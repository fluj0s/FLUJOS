promote regional security and increase interoperability of us forces and allied forces features of the clinton administration s conventional arms transfer policy are likely to form the basis for debates on c onventional arms transfer issues for the foreseeable future among the issues likely to be raised by the policy include developing consensus for conve ntional arms transfer rest raint determining whether or not there should be us governme nt financing support for american arms suppliers and the potential impact of the policy guidelines on sales and retransfers of upgraded military equipment president clintons conventional arms transfer policy represents public articulation of policy approach that has governed united states arms transfers at least since the reagan adminis tration if not earlier deci sions to sell or not to sell american weapons will be made on caseby case basis the guidelines set out in the policy are sufficiently broad so as to permit most us sa on the grounds of advancing the national interest the policy guidelines do not reflect more tightly drawn criteria for us arms transfers such as the strict code of conduct test that potential arms recipients would have to meet under proposal by some congressional arms control advocates the central multilateral arms control element of the policy is itself continuation of general united states policy in this area and as with other efforts of this type undertaken in the past it is ssentially dependent for its success on securing the agreement of other major weapons suppliers to forego activities that might otherwise be to their financial benefit although the administration has emphasized that its decisions on arms transfers will not be driven by commercial considerations but primarily by national security the clinton arms transfer policy holds th at supporting strong sustainable american defenseindustrial base is key national security concern rather than largely

directive 13 on conventional continuedconventional arms transferspresident clintons policy directive policy overview on february 17 1995 president clinton re leased details of his conventional arms transfer policy embodied in pr esidential decision directive 34 pdd341 this action took place after several months of internal debate nd discussion by the clinton administration this review of c onventional arms tran sfer policy was the first detailed examination of the subject since the end of the cold war since that event there has been much greater co mpetition between the security and economic rationales for foreign arms sales within the united states government than was the case previously at the height of the cold war security considerations were preeminent when decisions were made regarding possible arms sales economic benefits were largely sec ondary although there does not appear to be dramatic change in us conventional arms tr ansfer policy compared to previous administrations the clinton policy does seem to ascribe higher priority to domestic economic considerations including government willingness to help american arms sellers conclude foreign contracts that element of the clinton approach has been criticized by those who contend that us policy s hould place greater emphasis on constraining arms sales and more actively promote conventional arms control generally as currently outlined united states conventional arms transfer policy codifies an approach toward arms transfers that has guided the clinton administrations decisions over the last two years the unite d states continues to view transfers of conventional arms as leg itimate instrument of us foreign policy the stated criteria for such transfers are that they able the united states to help friends and allies deter aggressi on promote regional security and increase interoperab ility of us forces and allied forces2httpwikileaksorgwikicrs95639crs2 2continued arms transfer policy made public on may 19 1977the administration argues that deciding when specific arms transfer meets these standards will require examination of the dynamics of regional power balances and the potential for destabilizing changes within given regions specific criteria to govern these examinations are set out in detailed series of guidelines for us decisionmaking including criteria related to participation by us industries in upgrading of military equipment given what the administration believes are the multiple us interests involved in each ar ms transfer determin ation decisions will continue to be made on casebycase basis the united states itself under these gu idelines will unilate rally refrain from arms sales where it concludes the transfer of weapons runs counter to us human rights policy or would contribute to indiscriminate casualties transfers of anti personnel mines would fall into this latt er category likewi it will unilaterally refrain from sales where national interests are served by doing so such as by denying arms to pariah states restricting exports to preserve military advantage or lead in weapons technology or where regional stability can best be maintained by withholding us weapons the clinton administration notes that the intent of its conventional arms transfer policy is to promote restraint bot h by the united states and other suppliers in transfers of weapons systems that may be destabilizin g or dangerous to international peace at the sa time it is us policy to support transfers that meet legitimate defense requi rements of americas friends and allies in support of us national security and foreign policy interests the administration argues that the us record on arms transfers reflects these considerations it points out that the united states historical av erage for its arms sales in recen t years has been about 12 billion year and sales and deliveries have been primarily to allies and major coalition partners such as nat states and israel the administration further explicitly notes that once approval for an arms transfer is given the united states gove rnment will provide support for the proposed export in such cases the us will among other things direct american overseas mission personnel to s upport foreig n marketing efforts of american companies bidding on defense contracts and actively involve senior government officials in promoting arms sales of par ticular importance to the united states the united states will further support official fense department pa rticipation in inte rnational air and trade exhibitions when us law permits the secretary of defense determines such participation is in the national interest and congress is notified the administration notes that one major goal of its policy is to enhance the ability of the us defense industrial base to meet us defens requirements and ma intain longterm military technological superiority at wer costs in this context it is deemed appropriate to provide the kinds of assistance noted abovehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95639crs3 3see appendix for texts of formal administ ration statements released on february 17 1995 outlining the clinton conventional arms transfer policyprincipal goals of united stat conventional arms transfer policy3 the key goals of the us conventional ar ms transfer policy as set out by the clinton administration are to ensure that us military forces can continue to enjoy technological advantages over pot ential adversaries to promote regional stability in areas critical to us interests while preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their missile delivery systems to promote peaceful conflict resolution and arms control human rights democratization and other u s foreign policy objectives to help allies and friends deter or defend themselv against aggression while promoting interoperability with us forces when combined operations are required to enhance the ability of the us defens industrial base to meet us defense requirements and maintain longterm military technological superiority at lower costs arms control elements of the clinton policy the background statements outlining president clintons conventional arms transfer policy note that the centerpiece of united states efforts to promote multilateral restraint is its initiative to work with allies and friends to establish successor export control regime to cocom the coordinating committee for multilateral export controls american goals for this new regime are to establish effective international controls on arms sales and the transfer of sensitive technologiesparticularly to regions of tension and to st ates that pose threat to international peace and security the united st ates will continue to seek to increase transparency of conventional arms transfer s and related technolog ies it intends to take the lead in efforts to expand the register of conventi onal arms to include military holdings and procurement throug h national production the us will also encourage increased participation in the register the united states will further support regional initiatives to enhance tran sparency in conventional arms such as those being examined by asean states and the oas the clinton administration notes that it is the policy of the united states to continue to provide vigorous support fo r current arms control and confidence building efforts to constrain the dema nd for destabilizing w eapons and related technology the united states recognizes that such efforts currently under way in the middle east and in europe bolster stability they have the potential to assist otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95639crs4 suppliers to develop effective export c ontrol mechanisms to support responsible export policies the united states will also continue to provide defense conversion assistance to the states of the former s oviet union and central europe as way of countering growing pressures to export finally the clinton administration has placed new emphasis in its foreign and national security policies on regional security and stability and the language of its conventional arms transfer policy seems to emphasize this approach somewhat more than was done in the past in the pos tcold war era the clinton administration believes that arms transfers are likely to have greater effect on regional basis due to the prevailing military balances that exist within various regions thus while president clintons conventional arms tran sfer policy is cast in global terms its application is likely to be guided by regi onal factors and consider ations it is likely to focus most attention on how given arms sale by the united states or by others will affect regional military balanceand thus harm or hinder stability in the given region some implications of the clinton conventional arms transfer policy the clinton administrations conventional arms transfer policy establishes set of guidelines that are likely to fo rm the basis for deba tes on conventional arms transfers issues for the foreseeable future what follows is review of some of the more immediate implications of the clinton arms transfer policy developing consensus for conventional arms transfer restraint defense industries of major arms supplyi ng countries are under great pressures to export arms to compensate for much reduced domestic weapons contracts further some governments feel the need to sell weapons to any buyer both to maintain viable defense i ndustrial base and to secure needed foreign exchange within this environment it will be very difficult for the united states to r each consensus among major arms supplying governments for new conventional weapons control regimes whether regional or global the clinton administration is especially likely to encounter resistance to str ong new postcocom re gime which it states is central multilateral arms control element of its policy foreign governments are also not likel to curtail their conventional arms exports in major markets such as the middle east and persian gulf and in asia unless the united states does likewise since it appears unlikely that the united states will limit its sales of military equipment to its major allies and coalition partner states in these regions on the grounds of key national security interests the probable result is for continuation of past arms sales patterns by the united states and other arms suppliers this potential outcome has led to strong criticism of the clinton policy by those who had hoped it would contain features setting more difficult standards for arms sales by the united states to nations that had undemocratic gove rnments or that didhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95639crs5 4conventional arms transfers to the third world 19861993 crs report for congress 94612f by richard f grimmett july 29 1994 p52 5american defense industry has argued that several foreign governments provide subsidies and other financing support to their domestic defense contractors and thereby have an unfair advantage when competing for arms c ontracts to counter this situation american industry has proposed that some type of fund be established by the us government from which american industry could obtain financing for prospective foreign arms clients if such financing arrangement were established american industry could it is asserted be able to counter the competitive advantages foreig n industry currently enjoys and increase the prospects of american companies fo r winning additional arms contractsnot adequately protect human rights the greater emphasis in the clinton policy on providing government assistan ce to american arms sellers has also met with sharp criticism from american arms control advocat who note that relatively high overall american arms sales figures since the end of the cold war belie the argument that the us is not effectively competing with foreign weapons sellers during the last and the current congress for example senator mark hatfie ld and rep cynthia mckinney have introduced legislation in the senate and the house that would establish code of conduct for u s decisionmaking on conventional arms transfers this legislation among other things would notably increase the requirements foreign governme nts would have to meet in the areas of democratic practices and respect for human rights before they could be eligible to receive us weaponry government financing for arms exports the lack of financing from supplier stat to support arms purchases by would be buyers may curtail arms transfers in the near term even an oilrich nation such as saudi arabia has had to curta il its arms purchases in light of the fall of the price of oil and its need to meet other nonmilitary obligations neither the united states nor foreign arms suppliers have provided substantial amounts of financing for arms sales in recent years and this has made poten tial arms purchases by less wealthy nations more difficult if not impossible in many cases sales to subsaharan african countries for example fell from over 15 billion in the years 19861989 to about 2 billion in the years 199019934 indeed while the clinton conventional arms transfer policy stipulates that the administration will assist american defense industries in concluding an ar ms sale once it has determined that the sale is in us national interests the admin istration has not supported proposal strongly sought by industry to create fina ncing vehicle to help underw rite purchases of american military equipment by foreign buyers5 impact on sales and retransfers of upgraded equipment while one can argue that the criteria for decisionmaking on us arms exports set out as guidelines by the clinton administration are sufficiently broad and general so as to permit the justifica tion of almost any arms sale proposal one can also argue that the criteria to govern transfers of ite ms to upgrade existing weapons systems are rather restrictive for example the upgrade criteria in the clinton policy stipulatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95639crs6 that there will be presumption of denial of exports to upgrade programs that lead to capability beyond that which the unite d states would be willing to export directly in furtherance of this aim there is to be careful review of the total scope of proposed upgrade program to ensure that us licensing decisions will be consistent with it in addition us contributions to upgra programs initiate d by foreign prime contractors are to be evaluated against the same standard upgrades will be subject to the standard us government written end use and retransfer assurances by both the nation doing the integrating of upgrade items and the final end user of the system upgraded under these conditions the united states would be able to insist in weapons upgrade programs that the fore ign nation using united states defense articles to upgrade weapons system woul d have to allow the us the unilateral right to block any sale to third na tion of the upgraded weapon system and in addition the nation that was to be the ultimate purchaser of the upgraded weapon system would also have to agree that th us could block its retransfer of the finished weapon to another party the clin ton policy states that there will be strong and specific sanctions in place for those who violate these conditions since the upgrading of existing weapons is likely to be an important part of the international arms market in years to come this condition in the clinton policy could be source of significant us control over which nations will get advanced upgraded weapons at the same time it could be the sour ce of contract losses and significant disputes between the united states and foreign governments who want to use american weapons technology in upgrading various weapons but do not necessarily share the us view regardin g which countries should get certain types of advanced weaponry the united states in pursuing this approach to upgrades control may find some supplier nations unwilling to restrict their freedom to sell finished upgraded weapons and refuse to collaborate with the us on some weapons projects yet if the united states manufactures the best defense articles for given upgrade project foreign purchasers may have option but to agree to the terms set by the us under this policy in summary president clintons conven tional arms transfer policy represents public articulation of policy approach that has broadly governed united states arms transfers at least ce the reagan administration if not earlier decisions to sell or not to sell american weapons will be made on cas ebycase basis the policy guidelines set out in the policy are sufficiently broad so as to permit most us sales on the grounds of advancing the national inte rest the policy guidelines do not reflect more tightly drawn

house february 17 1995 statement by the press secretary conventional arms transfer policy the president has approved comprehensive policy to govern transfers of conventional arms this policy as detailed in the attached fact sheets serves our nations security in two important ways fi rst it supports transfers that meet the continuing security needs of the united states its friends and allies second it restrains arms transfers that may be destabilizing or threatening to regional peace and security this policy reflects an approach towards arms transfers that has guided the administrations decisions over the last two years specifically the united states continues to view transfers of conventional arms as legitimateinstrument of us foreign policy deserving us government support when they enable us to help friends and alliesdeter aggression promote regiona l security and increase interoperability of us forces and allied fo rces judging when specific transfer will meet that test requires examination of th dynamics of regional power balances and the potential for destabilizing changes in those regions the criteria guiding those casebycase examinations are set forth in the attached guidelines for us decisionmaking on conven tional arms transfers the centerpiece of our efforts to promot multilateral restrain t is our initiative to work with allies and friends to estab lish successor regime to cocom the new regime should establish effec tive international controls on arms sales and the transfer of sensitive technologies par ticularly to regions of tens ion and to states that pose threat to international peaceand secur ity while pursuing multilateral restraint through this and other mechanisms such as the conventional arms register and regional initiatives the united states will exercise unilateral restraint in cases where overriding national security or foreign policy interests require us to do sohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95639crs9 the white house february 17 1995 office of the press secretary fact sheet conventional arms transfer policy us conventional arms tran sfer policy promotes restraint both by the us and other suppliers in transfers of w eapons systems that may be destab ilizing or dangerous to international peace at the same time the policy s upports transfers that meet legitimate defense requirements of our friends and allie s in support of our national security and foreign policy interests our record reflects these considerations us arms sales remain close to our historical average approximately 12 b illion in governmentt ogovernment sales agreements in fy 1994 us arms deliverie s have also remained flat sales and deliveries sales have been primarily to allies and major coalition partners such as nato member states and israel us goals the policy issued by the president will serve the following goals 1 to ensure that our military forces can continue to enjoy technological advantages over pot ential adversaries 2 to help allies and friends deter or defend themselv against aggression while promoting interoperability with us forces when combined operations are required 3 to promote regional stability in areas critical to us interests while preventing the proliferation of wea pons of mass destruction nd their missile delivery systems 4 to promote peaceful conflict resolution and arms control human rights democratization and other u s foreign policy objectives 5 to enhance the ability of the us defens industrial base to meet us defense requirements and main tain longterm military technolog ical superiority at lower costs supporting arms control and arms transfer restraint critical element of us policy is to promote control restraint and transparency of arms transfers to that end the us will push to increase participation in the regist er of conventional arms we will also take the lead to expand the register to include military holdings and procurement through national production thereby providing more complete picture of change in nations military capabilities each year the us will also support regional in itiatives to enhance transparency in conventional arms such as those being ex amined by the oas and asean and will continue to adhere to th london and osce guidelines while promoting adherence to such principles by othershttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95639crs10 the united states will continue its effort s to establish successor export control regime to the coldwar era cocom our goals for this regime are to increase transparency of transfers of conventional arms and related technology to establish effective international controls and to promote restraint particularly to regions of tension and to states that are likely to pose threat to international peace and security the united states will also continue vigo rous support for current arms control and confidencebuilding efforts to constr ain the demand for destabilizing weapons and related technology the united states r ecognizes that efforts such as those under way in the middle east and europe bolster stability in variety of regions the united states will act unilaterally to restrain the flow of arms in cases where unilateral action is effective or necessitated by overriding national interests such restraint would be considered on casebycase basis in transfers involving pariah states or where the us has very substantial lead on weapon technology where the us restricts exports to preserve its military edge or regional stability where the us has fielde d countermeasures or where the transfer of weapons raises issues involving human rights or indiscriminate casualties such as anti personnel landmines finally the us will assist other supplie rs to develop effective export control mechanisms to support responsible export policies the united states will also continue to provide defense conversion assistance to the st ates of the former soviet union and central europe as way of countering growing pressures to export supporting responsible us transfers once an approval for transfer is ma the us government will provide support for the proposed us export in t hose cases the united states will take such steps as tasking our overseas mission pers onnel to support overseas marketing efforts of american companies bidding on defens contracts actively involving senior government officials in promoting sales of particular importance to the united states and supporting official departme nt of defense participati on in international air and trade exhibitions when the secretary of defense in accordance with existing law determines such participation to be in the national interest and notifies congress decisionmaking on us arms exports criteria and process given the complexities of arms transfer decisions and the multiple us interests involved in each arms transfer decision deci sions will continue to be made on case bycase basis these casebycase reviews will be guided by set of criteria that draw the appropriate balan ce between legitimate arms sa to support the national security of our friends and allies and the need for multilateral restraint against the transfer of arms

appropriateness of the tran sfer in responding to leg itimate us and recipient security needs consistency with us regional stability interests especially when considering transfers involving power projection capability or introduction of system which may foster increased tension or contribute to an arms race the degree to which the transfer suppor ts us strategic and foreign policy interests

afforded sensitive technology and potential for unauthorized thirdparty transfer as well as incountry diversion to unauthorized uses the risk of revealing system vulnerabilities and adversely impacting us operational capabilities in the event of compromise the risk of adverse economic political or social impact within the recipient nation and the degree to which security needs can be

must be welldefi ned to be considered for approval upgrades should be consistent with ge neral conventional arms transfer criteria outlined above there will be presumption of denial of exports to upgrade programs that lead to capability beyondthat which the us would be willing to export directly careful review of the to tal scope of proposed upgrade programs is necessary to ensure that us licensing decisions are consistent with us policy on transfers of equivalent new systems us contributions to upgrade programs initiated by foreign prime contractors should be evaluated agai nst the same standard protection of us technologies must be ensured because of the inherent risk of technology transfer in the integrati on efforts that typically accompany an upgrade project upgrades will be subject to standard usg written end use and retransfer assurances by both the integrator and fi nal end user with strong and specific sanctions in place for those who violate these conditions benchmarks should be established for upg rades of specific types of systems to provide policy baselineagainst which 1 individual arms transfer proposals can be assessed and 2 proposed departures from
