assigned to priority review it takes an average of 15 years from the moment manufacturer first approaches the food and drug administration fda with an idea for new drug to its final approval for marketing1 steps in the development and approval of drug or biologic eg vaccine involve actions by both the manufacturer and fda first manufacturer sometimes referred to as the sponsor submits to fda an investigational new drug ind application for permission to conduct clinical studies in humans second the manufacturer completes phase i ii and iii clinical trials to establish that product is safe and effective for specific purpose and population third the manufacturer submits to fda new drug application or biologics licensing application noted as ndabla throughout this report for permission to market the product fourth fda reviews the ndabla for evidence of safety and effectiveness process that sometimes includes requests to the sponsor for additional information the sponsors response and further fda review finally fda decides whether to approve the application 1 pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma at httpwwwphrmaorg crs2 for drugs and biologics that address unmet needs or serious diseases or conditions fda regularly uses three formal mechanisms to expedite the development and review process fast track product development priority review and accelerated approval2 this report briefly describes in text and in table 1 those mechanisms including their intended effects and statutory and regulatory bases and examines whether fast track accomplishes two goals making approval more likely and shortening approval time mechanisms to expedite the development and review process accelerated approval for the treatment of serious or lifethreatening illness fda regulations promulgated in 1992 allow accelerated approval of drug or biologic product that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments the rule covers two situations the first allows approval to be based on clinical trials that rather than using standard outcome measures such as survival or disease progression use surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit the second situation addresses drugs whose use could be deemed safe and effective only under set restrictions that could include limited prescribing or dispensing fda usually requires postmarketing studies of products approved this way3 accelerated approval involves httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22814 different concerns than do the other programs designed to speed the normal process for important new products and therefore this paper will not discuss it further fasttrack mechanism the food and drug administration modernization act of 1997 fdama pl 105115 directed the secretary to create mechanism whereby fda could designate as fast track certain products that met two criteria first the product must concern serious or lifethreatening condition second it has to have the potential to address an unmet medical need once fda grants fast track designation it encourages the manufacturer to meet with the agency to discuss development plans and strategies before the formal submission of an ndabla the early interaction can help clarify elements of clinical study design and presentation whose absence at ndabla submission could delay approval decisions however fda makes similar interactions available to any sponsor who seeks fda consultation throughout the stages of drug development unique option within fast track is the opportunity to submit sections of an ndabla to fda as they are ready rather than the standard requirement to submit complete application at one time4 2 other options fit very limited situations and support shorter times from idea to approved public use the animal efficacy rule 21 cfr 314 subpart i and 21 cfr 601 subpart h allows submission of data from animal studies of effectiveness as evidence to support applications of certain new products when adequate and wellcontrolled clinical studies in humans cannot be ethically conducted and field efficacy studies are not feasible the project bioshield act of 2004 allows the hhs secretary to authorize the emergencyuse of products that do not yet have fda approval in certain circumstances 21 usc 360bbb3 also see crs report rs21507 project bioshield purposes and authorities by frank gottron 3 regulations for the accelerated approval of new drugs for serious or lifethreatening illnesses are at 21 cfr 314 subpart h and for biological products at 21 cfr 601 subpart 4 fdama created section 506 fast track products in the federal food drug and cosmetic act see fda guidance for industry fast track drug development programs designation development and application review at httpwwwfdagovcbergdlnsfsttrkpdf crs3 priority review unlike fast track or accelerated approval the priority review process begins only when manufacturer officially submits an ndabla priority review therefore does not alter the timing or content of steps taken in drugs development or testing for safety and effectiveness for products believed to address unmet needs however it shortens the average amount of time from completed application until approval decision from 10 months to 6 months although priority review is not explicitly required by law fda has established it in practice and various statutes such as the prescription drug user fee act pdufa refer to and sometimes require it5 table 1 comparison of mechanisms to hasten product availability accelerated review priority review fast

rates are products that receive fast track designation more likely to have their ndabla approved by fda than products that receive such designation the answer is we dont know because while fda provides statistics on the products it designates as fast track it does not make public information on the ndablas it receives unless and until the product is approvedlicensed 5 fda center for drug

the fda website manufacturers have requested fast track designation for 569 drugs and 195 biological products since the fast track program was set into law fda granted the designation to 745 of those drug requests and 636 of those biologics requests of products with fast track designation fda eventually approved 106 of the drugs and licensed 177 of the biologics6 what that means is obscured by what we do not know for what percentage of products with fast track designation do sponsors submit ndablas how many ndablas submitted each year are for fast track products with only the numerator approved products one cannot calculate the percentage of ndabla submissions that are approved among fast track products fda receives approximately 100130 applications year and has stated that close to 80 percent of all filed applications will eventually be approved7 the 106 and 177 figures for fast track are not comparable statistic because they include the apparently httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22814 large but unquantified number of product development attempts that manufacturers discontinue for safety problems lack of effectiveness business decisions competing projects useful analysis would account for the percentage of fast track and nonfast track products of which fda is aware eg that have inds that result in submitted ndablas length of decision times for approval how long it takes from the time sponsor applies for marketing permission to the moment fda makes its decision varies greatly the length matters to the sponsor and its stockholders to potential consumers and healthcare providers and to fda two factors contribute to longer review times review staff constraints at fda and the quality and completeness of applications when they are first submitted pdufa and its three reauthorizations have addressed the staffing issue by authorizing industry user fees to support fda reviewers8 fdas web pages on the use of its fast track and priority review programs provide the review times for successful applications table 2 compares the review times by year and type of review procedure for all 787 approved ndablas applications that were submitted from fy1998 through fy2006 these applications received either standard review or priority review and the review times for these two procedures are summarized in the first two pairs of data columns in the table the third pair of columns summarizes review times for approved ndabla applications for products that received fast track designation as discussed below 6 fda cder fast track products approved since 1998 through 33107

captured in the standard review data the final pair of columns provide data on priority review times for ndas of new molecular entities nmes and new blas these applications represent subset of all those subject to priority review and are the group of products most similar to fast track products each row of table 2 corresponds to approved applications submitted during specific year the total approval time includes the time fda spends to review an application plus the time the sponsor takes to respond to questions if necessary plus the time fda spends on any additional review the table provides the median approval time for each submission year group which is the value at the midpoint of times in group fda uses the median in its reports stating it provides truer picture of our performance than average time which can be unduly influenced by few very long or short times9 table 2 number and total approval time in months of approved ndas and blas by fiscal year of submission

of supplemental ndablas c priority nmes and new blas are included also in the all priority column d each annual pdufa performance report adjusts the number and duration of reviews completed for

version at httpwwwfdagovcder reportscderdatabriefing19962006accessiblehtm crs6 fast track submissions in theory differ from routine ndabla submissions because they address unmet needs in the treatment of lifethreatening or serious conditions similar criteria apply to drugs that fda gives priority review status in fact 80 of fast track nda approvals were also given priority review as were all of the approved fast track blas again fda makes public detailed data only regarding the products that it approveslicenses using the data in table 2 to determine the impact fast track designation has on approval time is complicated by limitations in the data available these include the following inadequate data available fda tables aggregate applications by year and present only the median approval time value for each year this precludes using the individual application times in subsequent calculations missing data data available for analysis come from approved applications inclusion of numbers of applications and total time to review decision approval or not would allow examination of additional aspects of the fast track program that may provide advantages that do not affect total approval time unavailable documentation of decisions without detailed documentation of the many decisions embedded in the fda summary tables accuracy or consistency in assignment to year of submission rather than year of approval cannot be assessed if an httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22814 application is assigned to one year in the fast track column and to another in the all priority column for example relying on the annual median approval times could distort the comparisons overlapping categories the all priority and all standard groups sum to the total number of approved applications in each submission year the other categories however overlap by definition the priority nmes and new blas category is subset of the all priority ndas and blas for the fast track ndas at least 87 are counted in the priority nda group and at least 68 are also counted in the priority nme group fda lists some fast track nme applications as assigned to standard review as expected based on program goals times are shorter for priority review than for standard review for seven of the nine years median fast track times were shorter than priority reviews suggesting that fast track may have reduced timetomarket beyond the shortening of review time afforded by priority review more detailed analysis of individual application data might indicate how group differences may be due to obvious exceptions different procedures or application completeness or quality or unknown factors or chance for example how does the wide range of approval times from 24 to 341 months for the eight fast track product ndablas submitted in 2001 affect group averages finally review time from submission to approval is only one measure of fast track effect if fast track designation enables sponsor to submit completed ndabla sooner than it would otherwise that advantage would not be evident in this comparison of review times that begins with submission
