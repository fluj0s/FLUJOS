rarely engage in c ontroversy or debate on federal disaster assistance funding measures many constituents members of congress and analysts generally agree that the federal government has an important role in the immediate response to significant catastrophe s as well as in longterm recovery efforts some debate may occur howev er on the types of ac tivities to be funded through this request the

remainder of this report contains information on some of th issues raised in the debate over the fy2004 and fy2005 disaster assistance suppl emental requests considered and acted upon by congress unanticipated events and apportionment of spending one issue concerns the anticipation of catastrophes notably hurricanes and the rate at which funds are depleted from the drf hurricanes charley nd frances struck during the congressional recess by midaugust the dr f which is used for all disaster and emergency declarations issued by the pres ident contained insufficient funds to meet even the immediate response needs11 accordingly the schedule dhs had established for obligating funds pursuant to statutory apporti onment requirements had to be revised12 in letter to the chairman of the house appropriations committee an omb official reported that in light of the immediate needs it will be necessary to obligate funds at rate that will exhaust amounts currently appropriated to fund immediat disaster response effort s involving the safety of human life and the protection of property13 expediting the obligation rate omb noted required expeditious passage of suppl emental appropriations because of the unanticipated magnitude of the destructi on caused and anticipated to be caused by this seasons hurricanes the notification omb gave to congress on september 3 makes reference to an exception to the statutory apportionment requirements14 in essence dhs cannot obligate funds from the drf in excess of the amount appropriated and must obligatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32581crs12 15 contract or purchase on behalf of the united states shall be made unless the same is authorized by law or is under an appropria tion adequate to its fu

departments and agencies may however expedite the rate of obligation for reasons specified in the statute due to the immediate needs that resulted from the two hurricanes omb contended that the exception was appropr iately invoked as noted in the omb notice this change in the obligation ra apportionment nece ssitated supplemental appropriations to provi funds for the response to th hurricanes and other disasters while congress theoretically could have refused to appropr iate the requested supplemental funds it is not unreasonable to have expected positive action some may argue however that congressional power over the purse is compromised by having dhs and omb decide that supplem ental appropriations are necessary that decision arguably rests with congress while the situation that led to actment of pl 108303 was resolved expeditiously one may conceive that future catastrophic disasters including terrorist attacks more devastating than those of september 11 2001 could occur in the future while congress is in recess or in adjour nment the revision of the apportionment rate from the drf and the resulting pre ss to enact supplemental appropriations might be alleviated in the future if congress were to address the issue options for congressional action include congress could extend to the secretary of dhs the authority currently held by the secretary of defense and the secretary of transportation for the coast guard to obligate funds from the drf on deficiency basis under specified ci rcumstances15 as the coast guard has been transferred from th department of transportation to dhs it may be argued that the secretary of dhs has this authority when the coast guard operates as service to the navy in light of advances made in hu rricane prediction and projections of storm intensity it may be argued that hurricanes may be foreseen and anticipated at least to gree adequate enough for congress to consider supplemental ppropriations in late sp ring or early summer of each year prior to the august district work period16 congress could appropriate reserve funds that would be released to drf for obligation if specified cond itions exist for example over 2 billion appropriated for the drf in fy1998 was only made available until the director of the federal emergency managementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32581crs13 17 pl 10518 111

saster assistance18 background the late summer 2004 hurricanes damaged or destroyed significant portions of floridas agricultu ral production particul arly citrus trees vegetables and nursery products various other parts of th nation also have suffered farm production losses over the past year caused by prolonged drought floods freezes and other weatherrelated disasters generally farm production losses are not eligible for fema assistance but instead are covered under an ssortment of ongoing programs administered by the us department of agriculture usda these include disaster loans the federal crop insurance program and the noninsured crop disaster assistance program19 when major disasters affect widesp read portions of the nation congress traditionally has supplemented these ongoi ng usda programs with emergency crop loss payments livestock feed assistance and other adhoc programs between fiscal years 1988 and 2003 congress approved near ly 17 billion in emergency crop loss payments and approximately 26 billion in livestock and other emergency farm disaster assistance20 to assist farmers with more recen t production losses congressional and administrative action has taken place on two fronts 1 usda announced new florida hurricane disaster assistance program which is expected to make an estimated 500 million in direct di saster payments to florid citrus vegetable and nursery growers and 2 congre ss approved 35 billion supplemental appropriation for agriculture disaster ssistance in the fy2005 military construction appropriation act pl 108324 hr 4837 it includes 6585 million for damages caused by hurricanes and other storms in 2004 and an estimated 29 billion in general crop and livestock disaster assistan ce for eligible producers nationwide the 29 billion was offset by comparable reduction in funding for mandatory agriculture conservation pr ogram in future years usdas florida hurricane disaster assistance program t h administration has begun implementing new agricultural disaster payment program designed to assist any florida count that was declared disaster area as result of either hurricane charley frances or jeanne the new florida hurricanehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32581crs14 21 for more information on this program see httpdisasterfsausdagovfl_hurricanehtm visited oct 22 2004 22 section 32 is permanent appropriation that since

meats poultry fruits vegetables and fish which are diverted mainly to school lunch and other domestic food programsdisaster assistance program did not require new appropriation21 instead the program uses existing usda section 3222 funds estimated by usda at more than 500 million to provide direct disaster payments to produ cers of citrus vegetables and nursery crops based on estimated losses signup began october 5 for citrus assistance and october 20 for vegetable and nursery crops recipients are subject to an 80000 payment limit and must have adjusted gross income under 25 million which is waived if more than 75 of in come is derived from farming or forestry general crop and livestock disaster assistance of the estimated 35 billion in agricultural disaster ssistance provided in the fy2005 military construction appropr iations act pl 108324 approximately 29 billion is for additional crop disaster paym ents livestock feed assistance and tree replanting assistance much of this disaster assistan ce is expected to benefit regions that have experienced multiple years of drought and other areas that were affected by late summer frost and other disasters fiscal conservatives had insisted that th cost of any agricultural assistance for disasters other than the 2004 hurricanes be offset with reductions in other usda programs supporters of fa rm and conservation programs were opposed to reducing spending for any farm bill programs to pay for disaster assistance and contended that all natural disasters shoul d be treated equally c ongress did adopt 29 billion reduction in spending authority for the c onservation security program mandatory usda program authorized by the 2002 farm b ill pl 107171 however the offset will not take effect until fy2008 after lawmakers write new farm bill within couple of days after final c ongressional action on p l 108324 the senate adopted resolution sres 465 instru cting conferees on the fy2005 agriculture appropriations bill hr 4766

livestock assistance program lap which would provide direct payments to eligible livestock producers who suffered grazing losses due to natural disaster the bill requires the program to be modeled after the lap implemented in 2000 under this proposed program livestock producer would be eligible fo r lap benefits when natural disaster caused the producer in an approved county to suffer 40 or greater loss of grazing for three or more consecutive months during either 2003 or 2004 the livestock producer would be eligible for paymen ts for either year but not both finally necessary funds are

natu ral disasters not just terrorist attacks devastate communities and ve shortterm if not l ongterm adverse economic impacts these hurricanes c ontinue decadeslong trend that has required billions of dollars in federal expenditures th immediate shortfall in the drf in early september 2004 was resolved with the passage of hr 5005 pl 108303 with three other supplemental requests the adminis tration indicated to congress that the needs of stricken communities and victims required more aid during the debate on the supplemental request members of congre ss have considered issues such as the funding of disasters and the american red cross although farm disaster assistance has been enacted to cover farm production losses in virtually every crop year be tween 1988 and 2004 some policymakers are concerned that the continued availability of adhoc disaster payments might discourage producers from purchasing crop insurance policy several billion dollars in additional premium subsidy were pumped into the federal crop insurance program beginning in 2000 to enhance farm er participation and preclude the need for adhoc disaster assistance participation in the crop insurance program has increased significantly since 2000 however when widespread disasters strike the political pressure continues to further compensate farmers for disaster losses
