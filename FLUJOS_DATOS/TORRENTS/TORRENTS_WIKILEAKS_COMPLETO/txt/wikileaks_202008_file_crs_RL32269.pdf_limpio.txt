public health and scientific issues summary on december 23 2003 the us secretary of agriculture announced that cow in washington state had tested positive fo r bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease representing the fi rst domestic case the secretary announced expanded protections against bse on december 30 2003 on january 26 2004 the us secretary of health and human serv ices announced additional safety measures for products regulated by the us food and drug administration fda to protect public health both have st ressed that the human health impact of finding one bse positive cow is believed to be minimal bse is member of group of dis eases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies tses although the pre dominant theory is that tses are caused by prions or proteinaceous infectious partic novel disease mechanism first described in the 1980s some scientists believe virus ma eventually be identified as the infectious agent while some tses such as scrapie in sheep have been known for over 200 years others including bse appear to have emerged quite recently some tses seem to affect only one species and others like bse appear to have jumped the species barrier to inf ect more than one species this event has transformed prion diseases from rare and esoteric area of research to matter of significant public health concern bse is believed to have been transmitted to people who ate contaminated beef leading to the identification in 1996 of new human disease variant creutzfeldjakob di sease vcjd in the united kingdom as attention has focused on the finding of bse in the united states government control efforts have been sc rutinized some have argued that prevention programs begun in 1988 and strengthened at points si nce then are robust and that the finding of bsepositive cow represents an isolated case and negligible health risk to humans others believe that shortfalls in government prevention efforts are serious and that bse may be entrenched in the united states albeit at low levels the spectrum of opinions about the public hea lth risk from bse underscores the myriad uncertainties surrounding prion diseases and especially their modes of transmission and detection this report examines known and purporte d human health risks from bse and related diseases the status of efforts to detect and prevent these diseases in

scientific issues introduction mad cow disease bovine s pongiform encephalopathy or bse is an incurable degenerative neurologic disease of cattle first detected in the united kingdom uk in 1986 it wa s later linked to new fo rm of rare fatal human illness creutzfeldjakob disease cjd via consumption of beef from affected animals when compared with the existing form of cjd the new form called variant cjd vcjd affects younger victims nd displays distinct microscopic pattern of brain lesions at autopsy the suspected causal link between bse and vcjd announced by the british governme nt in march 1996 had sweeping effects on global cattle markets and on cattle production and slaugh tering practices in the united kingdom as well as other countries seeking to prevent bse the findings of bse in canadian beef cow in may 2003 and dairy cow in washington state in december 2003 have prompted expanded measures to guard against bse and reassessment of existing public health safe guards by federal agencies and other interested parties what are transmissible spongiform encephalopathies tses in livestock and other animals bse belongs to group of diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies tse s on microscopic examination the diseased br ain is permeated with holes like sponge hence the name spongiform tses are considered to be transmissible because feeding injecting or transplanting tissues containing the agent will transmit the disease tses are not new and are known to affect veral other species besides cattle scrapie which affects sheep has been known for over 200 years chronic wasting disease cwd which affects deer and elk has exis ted in colorado and wyoming for 40 to 50 years and has since been found in 11 ot her states and two provinces in canada tses also affect mink num ber of domestic and zoo cats and other ruminants such as goats and antelope there is long incubation period two to eight years in cattle during which signs are apparent length of the incubation period depends on the species affected the dose nd the mode of infection tses are thought to be caused by pro teinaceous infectious particles or prions prion protein is found in many body cells especially on the surface of nerve cells in the brain its normal function is poorly understood current theory is that tses result when prion protein changes into an abnormal shape and aggregates into long fibrils or clumps of fibrils called pla ques the abnormal prion can induce normalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32269crs2 1 monthly cjd statistics u k department of healt h at httpwwwdohgovuk

this remarkable ability allows the prion to replicate and behave as an infectious agen t the aberrant prion is not broken down and eliminated by the body leaving deposits that accumulate within the brain scientists speculate that the loss of normal brain cell prions or the toxicity of the aggregated abnormal prions causes nerve ce ll death which eventually leads to the characteristic holes that are trademark of the disease initially it was thought that slow virus caused tses when the pri on theory was first proposed in 1982 it was viewed with considerable skepticism further studies have supported the prion theory which is now predominant debate continues however and the heart of the controversy is the role of the prion protei n in causing tses is it the transmissible agent or just pawn in viralmediated disease human tse diseases in humans four related spongiform encephalopathies have been identified these diseases appear similar to each other on microscopic examination of the brain but may differ in the way they are acquired their clinical symptoms such as dementia or insomnia or their pattern of distribution throughout the world kuru is found only in one tribe in papua new guinea affected individuals contract the disease either through ritual cannibalism or preparation of the dead for burial fatal familial insomnia ffi and gerstmannstrausslerscheinker disease gss are inherited familial with cases occurring in families symptoms appear in midlife the fourth disease creutzfeldtjakob disease cjd usually strikes people over 65 it occurs worldwide at an timated annual ra of one case per million population since us cjd surveillance was begun in 1997 732 cases have been identified worldwide about 1015 of cj d cases are inherited but for most cases the cause is unknown less than 1 of cjd cases are iatrogenic they occurred as the result of various medical treatments or procedures which inadvertently transferred the cjd agent eg during transplantation of nervous system tissue the incubation period ranges from 15 months to more th an 30 years for iatrogenic cjd cases although they do not have an inherited mutation individuals who have developed iatrogenic cjd have genetic feature which may make them more susceptible to developing the disease following expos ure studies of blood donors in three european countries indicate th at this feature is present in 49 of donors in finland 42 in britain and 34 in ireland the first cases of vcjd were announced in march 1996 in the united kingdom according to the uk department of healt h as of february 2 2004 the total number of definite or probable cases of vcjd in the uk is 146 of which seven are still alive1 in addition six cases of vcjd have been reported in france and one each in canada ireland italy and the united states the us case lived in the united kingdom in the 1980s and is thought to ve acquired the disease there2 all vcjd cases have the same genetic feature that is associat ed with iatrogenic cjd and most sporadic cjd cases sporadic cjd is discussed fu rther below it is unknown if those whohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32269crs3 3 nonetheless uncertainty bout the

development of cjd or if there might merely be longer inc ubation period prior to the development of disease how are tses acquired several modes of tse tran smission have been desc ribed though often only one or two of the modes has been documente d for any given tse so far modes described are vertical maternal to child transmission inheritance spontaneous mutation iatrog enic transmission and oral ingestion of the tse agent modes of transmission that have not been documente d for given tse often cannot be ruled out this uncertainty and many others lead to questions about risk and difficulty in crafting tse preventive measures vertical transmission has been demonstrated for scrapie in sheep but not for bse in cattle3 inherited forms of human tse cjd gss ffi are caused by inherited gene muta tion often in the prion gene itself when the cause of tse is unknown it is called sporadic or sometimes spontaneous most cjd cases are sporadic scientists speculate that some cases of sporadic cjd may be caused by noni nherited mutations or by unidentified iatrogenic routes transmission of the agent may occur during procedures performed on the nervous system including the eyes especially when tissue transplantation is involved procedures linked with later development of cjd include neurosurgery corneal transplant and injection of growth hormone derived from the pituitary gland in the brain of human cadavers abnormal prions are not affect ed by most chemical disinfectants and the few chemicals that are effective may be too harsh for delicate surgical instruments prions are also very heatresistant and are not destroyed by autoclaving high temperature and pressure the standard procedure for sterilizing instruments to prevent transmission of bacterial viral and fungal agents bse is believed to be transmitted orally to cattle through feed containing the abnormal prion animal feed is thought to have become contaminated when infected animals were rendered into protei n supplement that is often added to feed this practice has been banned in countries affected by bse4 the oral dose can be very small in cattle ingestion of 10 milligrams of infectious brain tissue less than 11000th of an ounce can cause bse the genesis of early cases whether the cattle feed contained prions from sheep affected by scrapie or prion derived directly from cattle or another explanation remains matter of speculationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32269crs4 5 the species barrier is concept in epidemiology derived from the finding that many infectious diseases confine themselves to si ngle or related species and infect unrelated species rarely or with difficulty if at all 6 for further information on food safety and inspection service amr standards and testing see the

the bse agent is believed to be transmitted to humans via the oral route as well causing vcjd through consumption of beef contaminated with abnormal prions from the brains and spinal cords of affected cattle nervous system ssue may be present in beef products for example usda survey of meat from advanced meat recovery amr systems in 2003 showed that 35 of it c ontained nervous system tissue6 amr uses high pressure to strip edible materials from bone yielding meat paste used in products such as hot dogs and sausages since the finding of bse in the united states usda announced measures to keep nervous tissu out of amr products but it is still permissible to market the brains of h ealthy young cattle for human consumption in this country because the bse agent has not been f ound in beef muscle meat from affected cattle is not felt to pose threat howev er prions have been found in small amounts in the human muscle tissue of cjd patients and in the muscle tissue of experimental mice following the announcement of th us cow with bse usda launched voluntary recall class ii low health risk of meat from the animal and those slaughtered with it on december 9 2003 and all downstream meat processed in the same lots about 10410 pounds of raw beef according to usda there was an ex tremely low likelihood that the beef contained the bse agent the tissues of highest infectivity brain spinal cord and distal ileum all were removed from the infected cow at slaughter therefore the meat produced were cuts that would not be expected to be infected or have an adverse public health impact the recall is being conducted out of an abundance of caution7 news reports indicate that some of the meat was purchased and consumed the centers for disease control and prev ention cdc comments though that the risk for acquiring vcjd from consumpti on of bsecontaminated product is low presumably because of species barrie r that provides substantial but incomplete protection against development of vcjd in the uk where an estimated one million or more cattle probably were infected with bse cases of vcjd continue to be reported however the number of cases of vcjd remains small8 the european commission food safety scientific steering committee reached similar conclusion in its review of the safety of beef muscle meats sayinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32269crs5 9 european commission health

tempest mad cow fears may keep labs busy the use of new rapid screening kits also could mean income for uc angeles times jan 12 2004 p b1given the limited conditions of the research reported on and the consistent negative results of infectivity experiment s with regard to the presence of tse infectivity in muscles of cattle and sheep there is currently reason to revise our opinions with regard to the safety of bovine and sheep muscles also should infectivity be present at very low levels below current detection limits the risk of exposure to bse infectivity is reduced to negligible levels by risk reduction measures in place and by the fact that exposure would be by the relatively inefficient oral route9 however dr stanley prusiner the scie ntist who won the nobel prize for his pioneering work on the prion theory of ts and whose subsequent work identified prions in the muscle of experimental mice disagrees with the idea that muscle meats are safe prusiner who now heads comp any he founded to deve lop new rapid tests for tses advocates testing of all ca ttle slaughtered for food in the us10 testing for cjd and other tses substantial hurdle in the management of bse and human prion diseases is the lack of noninvasive test met hods prions are not directly visible in microscope do not contain dna nor do they cause immune or inflammatory reactions making typical test methods ineffec tive tests for accumulated prions in brain and spinal cord tissues serve as the gold standard and are often the only reliable measures of infection definitive diagnosis of cjd in humans requires the study of brain tissue which can be obtained by biopsy in living patie nts though this is considered highly invasive recently scientists have found that vcjd differs from other forms of cjd in that abnormal prions accu mulate in lymphoid tissues such as the tonsils and appendix tonsil biopsy has been used in the united kingdom as one method of distinguishing vcjd from other neurologic disorders in living patients tses that involve lymphoid tissue may offer premortem testing options in animals as well in sheep testing of eyelid swabs has been us ed to diagnose scrapie in cattle though the only bseaffected lymphoid tissue is the lower small intestine so as practical matter there is test that can be used in live cattle tests for bse in cattle are performed postmortem on brain tissue the washington state cow was tested by immunohistochemistry ihc in which abnormal prions in slices of brain tissue bi nd to special stain to make them apparent on microscopic examination

magnitude less sensitive than is optimal and has recommended that research efforts prioritize the development of tests with higher sensitivity tests that can be performed using blood or other noni nvasive samples and tests that can use noninvasive brain imaging techniques to detect human prion diseases13 prevention of cjd in healthcare settings as noted earlier iatrogenic transmission of tses is the inadvertent transfer of infective material during medical procedures such as tissue transplantation of corneas or dura mater the protective covering on the br ain or spinal cord injections of growth hormone derived from cadav ers or transmission on neurosurgical equipment study published in 2000 stated that 267 cases of iatrogenic cjd have been reported worldwide of this total seven were linked to th use of contaminated equipment five from neurosurgical instru ments and two from an invasive type of electroencephalogram eeg electrode14 removing prion infectivity from instruments and equipment has posed par ticular challenge since prions unlike viruses and other microbes ar resistant to heat irradi ation gas sterilizing agents and most disinfectants all neurosurgical

announced the possible first case of vcjd acquired from blood tran sfusion the donor gave blood in march 1996 and developed vcjd in 1999 and died the recipient was transfused shortly after the donation and died of vcjd in the fall of 2003 while it cannot be proven that the recipient acquired vcjd from blood rather than from eating beef the possibility that this case is transfusionre lated cannot be ruled out both bse and scrapie have been experime ntally transmitted to sheep through blood transfusion demonstrating that the bse agent can be present in blood hence the possibility of tse transmission through bl ood was addressed in the ited kingdom prior to the announcement of the apparent first case faced with the largest number of vcjd cases the united kingdom has since the 1990s applied co stly process called leukoreduction to all donated blood units to rem ove white blood cells where prions are thought to reside the united kingdom also imports all its plasma and plasma

valuable insights such as the role of genetics in susceptibility and disease progression incubation periods in mice wh ile still lengthy at onetwo years are much shorter than incubation periods in na

p 3the slow pace of prion research prion research is hampered by the nature of the disease and the protecti ons required for its study to protect researchers prions must be handled in laboratories with bios afety level 2 or 3 protections depending on sp ecific prions and studies36 all prion diseases are characterized by long incubation periods experimental transmission studies take years to yield results seventyfive per cent of nih funds awarded for tse research go to only two laboratories the size of the prion research community is relatively small poorly understood tse disease process scientists do not have complete understanding of whic h tissues are affected and therefore are infectious at each point of the tse disease process also unclear are the mechanisms by which the agent enters the body how it disseminates within the body and the routes used to reach the brain and cause the cellular damage that leads to clinical symptoms depending on the tse it is unclear how the agent spreads from host to host and what features of the host determine susceptibility or resistance origin of sporadic cjd experimental findings in mice raise concern about the spectrum of human disease that could result from exposure to bse researchers used mice genetically engineered with th human version of prion instead of the mouse version to simulate human disease when the mice were infected with the bse agent some developed signs of vcjd and others devel oped signs consistent with sporadic cjd the scientists believe it is possible that some human patients with sporadic cjd may have disease arising from bse exposure this finding highlights the difficulties in extrapolating the results of rodent studies to natural conditions and the need for rigorous surveillance and characterization of human prion diseases spread of cwd in the united states the lack of understanding of cwd transmission and whether it can cause disease in humans or cattle is of concern the institute of medicine report advancing prion science concluded that while there is evidence that cwd is transmissible to humans the theoretical risk of infection led the committee to advise people to avoid exposure to cwdcontaminated meat and meat products the wide range of pr actices for processing venison the paucity of regulation or oversight in this area and the many opportunities for spreading the cwd agent influenced the committees conclusion in this regard37 persistence of bse in the united kingdom in august 1996 the united kingdom tightened ban on the recycling of livestock into feed used for farm animals because cases of bse continued to occur despite an initial ban instituted in mid1988 total of 77 cases of bse in animals born after the 1996 ban have beenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32269crs16 reported 49 cases were re ported in 2003 although cont aminated feed imported prior to 2001 restriction is suspected to be the cause it remains to be seen whether cases will soon decline as predicted by th is theory or whether other explanations should be considered stability of tse disease agent prions are one of the most stable organic substances known even when prion infec tious tissue is incinerated at 600 degrees centigrade there is still some infectious activity remaining in the ash sample many physical chemical and irradi ation methods have been tr ied in order to inactivate prions with very little success some co mbinations reduce the amount of infectivity without totally elimina ting prions on reliable and cons istent basis glass

composed of these materials asymptomatic carriers experiments in mice nd hamsters demonstrated silent carrier state for bse tissues from experimentallyinfected animals that never became ill

are under discussion low autopsy rate according to estimates in the iom report advancing prion science at least half of human victims of tses in the united states do not receive autopsies and therefore are not identified as having tses this is major obstacle to reaching an understanding of the level of human tse disease in this country risk communication talking about rare but serious risks risk communication has risen in impor tance since the terror attacks of 2001 it is one of the required activities for stat health departments receiving federal funds for bioterrorism preparedness it should be noted that there is evidence that the finding of bse resulted from an intentiona l act risk communication is considered essential for success in controlling infectious diseases such as sars or influenza when officials may ask the public to cooperate with disease screening at airports home isolation vaccination programs or ot her control measures the finding of bse

changes in consumer behavior primer on risk communication from th canadian food inspection agency written prior to the finding of bse in canada opines about communicating risk in the face of uncertainty the public has tired of false reassurances of safety and of decisions presented as though they are relatively conclusive when fundamental uncertainties still remain one expert states that
