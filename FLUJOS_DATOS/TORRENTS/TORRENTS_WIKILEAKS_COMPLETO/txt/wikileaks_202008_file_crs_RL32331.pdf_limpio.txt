economic impact of cyberattacks summary information security the safeguarding of computer systems and the integrity confidentiality and availability of the data they contain has long been recognized as critical national policy issue its importance is growing as the integration of computers into more and more aspects of modern life continues in addition cyber attacks or breaches of information secur ity appear to be increasing in frequency and few are willing to ignore the possibility that the severity of future attacks could be much greater than what has been observed to date central issue in both public and privat sectors is whether we are devoting enough resources to information security part of the answer must come from economic analysis what are the costs both historical and potential of security breaches how frequently can attacks be ex pected can these factors be quantified precisely so that organizations can termine the optimal amount to spend on information security and measure the effectiveness of that spending one in the field is satisfied with our present ability to measure the costs and probabilities of cyberattack s there are standa rd methodologies for cost measurement and study of the frequency of attacks is hindered by the reluctance of organizations to make public their experiences with security breaches this report summarizes the limited empirical data on att ack costs and surveys recent theoretical work that seeks to overcome the absence of reliable and comprehensive statistics investigations into the stock price impact of cyberattacks show that identified target firms suffer losses of 15 in the days after an attack for the average new york stock exchange corporation price drops of these magnitudes translate into shareholder losses of be tween 50 million and 200 million several computer security consu lting firms produce estimates of total worldwide losses attributable to virus and worm attacks and to hostile digital acts in general the 2003 loss estimates by thes firms range from 13 billion worms and viruses only to 226 billion for all forms of overt attacks the reliability of these estimates is often ch allenged the underlying methodol ogy is basically anecdotal the insurance industrys response to risi ng perceptions of cyberrisk has been twofold initially most companies excluded and continue to exclude cyberattacks from standard business insura nce coverage after this initial exclusion several insurers then began selling specialized cyberri sk policies growth of the market has been slow lacking the empirical data to construct actuarial tables insurers are unable to price risk with the degree of confidence they enjoy in traditional insurance lines estimates of the macroecono mic costs of cyberattacks are speculative as long as any cyberattack is limited in scope and shortlived it is likely that macroeconomic consequences will be small but the ability to recover quickly is important since the length of time computers are affected is an important determinant of the costs it may be almost as important for firms to address their abilities to restore operations as to insulate themselves from potential attacks this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32331contents s t u d i s f t h f f c t f c b r t t c k s n s t c k p r i c s 2 s u r v d t n c b r t t c k c s t s 6 c s i f b i c m p

any shortcomings that remainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32331the economic impact of cyberattacks the importance of electroni c information systems is obvious to all participants in the modern economy when information fails to circulate whole sectors of the economy are vulnerable finance wholes ale and retail trade transportation much of manufacturing and many service i ndustr ies would slow to crawl without computers vital public services utilities national defense and medicine are equally dependent information security the safeguarding of computer systems and the integrity confidentiality and availability of the data they contain has long been recognized as critical national policy issue two current trends indicate that its importance is growing first the integration of comput ers into more and more aspects of modern life continues second cyberattacks or br eaches of information security appear to be increasing in frequency and few observers are willing to ignore the possibility that future attacks could have much more severe consequences than what has been observed to date the core issue in both public and private sectors is whether we are devoting enough resources to information security part of the answer must come from economic analysis what are the costs both historical and potential of security breaches how frequently can attacks be ex pected can these factors be quantified precisely so that business firms and other organizations can determine the optimal amount to spend on information security and measure the effectiveness of that spending this report surveys the state of knowledg on the cost of cyberattacks and the economics of information security first we summarize several studies that use stock market capitalization as measure of the cost of cyberattacks to victim firms the studies find substantial shortterm dr ops in the prices of shares of firms following the announcement of an informa tion security breach between 1 and 5 of market capitalization with greater losses up to 15 r ecorded by some financial institutions where attackers had gained access to confidential customer records second we present summaries of th existing empirical data on costs attributable to cybercrime and computer worms and viruses what is available is limited amount of survey data which is frankly described by its compilers as anecdotal but is nonetheless wi dely reported in the press third we analyze the reasons for the lack of statistical data firms and organizations have strong incentives to c onceal information about cyberattacks and there are significant uncertainties and measurement difficulties that limit our ability to specify the dollar amount at risk from information security breaches theoretical models that describe the returns to spending on information security shed some light on the size of potential losses but in the absence of better statistical data assigning an overall figure to the cost of cyberattacks remains highly speculativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32331crs2 1 this discussion draws on huseyin cavusoglu birendra mishra and srinivasan raghunathan the eff ect of internet secu rity breach anno uncements on market value capital market reactions for breached firms and internet security developersinternational journal of ecommerce forthcoming p 57fourth we examine the efforts of the in surance industry to develop policies that cover cyberrisk these initiatives are in their infancy the chief obstacle has been lack of data with which to construct actuarial tables on the costs and frequency of attacks finally we consider cyberattacks as macroeconomic eventsappendices to this report include mmary of information risk assessment practices in fortune 500 manufacturing company and an overview of efforts by financial institutions and regulators to manage cyberrisk in that industry studies of the effect of cyberattacks on stock prices thus far reported cyberattacks have been relatively limited in scope and have not yet been on scale that would have significant macroeconomic consequences individual firms however may have suffere d significant losses as result of past attacks an examination of the effects of those attacks might be illuminating most estimates of the cost to companies of cyberattacks are based on surveys survey responses are often expressed in such wide range as to indicate considerable subjectivity and thus they may be of limited use there may however be more objective measure of the effect of cyberattacks on individual firms in theory the price of companys stock is primarily determined by the present discounted value of the cash flows expected to result fro m that firms output that cash flow is what contributes to the wealth of the stockholders either in the form of dividends or in the expansion of the firm s stock of productive capital any event that changes investors expectations about that future stream of income is likely to affect the price of the stock four recent studies have examined num ber of actual cyberattacks in an effort to see if any of those attacks could be linke d to change in the stock prices of the affected companies in some cases the studies attempted to measure if any stock price effect depended on the different characteristics of either the firm or the attacks it seems at least intuitively obvious that some firms are more exposed to cyber attacks than are others it is conceivable that firm size may affect vulnerability to attack but more to the point some firm s are more dependent on computer networks than others to conduct business1 conventional firms wh ich have been referred to in this context as brick and mortar firms might be expected to be the least vulnerable to cyberattacks as they are the least dependent on the internet to conduct business some firms characterized as click and mortar conduct business both offline and over the internet these fi rms face an increased vulnerability because of the risk that the business they conduc t via the internet might be interruptedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32331crs3 2 ibidfinally there are firms whose business is conducted almost exclusively over the internet these firms would seem to be most at risk the extent to which business is affected might reasonably be expected to depend on the type of attack most attacks have fallen into one of two categories the first is denialofservice attack dos dos attack renders firms internet portal inaccessible nd interferes with its ability to conduct online business for the most part this kind of attack causes lasting harm the more serious category of attacks are thos that involve the theft or destruction of secure information this kind of security breach is more likely to have lasting effects on the targeted firm other things being equal th more dependent firm is on the internet and the more intrusive an attack is the more likely it is that any attack will have significant consequences for the financial health of that firm table 1 summarizes these considerations table 1 potential financial consequences of cyberattack type of firmtype of attack dos security breach conventional brick and mortar eg cocacolalowest click and mortar eg borders internet firms eg amazon ebayhighest it might be expected in study of the effects of past attacks that pure internet company whose network security is breached would suffer more than would conventional firm that is affected by do s attack but it might also be presumed that those firms are fully aware of their respective vulnerabilities and so they allocate resources to computer secu rity to differing degrees in contrast firms that provi computer security might be expected to benefit from cyberattacks unless their products were publicly blamed for an attacks success an increase in the apparent vulnerability of computer networks could be expected to raise future earnings of thos companies and thus boost their stock price cavusoglu et examined five specified hypotheses regarding the consequences of cyberattacks2 to do so they identified 66 distinct security breaches that occurred between 1996 and 2001 of those 66 events 34 were availability dos attacks of the 66 events 31 affected firms whose business was conducted almost entirel over the internethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32331crs4 3 katherine campbell lawrence gordon martin

ettredge and vernon j richardson assessing the risk in ecommerce proceedings of the 35th hawaii inter national c onference on system scien ces 2002 p 11first the study found using the entire t of observations that firm value was negatively affected by internet security breaches firms affected by the attack experienced 21 decline in valu relative to unaffected firms second the authors also found that firms that rely on the internet for conducting business were more affected than were more conventiona l firms internet firms affected by an attack expe rienced 28 decline in valu relative to the other firms that were studied third the study found that smaller firms tended to lose more than did larger firms as the result of an attack fourth the kind of attack seemed to make significant difference dos attack was not found to be any less costly than an attack where there was more severe breach in security finally the authors found that following the announcement of an attack computer security firms experienced 1 4 increase in market value relative to other firms campbell et examined 43 attacks affecting 38 firms which occurred between 1995 and 20003 looking at stock prices over threeday period centered on the attack they found that there was sign ificant if modest decline in the market values of affected firms as result of the attack the authors separately examined those attacks that did not involve unauthor ized access to confiden tial data and those that did they found that there was sign ificantly larger response in the latter type of attack those instances accounted for th significance of the overall effects the stock price reaction to attacks whic h did not involve unauthorized access to confidential information was insignificant the study concluded that investors apparently do not consider do s attacks to be important with respect to the longrun profitability of firms ettredge and richardson examined the effects of dos attacks against internet firms that occurred in february 20024 this study examined the behavior of the stock prices of over 100 internetonly fi rms during threeday window centered on the day of the dos attack specifically th authors wanted to know if the costs of an attack were greater for those firms that had greater dependence on the internet they found that on average as result of the february 2002 attack internet firms lost 5 more in market value than did noninternet firms immediately following the attack ettredge and richardson also looked to see if there were differences among internet firms using sample

ecomme rce the authors examined if those assessments were correlated with the loss following the february 2002 attack the authors found that variations in perceive d exposure to risk were correlated with variations in the loss of market value the authors suggest that is evidence investors are able to distinguish among internet firms based on their vulnerability to cyber attack garg et studied 22 events that occurred between 1996 and 20025 the authors determined that as result of those attacks the affected firms experienced 27 decline in their stock price relativ to the overall market on the day following the attack three days after the attack the stock prices of the affected firms had dropped 45 relative to th rest of the market the attacks were divided into four dis tinct types simple web site defacing dos theft of credit card information and theft of other customer information in the case of web site defacing the average loss in stock value was 2 on the second day which rebounded somewhat to 11 loss on the third day dos attacks resulted in 29 drop on the second day nd 36 decline on the third day for attacks that compromise nonfinancial in formation there was an average drop in stock value of 05 on the day of the attac k and total decline of 15 on the third day attacks which compromised financ ial information chie fly credit card data caused the largest declines on the day of the attack stock prices of affected firms fell average of 93 and by the third day the decline reached 15 the authors also found that there was correlation betw een the number of credit cards that were compromised and the magnitude of the stock price hit all the studies found that there was si gnificant decline in stock prices of affected firms in the days immediately following cyberattack the time frame is necessarily restricted in an effort to isolate the effects of the attack to extend the time horizon would increase the likelihood that any variation in stock prices was due to other events therefore the studies do not attempt to determine if there is any persistent change in stock prices or if the drop in stock prices is temporary6 two of the studies determined that the drop in stock price was related to the type of attack with dos attacks generally having smaller effect than attacks which compromised confidential information on of the studies found that there was significant correlation between the kind of attack and the magnitude of the effect on stock prices the fourth study found that th magnitude of the drop in price of stock was correlated with managers

value of related losses in the 2003 csifbi survey figure 1 shows that the types of att acks most frequently reported are not the ones that cause the greatest losses theft of proprietary information reported by 21 of respondents and nial of service reported by 42 accounted for 673 of total reported m oney losses 1358 million out of 2018 million the distribution of losses by type of ttack has not been consistent over the years that the survey has been conducted in the 2000 survey for example theft of proprietary information was the most expe nsive type of attack as it was in 2003 however financial fraud accounted for 211 of all losses reported in 2000 as opposed to only 50 in 200310 there is consistent trend in total reported financial losses to computer crime as figure 2 shows it is likely that the results are skewed from year to year by small number of relatively rge loss reports in additi on the number of respondents varies from year to year the survey also presents data on the re ported costs of individual attacks with highest lowest and average values by ty pe of incident for 2003 the lowest cost reports drop into the hundreds of dollars the highest values range up to 35

and frequency of att ack data summarized here the csifbi surveys include information on incidents related to web sites computer security practices and the sources and methods of attacks what do the csifbi survey results have to tell us about the overall costs of cyberattacks in the united states unfort unately not much the surveys authors do not claim that their respondents are representative sample of the businesses organizations and other entities th at are exposed to cyberrisk11 survey recipients are not randomly chosen but are selfsel ected from among security professionals as result there is rigorous statisti cally sound method for extrapolating the loss reports of the 530 respondent s to the national level secondly the cost data reported are inco mplete even for the sample as noted above 15 of respondents to the 2003 surv ey did not know whether there had been unauthorized use of their systems more significantly while 75 of respondents reported financial sses only 47 could quantify the losses12 thus the figures in the charts above represent only measurable losses and substantia lly understate total losses though one can specify the degree of understatement fu rthermore if less than half of respondents re porting losses can put dollar figure on those losses the clear inference is that there is standard technique for quantifying the amount of loss the survey does provide numerical s upport for number of propositions that are generally accepted in the computer secur ity literature that insiders are the source of substantial percentage of attacks13 that many attacks are unreported14 and that there is simple standardized method fo r quantifying the costs of cyberattackshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32331crs9 15 ibid p 20 16 for overviews of these companies see

ication of these costs table 5 below presents cost data for specific worm and virus attacks from both cei and mi2g for some attacks the estimates are very close for others they diverge sharply the differences may reflect either differences in cost estimation models or the two firms may define the ep isodes differently for example one may break out cost figures for number of sepa rate attacks

estimates of the cost of virus and other attacks while they do not publish time seri or descriptions of their methodologies their estimates are likely similarly derived by extrapolation from relatively small sample of cases based on their best judgem ent of how computer users worldwide are affected essentially these estimates constitute anecdotal rather than statistical evidence why empirical data are scarce accurate and statistically comprehensive data on the incidence and costs of cyberattacks are critical to the analysis of information security nevertheless as 2002 world bank study found the existing base of information that supports projections about the extent of the electronic security problem is substantially flawed23 if information gathering has the potential to reduce costs and risks why does the data shortfall persisthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32331crs13 there are two chief obstacles first there are strong incentives that discourage the reporting of breaches of information s ecurity second organizations are often unable to quantify the risks of cyberattacks they face or even to set dollar value on the cost of attacks that have already taken place thus even if all the confidential and proprietary information th at victims have about cybe rattacks were disclosed and collected in central database measurement of the economic impact would still be problematical incentives to not reveal information comprehensive data on information secu rity breaches are lacking not because the value of such data is not generally r ecognized the problem is that organizations have real economic incentives not to rev eal such information the costs of public disclosure may ta ke several forms financial market impacts the stock and credit markets and bond rating firms may react to secur ity breach announcements negative reactions raise the cost of capital to reporting firms even firms that are privately held and not active in public securities markets may be adversely affected if banks nd other lenders judge them to be more risky than previously thought reputation or confidence effects negative publicity may damage reporting firms reputation or br and or cause customers to lose confidence these effects may give commercial rivals competitive advantage litigation concerns if an organization reports security breach investors customers or other st akeholders may use the courts to seek recovery of damages if th organization has been open in the past about previous incidents pl aintiffs may allege pattern of negligence liability concerns officials of firm or organization may face sanctions under federal ws such as the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 h ipaa the grammleachbliley act of 1999 glba or the sarb anesoxley act of 2003 which require institutions to meet various standards for safeguarding customer and patient records signal to attackers public announcement may alert hackers that an organizations

organizations may have good reas ons not to make public disclosures regarding security breaches one would exp ect their incentives to measure the costs of such incidents internally to be str ong

efforts in fact there are standard methods for measuring the costs of cyberhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32331crs15 28 ibid p 40attacks attacks produce many kinds of co sts some of which cannot be quantified easily if at all as result there is presumed gap in private internal data that mirrors the absence of public data on cyberattack costs the costs associated with cyberattacks can be divided into direct and indirect costs direct costs include the expenses incurred in restoring computer system to its original preattack state recovery from an attack will typically require extra spending on labor and materials these are the easiest costs to measure but even at this basic level of cost accounting complexities may arise if an attack leads to increased spending on it security to what extent are those costs attributable to the attack if planned upgrade in hardware or software is accelerated after an attack should the upgrade be classi fied as security cost another set of direct costs arises fro m business interruption these costs may include lost revenue and ss of worker productivity during the disruption lost revenues may be easily measured by refere nce to preattack period but this may not tell the whole story lost sales ma be transitory phenomenon limited to the attack period and possibly made up afterwards or they may be longterm if for example some customers switch permanently to competing firms measurement of productivity loss is not always straightforward or uniform generally this is not an added dollar cost the workers are paid what they would have been paid anyway assigning va lue to lost time depends on each individual organizations estimate s of its own costs related to business opportunities forgone during the disruption or diversion of resources during the recovery effort another direct cost may involve the loss of value in information assets that are stolen compromised or otherwise degraded during an attack soo hoo summarizes the difficulties in measurement that may arise here the value of an information asset is highly dependent upon who possesses the information sensitive commercial rd information in the hands of competitor is significantly more problematic than if it were in the hands of netherlands teenager time sensitivity can also complicate the valuation problem for example password that expires in ten seconds is worthless after it has expire d but it is quite valuable during the ten seconds that it could be used to gain system access add to these difficulties the quantification challenges posed by intangible values such as reputation trust embarrassment et c and the task of valuation quickly becomes highly uncertain and pot entially contentious enterprise28 attacks also have indirect costs which may continue to accrue after the immediate damage has been repaired many indirect costs flow from loss of reputation or damage to firms brand customers may defect to competitors financial markets may raise the firms cost of capital insurance costs may rise and lawsuits may be filed some of these cost factors are readily quantifiable but other aspects of loss of trust or confidence are intangible and difficult to measurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32331crs16 29 hasan cavusoglu hu seyin cavusoglu and srinivasan raghunathan economics of it security management four improvements to current secu rity

than th price of an attack on major company would be in terms of st ock market capitalization29 indirect costs of cyberattacks may also include economic harm to individuals and institutions other than the immediate target of an attack an attack on one firms computer networks may affect other firms up and down the supply chain when credit card data is hacked or an intern et service provider goes down consumers suffer costs from an accounting perspec tive these do not count as costs to the target firm but from policy perspective they can be significant the possibility of cascade effects disruption spreading from computer to interlinked computer is wellknown but we are far from being able to quantify the economic impact of an event of this type to profitseeking business measurement of costs already incurred is useful primarily to the extent that it facilitates pr evention or mitigation of future losses in the cybersecurity field as sewhere risk assessment is primarily forwardlooking activity it is less important or n ecessary because certain costs cannot be quantified the next section of this report discusses the cost models that firms and organizations use for cyberrisk cyberrisk cost models it is normal for businesses to make decisions on the basis of incomplete information in cyberrisk management thes decisions involve the amount to spend on information security and how to allocate th at budget despite the gaps in data and measurement capabilities businesses government and other organizations have strong incentives both economic and legal to develop risk management programs that are as robust as possible early attempts to measure cyberrisk d to the annual loss expectancy ale model developed in the late1970s at the national institute for standards and technology nist30 ale is dollar figure produced by multiplying the cost or impact of an incident in dollars by the frequency or probability of that incident in other words ale considers security breaches from two perspectives how much would such breach cost and how likely is it to occur ale combines probability and severity of attacks in to single number which represents the amount firm actually expects to lose in given yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32331crs17 31 the cert coordination center and others publish raw data on the number of attacks but these figures which have been growing rapidly in recent years do not distinguish betweenmajor and minor incidents the data sharing problem discussed above hampers efforts tocollect reliable figures on the frequency of attacks in the past

they bot h resist quantification the difficulties in cost measurement have been set out above and similar uncertaintie s apply to efforts to specify the likelihood of an attack31 attempts to calculate value for ale run afoul of the unrealistic and timewasting assumption of numerically precise information32 if precise calculation of amounts at risk is not feasible what are the alternatives numerous thodologies that measure risk qualitatively rather than quantitatively are in use common practi ce is to rank information assets according to how valuable they are and b how vul nerable they are to

allow for the quantification of risk although the da ta needed to perform traditional business calculations such as return on investment or costbenefit analyses of security spending may be unavaila

security nov 2002 p 438given the uncertainties in measuring costs risks and the effectiveness of security efforts we cannot make simple statements like the following company that expects to lose x dollars per year to cyberattacks will generally spend dollars to mitigate those losses until better empirical cost data become available such calculations will remain speculative however theoretical models have been developed that attempt to shed some light on the returns to security spending these models are fairly rudimentary but as they are refined or even in their present state they may help put security spending decisions on more rational and rigorous basis38 the smokestack curve the first observation from these theoretical models is that there are diminishing returns to security spending little spending can bring substantial reduction in expected losses ale at higher levels of spending the reduction per dollar spent will be less at very high levels the extra amount of loss reduction purchased may be very low or even approach zero in graphic terms this pattern is called smokestack curve resembling plume of smoke rising vertically at first then flattening out as it cools and drifts away on the wind diminishing returns are observed in many business situations moitra and konda provide evidence for them in secur ity spending they conduct simulation of malicious attacks against network systems and measure survivability the degree to which system is able to withstand attack and still function at certain level when different levels of defense mechan isms are deployed their results show survivability at various levels of security expenditure they summarize their findings as follows as cost increases survivability increases rapidly at first and then more slowly such plot can provide systems manager with the ability to make an informeddecision about the level of defense that is most appropriate for his or herorganization since it shows the tradeoff involved between cost and expectedsurvivability 39 in moitra and kondas analysis firms security spending decisions will depend upon how risk averse they are if partic ular security breach will cause intolerable losses firms may continue to spend on security even when the marginal return is low gordon and loeb40 introduce the assumption of risk neutrality which means that the firm is indifferent to investments that have the same expected return evenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32331crs20 41 in it security terms risk neutrality would mean that the firm did not differentiate between highcost lowprobability event and lowcost highrisk attack clearly this is asimplifying assumption that will not always hold true in the real worldfigure 3 returns to it security spending s1lƒs45though the investments may ve varying amounts of risk41 under risk neutrality profitmaximizing firm would increase spending on it security as long as the return in terms of reduction in ale or expected loss exceeded the marginal expenditure the firm would stop spending when one additional dollar spent on security reduced ale by less than dollar by assuming risk neutrality gordon nd loeb identify an optimum level of security spending found at the point on the smokestack curve where marginal security spending equals marginal loss re duction this is shown in figure 3 below the horizontal axis

the optimal amount to spend on information security never exceeds37 of the expected loss resulting from security breach and is typically muchless than that 37 hence the optimal amount to spend on information security would typically be far less than the expected loss from security breach 42 since loeb and gordons model is theoreti cal and not based on empirical data the nature of their assumptions determines their results without evaluating the robustness of their assumptions or the co mpleteness of the ma thematical proofs of the propositions that flow from the assumpti ons it may be interesting to see what their estimate of optimal it security spending suggests for the value of ale we can roughly estimate the amount spent on it security even though there is standard definition of what constitute s security spending as opposed to for example normal upgrades of hardware an d software and even though statistics based on direct measurement or reporting are not available common rule of thumb is that organizations devote roughly 5 of their total it spending to it security43 forrester research inc projects th at total it spending by business and governments in the united states in 2004 will be 743 billion44 with these two assumptions we can estimate that it security spending by us businesses and governments in 2004 will be about 37 billion gordon and loebs model suggests that this figure does not exceed and is probably considerably less than 37 of ale or the amount organizations expect to lose as result of cyberattacks thus figure of 100 billion represents lower bound estimate for the annual expected loss in the united states to the extent that firms spend less than 37 of their expected loss on security the estimated figure for ale rises is it security spending too high or too low gordon and loebs model estimates an optimal level of security spending there are arguments however that organizations do not now spend an optimal amount on security that

49 rebecca t mercuri analyzing security costs communications of the acm v 46 june 2003 p 18why would firms spend too much on security one reason that is cited repeatedly is that some security spending is driven by legal and regulatory rather than economic considerations over 40 of respondents to idcs 2003 security survey reported that compliance with i ndustry regulations was the most important factor contributing to growth in it secur ity spending only about 25 cited risk level concern at executive level as the most important factor45 another argument is that since many fi rms cannot perform satisfactory return oninvestment calculation for security sp ending they adopt best practices approach and simply make the same ki nd of investments they see other firms making critics of this approach claim that the result is herd mentality leading to expenditure on security features that may be of little value to the buyers specific needs for example think about why firewalls succeeded in the marketplace its not because theyre effective most firewalls are installed so poorly as not to be effective and thereare many more effective security products that have never seen widespreaddeployment firewalls are ubiquitous because auditors started demandingfirewalls 46 on the other hand some companies re gard existing security products and services as useful and desi rable but not affordable ma ny executives view security as an underfunded area insufficient budge t was cited as the primary obstacle to effective information security by 56 of respondents to the ernst young survey47 similarly lack of resources was most often named as the biggest challenge to security infrastructure management in the idc security survey48 some analysts tend to discount these vi ews individuals who selfselect into security professions may be those biased toward greater risk avoidance than are members of the general population and thus might be prone to overestimate potential losses or willing to authorize greater prevention expenses than actually necessary49 given the lack of empirical data about cyberattack costs and the measurement difficulties that have been discussed in this report it is not surprising that there are different views on the appropr iate level of security spending single dramatic security breach could produce significant shift in risk percep tions

principles can improve on that judgement cyberattacks and the insurance industry as an industry dedicated to accepting ri sks that people and businesses want or need to shed the insurance industry is unsur prisingly interested in the increasing risk of cyberattack as these risks became larger and more evident with the growth of the internet the insurance industrys reaction was essentially twofold the initial reaction was largely to make it clear that existing business insurance did not include coverage of cyberrisks the premiums charged for existing types of business insurance essentially did not account for the risk from some form of cyberattack and thus to cover these risks at the existing lower premium rate would have been economically damaging to the insurance company in general the reaction of excluding new risk once it becomes kno wn is quite common in the insurance industry one can see it fo r example in the reaction to the 911 attacks and in the industrys reaction to the increase of homeowners claims for mold damage particularly in texas in both cases th risks were presumed to be included in policies when they were low frequency and low cost risks once it became clear that they were not such low frequency and low cost risks insurance contracts began to specifically exclude them the second reaction to this new cyberri sk was to introduce specific policies to cover those risks that had been excl uded from traditional business insurance coverage this largely began occurring in 1999 although some c overage was offered as far back as 1997 the market leader in cyber risk policies aig is estimated to have approximately 70 of the market for cyberrisk insurance with approximately 2500 policies issued50 other companies writing po licies include chubb st paul zurich american hartford and ace ltd the total premium for such policies has been estimated to be between 60 million and 120 million in 200251 t h s numbers are however quite different co mpared to those

with only 9 of the total commercial market in 200253 estimates for growth in cyberinsurance coverage are substantial with the insurance information institute seeing 2 billion in premiums by 2007 or

insura nce industry in this realm is lack of data insurance pricing rest s critically on an understanding of the risks that are being transferred particularly the frequency of the risk and the possible damages that could result with enough experience and data the insurance industry can be extremely accurate in its predictions and very efficient at dealing with risk even with risks that might be very rare or very damaging the risks to be covered by cyberinsurance however were not only unexpected but also are to large degree qualitatively different from what has been seen in the past this leads to situation where insurers are writing policies without the type of information that they prefer particularly when compared to lines like fire or auto where insurers have long historical experience aig might estimate as it has that computer viruses caused 13 billion in damage in 2001 however th is would only be the beginning of the questions that might need to be answered what is the likely frequency of such attacks is this number high number or low number compared to what the costs might be in the future what steps has particular company taken to mitigate the damage from future attack and will th steps be successful in doing so successfully pricing insurance in the long run demands answers to such questions the experience that few years have given the companies is important and the estimates now are more accurate than they were five years ago but more experience is certainly needed before insurers will as comfortably write cybe rrisk polices as they write other lines

innovation in the manufacture of computers it is also widely expected that the speed and memory capacity of those computers will continue to improve rapidly such rapid rate of technological advance in the development and manufactur of computers was predicted in 1965 by gordon moore one of the co founders of intel corporation57 specifically moores law predicted that the number of transistors that could be put on computer chip would double every 18 months whether or not that prediction was selffulfilling prophecy may be open to stion but the fact is that the pace of technological advance in th manufacture of computers has vindicated moores law over time because of the rapid innovation in the pr oduction of computer chips the prices of computers as well as other goods related to information processing and communications sometimes referred to collec tively as information technology it have been falling steadily for some time between 1959 and 1995 computer prices fell at an average annual rate of near ly 169 and between 1995 and 2002 prices fell at an annual rate of 201 these price declines reflect substantial improvements in the quality of computers the bureau of labor statis tics bls has developed procedure for estimating price indexes for goods whose char acteristics are changing rapidly these are referred to as hedonic price indexes hedonic price indexes attempt to estimate statistical relationship between prices and set of characteristics such as memory and processor speed these price indexes are important to the measurement of productivity because estimating price change is necessary to estimating change in real output and thus productivity if the rate of price dec line in computers is overestimated then measures of productivity will be overstated most studies

contributed to an increase in the overall amount of capital availa ble to the workforce this is often referred to as capital deepening increas in the capital stock generally tend to raise worker productivity in part because of increased spending on it equipment the overall rate of investment spending rose significantly in the 1990s prior to the recent acceleration in productivity growth most analyses found that computers yielded little benefit one reason is that until recently computer s accounted for relatively small share of the total capital stock59 but that view has now changed economists are encouraged that the acceleration in productivity growth of the late 1990s may mean that the economy is on higher growth path and many believe that computer s have had lot to do with it two recent studies found considerable evidence that the computer or more generally it equipment is behind most of the recent acceleration in productivity growth there is also evidence of mode st spillover into other sectors of the economy in other words investment in computers can raise the productivity of the workers who use them but it may also lead firms to change the way they operate leading to further productivity gains the first study by oliner and sichel at the federal reserve board found that of 09 percentage point increase in the gr owth rate of total factor productivity from

the sector producing it equipment has had modest direct effect on total factor productivity by far the more important factor has been the dec lining price of it equipment stimulating surge in investment and increasing the size of the capital stock remember that total factor productivity measures changes in output that are not accounted for by changes in economic inputs such as labor and capital there is doubt that computers are raising productiv ity of many firms but as long as economic statistics measure them correctly the increased share of work that computers do will not show up in increased multifactor productivity because that measure of productivity tracks the increase in output not associated with the increase in investment in computers62 it is unclear whether or not computers have had any spillover effects on multif actor productivity beyond their direct contribution to growth in output there is some evidence to suggest that those spillover effects of computers on total factor productivity are fairly small in 2000 jorgenson and stiroh found that those sectors of the economy that i nvest most heavily in computers and it equipment such as financial services

growth in another study robert gordon found th at most of the acceleration in labor productivity was attri butable to capital deepening nd faster productivity growth in the production of computers and it equipment64 of the roughly 02 percentage point increase in total factor productiv ity most was accounted for by faster productivity growth in the manufacture of durable goods that suggests that any spillover effects of computers on the overall economy were limited it seems evident that at least in the recent past computers and other it equipment have made si gnificant contribution to the production of goods and services but those investments may also have introduced new vulnerabilities because many of the computer systems ar interconnected they may be subject to attacks designed to interfere with their operations in the face of uncertainty about the ri sk and the potential cost of threats to computer operations and security firms must allocate some resources to the protection of their computer networks and databases the result is onetime reduction in the productivity for those firms because of the increased need for computer security there is an increase in the inputs to the production of goods and services without any corresponding in crease in the output of those firms productivity is ratio of the output of fi rm to the inputs used in the goods produced by that firm any increase in inputs th at do not contribute to output will reduce measured productivity in the case of one time increase in the cost of computer security there will be onetime drop in the level of productiv ity firms may also direct it employees to spend more time on computer security problems and less time enhancing and developing ne w customer services wh ether or not the increased need for computer security has any longterm effects on productivity growth may depend on improving productivity in the pr ovision of computer security unless there is some increase in risk or unless firms reassess their perception of the potential threat much of the effect of increased computer security costs on productivity has ready happened estimates of the magnitude of the eff ect on productivity of the increased cost of computer security are hard to come by there are estimates however of the overall effect on productivity of the increased spending on homeland security following the september 11 terror attacks increasing physical security is likely to be more expensive than increasing computer security because much of the provision of physical security is labor intensive in an analysis

perspective by examining previous events that have been labeled disasters and looking at estimates of the economic co sts associated with them the bureau of economic analysis b ea is the agency responsible for publishing estimates both of national income and also of the capital stock in order to do that it must also estimate how much of the capital stock is lost due to some catastrophic event above and beyond the preciation that occurs over the lifetime of any physical asset table 8 presents selected bea estimates of the value of structures and equipment destroyed as the result of various significant events the value of the loss is expressed as percen tage of gross domestic product gdp also shown is the rate of economic growth in the quarter preceding the event and for the quarter in which the event occurred as well it might be unwise to read too much into the differences in economic growth between the quarter prior to and the quarter of the event however it may be worth noting that economic growth declined in less than half of the cases shown it appears that whatever effect these disasters d on the macroeconomy was not significant relative to other factors that influence economic growth there is fundamental difference betw een cyberattack and conventional physical attack in that cyberattack genera lly disables rather than destroys the target of the attack because of that difference direct comparison with previous largescale disasters may be of limited use there have been two other events in the recent past that may also serve as ba ses for comparison the first was the requirement to upgrade many computers nd their software to avoid what was potentially serious problem related to recogn ition of the date in the last year of the 20th century this was generally known as the y2k problem the second recent event was the electrical blackout that affected much of the northeastern united states in august 2003 the problems associated with y2k were different from the potential costs of cyberattack in that it was known with so degree of certainty that there was problem and there was known deadline by wh ich the problem had to be solved it was similar in the sense that firms had to divert resources in order to fix problem in the same way that firms must divert re sources to protect th eir computer networks from

been scheduled to take place prior to the date change were sped up along with any addition to productivity they may have contributed the electrical blackout of august 2003 may also serve as case for comparison estimates of the cost of th blackout range from 6 to 10 billion for the entire us economy67 that accounted for 01 of gdp the power failure imposed costs on both households and bus inesses producti on was disrupted affecting earnings and profits food stocks spoiled because of lack of refrigeration and government costs rose because of the increased demand for police and other emergency services in some cases pr oduction may have simp ly been delayed in which case losses may not have been perm anent but in other cases businesses may not have been able to make up the loss by shifting production the determinants of the cost of the power outage were principally the size of the area affected and the duration of the blackout costs may have been less than they otherwise would have been because power was lost late in the afternoon and began to be restored the following morning of all the cases cited the northeast power failure may be the most relevant to consideration of the potential costs of cyberattack in the case of the power failure there was little if any destruction of physical capital the cost of the outage was primarily dete rmined by its size and duration those two factors would likely also determine the economic cost of cyberattack68 any estimate of the potential economic co st of cyberattack must ultimately be speculative computers and other info rmation processing equipment that might be vulnerable to attack make direct contribution to the production of goods and services but it is unclear how much other factors of pr oduction both labor and capital are dependent on computers it seems within the realm of possibility that the effect of an attack on computers and thei r networks could have an effect on outputhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32331crs33 69

interrupted market transactions might be limited to whatever currency is in circulation significant proportion if not all of total production mig ht be interrupted for all of these things to occur simultaneously would presumably require an extremely sophisticated attack that was completely successful while the probability of such an event may be extremely low it still gives basis for an upper limit to any estimate of the economic damage that might be done if all economic activity were to be temporarily interrupted by cyberattack the only consideration in estimating the cost would be the duration of the event the share of gdp produced on given day is bout 03 of the total for the entire year some of the production that mig ht be interrupted is unlikely to be permanent loss but would simply be deferred until the effects of the attack dissipated since considerable if unknown share of output is not dependent on computers the final cost would be less than that historically total annual production of g oods and rvices has averaged roughly onethird of the value of the total stock of physical capital as of 2001 computer equipment and software accounted for roug hly 18 of the total capital stock if equipment and software are ssumed to contribute to output in the same way as other forms of capital their direct contribu tion would account for about 18 of total annual production69 if that share of output were in terrupted for single day it would amount to about 005 of total annual gdp as long as any cyberattack is less than comprehensive and shortlived it is likely that any macroeconomic consequences will be fairly small but whatever the scope of the attack the ability to recover quickly is important since the length of time computers are affected is an important determinant of the costs it may be almost as important for firms to address their abilities to restore operations as it is to work to insulate themselves from any potential attack

4th quarter 2001 p 3conclusion and policy options this report has described the difficulties that attend the measurement and quantification of cyberrisk there is stion that our presen t level of knowledge is below what we would like it to be by briefly setting out the chief obstacles to progress and the market forces that are driving efforts to improve cyberrisk management some conc lusions about the avenues ava ilable to policy makers can be drawn the first major obstacle is the lack of data on the frequenc and severity of cyberattacks organizations particul arly private busine sses have strong incentives not to share information about ttacks several government agencies are planning or conducting survey research on much greater scale than has been done before the results together with other governmentsponsored efforts to increase information sharing may in time lead to significant improvements in our ability to assess cyberrisk if incentives to conceal information remain strong70 however some form of mandatory re porting regime might be cons idered model could be the public health system where the benefits of central data base on cases of certain illnesses outweigh an individuals right to privacy the other chief obstacle is the inherent difficulty in measuring costs that may be intangible and subject to innumerable c ontingencies current research focuses on how to improve quantification of risk and costs in the face of this complexity it is too hard to solve the fully general security problem therefore we must simplify we must model71 modeling involves tradeoff the simpler the model the easier to use but if model is too simple it ma fail to capture cyberrisk in its entirety on the other hand if model is elaborat ed to take into account more and more possible attack scenarios it may become so complex that the cost of measurement itself becomes material to the risk mana gement calculation particularly for small firms and organizations at the present stage of knowledge we cannot identify any one best cyberrisk model that all firms and organizations could usefully adopt there may never be such onesizefitsall procedure there are three major market forces at work that will lead to improvements in cyberrisk management comp etition liability and insuran ce what might policy do to encourage these forces or at least not to interfere with them firms that best manage cyberrisk will be rewarded by competitive market this simple statement implies that it may be premature for policy makers to attempt to move forward with general standard for risk management in addition to the information on security research publishe d in journals and conferences we can be sure that much of the cuttingedge work in the field is being done out of the public eye behind the corporate proprietary veil it may be useful for public and private groups to put forward sets of guidelines nd best practices but only to the extent that these are seen as minimum requirements not complete and sufficient responses tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32331crs35 cyberrisk deciding that todays met hods are good enough may discourage future research the second market force is liability th prospect of being sued for damages when confidential information is stolen or destroyed is major incentive for firms to improve information security it is also however major disincentive for sharing information about cyberattacks some may suggest that limits or caps on liability related to cybersecurity breaches would make firms less reluctant to disclose incidents in theory lower liability would also reduce the incentive to invest in security but in practice since liability is only one of many costs that influence risk management decisions this ffect might be very slight finally market forces in the form of profit opportunities are driving the development of cyberrisk insurance thriving insurance market would greatly reduce the costs associated with the inability to quantify risk with insurance firms would not have to measure potential risk s of cyberattacks themselves any more than homeowners have to calculate the ex act probability that their houses will burn down significant economic efficiencies will be obtained as the risk assessment function is shifted from millions of individual organizations and firms to insurers who specialize in pricing risk growth of cyberrisk insurance is hindered primarily by lack of reliable actuarial data related to the incidence and costs of information security breaches enhanced collection of such figures would probably be the most important contribution that policy can makehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32331crs36 appendix an overview of cyberrisk management in fortune 500 manufacturing company
