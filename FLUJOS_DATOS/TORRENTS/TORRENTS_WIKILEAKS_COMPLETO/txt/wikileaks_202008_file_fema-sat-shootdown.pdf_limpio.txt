for official use only fouo 1space object reentry state leadership briefing dhsfema region ix february 19 2008 for official use only fouo 2situation an uncontrollable us government satellite will reenter earths atmosphere between the end of february and early march the satellite consists of 5000 pounds of equipment and material including fuel tank containing 1000 pounds of propellant hydrazine classified as hazardous material hydrazine is clear colorless liquid with an ammonia like odor direct contact with skin or eyes or ingestion or inhalations from hydrazine released from the tank upon impact could result in immediate danger including convulsions tremors or seizures ingesting or drinking hydrazine can cause nausea vomiting uncontrolled shaking inflammation of the nerves or coma source us dept of health human services agency for toxic substances and disease registry for official use only fouo 3situation the us government has decided to take action to mitigate the risk to human lives by engaging the nonfunctioning satellite low altitude missile launch is being planned to break up the satellite destroy the hydrazine fuel tank and bringing down the debris over water this mission is not anticipated to occur until after february 20 2008 the dod has high degree of confidence the engagement will be successfulfor official use only fouo 4situation if the missile engagement is successful the fuel tank will fragment causing the hydrazine to dissipate prior to entering the atmosphere or during its descent the hydrazine will then not pose risk to human lives full ninetynine percent of the debris resulting from the engagement will reenter the earths atmosphere within one week for official use only fouo 5debris footprint debris that survives reentry will impact within debris or impact area on the earths surface it is possible to estimate the size of the footprint but very difficult to predict where the footprint will be on earths surface or where specific pieces of debris will land after its initial breakup along its trajectory through the atmosphere reentering object will continue to break apart surviving pieces will hit earth in an impact or debris footprint the heavy debris will generally travel farther downrange to the toe of the footprint lighter material will generally be near the heel footprint lengths can vary from hundred miles to perhaps over thousand miles depending on the characteristics and complexity of the object the footprint width is generally determined by the effects of wind on the falling debris objects with heavy objects affected less and lightest the most if the object should explode during reentry fragments will be spread out across the footprint footprint width of perhaps 10 to 25 miles is typical for official use only fouo 6assumptions dhs fema has lead for allhazards consequence management response federal departments and agencies have sufficient capability and assets to support state tribal and local

respond as needed for official use only fouo 8 federal concept of operations consequence management the federal operations center in washington dc is in constant contact with dod and will notify all states and interagency partners with information concerning the reentry of the satellite and debris field once it is known fema is developing notification plan to ensure that governors homeland security advisors emergency managers first responders the public and the media have all available information about the timing and location of reentry if it is to occur over the united states states and interagency partners will be notified of the reentry event by the national warning system nawas for official use only fouo 9 federal concept of operations consequence management the national
