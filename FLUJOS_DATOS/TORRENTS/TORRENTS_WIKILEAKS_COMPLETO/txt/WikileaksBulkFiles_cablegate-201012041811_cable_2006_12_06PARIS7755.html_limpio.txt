gourdaultmontagne discuss russiageorgia russiakosovo and turkeyeu classified by ambassador craig stapleton for reasons 14 b d 1 s summary eur as dan frieds december 7 meeting with presidential diplomatic advisor maurice gourdaultmontagne mgm focused largely on russia with france in defensive posture mgm raised the aborted putinchirac dinner on the margins of the nato riga summit saying it had been instigated by russia and portrayed france as having attempted to steer in way compatible with latvian interests in contrast to french political director araud septel he showed reluctance to see the kremlins hand in the litvinenko poisoning preferring to ascribe it to rogue elements mgm claimed to support georgian independence while suggesting that nato article 5 obligations precluded georgian nato membership on kosovo he reviewed frances plans to persuade the eu to agree to offer serbia an saa agreement not linked to fulfillment of its icty obligations but worried above all about putins explicit threat to veto security resolution mandating independence there was risk of instability and partition if the west did not exercise sufficient care in managing the russians fried countered that the west needed to be prepared to proceed in extremis without the russians and warned against allowing the russians to hold up decision through the threat of veto 2 c summary cont on other issues mgm reviewed the francogerman proposal for review of turkeys implementation of its ankara protocol commitments between 2007 and 2009 assured fried that france wanted to avoid train wreck but insisted it was incumbent on the turks to make gesture fried reminded mgm of the strategic importance of keeping turkey tied to eu mgm agreed in principle but insisted turkey had to play by the eus rules and noted the difficulties of managing domestically public sentiment against turkey fried and mgm agreed that france and the us had worked well together at the nato riga summit end summary 3 c eur as daniel fried accompanied by the ambassador and pol deputy notetaker met december 7 with president chiracs diplomatic advisor nsaequivalent maurice gourdaultmontagne mgm to discuss number of european issues that revolved largely around russia mgm was joined by presidency middle east advisor dominique boche and strategic affairs advisor laurent bili putinchirac at riga 4 c noting at the outset that he had been directly involved in the aborted putinchirac dinner on the margins of the nato summit mgm assured fried that french actions had been above board kremlin advisor pridhodko had originally proposed that putin meet chirac privately at paris airport november 29 in order to express his birthday wishes mgm cited putins meeting in hannover with former chancellor schroeder as precedent france had agreed while noting that the dates coincided with the riga summit pridhodko suggested riga which france dutifully vetted with the latvians with the understanding that they would have to host such dinner and assuring the latvians that france was prepared to say to the russians if meeting would in any way cause them embarrassment the latvians were prepared to proceed so long as the russians also agreed to bilateral meeting which mgm conveyed to pridhodko pridhodko had suggested that this could be difficult given negative russian public opinion toward latvia the latvians told mgm that the russians had refused to meet at the official palace or residence but were considering the latvian cultural center mgm said he had encouraged the russians to accept the last offering and they had proceeded as if it might be acceptable late tuesday however they balked apparently because the center was located about 200m from the latvian museum of occupation 5 c mgm concluded his presentation with the argument that such meeting would have been positive for russianlatvian relations and would have helped to blur dividing lines between nato and russia he complained over latvias going public with the cancellation by querying nato syg hoop scheffer as to whether we are allowed to receive the russian president he commented that had they remained silent the cancellation would have been nonevent fried countered that the latvians had been right to inform nato and thus avoid surprise he contrasted the russians clumsiness in managing the dinner with the latvians transparency suggesting that it was time for the russians to accept the independence of the baltic states he added pointedly that the us would longer accept putative russian concerns about latvian treatment of their citizens at time when they were still rounding up georgians on the paris 00007755 002 of 003 basis of ethnicity mgm commented meekly that the timing had not been right for the visit and agreed that the latvian government longer had problem of noncitizen ethnic russians litvinenko case 6 s fried commented that the shortterm trend inside russia was negative noting increasing indications that the uk investigation into the murder of litvinenko could well point to some sort of russian involvement mgm called attention to chiracs statement encouraging the russians to cooperate in the investigation he wondered aloud who might have given the order but speculated the murder probably involved settling of accounts between services rather than occurring under direct order from the kremlin fried noting putins attention to detail questioned whether rogue security elements could operate in the uk less without putins knowledge describing the current atmosphere as strange he described the russians as increasingly selfconfident to the point of arrogance georgiarussia 7 c fried noting he had discussed georgia the previous evening with mfa political director gerard araud septel said it was important to support georgian sovereignty against russian pressure for three reasons the situation overall in georgia was improving under saakashvilis leadership violation of georgian territorial integrity would set dangerous precedent and germany and central and eastern europe had strong interest in ensuring that gas and oil pumped from azerbaijan and central asia did not travel exclusively through pipelines owned or controlled by russia mgm responded that france supported georgias independence but wondered how to accomplish this within existing structures the heart of nato was article 5 and it was doubtful that nato would declare war on russia over georgia it was therefore important to bypass article 5 and find specific way that did not involve nato membership if georgia joins armenia may follow even in the case of turkey was its kurdish problem one for europeans mgm asked 8 c fried assured mgm that the us was not seeking membership for georgia soon but it was important not to close the door in order to continue to promote georgian reform and development it was incumbent on the west to support georgian sovereignty and maintain united front against russia he argued he related that he had urged saakashvili not to seek crises with russia since crisis worked only for russia and time was on georgias side so long as it moved quietly in five years burgeoning georgian economy had the potential to dramatically change the politics of the region mgm agreed in principle but suggested one could differ on ways and means serbia and kosovo 9 c fried explained that the us had decided to offer pfp to serbia as means of supporting democratic forces in the upcoming elections president tadic had made strong case for serbias euroatlantic future similar considerations had prompted the us to support ahtisaaris recommendation to postpone tabling his proposals on kosovo status but it was critical to move quickly after january 21 additional delay would encourage the serbs and others into thinking the west felt intimidated it was time to push onward to supervised independence fried said that while russia could be expected to cause difficulties in the end he believed it would abstain on unscr although he could not be certain what was certain was that the russians must not be allowed to believe that the threat of veto will work because they would exploit any opening the west therefore had to send the signal that it was prepared to move without them if necessary because signal would be interpreted as tacit acquiescence in russias raising the bar this was terrible option but paralysis was worse 10 c mgm reviewed the history of frenchserbian relations back to the salonika front of wwi on which mgms grandfather had served judged pfp as positive offer and said chirac had proposed to merkel that the eu move to stabilization and association agreement saa with serbia even in the event of insufficient icty cooperation merkel had initially responded negatively citing tadics failure to request it but france continued to believe that offering saa could make difference in the january elections if the germans were not on board by early january france would move on its own to propose saa as for the ahtisaari proposals mgm said putin had told the french russia will not hesitate paris 00007755 003 of 003 to veto any solution that does not enjoy the agreement of all the stakeholders mgm urged great caution in moving forward citing putins purported concerns about the risks of partition and merging of the north with serbia and the south with albania leading potentially to radicalized muslim state in the heart of europe 11 c fried responded that the serbs and albanians had been told that kosovo would be independent and that it would be mistake to turn back perhaps the russians were bluffing but even if they were not wavering would lead to disaster beginning with riots by kosovars that risked turning kfor into an occupying force and could led to the very radicalization we had successfully avoided so far mgm said france was not advocating further delay but was nonetheless concerned that independence could have unintended consequences public opinion could change and russia might become yet more irrational in the runup to legislative and presidential elections fried agreed on the desirability of negotiating security council resolution that would be acceptable to the russians perhaps even leaving out the word independence but the west needed to be prepared in extremis to move forward without russian support russia would seize on any paralysis to try to raise the bar mgm agreed in principle but urged again finding ways to coddle russia turkeyeu 12 c during discussion cut short by summons from president chirac fried asked mgm how france planned to avoid turkeyeu train wreck mgm said france supported turkey but turkey needed to play by eu rules and fulfill its commitments it was not the eus fault that the cyprus plan had not been approved by referendum but this could not be used as an excuse for not implementing the ankara protocol it was critical that turkey start to implement the protocol through gesture mgm said that chirac and merkel had agreed on the basis of the commission proposal not to open eight chapters and not to close any other chapters but they had also agreed to insist on review of turkish implementation to serve as the basis for further eu decision in the time frame between 2007 commission report and 2009 european parliamentary elections although erdogan had told merkel not to expect any further turkish gestures mgm nonetheless hoped the turks would find way as they had so often in the past to do something at the last minute 13 c fried described the us approach of encouraging turkey to respond constructively expressed the hope that the eu would not be too onesided in its judgment of the ankara protocol implementation but reminded mgm that the eu also had not followed through on its promises which mgm hotly denied fried continued that the us wanted to be helpful but was avoiding taking public stance he reiterated that the stakes were high given turkeys strategic value 14 c this message was cleared by as fried please visit paris classified website at httpwwwstatesgovgovpeurparisindexc fm stapleton
