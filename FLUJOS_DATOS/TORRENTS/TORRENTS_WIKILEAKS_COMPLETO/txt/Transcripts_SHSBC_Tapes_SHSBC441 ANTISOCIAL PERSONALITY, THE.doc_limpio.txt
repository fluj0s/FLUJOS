the antisocial personality lecture given by l ron hubbard on the 25 august 1966 how are you today audience good fine and this is the what audience 25th of august ad 16 by george youre fight twentyfifth of august ad 16 saint hill special briefing course this article this article and lectureyou will see something of an article on this lateris not necessarily dedicated to government any particular government and it is not really dedicated to the east grinstead urban district council and i would not say that it was you see and any similarityyou know they put this on the beginning of books you seeany similarity between actual individuals and this lecture are totally accidental and the name of the lecture is the antisocial personality now i told you i would keep you advised on such ethics matters as might concern an auditor and this is one of those lectures ive sat down and ive very very carefully made up what must be complete list of all of the characteristics of suppressive person and put this together on the basis of the interrelationship between that individual and the society around him that individual and the auditor and that individual and himself and i hope you can see some benefit from this now ethics as you know has as its basic purpose getting in technology that is its primary purpose and it doesnt have any object of social betterment and it goes this far in getting in technology that if people are going to advance casewise they must do so in relatively unsuppressive environment and you cant have people advancing casewise when they are in suppressive environment and suppressives dont advance casewise so you might say ethics and the idea of suppressive persons and the idea of potential trouble sources the idea of rolly coasterwhat makes person get better and then get worse and get better and get worsethese things are all of them part and parcel to an auditors bag of tricks if an auditor doesnt know about this and doesnt pay any attention to this then he very soon breaks his heart i just had long letter from an intern here giving bunch of data on what auditing suppressivetype person had done to him personally that was interesting you seenot what it had done to the suppressive but what it had done to him well he very soon had begun to believe you see well scientology didnt really work and he wasnt getting anyplace and his ideas were wrong and that he really couldnt audit and all of these things began to creep up on him you see he was auditing somebody who was yakyakyakyakyakyak invalidate invalidate and you know had eighty thousand hours of auditing and hed never gotten any gain and so forth and he knew that his father was suppressive but had murdered his father last year andwith hot flatirons but that hadnt done him any good either so ethics didnt work and this auditor felt like gooney bird he was flopping around with goals left you see hed come up against this brick wall well if hed really known his ethics and really known what his characteristics were of suppressive persons he would have taken one look at his case assessment form as he began the pcor he wouldve done oneand the person had been eight thousand hours in auditing and had been audited in milwaukee mexico north pole and hadnt ever gotten over his sciatica and had been audited in angeles and new york but somehow or another he kept at it even though it had cost him great deal of money and hed never had any improvement particularly in his sciatica and so on but hed kept at it becausewell he just kind of wanted to show people it didnt work you know and the auditor at that moment would have exercised any hgc auditors prerogative which is simply not to audit the pc thats the least he would have done see any hgc auditor can say i dont care to audit this pc period and thats it and its been that way for many many years every once in while ds of p get enthusiastic and say well that may be the custom but here we dont really exercise that you see and kid the auditor in and get him in there pitching again actually its bad thing if he does so because its enforced help you see and so on and they wont get very good result on the pc do you know that youll get better result on pc if you simply take the auditor and run ow on him regardless of his grade of releasejust run little ow with him on that pc you ought to make it as little experiment someday if youre in an executive auditing positionyou know your lowergrade type auditorsand just run little bit of ow on the pc before they audit them pc will make marvelous gains its fantastic so the auditor in this particular case had he been able to havecall off what are the characteristics of suppressivebingbingbingbing bingwhy he wouldnt have sat there getting his anchor points punched in now its one thing to have critical pc and another thing to be trying to audit suppressive pc or pc who is potential trouble source these are quite different things the critical pcof course pc can become critical simply by having withhold or an overt on the auditor thats the first thing you check you dont sit there and take it on the chin pc was all right yesterday today he says well areare you sure youyouveyouve gotten yourever gotten classification for and so forth i never would say anythingit would astonish if i saw an auditor do otherwise than say all right is there anything being withheld have you committed thats it thats it thats it thats it yeah yeah yeah what that would just be that see well fellow would give it to you and say hmphmp and if youif the fellow just went on nattering and complaining about having been audited thousands of hours and not having gotten any case gain and not havingbeen shoved into it because of his wife and proving to her that scientology didnt work and that sort of thing i wouldnt sit there and take that not as an auditor you see impersonally i have never done anything in the universe that i owe anybody scientology see i dont owe anybody scientology thats why weve made that much progress which is remarkable fact that when you are too propitiative far far too propitiativeyou know you feel that youve been mean to people and youre trying to make it up and all of that sort of thingwhy you get into all kinds of reactive complications all kinds of them and you get so that you really cant help people but the main thing that you get into is the fact that you then do anythingyou dont do proper actions you do anything to help themand you let them get away with anything and you exert control of any kind whatsoever so you really dont have very good run in it but i never owed anybody scientology and i trust you didnt either so there isnt any reason to take knocking around one of the first pccontrol techniques there was this sounds very rough we didnt know at that time you see that it was withhold that made the person critical and the person would get choppy and refuse to do what you said and refuse to go back through it againold dianetictype auditing and the control technique was simply to get up and say well when you decide youre going to why i will come back and audit you and walk out of the room i vividly remember it that was actually in force before the official publication date of the first book so that goes way back into pc control now in view of the fact at that time i was getting my first psychoanalytictype pcsyou know pcs who had been into psychoanalysis and were now swinging in toward dianeticsand got tremendous number of failed cases tremendous number of roughedup people it was interesting you see that i in scouting around in an average level of the society was not in actual fact running into the failed psychoanalytic patient or some of the very very very rough cases that the society had i was running into and had acquaintance with some criminals and some insane and so on but not the people who had beenlet be more explicithad been roughed up by psychotherapy whose actions and behavior had been more or less confirmed or perverted by psychotherapy you see theyre special very special type of case and it was this type of case on which an auditor could easily fail that we got tremendous number of in the first foundation and they were very very hard to handle and today i would recognize pretty well what the bulk of them were they were either sps or pts but one of the things that they were pts on was of course the psychoanalyst and the psychiatrist now lets be more explicit here so that nobody gets adrift on this you all know this but ill give you the datum what we call suppressive person is person with certain behavior characteristics which we will cover here and who suppresses other people in his vicinity and those other people when he suppresses them become pts or potential trouble sources and they are called potential trouble sources because they really do make trouble they rolly coaster they natter they go up in smoke now because person is raising the devil does not make him suppressive person the suppressive may be sitting back there with covert mona lisa smile and the pts is busy going up in smoke or running around and doing weird thingspts is active pts might be going insane being put in the local asylum or something like that you havent got the source of the social difficulty youve just got the pts and this person is pts potential trouble source simply because they are intimately associated with suppressive now if you recognize that all by itself tremendous burden would come off of your auditing you would know what you were looking at joe is okay today hes gone bad tomorrow i remember notable case of this one psychoanalyst very prominent psychoanalyst in new york city very well knowni took this psychoanalyst just in demonstration and sent this psychoanalyst right straight up into seventh heaven see the psychoanalyst was in beautiful condition got rid of her schiosis or whatever else she had she felt terrific you know i just erased the secondary actually necessary to resolve her case felt fabulous shed been trying to get at this for years in psychoanalysis and couldnt she was in jungian analysis by the way and couldnt find it in having been druid anybody says to you well scientology is weird because it believes in past lives why look at them rather oddly and say arent you familiar with the subject of psychotherapy be mean you know and they say well yes oh yes im professor of uptygup you know and say well why is it that you didnt know that one of the primary branches of psychoanalysis and so forththat of professor jungbelieved implicitly in returns to druidism see were not being new at all i dont know whether its in his immediate textbooks or not but i remember this case vividly and that was what she had been jumping around in she had been jumping around trying to pretend she was painted blue living in trees in her past lives this is jung jung and adler were the principal squirrels in psychoanalysis and she just went right up to the top of the tone scale man she was in beautiful shape she stayed that way for three days and she crashed harder than anybody ive ever seen crash terrible shapesick miserable moaning around and in those days i took the psychoanalytic explanation it wasnt that we were doing psychoanalysis it was justif you understand what im talking to you about on thiswas because we accidentally were getting into psychoanalytic patients and practitioners they were moving in our direction and we used to attribute it to the fact that shed not been benefited but had just hit manic get that phrase hit manichad become manic for three days therefore one could say it was very dangerous that she was processed and all this i know today exactly what happened to her all these ages afterwards she hit an sp man and he plowed her through the wall i even know the guys name she maybe hit more than one but boy she sure went through the wall and that was simply rolly coaster betterworse there is such thing as manica person gets on an enthusiastic euphoria that life is great its just that psychiatrists hate people in that condition and so they promptly cave them in they go bow the guy says wow at last i realize i can be sane and isnt the world wonderful oh my god youre in manic weve got to give you eighteen extra shocks and transorbital leukotomies and trowohkhhr so there has arisen this thing known as manic condition which is very harmful and theres thing called euphoria which is very bad thats so if anybody says he got any benefit or did anything good why they can plow him in quick there are such conditions see the guy got better they couldnt stand it and they caved him in bang whoever was in his vicinity that was suppressive caved him in quick now when you as an auditor see that sort of thing know what youre dealing with dont be reasonable idiot youre in this field other field at all youre in the area that im talking about in this lecture you are not in some new factor which has just arisen i want to be very positive about it because if they developed such thing as manic personality to explain away somebody feeling good or getting better then they will develop this theory again and i say they i mean suppressive type psychotherapists they will develop it again and they will develop it individually for you and give you lots of reasons why it really didnt work and why the guy caved in and how its very dangerous to process somebody because this happens and this is the only mechanic of it happening now i have trouble impressing even executives in this organization every once in while theyll think well theres some other reason why person has worsened condition and the weeks go by and the weeks go by and i will repeat it several times and all of sudden they throw away the rest of them and they to their own satisfaction have isolated the fact that it is contact with suppressive which has worsened the pcs case it was not the auditor it was not the case supervisor it was not this and not that and all the other thousand things that can be blamed now you hear of somebody going along all right and then getting worse in let us say the poughkeepsie foundation see and you have tendency to say well they dont know much about auditing in the poughkeepsie foundation and so made the person worse give your fellow scientologist break he was trying tooalways dont blame the auditor dont blame the past auditor dont blame the past hgc get off of it there is only one reason it happens and maybe in this hgc there was an sp thats very doubtful but maybe there was but that isnt that hgc do you follow that was an sp suppressive person and honest please its the only reason there arent others you will hear this and hear this from pcs that come in and say well i was out in portland and they ruined out there they audited on processes they shouldnt have audited on and hes learned some patter you knowlike they overran it you know and they did this and they did that and hes learned this variouspatter line and hell give you these explanations and so forth well i know hes right there and i know hes very persuasive but please for my sake dont buy it because there isnt word of truth in it what is true is that after his case improved he encountered suppressive rolly coastered and is now actually an ethicstype pc and youve got business doing anything with him at all he belongs to the eoethics officer owned propertyand belongs to nobody else and you say well our ethics officers good and so forth because after all hes been to see the ethics officer and his case didnt immediately improve well i dont care whether his case improved or not if hes an ethicstype person hes at least off the technical lines if ethics did more than that we would all make it even those people would eventually make it do you see but as long as they stay on the lines knocking around you have in actual sober fact situation where people are in many respects caving in simply because we have let ethicstype personnel along in our lineup we put them in the technical lineup not the ethics lineup do you see and if ethics was just place to put them at least the rest of us would make it and if there was place to put them at all i assure you that we would not make it at allthat serious now i speak from the vast gold mine of experience of the first foundation never talked to you too much about the first foundation i didnt have control of this organizationjust by dint of personality and shouting and it wasnt in operation twentyfour hours before it started to squirrel right in its own internal actions people were being told that auditing was not scientific type activityauditing was not scientific type activity being told it was an art that it could not be learned that it was sort of knack you had and they were being told this by mr joe winterdoctor the late and his overt was that he and the publisher had arranged itbecause i was too hard to do business withthey had arranged it to do more agreeable book by joe winter on the subject of dianetics which would get the medical doctors interested in the subject that was his overt he didhe wrote such book it was i think doctor looks at dianetics and there were people around there galore and they were just tearing standard procedure to pieces people that i had trained just prior to that activity were actually still able to get results and people around there couldnt get results and i couldnt hold in technology because i one didnt have control of it and two didnt have ethics and we could never hold in technology until we finally got ethics so curse ethics if you want to think its terrible that here we are who owe the rest of the world our services being mean too and deplore it all you want to but realize that it has great value and if you as an auditor are in great disagreement with ethics and so forth then you must also be in disagreement with auditing people and getting gains that stay there because if you go into practice of auditing suppressive persons or continuing to audit person that you recognize as suppressive youre going to get your heart broken because he isnt about to go anyplace man thats our biggest source of losing auditors see tie into and try to audit suppressive dont recognize it and there they go and the other one is they must be able to recognize case gain and loss of case gain and recognize in those two actionsremember youve got to be able to recognize case gain before you can recognize loss of case gainand to see in those actions an ethics situation not an auditing situation its perfectly all right for the individual auditor to turn around and put on his ethics hat if he hasnt got an ethics officer closer than eighteen thousand miles or something like that why lets put on his own hat put it on himself and become the ethics officer but he has to be an ethics officer when hes an ethics officer and an auditor when hes an auditor theyre two different guises if he sees suppressive or pts situation and does not recognize them and realize what to do about them he will not last very long as an auditor or if he does his own case and progress will be completely stopped i speak the truth this is what we learned in the first foundationsdearly bought it isnt whether there are good guys in the universe and bad guys in the universe it just so happens that there are guys in the universe whoreally different than other guys if little bit weaker and stupiderare more susceptible to not being here at all and who think they are someplace else being fought by people or things that arent there either and behave like bunch of northbound horses you know and make horrible mess out of their lives because theyre fighting things that arent there for reasons that dont exist and they look like bunch of apesworse than that if you could see with an inside view the visio of an sp it would startle you half to pieces because you wouldnt know there was anything quite that gaudy he doesnt see the world around him he sees threedimensional motion picture of enemies always attacking him now once in while you have run into somebody who didnt have wall there who had picture of wall you run into these people every now and then its very funny i dont know how they even manage to walk in and out of doors but its absolutely true the wall isnt there but picture of the wall is and it frightens them half to death when you start auditing them or running reach and withdraw on walls or something like that because the wall shakes and it looks like its going to go to pieces and you think theyre going ot because they can now erase matter they didnt have wall there you see notice that the wall isnt erasing for you if the guy was ot it would now therefore this is where the universe is really mockup its really just very thin flimsy mockup of course it is mockup but to you and it has solidity now this other bird he doesnt have the wall there that you and i have he has another wall there entirely now that person isnt necessarily suppressive person this is what we call dubin using the phrase out of the motion picture industry of putting soundtrack on top of something that isnt there now that guy when he starts to run one of our contact processes gets into huge cognitions and gains because he finds out that his mockedup wall isnt the wall thats there that the wall thats there is the wall you and i see and this brings him tremendous relief well that does not make him suppressive that is not even one of the characteristics of suppressive particularly were not interested in that characteristic as suppressive characteristic all im trying to tell you about is as that wall is mockup for this person so is every one of us mockup for that suppressive we arent there in the places were standing god knows whats standing therepink alligators martians fbi agentssomething else now somebody will say well hes just taken paranoia and specialized on it and so forth as primary source of the thing and of course we know paranoia and weve always known paranoiajust dismiss the whole thing hell what they hold up and call paranoid is such mild version of what im talking about that we havent any interest in it at all paranoid simply believes people are against him sometimes people are against somebody so they say hes paranoid you see works both ways theres homicidal maniacs and so on this has nothing to do with psychiatric classification because it really mostly looks totally sane once in blue moon you get one of these boys in an institutiononce in blue moon but i really think he would look so normal to the average psychiatrist that hed be let out at once now they know that there is somebody who believes people are against him well this is not as simple definition as that it is person who is surrounded by identities which are different than those others see and others have different intentions they dont have the intentions you and i have noticed in people they have entirely different intentions this is an interesting point of view because its sort of like the fellow lives in sort of cinerama hes in cave filled with cinerama except we are the dramatic personnel when we walk in and out of his lives now you see paranoid usually is delusive he has fictional people walking in and out of his lives in that he doesnt have to have anybody walk into and out of the room to have somebody in the room do you follow in this particular case of the suppressive you really have to have somebody walking in and out of the room for him to have been confronted by one of his fictional people this is very very very hard thing for sane person to envision that somebody could go through life fooling everybody on this whole line but they exist the exact anatomy of whats wrong with their case is theyre stuck on the time track they are stuck somewhere in life in some activity where theyre in very tight spot and are being surrounded badgered tortured or injured in some way by people or group and whereby that has happened to all of the rest of us at some time or another we have moved on up the track well the suppressive never has he has never gone another inch beyond there he is there totally today is that point on the track it is always ten oclock do you see time does not move for this person to get him to run an engram is next to impossible because person has to have concept of motion on the time track in order to get from one end of an engram to another and you have to be able to go over something in order to erase it on the time track and of course this person is not about to go over anything because he is in place else but this precise pinpricked instant in time now all of us in an aberrated state can find point on the track where were quote stuck in other words we have for long time had an incident there we didnt notice before now thats not the same thing the suppressive for long time has had the world there and didnt notice see theres the difference now this person is simply in that condition there he is only hes sitting right here amongst us being revolutionary being put down by the spanish inquisition and were all priests and i dont know but i think he even sees us in robes and he says weird outofcontextish statements to us every now and then which he hastily covers up because hes also learned that he mustnt be told that hes wrong and thats his world so of course he butchers everybody now youd have to know something about the mind before you could know anything about the anatomy of suppressive that of course lets psychiatry and psychoanalysis out now let give you in rather rapid order the actual attributes one right after the other in very machinegun fashion and this is the antisocial personality ive called this thats because you in speaking of it and so on actually marry up with old technology because theyve looked for this fellow called the antisocial person for very long time freud uses the term psychologists use the term its been used for very long time they know there is such thing as an antisocial personality and this is the personality for which they were groping were calling it suppressive because its more explicit but if you were speaking of this broadly or generally why youd be very clever to say well an antisocialtype person youre on technical firm ground now this in actual fact is quite adequate as discovery of some magnitude the attributes of the antisocial personality would in psychology be an isolation study and discovery of considerable magnitude to the psychologist hed be terribly interested in this he runs into them all the time and doesnt know what hes looking at out of this by the way you could make up type of personalityanalysis test that would isolate these birds at once you would just have as many columns as i have attributes here make up gradient scale on that column see where the person is and you wouldif he rode low on the resultant graph why you had one and if he rode high why you didnt its almost worth doing but it would be of only great value if you were trying to go through firm fast and straighten it out youve got the bideawee biscuit company on your hands and in the line of organization why hes asked you as scientologistbecause the scientologists seem to be very well organized and succeedingwhat you would do well if you had personality test of this character it would be of great value to you youd just deal them out and those people that flunked them why you would set those aside and get them off the assembly belts and the firm would promptly recoverjust like that bang of course theres always the danger that its the gm anyway not if hes asking you for help and this is the first attribute this person speaks only in generalities and that is the first thing we noticed about them they never spoke in anything but generalities it wasnt henry said itever it was always everybody said it such person will get one letter in criticizing the magazine out of seven thousand avid readers and will immediately report the readers all think one instance becomes every now every human being has this tendency to some slight degree but this person pushes it home too hard any piece of bad news becomes an everybody its what the community thinks of you you see see one casual remark dropped someplace or another becomes immediately the total public opinion of england you see but its this generalitythe use of generalities to totalitythat give us the hallmark that was first noticed of suppressive they use this to pieces now it affects ptses so ptses will echo it when you hear somebody says well everybody in this community just hates scientology you know youre talking to pts or suppressiveimmediately and you dont have to further qualify it now if you want to find out if its pts its somebody told him and if its suppressive he dreamed it up and this is one of the hallmarks of an ethicstype personality and is this antisocial personality now of course it haspeople just havent been doing this since weve been around theyve been at this for long time i imagine they were busy telling nerosuch suppressive persons as he had in his vicinity would hear one whisper from one guard and immediately this became the opinion of the population of the entire empire the people of rome or all the people of the empire believe see some pishtush that was uttered by some little goose that was down in the fifth corridor whos just stubbed her toe you know and this becomes public opinion now the newspaper tries to bring about public opinion and you very often find newspapers dealing in sweeping generalities they ought to be shot for now ill show you borderline generality which you might not think is generality sometimes but 865 dead on holidaybanner headlines you see you know i think if that many people took holiday that was not the news story i think that dealt with the minority you get my point the newspapers got headline there about the people that died in accidents on this holiday which unfortunately involved some twentyseven or twentyeight million people and they speak of the eight hundred in certain way so it looks like holidays are sort of dangerous or roads are dangerous airplanes have been catching it of recent years and yet the airplane has better safety statistic than the railroad what they did was continue to carry more and more and more and more and more people you see so when they did have an accident it was very spectacular indeed but statistically and so on was less accident per passenger mile than the railroads had and is i think better statistic by far than some of the other means of transport man uses but the statistic on steamer passengers being carried and so on is very much on the decline because you dont have very many steamers carrying very many passengers anymore its not high traffic volume anymore so if one steamer went up in smoke per year they would have more casualty statistic than the entire airline history for that year do you follow passengers carriedvery small numbers newspaper doesnt bother to explain all of this but the newspaper itself is of course generality now this generality is big factor now it doesnt make person who simply says well theyre mad at inspecificallythat doesnt make him suppressive person but if hes using it to push things down your throat it rather tends to everybody at school believes youre good they allthese sweeping things connected with bad news theres great value in knowing this because the rebuttal of course is who is they what is everybodys name and the guyhes either pts and has simply just been told this and therefore he isolates it and makes him feel better or hes suppressive and is mad as the dickens because hes been trapped all right thats the first characteristic deals in generalities second characteristic such person deals mainly in bad news critical or hostile remarks invalidation and general suppression now of course we know that but did you ever know anybody who never said anything good about anybody ever well that person was suppressive theresno further qualification is necessary that person was newspaperi mean suppressive theres the hallmark of the suppressive because that is the extent of the operation in actual fact they also oo bad things to people but there certainlythere isnt anybody good anyplace anywhere you know ever and its just they deal mainly in bad news critical or hostile remarks invalidation and general suppression and thats their stock in trade now if you told this person to tell bill that you certainly appreciated his bringing you home last night that person will never so tell bill never never never relay complimentary remark never relay good news period good news does not pass it might become an outright lie the good news wont pass but it might become an outright lie and somehow or another become bad news but they will pass bad news but altered worsened number three this is the characteristic of which i was just speaking the antisocial personality alters to worsen communication when he or she relays message or news good news stopped and only bad news often embellished is passed along now that is common characteristic to that type of personality it isnt that you gave them good news or you gave them bad news this is not this now this is the other one the other one is this whatever passes through their hands is altered they alter the communication if they say its twothree anha if you said it was tuesday it becomes thursday you see theres always an alteration of communication the communication does not duplicate the communication alters now if you had this old test that they use in the army of they have whispered message passed along through dozen men you know to find out what comes out the other end well actually in the british army they commonly drill them andnot as demonstration and so forththey get them so they actually will pass on relayed communication but if you were to go down that twelve men you would find only at the outside one or two of them had altered the communication and you would have your hands on people who were either pts or suppressive the altered communication they usually worsen the gist of the communication but they certainly alter it do you get the idea thats distinct difference from the person deals in bad news see this person alters communications that flow through him and the next characteristic is fact that suppressive the antisocial personality does not respond to treatment reform or psychotherapy response now you actually never deal with the serious ones theyre running the london daily mail and things of this character theyre running the great banks of the worldthe serious suppressives theyre not theyre not in actual sober fact accessible to you theyre the insane ones i mean the insane one is not really accessible to any psychotherapy hes so batty that his close staffs normally know it but when hes moved up in position in the world and so on hes quite able to make this the normmakes this the normal circumstance of existence you see he would shoot at you only i mean the real bad one it isnt that you wont get one in the auditing chair but the real bad onehe really never does come and sit down in the auditing chair do you understand and he and the people he influences are the only people on the planet who wont so hes not open to being audited im finding it little bit hard to make the point because you say case gain and so forth this sort of thing yes that is the characteristic but i just wanted to point out to you that you dont get this guy in the auditing chairthe worst ones you dont get him in the auditing chair at all hes back there screaming someplace about you but he would never come in and sit down in the auditing chair so we of course knowing enough about the mind can sandblast these people and blow them up with power processes used in various ways and we could blast through with cchs and somehow or another we could undoubtedly do something for themif we had to but thats today thats today and its only because we know the anatomy of what they consist of and we know the rest of these things we could do something for them today but it would take very very very heavy teamwork it would take an organization and it would take one preferably who had an institutional access to really take on this line of country and what this is meant by is that the person who comes along who hasnt been helped by auditingwell we can modify that and say well if he hasnt been helped by lowergrade auditing if he hasnt been helped by the usual or ordinary approaches of auditing and so on then that person is an sp so we can say that he isnt benefited by psychotherapy because were not in that business he does not respond to treatment that is for sure he does not reform that is for sure and the psychoanalyst never came within thousand miles of him and the psychologist doesnt even recognize him let give you that characteristic again he does not respond to treatment or reform or psychotherapy response change now if you say auditingthen auditing is not psychotherapy and is not normal human activity at allbut he wont respond to the lower forms of auditing he wont respond to grade auditing up to let us say iv now very skilled auditor in an organization and so forth can undoubtedly take these people and blast them to pieces if he could get them to stand still but if you started picking up every one there was you would need an institution its not that this fellow has acted insane in the society its the fact that he would go insane the instant anybody looked like he was going to do anything to him mentally the one thing this fellow cant do is confront his own mind now recognize that as one of the motivations of his activities with regard to scientology he does not dare confront his own mind he would go into trembling fits he would go into piercing screams that they would have to put him in padded cell for years if he took one tiny little look at his own mind you understand and thats why you when you come along and you say were going to audit people were going to process people and were going to do something with the mind thats why these guys go mad you follow it theyre right up there to the heads of states saying youve got to shoot these people youve got to kill these people youve got to do something about these people auhhhhr you know they talk sanely like that and of course state that would listen to them has that type of person in charge of it i wouldnt mention any namesbolkey down in victoria smith rhodesia i dont want to get any libelous remarks out here so ill simply deal in truth you got the idea the second they deal in their mind those spooks that they carry with them all the time move slightly and they just go zyaahhhhhhh so it isnt what youre doing youre just wasting your time to explain to these people that youre not doing anything bad all youre doing is helping people with their minds its the thought that anything has anything to do with the mind of any kind whatsoever that drives them into screaming terror thats the kind of nut in the back of this newspaper chain up here they got one like this on the east grinstead town and country planning committee recognize what youre dealing with dont be reasonable you cant talk to these fellows about psychotherapy or about the mind or reason with them in any way the second youve lifted the tiniest curtain of the subject theyve gone into irrational screaming fits they would want nothing less than your execution and your crime is not what they say your crime is your crime is the fact that you have almost made them confront something that they cannot and do not dare confront and youve almost exposed them because theysee theyre not under good control and they recognize that if they lose control they will undoubtedly be put away they know theyre that close to insane and thats why they get mad at you particularly now that was the fourth characteristic and the fifth characteristic is surrounding such personality we find cowed or ill associates or friends who when not actually driven insane are yet behaving in crippled manner in life failing and not succeeding the people in this persons vicinity just fail you say well theres family and they always had bad luck you know they lost boy and then the other one flunked in school the other ones in prison andand so forth then there was jessie ann and jessie ann of course well shes been in the insane asylum for some time and family looks awfully unlucky get smart this family isnt unlucky this family has got suppressive in the middle of it now they make trouble for others now when you try to treat those people in the vicinity of the suppressiveand heres whats very importantthey dont recover they get little bit better and they get worse and they get little bit better and they get worse and then they really get worse and then when it looks like theyre really going to recover then they die suppressive couldnt stand that he just wiped them out then this is what youre up against you have broad familial pattern of sickness or something like that and you dont do anything ethicswise about it and so on why youre not going to get any success on any member of that group unless you handle it from an ethics viewpoint therefore if you didnt know that you could make an awful bust out of processing people when you have group of people who are commonly rolly coaster bunch or kind of sick and unlucky and all that sort of thing and you dont suspect theres suppressive in amongst them and that theyre all pts and that youve got some other explanation like they lived in the swamps and of course they were fever stricken i dont know who the hell was making them live in the swamps and number six is something which is saving grace the antisocial personality habitually selects the wrong targethabitually theyre always selecting the wrong target now this isbecomes very funny if tire went flat they would blame their companion but they wouldnt connect it on the basis that the tire went flat the tire went flat so they got mad at their companion now you say well thats human characteristic well human beings do tend to get mad at the things around what theyre mad at and so on but this would be on the basis of disassociate the tire is flat now being mad at the companion has nothing whatsoever to do with the tire being flat and itd go to point of the icebox is making dreadful racket in the kitchensee ratatattat and so onso they go upstairs and fix the pipes in the attic to the hot water system and you very often will see these people and you consider that they are ineffectual on the job theyre ineffectual on the job that if they did notice anything was wrong they would fix something else if they were served notice by the salivation army they would go down and report to the jailhouse or something they can never quite figure out where what was which see and this goes in reverse if they want to straighten out something in the society then they will attack the people who arent doing it when you get government going like this you know exactly what youre dealing with for instance were not messing up the insane the psychiatrists are theyre attacking us see and theyre not attacking the psychiatrist do you see you get the tremendous gap there its wrong target situation but theyll get enthusiastic on wrong target the like of which you never heard of this isnt defensive as far as we are concerned this is just remarkable because its saving grace because they attack wrong target they dont succeed very well that means theyre ineffectual theyre kind of goony and you neednt be anywhere near as afraid of them as people have become because theres that one factthat one factthat sixth characteristic wrong target you can absolutely count on it when youve got suppressive general and hes got ridge that has to be cleaned out and so forth why he sends all of his troops into the valley if he has to to win the battle knock out all the artillery emplacements and so on why he will have the enemys water supplies polluted its as wrong target as that if he should shoot at he shoots at b and you will see this person as awell as woman in the middle of family something like that she will spot the wrong reasons for things and then settle these wrong reasons and it gets pretty goony if you listen to it after while well lets see bill failed at college and you expect some remarktherefore we wont send pete to college we will send them something else you know we should go on diet theres disassociation involved in these things which is sometimes hard to catch because you dont catch it to what was going on but you get them lined up but you watch for this wrong target but it serves you in very good stead because hell never attack the right thing and heres another saving grace in dealing with these people they dont complete cycles of action if they start to put an apple on shelf it will only get halfway there thats for sure if they start war in zanzibar it wont be completed that incomplete cycle of actionthats just total dramatization they didnt ever complete those cycles of action if they completed one theyd find it out then they would redo it they mustnt arrive and they dont arrive and this is because their time sense is loused up they dont have ideas of consecutive events and so they dont therefore complete cycles of action these by the way are all empirical these are not theoretical i didnt tell you that these are not just theoretical extrapolations where i sat down and figured out what would be this personality and so on this winnows out just thousands and thousands of hours of observation shaking down the common characteristics the characteristics these people have in common these things are not necessarily themselves associated with one another these are just things that you know that these were the characteristics which were common to all of them there are lot of other characteristics that you could equally apply you see but you wouldnt necessarily they arent necessarily common to all these suppressives some have them some dont and this is empiricalthat is to say picked up by actual observation and experience in life and thats one of the wildest things to watch you ever had anything to do with is cant finish cycle of action you watch suppressive trying to finish cycle of action and so on he changes his mind and goes over on wrong target theyll shift between wrong target and cycle of action you see they start to finish cycle of action why then they will shift the target to something else therell be some reason why they cant finish that cycle of action theyve got to do something else and you justsuddenly youll look at them and you say hey that hasnt got anything whatsoever to do with what you were doing and you dont have to do that in order to do something else and they just know youre wrong man now number eight many antisocial persons will freely confess to the most alarming crimeswhen forced to do so will have faintest sense of responsibility for them that is when such person does confess to crimes you will find out oh yes i killed the baby yes yes yes i murdered all the policemen you know bluhuhbluuh bluh bluh and you say well what was the baby doing to you you had to blow its head off with 45 well i really dont know dont know very sorry for it yep you got any more babies to shoot you know sense of responsibility at all they drive you mad they drive policeman mad when they try to interrogate such fellows and so on the fellow will confess to all the crimes under the sun you know and reformers go mad on this you know because after the fellows confessed to all these crimes he says so what the idea of crime iswell you think theyre crime he doesnt they dont have any classification of behavior different types of behaviorthat theres such thing as good behavior and bad behavior nice behavior and pleasant behavior there arent different types of behavior and they certainly take responsibility for some of the wildest crimes and this is one thing that shows up and when you hear this boybecause maybe the guy has fooled you right up to that point see you hear about how he murdered his wife and corrupted all of his family and hes sitting there hes got pleasant smile on his face and so on oooh hey wait minute that is suppressive characteristic and youll find the rest of the details then unobserved before will now start to fill in responsibility for committed acts that sort of thing happens it can go off into any branch of crime by the way it isnt one type of crime or another type of crime or one type of behavior or another type of behavior its interesting that they explain kleptomania by the hand wandered over and took something and put it in the pocket and they stand back and watch the hand detachedly do this its marvelous yes well they took all of the money out of the cash register yes yes yes yes and if you pin it down why what they actually did was observe their hands take the money out of the cash register and put it in their pockets and they did so with little bit of surprise and maybe even faint feeling of reproof like their hand shouldnt be doing that but they dont have anything to do with it its marvelous now the antisocial personality supports only destructive groups and rages against and attacks any constructive or betterment group if you knew person was suppressive and so on you could forecast at once what his reaction would be to decent group or to criminal group and if you had one for instance in parliament or congress and you wanted to know what type of group they would try to legislate against you could pick it up like that because any group that is betterment group they will legislate against and riotssmiots so theyre all rioting and killing each other out in cleveland well thats reason to do anything about the i will arise society in cleveland but you say the police department there in clevelandyou say that they were attempting to preserve property and so forth well shoot them do you get the idea and that there were some ministers around and that they were actually counseling moderate action and so forth well well have them investigated its reverse its the negative of the positive its what you would have normally been led to expect as law and order they will reverse you know you support the rioters and you attack the people who are trying to prevent riots you know you support the wage earners and you put the bums into the millionaire class if you possibly can see you reward down statistics we would put it consistently and continuously now regardless of the group character of the actions which are approved by this type of personality are destructive actions well it was good thinghe walked in and blew his head off with shotgun and that was bad thingshe made cake and gave it to the kids so that if you have good action and person approves of it hes probably not suppressive but if hea person seems to be disapproving all the time good actions you cant quite figure out what this is all about well dont be so far adrift youre talking to suppressive these goodbad actionsyou know these actions well it was probably good thing that the atom bomb hit hiroshima because now theyve been able to tillthe war was good thing because the scientists were able to invent so many new things whats that you know well what that is is suppression its the approval of destructive action and the inhibition of constructive actions now they by the way will attach themselves to constructive people to try to smash them they will go that far you find it in hollywood boy oh boy man if you ever started to clean out hollywood youd have ball and the eleventh one helping others is an activity which drives the antisocial personality nearly berserk activities however which destroy in the name of help are closely supported really anything that helps somebody is bad and things that dont help are good but if youve got real mixedup mess whereby youve got the witch doctors are uniformly killing off all the villagers but making big play out of what good thing this is why theyll support those witch doctors down to their last penny and ounce of energy yeah those guys are great see the idea is to get rid of everybody you can more or less extrapolate these characteristics if everybody became miserable then you could get rid of them all and they would all disappear and then theyd all die and this fellow would then be safe you see well that works out fine except the people around him arent the people who are around him so of course it wont work out ever and then the last one the antisocial personality has bad sense of property and conceives that the idea that anyone owns anything is pretense made up to fool people nothing is ever really owned and you listen to these guys sometimes they really just pretend that people own things and so on you watch that characteristic it becomes almost pathetically amusing the reason they took the car and smashed it up and the reason they smashed your car up is because it isnt your can you bought it and paid for it and sweat yourself to pieces paying for the thing and youve safeguarded it and taken care of it and so on but its not your can youre just pretending that its your can now you could say that there could be two or three more and you could say that it is tremendous feeling of importance or dominance and so forth had to do with this well now theyve assigned those characteristics to the paranoid personality but they do not belong that fact that some guy thinks hes terribly important and another guy thinks hes unimportant and so forth has nothing whatsoever to do with suppression its another characteristic of the personality and some guys are rather ridiculous on the subject of importance but if you ever really want to see important blokes why go down and talk to some ditch diggers or some charladies or something like that now they are very important people and you think these people because of their station in life would think of themselves as unimportant people well it goes almost inversely that the lower down fellow is the more he has to assert his importance if you ever want to see somebody bridle about importance you want to take somebody who is not really very important and then he becomes very important as far as dominance is concerned they have dominance in the society totally mixed up with suppression theres nothing wrong with dominance when i say theres nothing right wrong otherwiseits just dominance is dominance you know george dominates his business he dominates his family or she dominates something or otherso what see its what do they do with this domination that counts that they dominate has nothing to do with anything do you follow now though person thinks hes important or doesnt think hes importanttheyve assigned that as characteristics of paranoia and i have seen some people who did think they were outrageously importantfantasticand harped on it all the time but that was just crazy psychosis in the middle of it you wont find that all suppressives conceive they are important its not common denominator so there are many other characteristics which you will find in this field but i do not think that you will find them as common denominators ive just given you dozen common denominators by which they can be recognized these will hold true now on top of these there will be all kinds of wild idiosyncrasieswild idiosyncrasies odd differences personal quirks and peculiarities youll find these things galore but they dont hold across the boards dont think when youve met one who thinks that he has to have green hat on all the time and hed be safe then that all sps have to have green hats because they dont this was this peculiar sp but the other dozen characteristics which ive just given you i think you will find hold pretty true throughout any and all of these suppressives now you watch these things and youll they are things by the way which are very startling to auditors he gets some overts off this guy and this guy has robbed his little brothers piggy bank and hit his sister on the head with hammer and hes just sitting there you know talking wife owns some property and so he lost it in gambling game shes been destitute ever since he left her in omaha you look for some reaction on this meter see you look for this guy to cognite you look for something to happen youve gotten fantastic overts off this guy and youre getting tone arm action either well the pathetic part of it is the overts probably arent even true hes probably just trying to horrify you he might have done them he might not have done them but if he did do them he had responsibility for them you watch these kind of things so you should know those various characteristics see you should know what they consist of and if you know them as common denominators when you see one of them this doesnt prove too much until youve got it married up with two or three more now you know and you say ahhhh ahhhh ahhhh wonder josie ann rolly coasters all the time you see look at this guy pete you know whatever it is anyhow an auditors skills depend upon his recognition of the situation he is auditing and when you have some isolated series of characteristics which give you certain expectancy they become valuable and if you have dozen characteristics which when you have perceived them in pc and which when they add up to several others of these characteristics of the dozenyou now know what to predict youre going to predict case gain youre going to predict catastrophe youre going to predict total mess in all directions and somewhere along this line you better unload because you are auditing an ethicstype case and you got business doing it when you see somebody rolly coasterthey felt good and then they felt badyou say well scientology has harmed them scientology didnt harm them but by being audited they attracted the notice of suppressive who then proceeded to cave them in fast and you do an sd on somebody and find the wrong suppressive why the pyoull get rolly coastera search and discoveryyoull get rolly coaster youll get person worsening but also remember the situation can occur that you did perfectly good sd and then one week later they met another sp see that condition could exist also well i hope that this will be of some service to you its gruesome subject i hate to run this type of thing into your lap but i would rather tell you than have you find it out in an auditing chair i think maybe it would be of some service to you now there will be an article published on this particular subject but you should know these twelve characteristics thank you very much
