chinas space program options for uschina cooperation jeffrey logan specialist in energy policy resources science and industry division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22777 china has determined yet still modest program of civilian space activities planned for the next decade the potential for uschina cooperation in space an issue of interest to congress has become more controversial since the january 2007 chinese antisatellite test the test reinforced concerns about chinese intentions in outer space and jeopardized space assets of more than two dozen countries by creating large cloud of orbital space debris some argue that chinese capabilities now threaten us space assets in low earth orbit others stress the need to expand dialogue with china this report outlines recent activities and future plans in chinas civilian space sector it also discusses benefits and tradeoffs of possible uschina collaboration in space as well as several options to improve space relations including information exchange policy dialogue and joint activities for more information see crs report rs21641 chinas space program an overview by marcia s smith introduction china has made clear advances in space capabilities over the past decade the country has launched over 100 orbital missions since 1970 including string of 50 consecutive successful long march rocket launches from 1996 to 2006 after overcoming technical problems with the help of us companies in the mid1990s1 china sent humans into space in 2003 and 2005 and orbited lunar explorer in october 2007 that is paving the way for additional moon exploration china is now world leader in yearly space launches yet remains notably less active than russia or the united states as shown in table 1 chinas space program was initially

commission of science technology and industry for national defense the pla continues to play role in chinas overall space activities managing both manned civilian and military efforts while cnsa handles unmanned scientific projects and international collaboration chinas space activities and intentions are not transparent the dualuse nature of most space technology compounds the uncertainties

subservient to domestic social and economic development goals which include national security2 china has been strong proponent of an arms control regime in space and has argued for the peaceful use of outer space in the united nations conference on disarmament and at the prevention of an arms race in outer space dialogue some claim that china takes this stand in order to prevent further progress by the united states in space while allowing it to covertly catch up3 chinas spending on space is growing although details are often not available the cnsa reports to have budget about onetenth the size of nasas4 western experts estimate chinese space spending at 1422 billion per year on par with france and japan5 chinese budget opacity the dualuse nature of most space technology and currency conversion difficulties make direct comparisons uncertain china collaborates with other countries on civilian space activities but it is not considered key member of the international space community6 currently china collaborates with russia the european union eu brazil canada nigeria and others the russian partnership is probably the most active and has benefitted chinas manned space effort

euled galileo satellite positioning system but progress on this has been slow and sometimes controversial competition in space also exists among china india japan and south korea although there may be military implications to this competition each country seems more focused on building national pride by displaying technology prowess chinas human space flight program chinas program to launch humans into space began earnestly in 1992 and is designated as project 921 china has apparently chosen the more expensive route of sending humans into space over machines for the wider attention it attracts both domestically and internationally manned program builds greater national prestige an increasingly important political benefit in china and by drawing international attention to the countrys technical capabilities china has made steady although unremarkable progress in its human space schedule compared to the us apollo and soviet soyez programs of the 1960s and 1970s chinas shenzhou effort is far more modest7 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22777 project 921 is divided into three phases phase i included the first five shenzhou flights culminating in chinas first human spaceflight on october 15 2003 phase ii began with shenzhou 6 which flew two chinese taikonauts8 on fiveday mission starting on october 12 2005 shenzhou 7 was threeday mission starting on september 24 2008 and built experience with extravehicular activities shenzhou 8 9 and 10 are scheduled for 20092010 and will attempt to establish space laboratory module with docking capability shenzhou 9 will test docking procedures with the module delivered by shenzhou 8 and shenzhou 10 will carry crew to the module phase iii is less well developed but includes establishing permanent space station china claims that it has not set date for development of the station9 the shenzhou modules have been designed to dock at the international space station if that becomes politically feasible in the future chinas lunar exploration activities and beyond on october 24 2007 china successfully launched change 1 the countrys first lunar probe approximately 14 days later the probe entered final orbit around the moon china became the fourth country to orbit satellite around the moon japan became the third only weeks before china orbiting 200 kilometers 124 miles above the surface chinas explorer uses stereo cameras and xray spectrometers to map three dimensional images of the lunar surface one goal of the mission is to begin mapping potential lunar resources that could some day be used by chinese industry china plans to send change 2 equipped with robotic lunar rover to the moon around 2012 approximately five years later change 3 is scheduled to send another rover to collect samples that will be 7 steve

commence but china denies that it has timetable for this effort11 china also has plans to explore mars and the outer solar system and is discussing collaboration with russia to do so these plans are more vague and uncertain than program 921 and the lunar exploration uschina space cooperation china and the united states have limited history of both civilian and military collaboration in space china has publicly pushed for more dialogue and joint activities mistrust of chinese space intentions grew in the mid1990s when us companies were accused of transferring potentially sensitive military information to china12 since then cooperation has stagnated often roiled by larger economic political and security frictions in the uschina relationship in september 2006 nasa administrator michael griffin visited his chinese counterpart laiyan sun in china he couched the visit as get acquainted opportunity httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22777 rather than the start of any serious cooperation in order to keep expectations low followon activities were announced after the trip although the chinese issued four point proposal for ongoing dialogue between the two organizations that stressed annual exchanges and confidence building measures13 on january 11 2007 china conducted its first successful antisatellite asat weapons test destroying one of its inactive weather satellites14 advance notice of the test was given nor has china yet explained convincingly the intentions of the test15 the international community condemned the test as an irresponsible act because it polluted that orbital slot with thousands of pieces of debris that will threaten the space assets of more than two dozen countries including chinas for years understanding the nuances of chinas intent in conducting the test is important but remains open to interpretation how was the decision made to conduct test that would contradict beijings publiclyheld position on the peaceful use of outer space and that would almost certainly incur international condemnation some speculate that the united 10 launch dates for change 2 and 3 may depend on development of the new heavylift long march 5 booster rocket and the launch facility under construction on hainan island 11 china has timetable for manned moon landing xinhua october 25 2007 12 crs report 98485 china possible missile technology transfers under us satellite

report rs22652 chinas antisatellite weapons test by shirley kan 15 in march 2007 press conference premier wen jiabao reiterated that the test was not directed against any one country and that chinas position on the peaceful use of outer space remained unchanged premier wen jiabaos press conference ministry of foreign affairs of the peoples republic of china march 17 2007 crs5 states unilateral positions encouraged china to conduct the test to demonstrate that it could not be ignored16 in particular the us national space policy issued in september 2006 declares that the united states would deny if necessary adversaries the use of space capabilities hostile to us national interests17 given chinas apparent commitment to space the growing us dependence on space for security and military use and chinese concerns over taiwan the asat test may have been demonstration of strategic chinese deterrence18 others saw more nefarious display of chinas space capabilities and sign that china has more ambitious objectives in space19 still others speculate that the engineers running chinas asat program simply wanted to verify the technology that they had spent decades developing and significantly underestimated the international outrage the test provoked20 the chinese asat test seemed to derail any movement to build on the meeting between nasa and cnsa some believe that chinas asat test will continue to dampen momentum that might have been building for the two countries to expand cooperation while others argue that it is pressing reason to boost dialogue21 challenges of cooperating with china some of the most important httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22777 challenges of expanding cooperation in space with china include inadvertent technology transfer from this perspective increased space cooperation with china should be avoided until chinese intentions are clearer joint space activities could lead to more rapid dualuse technology transfer to china and in worstcase scenario result in space pearl harbor as postulated by congressionally appointed commission led by donald rumsfeld in 200122 moral compromise china is widely criticized for its record on human rights and nondemocratic governance any collaboration that improves the standing of authoritarian chinese leaders might thus be viewed as unacceptable 16 william j broad and david sanger flexing muscle china

collaboration will not produce tangible benefits for the united states especially without new bilateral political climate23 benefits of cooperating with china the potential benefits of expanded cooperation and dialogue with china include improved transparency regular meetings could help the two nations understand each others intentions more clearly currently there is mutual uncertainty and mistrust over space goals resulting in the need for worstcase planning offsetting the need for chinas unilateral development collaborating with china instead of isolating it may keep the country dependent on us technology rather than forcing it to develop technologies alone this can give the united states leverage in other areas of the relationship cost savings china now has the economic standing to support joint httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22777 space cooperation costsharing of joint projects could help nasa achieve its challenging work load in the near future some have argued that us space commerce has suffered from the attempt to isolate china while doing little to keep sensitive technology out of china options for possible cooperation information and data sharing confidence building measures cbms such as information exchange on debris management environmental and meteorological conditions and navigation are widely considered an effective first step in building trust in sensitive relationship nasa has done some of this with cnsa in the past but more is possible space policy dialogue another area of potential exchange could begin with strategic communication24 an attempt for each side to more accurately understand the others views concerns and intentions dialogue on rules of the road code of conduct or even select military issues could be included joint activities this type of cooperation is more complex and would probably require strong political commitments and confidence building measures in advance bi and multilateral partnerships on the international space station lunar missions environmental observation or solar system exploration are potential options joint ussoviet space docking exercise in 1975 achieved important technical and
