from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk to gary funkhouser garyltrrarizonaedu subject re russian data date tue sep 17 164228 1996 gary its great to hear from you the stuff you are doing is very interesting to say the least from the details you give the precip stuff looks the more relevant for the holocene though i note that you dont have manuscript yet the other stuff is of course interesting but i would have to see it and the board would want the larger implications of the stats clearly phrased in general and widely understandable by the ignorant masses terms before they would consider it not too specialised i suspect that this might not be straight forward are you not being in the time honoured don graybill fashion too demanding of the response function results when you say deriving transfer function is not justified we all strive for perfection but does it exist seriously it would be easier as regards publication policy to get the editor to accept reconstructionreconstruction based paper than one describing chronology inferences i dont know whether this is any use but i hope youll send us something i also hope life going ok for you these days i cant see getting to tucson for some considerable time and i dont suppose you have any plans for cruising this way so ill see you when i see you keep in touch and let know what you you decide the best to you keith at 1644 110996 0700 you wrote keith hows it going ive been working on some of the data that don collected with shiyatov mazepa and vaganov in the late 80s and i was wondering if you thought any of it might be appropriate for the holocene or if you have any ideas about where we could go with it i already have fair draft dealing with the kyrgyzstan juniper chronologies although i wasnt able to get any climatic reconstructions out of it the material has some interesting properties similar to some of our longlived trees in the southwest us for example autocorrelation in the series increases as direct function of stand elevation there is shift from high to low frequency variation with increasing elevation and the intercorrelation among the highest elevation stands is greater than that for the lower stands maybe this means that the lower altitude sites are responding to more local conditions precipitation while the higher stands are responding to more regional temperature signal response function analyses with the indices may suggest this but again its not strong enough to justify developing transfer function the draft is about 2500 words plus figures and tables stepan hasnt seen it yet but i cant imagine that he will change it very much i know that valeri didnt find any great climate responses either there are also 12 chronologies from central and southern siberia some which are pretty close to jacobys mongolian sites i was able to build 3 precipitation reconstructions one has about 50 explained variance for may june season i havent composed draft yet and although gordons dealing with temperature couple of the chronologies are of comparable length and i want to look at our low frequency variation relative to his jeff dean and i are headed to the white mountains this friday for little 5day collection trip thanks for your time keith cheers gary gary funkhouser lab of treering research the university of arizona tucson arizona 85721 usa phone 520 6212946 fax 520 6218229 email garyltrrarizonaedu
