again their memories and the sounds of their cry will forever not be in vain the access to justice project team consisting of paralegals and community volunteers was instrumental in tracking and making it possible for oscar foundation to document the various cases that we have here in illustrated lastly this report is dedicated to the missing persons their relatives and all those kenyans who

impunity police ineptness in investigating cases of extrajudicial execution abductions arbitrary arrests and disappearances perpetuated by law enforcement agents the failure of the police to investigate all complaints against police abuse documented in kenya over period of eight months as well as subsequent surveys conducted by the oscar foundation free legal aid clinickenya offlack in kenya where abductions disappearances and related abuse have occurred is direct conspiracy to undermine the rule of law and human rights under principles of international law it is incumbent upon governments to investigate when patterns of disappearances are committed by law enforcement agents these acts of systematic and widespread abductions amount to crime against humanity under both national and international law the failure of the government of kenya to prosecute the perpetrators regardless of their status and standing constitute to culture of impunity the declaration on enforced disappearances reaffirms this principle known as universal jurisdiction providing that all states should take any lawful and appropriate action available to them to bring to justice all persons presumed responsible for an act of enforced disappearance which are found to be in their jurisdiction or under their control the oscar foundation takes exception to the current systematic and widespread abductions committed by both private militia and law enforcement agents its on this background that this report dubbed the veil of impunity seeks to document all cases of abductions and enforced disappearances as they occur and hold the government accountable of particular concern to kenyans and wellwishers is the behavior of the leaders serving under the current regime it will be remembered at the height of the well coordinated execution of tens of young people in and around the central kenya rift valley and nairobi that the minister for internal security honorable john michuki obviously acting at the behest of collective cabinet decision and other state machineries issued fiery and not well thought out but surely meant statement calling for execution in cold blood of young people from particular ethnic community previously himself having fallen victim to an attempted break in in his rural home in central kenya and the dare devil killing of his area assistant chief in his rural neighborhood obviously the minister was emotionally charged and not rational in his attempt to demonstrate the government capacity for brute force that young people had been killed before without the state raising as much as finger other than issuing mere calls for peace and tolerance shows that the minister s actions were prompted by threat on his life and not the common security good of all kenyans young or old this further depicts the current administration s selfishness and selective application of state resources including power to protect all and sundry regrettably majority of those killed during the massacre that was characterized by ritualistic beheadings and skinning of the torso were young people in the informal matatu industry still they are the same ones being targeted in the current clump down obviously victims of the double edged sword of injustice the events of recent past where thousands of young people have mysteriously disappeared never to be found dead or alive or executed in cold blood and their bodies found dumped and often mauled by wild animals in various locations point to the arrogance vengeance and dishonesty with which the so called operation squads such as kwekwe scorpion spider and rhino squads are carrying out the mandate of their license to kill with both ethnic and generation bias and impunity according to documented complaints received at the oscar foundation offices over 8000 young people from central kenya nairobi and part of rift valley are reported to have disappeared or been executed reports are also emerging that there are mass graves scattered all over the country particularly in karura forest kitengala nairobi national park and ngong forest where most of the missing are believed to have been secretly buried after execution in cold blood in kenya there are courts and judicial regime competent to try criminal suspects however events of the recent past points to the lack of confidence in our judiciary by the government to uphold the rule of law and director s statemento f f l c k v i l f i m p u n i t x c u t i n n d d i s p p r n c w h i s g u i l t 2 0 0 8 promote the corrective role of the penal institutions and other law enforcement agencies in the promotion and protection of human rights and the eradication of systematic abuses the church has played fundamental role in the democratization process in kenya since independence however this role has been perceived to have failed the test of time in the months preceding the 2005 referendum the church negated its noble principle of offering divine guidance to the faithful on political and social decisions led by former archbishop of the catholic church in nairobi ndingi mwana anzeki the church supported the referendum and also voiced its support for the clause seeking to retain the controversial death penalty as provided for in the proposed draft constitution the supkem also was split over the support of controversial political discussions including the referendum and the debt on death sentence in the wake of systematic executions and other human rights violations perpetuated by state faith based organizations remained silent in condemning the vise raising pubic opinion against the faith groups the role of the faith groups in promoting democracy and free society has failed to impress upon the status quo allowing pattern of selective and systematic violations although the muslim community has maintained its stand against the controversial anti terrorism bill it has remained silent as the government steps up its crack down on young muslims suspected to have taken part in terror activities the government has repatriated young muslims to foreign countries where they have been subjected to torture and other human rights violations the double standard the faith based organization have demonstrated in regard to the right to life is questionable as they only open their mouth against abortion and remain silent when tens of thousand of young men are executed by the state without due process if life start from conception when our youth are being executed then where is the church at this critical time truly the faith based organization is in cross road at the sanctity of life and should end the hypocrisy the church out cry against the reproductive health bill 2008 is unjustified and laughable inspite of foreign invasion blatant arrogant and violation of the sovereignty of our nation the faith based organization has failed the test of time to seek divine intervention and petition the government against rendition of its own citizenry the current state of hopelessness and targeted harassment of the muslims to pledge for the return of those repatriated politically the president seeks to gain political clout and lure the muslim votes against deteriorating human rights discourse political manipulation and deceptiveness displayed by the president is indicative of failed democracy and government that has failed to protect the sovereignty of its citizens the faith based organization currently preach on success theology based on thanks giving seed planting tithes and blessings but in fear of offending their flock the fail to preach righteousness as advocated in 2 timothy 316 this scenario has made many to view the church as business entities out to make kill in the name of yahweh and the almighty allah the kibakiraila administration continues plotting against the youths the new ge neration on the other hand personified by u ncompromising activists in the elective offices who include young turks in the academics the clergy business executives and professionals is unshackled by the colonial and post colonial politics it is well educated well grounded in political and economic issues highly informed and critical on contemporary affairs it is generation that is obviously disappointedwith the politics of compromise and appeasement practiced by their elders during the moi era and the arr ogance of power demonstrated during kenyattas and now kibakis period the generation is unwilling to compromise on the principles of democracy good governance accountability and human rights this generation feels that change is not the departure of the present incumbents or their replacement by selfinterested parties true change is total overhaul of four decades of intolerant system and replacement with culture of democratically empowered civil society institutions and one governed by the rule of law the rising culture of militarism amongst the youth as demonstrated during post elections violence school riots and consequent destruction properties and lose of life the action of disgruntled farmers to uproot and destroy tea plantation hyped industrial actions and activism in prisons and the police force that almost led to mutiny is clear indication that not only has the ruling class lost touch with the reality of the people just like during times preceding the french revolution but also exemplifies time bomb which if not diffused has the f f l c k v i l f i m p u n i t x c u t i n n d d i s p p r n c w h i s g u i l t 2 0 0 8

different methodology aimed at mediation and constructive engagement was used as opposed to use of brute force and suppression to diffuse their potency and scuttle their militarism that they have grown immune to death disappearances detention and exile of their colleagues and their loved ones mean that they have been hardened and know best what to expect if they hit back they hit back with equally brute force and the bitterness of vengeance which might leave the country blind and deteriorate into class and intergeneration war most sincerely kamau kingara executive director oscar foundation dedicationthis report is dedicated to all victims and survivors of police abuse who despite the pain and suffering that they have endured they still live with hope this work has been published with generous financial support from the offlackuk and usa executive summaryarbitrary arrests extrajudicial execution abductions and disappearances involving the youth continue to occur in kenya eight months after the two protagonists signed peace accord ending thirty days of postelection violence and widespread police brutality in recent report the oscar foundation described the disappearances as systematic and widespread and being perpetuated by both the police and organized gangs against specific youth groups1 the oscar foundation affirms that the pattern and trend of disappearances constitute crimes that are punishable under both international and national law and they need to be investigated the government should adopt resolution condemning disappearances and acts of extrajudicial executions in kenya and should disband all criminal squads operating within the police force in 2007 the commissioner of police established the kwekwe squad to suppress the youth the group is notorious for its acts of staged abductions and executions of innocent youths which occur with impunity the culture of impunity in kenya pause fundamental human rights question impunity constitutes crime against humanity that requires urgent international and national intervention to stop its widespread the coalition government has gone to great lengths to conceal evidence implicating both the police army and military forces in cases of abductions and related human rights violations2 despite efforts to investigate and document cases of disappearances pursuant to international law the government on numerous occasions trash human rights reports without authenticating the allegations detailed therein it is on record that the police spokesman has unwittingly come up with weird suggestions aimed at defending the force even when evidence is to the contrary this outright time bomb report of the oscar foundation free legal aidkenya offlack on disappearances of

that the findings are not factual clearly points to scheme of cover up in the past eight months evidence has shown sign of abating the crisis rather it has increasingly spread to other parts of the country with new cases of disappearances reported in mt elgon during joint police and military operation to wipe out the sldf militia from the area the government contends that its operations in mt elgon was direct responsibility of its security forces to provide security and stamp out organized criminal gangs despite being accused of human rights violations committed by the kenya armed forces against innocent civilians this acts of extrajudicial executions disappearances and wide spread abductions are reinforced under climate of impunity that the government continues to supervise these acts have not only brought untold suffering to hundred of thousands of civilians but also undermined peace and tranquility law enforcement agents noticeably the police continue to commit unspeakable acts of state sponsored terrorism against the youth kenyas armed forces and military forces together with elite crimes prevention units within the police continue to account for numerous crimes against civilians including extrajudicial executions torture rape arbitrary detention and adductions3 their involvement in the postelection period involving the disappearances of more than 280 youths alleged to have been arrested that has complicated the matter according to the oscar foundation over 8000 youths have disappeared since 2002 and remain unaccounted for the pattern and trend of disappearances in kenya is evident of state involvement to perpetuate criminal activities against the citizens these acts constitute crime against humanity according to offlack it is evident that these acts are part of government policy of militarization 4 in the period under review the police engaged in active and widespread acts of extrajudicial executions that precipitated to conflictlike situation that replaced organized gangs that often were the main perpetrators of disappearances and other related human rights violations5 offlack has documented over 280 cases of disappearances that occurred between december 2007 and august 2008 slightly higher number than what the police have acceded to since the beginning of the year however human rights groups put this figure to close to 500 people following the botched up operation in the mt elgon in march august 2008 which left traces of human rights violation including disappearances rape and torture in the course of its research oscar foundation conducted more than 00 interviews with witnesses and victims of police brutality during the postelection violence in nairobi nakuru kisumu mombasa and in remote towns and villages in rift valley militarization refers to the process of changing the police force from their basic duty of civil obligation to use of military tactics in carrying out their mandate having police commissioner who has military background has militarized the police force in most cases documented by the oscar foundation witnesses spoke of how members of the dreaded kwekwe squad arrested their victims from their homes and the police have not made any information on the arrests public most family members are trying to find their disappeared relatives through private channels in addition to the cases that occurred during the period of the postelection violence offlack has documented 0 cases of disappearances that occurred between december 007 and august 008o f f l c k v i l f i m p u n i t x c u t i n

most parts of the country increased and the civilian population continues to bear the brunt in nairobi victims relatives repeatedly accused the police of presiding over police state and culture of impunity that is worse than war survivors who escaped from the dragnet told oscar foundation of police brutality arbitrary arrest intimidation and impunity that prevail in the police force6 in parts of central province the strong hold of the kenya national youth alliance kenya the situation during the pre and postelection appeared fragile and presented stark picture on human rights situation in the region police engaged in mass arrests and imposed curfews in total violation of the right to assembly and movement those who dared to leave their houses got arrested at various checkpoints and are since unaccounted for the arrest and execution of youths by the police unmasked what is now known as kenyas killing fields7 during which abuses including numerous arbitrary detentions and extrajudicial executions often occurred leading to enforced disappearances that occur in state that is evident of lawlessness and state institutionalized impunity in nairobis kibera kariobangi mathare and dandora areas police brutality coupled with arbitrary arrests continued unabated and in parts of central province and other districts in the rift valley ambushes and clashes between the youth and the police were daily occurrence with casualty records rising higher in 2007 the police declared war on members of the mungiki and launched countrywide operation to wipe out members of the sect this degenerated to police state with the formation of the infamous kwekwe squad following series of beheadings the government declared shoottokill order and ordered the police to conduct mass arrests of youths some of whom were later found dead and dumped in ngong forest8 in areas under the effective control of the mungiki the fearstricken atmosphere was astounding and people who had survived both the chaos of postelection violence and actively protested the abuses perpetrated in their villages by the sect members were too terrified to open their doors even to their neighbours in most cases people chose not to report the abductions of their relatives to the authorities hoping that their silence might protect their remaining family members one of the witnesses woman who chose not to file formal complaint about recent abduction of her told oscar foundation of how the police could visit her house and threaten her with arrest9 today most people are increasingly reluctant to talk to human rights workers or journalists fearing further persecution from the police the relatives of over 100 victims of disappearances have refused to openly speak of the cases and have not publicized or use the information about their cases in any way in most incidences where the abducted person was released from custody or the relatives found his body the families often refused to be interviewed and asked human rights investigators not to disclose the names of the victim and his relatives their place of residence or any other details that may enable the authorities to identify the witnesses

custody by law enforcement agents and the authorities subsequently deny that the victim is in their custody or conceal the victims whereabouts or fate in way that places the victim beyond the protection of the law10 often victims of disappearances also suffer torture or are summarily executed typically those responsible for disappearances try to avoid being called to account through coverups and by spreading misleading information about the facts11 according to international law cases of widespread and systematic disappearances qualify to be regarded as crimes against humanity an act or series of acts that outrage the conscience of humankind12 evidence compiled by the oscar foundation is indicative of both widespread and systematic acts of disappearances and conspiracy to conceal evidence according to police spokesman mr eric kiraithe in news interview by beatrice marshall of ktn in september 2008 he conceded that about 3000 people are unaccounted for this according to the police is regarded as normal disappearance often the victims are civilians or individuals who when taken from their homes checkpoints or other locations were unarmedthey are hors combat they are predominantly men between 18 and 45 years old although the government has also targeted females suspected to be allied to the mungiki sect women have also increasingly become victims of disappearances 13 in most cases the perpetrators are law enforcement agentseither elite police squads or as is increasingly the case local security forces who are ultimately subordinate to the police this demonstrates the governments awareness of the scale of the problem even if it denies responsibility and its lack of commitment to ending disappearances and holding perpetrators accountable14 systematic abuse of human rights cases of disappearances and extrajudicial executions have become an enduring hallmark of human rights violation in kenya oscar foundation has documented hundreds of cases in which the police detained people during largescale sweep operations or targeted raids with authorities then denying any responsibility or knowledge of the detainees whereabouts official figures on disappearances are inconsistent and contradictory despite numerous figures being released by human rights organizations demonstrating the appalling scale of state conspiracy to deny responsibility the oscar foundation local human rights organization that send human rights monitors to mt elgon maintains database on disappearances in mt elgon area during and before the military operation dubbed okoa maisha according to offlack over 80 cases documented by its staff since the beginning of the conflict in mt elgon involved militia and more than 15 involved the military and the police while the disappearances rate has fluctuated over the past two months the rate did not decrease in 2008 in 2007 offlacks staff documented the abductions of over 700 people 430 of whom allegedly 0 declaration on the protection of all persons from enforced disappearances united nations g res 7 undoc res7 december 8 preamble the police have often refuted allegations that its officers have been involved in cases of extrajudicial executions and disappearance of youths believed to belong to the outlawed mungiki sect human rights violation may be classified as crime against humanity in the context of an armed conflict or in times of peace in modern jurisprudence the elements of widespread or systematic include the scale of the crime the existence of specific patterns as to the identity of the perpetrators and the victims the authorities knowledge about the crime or obligation to have such knowledge and the actions taken by the authorities in response to this knowledge mungiki an outlawed sect group which consists of mostly unemployed kikuyu youths under principles of international law when pattern of disappearances amounts to crime against humanity any state may prosecute their perpetrators regardless of their nationality the nationality of victims or the place where the offense was committed international law states that neither head of state nor responsible government officials enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution for crimes against humanity the declaration on enforced disappearances reaffirms this principle known as universal jurisdiction providing that all states should take any lawful and appropriate action available to them to bring to justice all persons presumed responsible for an act of enforced disappearance who are found to be in their jurisdiction or under their controlo f f l c k v i l f i m p u n i t x c u t i n n d d i s p p r n c w h i s g u i l t 2 0 0 8 2disappeared offlack monitors the situation through out the country as part of its access to justice project and compiles data for tracking the actual number of disappearances may be several times higher since evidence from survivors and victims relatives across the country suggests the situation of disappearances to be similar in areas not monitored by offlack offlack affirms that the total number of cases documented in 2008 is likely to increase since many families report the disappearance of their relatives to offlack months after their detention after their own efforts to find the detainee have proven futile and they often fail to get help from the relevant authorities the culture of impunity oscar foundation has documented evidence that is indicative that disappearances are not random acts of criminality but rather follow systematic pattern of impunity whereby the victims are either civilians or hors combat the government frequently claims that members of the outlawed mungiki sect are responsible for disappearances but offlack found clear evidence that law enforcement agents military and military security agents are responsible for the vast majority of these crimes in cases documented by offlack between the periods covering january 24 2008 to august 10 2008 officers from the kwekwe squad carried out mass arrests and detentions that resulted in the disappearance of victims in many of these cases witnesses indicated that the perpetrators ferried off their victims in police vehicles and others in unmarked cars which are used only by the flying squad police unit often the police carried out sweep throughout the country targeting criminal gangs for example on the night of july 3 2007 large contingent of military police arrived in mathare slum in nairobi the soldiers who witnesses said were drunk searched the houses and took away all the males who had been staying in the houses that night the police also committed acts of robbery including stealing money jewellery and committing acts of rape relatives learned through unofficial sources that the servicemen who carried out the operation were members of kwekwe and the general service unit gsu and that the missing men were later found dead and many more remain unaccounted for although the local police office opened inquiry files into the abductions recently the police publicly denied their units involvement in abductions and even threatened to take action against human rights groups accusing them of such crimes15 in number of cases documented by offlack the forces carrying out the detentions did not try to conceal their identity as members of the kwekwe for example in december 2007 group that detained eight members of the outlawed mungiki sect openly claimed that they were acting under orders from the police commissioner in another case relatives of man who was taken away from one of the villages in karatina in october 2007 told offlack that they had recognized the unmasked men who carried out the detention as representatives of local unit of the kwekwe working with the flying squad perpetrators of crimes against humanity such as disappearances are criminally responsible for their acts given the particular seriousness of these crimes international law sets out special rules of responsibility for them thus criminal responsibility cannot be avoided by invoking that the suspect holds an official position including that of head of police as is the case of kenya military commanders or others with command authority are considered criminally responsible for disappearances carried out by their subordinates if they were awareor should have been awareof the abuses and failed to take effective measures to prevent them the exception of due obedience to superior orders is not accepted as justification for the commission of crimes against humanity finally statutes of limitations do not run in the cases of crimes against humanity and those responsible do not benefit from refuge in third countries 16 the government spokesman posted statement on his official website accusing the oscar foundation of spreading lies against the state and for inciting the public against the state the failure by government to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of disappearances is excuse all perpetrators can be brought before an international criminal court for prosecution f f l c k v i l f i m p u n i t x c u t i n n d d i s p p r n c w h i s g u i l t 2 0 0 8 victims rights the victims of disappearances in kenya fall into three main categories mostly males between the ages of 18 and 45 from variety of social and educational backgrounds whom the authorities presumably believed were affiliated with or had information about outlawed groups and participated in organized crime or subversive activities 17 recently the police have also increasingly targeted womena trend that may be linked to the fact that the women were hiding information on their husbands in 2008 the wife of mungikis chairman maina njenga also mother was abducted on her way home by group of armed men believed to be police officers later her beheaded body was found dumped along side his driver her relatives have had information to date about the circumstances that led to her death and the police have not arrested any suspect according to oscar foundation people who disappeared over the last six months were not connected to the alleged mungiki sect the government has proposed an anti terrorism law which would allow counterhostagetakingdetaining suspects relatives in order to force them to surrender18 the initiative was opposed by human rights organizations who promised to push amendments before implementation of such law should it be adopted the government has sent strong signal of approval for such law several cases documented by offlack during the 2007 postelection violence provide evidence that security forces adopted policy of counterhostagetaking commonly known as renditions the most renowned counterhostage operation or renditions occurred in 2007 when members of antiterrorism unit abducted and disappeared several kenyans who are being held in prisons in ethiopia number of them reappeared in february 2007 with charges against them19 torture and death in custody many of those who disappear in the custody of kenyan police also become victims of torture and extrajudicial executions bodies of people who had been previously taken into custody and then disappeared are regularly found in ngong forest in one of the cases documented by oscar foundation several men disappeared after they were taken away during largescale sweep operation conducted by police and members of the general service unit gsu days later most bodies were found bearing gunshot wounds to their heads were found in shallow graves in ngong forest the criminal investigation opened into the cases has so far produced results the testimony of detainees who were eventually released after being held in unacknowledged detention strongly suggests that torture in custody is rampant in kenya20 in another illustrative case on january 15 2008 group of armed men some of whom in police uniform took away felix muiruri ngugi from his

the young men had been detained between january 2008 and september 2008 at various police stations during which time their relatives actively sought but received information of their whereabouts while in detention the young men were held on the concrete floor of tiny unheated cells they were handcuffed the entire time at the time of the interviews they were in varying state of shock had difficulty speaking clearly and focusing their eyes they spoke of how their perpetrators 7 on april 008 police officer broke into house belonging to john maina waweru at gunpoint took him away without even checking his documents he has not been seen or heard from since then the family of john maina waweru denied his involvement with the outlawed mungiki sect 8 suppression of terrorism bill 00 the authorities denied reports of the arrests and disappearance and would not even acknowledge that the arrested people had been abducted the government later confirmed the fact of the abductions and announced that the government had launched investigation on the circumstances of arrest but has not thus far publicized any findings 0 kenya has ratified the united nation convention against torture uncat outlawing the use of torture cruel inhumane or degrading treatment subsequently the police act section outlaws the use of torture by police officers f f l c k v i l f i m p u n i t x c u t i n n

report the unlawful detention and torture to the authorities fearing intimidation and harassment right to rule of law according to offlack not single officer has been held fully accountable for disappearance since the first case was ever documented the government has failed to establish meaningful accountability process for abuses by law enforcement officials notably despite kenyas commitment to upholding the rule of law complete impunity continues to prevail and the overwhelming impunity enjoyed by perpetrators of disappearances has doubtless encouraged others to commit untold cases of disappearance in recent years the police force through an oversight board has begun opening partial investigations into most of the abductions reported by victims relatives in midseptember 2007 the offlack conducted investigations into the abductions of approximately over 8000 individuals reported from 20022007 the few cases involving investigations of disappearances serves as yet further proof of the authorities lack of awareness of the scale of the problem especially since these figures are not made public and none of the investigations has led to any form of findings the absolute lack of progress made by the police to investigate these cases is indicative of the authorities failure to bringing perpetrators to justice according to list of convictions of police officers who have been accused of crimes against civilians compiled by the oscar foundation not single officer has been convicted in relation to disappearance21 in what is also longstanding pattern law enforcement officer usually make effort to conduct even the most rudimentary investigative actions such as questioning witnesses or searching for particular car that had allegedly been used by the perpetrators even in cases where the victims or witnesses have information that could easily lead to establishing the perpetrators such as the names of unit commanders or the registration numbers of the cars the investigators take action to utilize this information in some cases when the evidence strongly suggests the involvement of known police forces the victims family tries to report the matter to the police for investigation however the police often refuses to take it and the case becomes stalled because of bureaucracy even after detainees are released from non gazetted detention facilities and the perpetrators are established accountability process takes place to hold perpetrators to account for example according to offlack the flying squad police unit is notorious of arresting and dumping suspects in unacknowledged facilities22 however not single cases involving the squad has ever been conclusively been investigated power to enforce in 2001 the commission on human rights established an intercessional openended working group to elaborate draft legally binding instrument for the protection of all persons from enforced most of the criminal cases against law enforcement agents are closed or suspended after several months due to the impossibility of establishing the identity of the perpetrators according to offlack despite several officers being found criminally responsible for crimes related to abductions details were provided and it is unclear whether even the case was concluded the declaration on the protection of all persons from enforced disappearance also terms the systematic practice of enforced disappearances to be of the nature of crime against humanity declaration on the protection of all persons from enforced disappearances preamble although nonbinding standard the declaration reflects the consensus of the international community against this type of human rights violation and provides authoritative guidance as to the safeguards that must be implemented in order to prevent it the rome statute of the international criminal court icc also provides that enforced disappearances are crime against humanity when committed as part of widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population with knowledge of the attack see rome statute of the international criminal court doc aconf 8 july 7 8 7 ilm article 7 russia has not ratified the rome statute but many of the definitions of crimes contained in the icc are considered part of customary international law f f l c k v i l f i m p u n i t x c u t i n n d

to help eradicate the scourge of disappearances that had ravaged societies in all regions of the world since then the working group has been holding two sessions per year and making substantial progress towards the completion of this treaty the current text contains important protections as well as innovative mechanisms for the prevention of disappearances while initially mildly supportive of the initiative kenya has become increasingly hostile to the idea of domesticating international treaties aimed at preventing and protecting all persons against human rights abuses including cases of disappearances the terrifying abuses committed by the kwekwe deserve the most energetic condemnation but it is clear from this report that the responsibility for disappearances in kenya lies mainly with the government attempts to disguise such crimes as militia abuses are reprehensible parallel efforts to distort the measures aimed at providing legal protection and remedy for such crimes further undermines both the moral and legal authority of the government unfortunately number of proposals aimed at compromise and at accommodating kenyas concerns have led nowhere beyond this specific issue kenya has not engaged in substantive debate on the provisions of the draft treaty at the same time it has become one of the major obstacles to the completion of the treaty through the systematic introduction of procedural issues aimed at delaying and derailing the debate recommendations the united nations commission on human rights should v adopt resolution condemning ongoing violations of human rights and humanitarian law by law enforcement agents and specifically condemn the widespread and systematic pattern of enforced disappearances in kenya as crime against humanity the resolution should call on the kenyan government to immediately end the practice of disappearances and take measures for their prevention in the future v call on kenya to invite key thematic mechanisms particularly the working group on enforced and involuntary disappearances the special rapporteur on torture and the special rapporteur on extrajudicial summary or arbitrary executions v insist on accountability the resolution should call on the kenyan authorities to ensure meaningful investigations into all reported crimes by kenyan military police and the paramilitary units against civilians and specifically require the prosecution of the perpetrators of extrajudicial execution and disappearances it should call on the authorities to publish detailed list of all current and past investigations into such abuses and indicate their current status v renew its call for national commission of inquiry to document abuses by both sides of the conflict and make clear that kenyan authorities continued failure to make progress on accountability will result in the establishment of an international commission of inquiry to document and produce an official record of abuses v encourage individual member states to prosecute the perpetrators of extrajudicial executions and disappearances in kenya under the principle of universal jurisdiction over crimes against humanity v ask all member states to cooperate towards the prompt completion of strong international treaty to prevent and punish enforced disappearances resolution 07 xxviii of the general assembly of the united nations clearly provides for universal jurisdiction over crimes against humanity or war crimes see principles of international cooperation in the detection arrest extradition and punishment of persons guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity general assembly resolution 07 xxviii doc a00add 7 the principle of universal jurisdiction is now part of customary international law and is also reflected in international treaties and national legislation moreover in certain circumstances according to rule known as aut dedere aut judicare extradite or prosecute state is obligated to either exercise jurisdiction over perpetrator or to extradite the person to state able and willing to prosecute or to surrender the person to an international criminal court with relevant jurisdiction states are obliged not to extradite to countries where the individual would be at risk of torture the icc statute emphasizes that it is the duty of every state to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over

kayole the government should act with disappearances continuing on wide scale in parts of kenya the practice is now being perpetuated with impunity and pause serious form of human rights violations acts of criminality are often perpetuated by law enforcement agencies that target criminal gangs and members of outlawed groups in periods preceding to the december 27 general elections acts of disappearances were reported in various parts of the country with victims often falling between the age of eighteen and forty five years old the most affected parts of the country were mt elgon district central and in nairobi provinces the government must adopt strong resolution condemning all acts of abduction and investigate all cases of disappearances the practice of disappearances being perpetuated by state agents threatens human rights and democracy the government which was voted on the platform for change and respect of human rights has failed to uphold the right to protect all persons from enforced disappearances despite documented evidence implicating known police officers for abducting suspects from their homes and the more than 280 unaccounted for persons the police have declined to take action on the officers implicated the government has turned blind eye while state agents commit crimes against humanity with full impunity according to international law such criminal activities may qualify to be prosecuted under international law and perpetrators of such acts that outrage the conscience of humankind may face prosecution over 8000 people have disappeared in kenya since 2002 with the full knowledge of the government according to hundreds of witnesses the environment under which these crimes occur is characteristic of widespread impunity in 2007 all cases under investigation opened into the disappearances yielded results and prosecutions or investigation report has been produced case in mind is the arrest and subsequent prosecution of joseph kimani ruo together with maina njenga on suspicion of being members of the outlawed mungiki sect on 21607 the two were arrigned at the high court in nairobi for delivery of judgment of their case an eyewitness account told offlack that ruo was acquitted of all charges against him by the honourable court on the said date on the corridors of justice kimani was accosted by group of police officers in plainclothes believed to be from the cid one of them is said to be known as corporal njoroge and that he was well known to kimani kimani whispered to the witness that they were going for meeting with the officers later on his phone went dead and since then he has not been seen or heard of can the police give an insight into the disappearance of joseph kimani ruo while in the custody of police office even after being captured in the full glare of the press the relatives of the disappeared have redress and hope of finding their loved ones as the police continue to issue unfounded and misleading information about the missing persons relatives are often reluctant to even report the disappearances to the authorities fearing for the safety of their remaining family members as observed in number of cases the police continue to perpetuate fear and intimidation of innocent youths on the pretext of dealing with crime in an incident in umoja estate in nairobi two criminal suspects were executed after three hour shooting spree the offlack attributed this incident to lack of intelligence and coordination by the police while dealing with organized crime according to offlack the police resort to extra judicial execution as means of silencing suspects and engaging in criminal conspiracyobservationso f f l c k v i l f i m p u n i t x c u t i n n d d i s p p r n c w h i s g u i l t 2 0 0 8 although cases of police misconduct are linked to criminal intent there are internal monitoring mechanisms in the police force that protects the rights of the suspects against abuse by rough officers in kenya law enforcements agents arbitrarily kill suspects and violate the basic principles on the use of fire arms which calls for maximum restrain by law enforcement officers to use weapons only when its strictly necessary and often after shooting inquests are opened and police officer are held accountable for the killings 24 offlack urges the government to invite key thematic mechanisms particularly the working group on enforced or involuntary disappearances and the special rapporteur on torture to visit kenya and conduct investigations in to the disappearances its would be practical for member states to press kenya to issue the invitations to also the icrc mission to assist in tracking the disappearances the december postelection violence now under fragile truce has brought untold suffering to hundreds of thousands of civilians who have fallen victim to abuses perpetrated by both the police and private militias in mt elgon sdlf militias committed unspeakable acts of torture abductions and rape and in similar patterns the military and the police committed gross human rights violations in addition to enforcing disappearances the military together with police also committed numerous other crimes against civilians including extrajudicial executions torture arbitrary detention and rape the overwhelming majority of these crimes remained uninvestigated and unpunished and the government has defended the actions of the military in 2007 the oscar foundation published numerous reports urging the government to stop abuses establish meaningful accountability process and invite the monitoring mechanisms to the country to investigate cases of alleged disappearances offlack believes that the government has defied number of international treaties that it has acceded to and has failed to comply with the majority of recommendations proposed by human rights bodies to protect and promote human rights we are in way looking down upon on the very important role that the police play in this country in upholding law and order neither are we ignoring the many who have lost their lives in the line of duty for the love of the country but the point of focus on this report is the realization of the police and the government of the impending catastrophe that awaits on the road to ensuring maturity of the rule of law caused by legislative handicap in the police laws and the criminal procedure laws in general the role of police is carrying out investigations after apprehending the offenders 25 the police are responsible for investigation in order to provide the prosecution with evidence for presentation to the judiciary the aim is whether case has been established and if it meets the standard beyond reasonable doubt to sustain conviction the penal code 26does provide all offences with which an accused person may be charged with in court of law the constitution under the bill of rights provides that everyone has right to liberty27 other laws directly significant to their operation include the traffic act the evidence act and the prisons act however policemen have operated in blatant disregard of these laws this legal framework under which the kenya police operate grants them wide discretionary powers without providing adequate mechanisms to check excesses reasonable force for instances is permitted by the criminal procedure code where suspect resists arrest but the code does not specify what amounts to unreasonable force due to this loop hole the police often find justification for every excessive force used in the course of performing their duties as much as disappearances has become normality to the acts or omissions of the police officers other felonies include holding accused persons in order to extort evidence recent amendments to the evidence act notwithstanding corruption is entrenched in the police force that number of criminal cases are scuttled by shoddy investigations done by police officers who have been compromised by suspects cover up of offences committed by police officers has also contributed to the indiscipline exhibited within the rank and file in the police force offlack report on mungiki s cap 8 laws of kenya cap laws of kenya 7 s7 constitution of kenya s7 goes ahead to give detailed procedure to be followed in case person is arrestedo f f l c k v i l f i m p u n i t x c u t i n n d d i s p p r n c w h i s g u i l t 2 0 0 8 8 the ruthlessness blatant disrespect of the law and the crude behaviour of the police is good indicator of these mistakes attributed to several factors these include lack of qualifications during recruitment wrong judgements political interference abuse of power lack of enthusiasm in investigations lack of motivation abuse of due process shown by inadequate shoddy and lengthy investigations the accused often faced serious charges and are subjected to informal repression torture and inhuman and degrading treatment at the hands of these police officers this act is indicative of corrupt and manipulated police system that thrives on handouts offlack takes great exception to these killings whereby they sometime use power saws and machetes to inflict deep cuts on their victims in addition the assailants bludgeon their prey using clubs crow bars wheel spanners and even building stones this new tactic adopted by the police officers is scheme aimed at depicting the mungiki adherents being at war against themselves reminiscent of scripts taken from the 1930s gang war in chicago fighting for control of bootlegging it is important to note that all suspects of any crime are innocent till proven otherwise by competent court of law to portray the youth as criminals based on their ethnic background and or social affiliation is symptomatic of society whose morals have eroded in this age and time to be youth has become synonymous to being criminal not knowing ones fate the next minute killing can be attributed to error save that the police rely on mistaken identity or stray bullet whenever faced with prima facie case of negligence the rogue and trigger happy police officers mostly engage in moonlighting and when the deals go sour they end up executing their partners in an organized crime ostensibly in their quest to justify their execution acts the police stage manage raid where in pre arranged meetings with the media houses who get invited to cover the imaginary foiled crime robbery attempt the police immediately in the scene of crime issue press statements without any investigation to warrant the killings neither do they open inquest files as required by law in most cases the media abet to these criminal activities perpetuated by the law enforcement agents by misreporting the incident without verification of facts and give credence to the police theory these conspiracies to harden evidence and justify the killings by the police have occasionally duped the media in publishing propaganda and public relations materials aimed at whitewashing the already tarnished name of the police force today the community policing initiative has failed drastically our preliminary enquiries have scrutinised the conduct of all the officers involved offlack affirms that most of the killings are occasioned by misinformation and lack of any intelligence report to justify the loss of lives we also take great exception in the conduct of the police investigations which is evident of errors precipitated by the fact that rogue police officers and trigger happy are shielded from prosecution by their superiors the only disciplinary action taken against the said officers is transferring them to different stations where they continue with their heinous acts with impunity it is important that lessons are learned from badly planned and executed police operations the culture of impunity and lawlessness within the police force threatens the ability of the police to uphold law and order and exacerbates brutality and corruption the failure by the kibaki raila grand coalition government to guarantee protection of the rights to life human rights and peaceful co existence among the ethnic communities of kenya has compromised fundamental human rights corruption and police brutality are the common endemic characterizing our police system hence threatening development and social justice lack of administrative and judicial measures to deal with police misconduct have entrenched the culture of impunity among police officers that escape punishment in the face of their victims the establishment of the public standing oversight committee popularly known as the office of the ombudsman and the police oversight board has set good precedent in the governance justice law and order sector reforms the composition character competence integrity academic qualification professional status and managerial skills are unquestionable and of high repute despite these credentials all what an ordinary kenyan is yearning for is none other than justice taking its course regardless of any institution that will deliver cynism and mistrust abound as the common man waits to f f l c k v i l f i m p u n i t x c u t i n n d d i s p p r n c w h i s g u i l t 2 0 0 8 see results of the much awaited reports of commissions of inquiry and probe committees as is evident in the performance of the weakkneed kenya anti corruption authority which has never prosecuted with success any high profile case where millions worth of resources have been siphoned to offshore accounts and huge tracts of land amassed irregularly these institutions need laws to govern their operations for them to acquire the much needed independence in order to avoid external pressure and mainly from the executive simply put for the ordinary kenyan to have faith in these institutions the same institutions must be established on foundation of trust and confidenceo f f l c k v i l f i m p u n i t x c u t i n n d d i s p p r n c
