summary more than most countries po lands relations today with the rest of the world are influenced by its past the victim of historical forces and powerful neighbors poland was partitioned in the 18th century and once again in the 20th this loss of sovereignty may partly explain its assertiv foreign policy poland has carved out unique sometimes maverick role for itsel f in europe nato member since 1999 and an eu member since 2004 poland has fo rcefully pursued its national interests and has not been reluctant to assert itself with major powers for example with germany its leading trading partner with the european union and with the united states poland has been staunch us ally not only in the global war on terrorism but also in the usled campaign in iraq however several fact ors including the revelations of prisoner abuse at abu ghraib prison and th march 2004 madrid bombings have caused poland to weigh the costs and benefits of its participation in iraq and reassess its pa rtnership with the united states many poles are also disappointed that their cooperation in th iraq mission has yet to yield tangible benefits in particular the poles had hoped for help in three areas military assistance iraq reconstruction cont racts and us visa policy poland has been an active member of the european union eu and has not always sided with the majority many of its positions within the eu and toward its eastern neighbors have been in accord with us policy preferences that have at times been at odds with eu members however some analysts believe that for economic and social reasons poland likely will draw closer to its fellow eu countries over the long term and may even tually play leadership role on the continent this report analyzes polish foreign policy motivations

international herald tribune april 2 2005poland foreign policy trends background more than most countries po lands relations today with the rest of the world are influenced by its past at the end of the 18th century it was partitioned among russia prussia and austria and for more than century poland as state did not exist it was reestablished after the first world war with us backing only to be divided again between the nazis and th soviets in 1939 and then dominated by moscow after 19451 poland has long been viewed as crucib for change in central and eastern europe and ultimately the soviet union historians are likely to attribute that in large part to the rise of two remarkab men in 1978 the arc hbishop of krakow cardinal karol wojtyla was elected pope john paul ii the following year he returned from rome to visit his homela nd and said mass before more than one million celebrants urging poles do not be afraid2 john paul served as an inspiration for poles to confront their ow n government and by extension the ussr in 1980 after the government raised food pr ices electrician lech walesa led his fellow shipyard workers in gdansk in strike the confrontation led to the formation of solidarity an independent trade union over the ensuing decade it evolved into political party that was instrumental in ending communist rule in 1983 solidarity leader walesa was awarded the nobe l peace prize in 1989 and 1990 solidarity candidates won polands fi rst democraticallycontes ted parliamentary and presidential elections in the 1990s successive postcommuni st governments moved swiftly to consolidate democracy and establish mark et economy their efforts were capped in 1999 by nato membership and in 2004 by entry into the european union eu poland has conducted proac tive foreign policy over the past 15 years it has aggressively pursued its national interests and has not been reluctant to assert itself with major powers for example with germany its leading trading partner with the european union and with the united states warsaw has cooperated with its neighboring states to the north and south in such regional formations as the baltic cooperation council and the visegrád grouphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32967crs2 but polands main foreign policy initiatives in europe have been directed to the east and west it has actively promoted the development of democracy in the two countries to its immediate east belarus and ukraine to its west poland has had somewhat contentious experience integrating into the eu in terms of transatlantic relations poland is perhaps the most emblematic of the countries tied to both the united states and the eu it does not wish to have to choose between the two but occasionally has d to take sides this was particularly true of the iraq conflict in which poland chose to support us policy both diplomatically and militarily however several factors including the march 11 2004 madrid terrorist bombing s and revelations of pris oner abuse at abu ghraib caused polish public opinion to turn resolutely against continued involvement in iraq the government has responded with phased withdrawal of its troops in addition many poles believe that the united states has failed to show sufficient gratitude for polands support poland will be holding pa rliamentary elections in september 2005 many observers believe that the current ruling party the democratic left alliance sld is likely to suffer defeat at the hands of the centerright civic platform po party if that does transpire most observers be lieve that polands fo reign policy would not likely undergo abrupt and dramatic chan ges under the next government whichever party leads it warsaw may become somewhat less reflexively pro american although the pole s may have lined up beside the united states on iraq they also know that their future ec onomic prosperity pends on continued cooperation and integr ation with the eu poland and europe east and west as noted above part or all of po land was under russian domination throughout the nineteenth century and most of the 20th for poles history is never far from the surface in looking eastward poland has therefore sought to encourage democratization of belarus and ukraine not only on principle but also for the practical reason that doing so would impr ove polands security by establishing buffer zone between itself and russia polands policies toward its two immediate neighbors have been largely consistent with those of the united states somewhat confrontational toward the more repressive belarus but seeking engagement with ukraine many have argued that helpin g the two countries eventually acquire eu and nato membership should be fo reign policy priority for poland polands involvement in ukraines fall 2004 po litical crisis was particularly noteworthy president kwasniewski joined with eu foreign policy chief javier solana and lithuanian president vladas adamkus in helping negotiate settlement over the disputed presidential vote poland s new status as member of the eu is believed to have lent weight to its role in mediating the ukraine political crisis poland pushed within the union to get bru ssels more actively involved in helping solve the crisis in kiev finally poland subsequently joined with several of its neighboring c ountries in endorsing ukraines eventual eu membership us

backbone in ukraine along with javier solana some obser vers believe that flush w ith its success in ukraine poland might now set its sights on encouraging reforms in moldova3 perhaps the most important factor in polands eastward perspective is its relationship to russia one polish academic has asserted that his countrymen fear russia and exaggerate the threat it poses and cautioned against allowing phobia about russia to hamper the effectiveness of polands foreign policy noting that the united states is main source of polands s ecurity he pointed out that for the us russia is not threat but an important t hough difficult partner in the war against islamic terrorism4 he argued that to more effectively promote democracy in belarus and ukraine poland must impr ove its relations with moscow in may 2004 poland fulfilled longterm foreign policy goal when it joined nine other countries in becoming member of the european union poland achieved nato membership earlier in 1999 eu mbership had been contentious issue particularly for poles living in rura l areas who feared that they would be overwhelmed economically by more efficient western european agricultural producers however those fears have t hus far been groundless as poland began to experience economic gains agricultural subsidies and surge in farm exports almost immediately after it joined poland was not reluctant to assert itself before joining the eu and will likely be even less hesitant to do so now that it is member on several issues poland staked out positions intended to advance its in terests and values these stances have sometimes been opposed by major players within the eu such as france and germany for example during the velopment of the eu constitution poland joined by several other mostly roman ca tholic countries called for the preamble to include language referring to europes christian heritage the measure was not adopted but pope john paul ii lauded poland for its efforts warsaw also has argued strongly that turkey is democratic islamic state and deserves to be admitted into the eu poland has argued for its right to maintain relatively low corporate taxes practice criticized by some other countries as an unfair subsidy meant to attract foreign investment finally poland has supported the velopment of an eu military capability but has stressed that this not be done at the cost of weakening nato polishus relations iraq and related issues poland supported the united states in iraq both politically and militarily it was one of small number of countries to pr ovide troops in the combat phase of the conflict and then deployed large 2500 strong contingent of peacekeeping troopshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32967crs4 5 poland toughens stance over backing us with

terrorist attacks in madrid and the revelations of prisoner abuses at abu ghraib contributed to increased public pressure against c ontinued military engagement in iraq in december 2004 the polish government declared that it w ould be withdrawing about onethird of its forces after the iraqi elections further announcements on phased withdrawal followed given the many daunting challenges and political risks some question why poland joined with the united states in the iraq conflict in the first place observers attribute polands participation to variety of factors some stress that the poles were at least in part motivated by sense of gratitude for past us support including us assistance during the cold war and the lead role played by the united states in expanding nato to include poland among other states poland may also have joined the iraq effort because it subscribes to the bush administrations belief in the need to thwart tyranny and spread democracy poles cite their role as mediator in ukraines political crisis as another exampl of this conviction in action according to former polish foreign minister cimoszewicz poland did not join the coalition because it believed that sadda m hussein had weapons of mass destruction but rather because poland believed it was in its own security interests to support the united states and thereby maintain strong transatlantic security linkage5 there were practical benefits of join ing the iraq operation polish defense officials speak of the invaluable experience and information that the iraq operation has provided the military chiefly through having command of large international expeditionary force anothe r benefit was psychological at the outset of the conflict the bush administration treated the poles as important partners in the international scene according to one analyst bush gave poles and the polish political class the feeling that they belong to the count ries that really matter in the world6 however poland has experienced difficulties both at home and abroad as result of its participa tion along with other factors the iraq deployment is listed as reason for the sld governments sharp decline in popularity in addition some analysts believe that polands partne rship with the united states may have contributed to strained relations with other eu states particularly france and germany which opposed the iraq inva sion in may 2003 german newspaper referred to poland as americas trojan donkey some poles have faulted the partnership for being unconditional former polish defense minister has argued for example that the sld government erred in not bargaining with the americans for military assistance before committing troops to iraq7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32967crs5 8 us ally

poles afp august 10 2004some poles also maintain that their count ry has begun to see itself as paying for us mistakes in iraq and that this might have an impact on bilateral relations in the past year in fact the poles have become less reluctant to criticize the united states openly for example in september 2004 interview president kwasniewski urged the united states to be flexible open and gracious in later press appearance he recalled that from the beginning i warned president bush against policy of american dominance in iraq and in the w hole world and more pointedly former president and solidarity leader lech walesa remarked that america failed its exam as superpower it is military nd economic superpower but not morally or politically anymore this is tragedy for us8 poles also have begun to ask themselves what they have received in return for their loyalty to the united states in par ticular poles had hoped for help in three areas military assistance iraq reconstruction contracts and us visa policy in recent months some iraq reconstruction business has begun to flow toward polish firms and president bush pledged to seek 100 million in military assistance for poland it is the visa waiver issue howev er that seems to resonate the most among poles perhaps because it could be fixed w ithout financial cost to the united states warsaw has hoped to join 27 other countries which have been granted waiver of the us government requirement to obtain visa for shortterm travel to the united states according to one report the political class were outraged at the us decision to treat poland differently from th eu15 by imposing visa regulations on polish nationals as part of general tightening of immigration controls in the wake of 911 in radio interview that touc hed upon this issue lech walesa maintained that americans are making fun of us9 us analysts however argue that there are some factors militating against waiving visas for poles first of all polands continued high unemployment rate close to 20 in april might act as an incentive for poles to seek work outside of the count ry and overstay their visas secondly if the united states were to make an excep tion for poland even though it does not meet the objective requirements many other countries would also seek to make their case for being exempted one observer has point ed out that given continuing concerns over the threat of terrorism there is not much sentiment in congress to make it easier for people to enter the united states finally poland is said to be lobbying to be future location for us military base amid us consideration of global rebasing scheme poles claim that such move would represent good payback for th eir participation in iraq us military bases would benefit local economies as well as polands desire for american investment lastly having the us military present on its soil they argue would increase polands sense of security httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32967crs6 10 the disillusionment with iraq did not spill over into disapproval of the bush administration polls showed that during the fall 2004 us presidential campaign poland was the only country in europe to prefer bu sh to his democratic opponent sen john kerryassessment more than many countries poland has habit of asserting its independence one unwavering constant in polands foreign po licy has been its efforts to protect its perceived national inte rests in region that more than once has devoured it as state poland has been close ally of the united states as new member of the eu it is now attempting to balance its transatlantic interests because it views the united states as the main guarantor of its security poland will likely continue to support the united states within nato poland wants to modernize its armed forces ensure alliance interoperability and improve its own defense capabilities however the poles point out that their resources have been severely strained by the iraq mission forc ing them to sideline their plans to update their military poles were more supportive than most europeans of the usled invasion of iraq and the subsequent military occupation nevertheless some observers maintain that participation in the iraq operation was the most controversial foreign policy decision made by polish government si nce the fall of communism many poles agreed with the governments decision to deploy troops with the coalition and were proud that poland was given command role some asserted that iraq demonstrated that polands security interests are now global longer just regional several factors eventually increased polish public opposition to the war and poland has become less reluctant to criticize the united states openly in part some argue because it has begun to see itself as paying for us mistakes10 some poles assert that in siding with the americans they erred by putting all their security eggs in one basket damaging their relations with other allies they suggest that poland repair its intraeu relations and believe that given its size and growing influence poland might eventually become leading force within larger stronger eu many of polands actions within the eu have been consis tent with policies preferred by the united states poland nd the bush administration both support the notion of taxing consumption rather than i nvestment on eu security policy poland stresses the importance of maintaining th transatlantic link like washington warsaw supports the accession of turkey polands s ponsorship of reference to europes christian heritage in the eu constitution shows that poles are not reluctant to mix religion with governance compar ed to many other european societies poland has demonstrated that it can be an independent actor within europe often taking positions in line with us policy or interests for example the decision to buy lockheed martin f16s rather than europeanbuilt fighter aircraft regardless of technical rationale might have had political repercussions poland was still queued up to join the eu at the time polish officials stress that their government did not expect quid pro quo for its decisions to join the iraq coalition and to purchasehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32967crs7 11 polish participation in the armed inte rvention and stabilization mission in iraq

americas protégé to constructive european marcin zaborowski institute for security studies december 2004 us fighters nevertheless there is sense that the us inaction on several issues of intense interest to poles indicates an absence of gratitude it resulted in disappointment that support for the usa didnt bring poland measurable benefits11 polands foreign policy outside the eu s also generally been in harmony with us international goals for example poland was instrumental in advancing the practice of democracy in ukraine warsaw played lead role in resolving the fall 2004 election crisis president bush stated that president kwasniewski had showed remarkable leadership and the people of the ukraine are better for it and the world appreciates it and i appreciate it12 during the current decade polish leaders have at times spoken of acting as bridge between russia and the west through maintaining active ties with russia pola nd also hopes to discourage nondemocratic tendencies in answer to the question of where poland sees its future and interests some observers see division the united stat may be important to its security but poland has natural affinity toward fe llow eu countries in cultural and economic matters many believe it is inevitable that poland will draw closer to europe13 but what kind of eu member it will eventua lly become from the us standpoint remains to be seen some believe that poland as an eu member will likely wind up being more like the united kingdom staunch us ally than like belgium which has at times taken positions contrary to us policy some have speculated that poland given its size will be looked to as leader of the central and eastern european regi on however officials from neighboring countries say that although they may re spect and admire poland they hope that it does not come to regard itself as the chief spokesperson for central europe some observers believe that polish po litics is undergoing transition period featuring the fading of the old solidarity generation they ssert that although poland has traditionally had closer ties to the united states than many other european countries have members of the new generation entering politics are perhaps not so firmly rooted in the transatlantic relationship analysts therefore caution that us policymakers should not take polish friendship for granted in addition for the past ten years the united states has had close friend in poland in aleksander kwasniewski but his time as presid ent is coming to an end in one view it is unlikely that any polish leader in the next few years will be as strongly prous as mr kwasniewski it is important not to exaggerate the extent to which poland will move away from the us in the next few years but warsaw will be less willing to set itself at odds with berlin and paris in order tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32967crs8 14 eiu country briefing october 14 2004 15 hedgehog lies in wait jan cienski financial times october 26

coalition the parties that would likely form the new government might not qualify as euroske ptics but some of their members have admitted to feelings of am bivalence about the eu15 some analysts also argue that communist successor parties such as the sld and politicians such as kwasniewski may have been overly cooperative toward the united states and western europe in an effort to compensate for their past allegiances polish foreign policy since 1989 does not appear to have been significantly affected by whichever party is in power but analysts suggest that nonsocialist led government at this point could be expected to push polands national interests more aggressively in its bilateral relations with the united states
