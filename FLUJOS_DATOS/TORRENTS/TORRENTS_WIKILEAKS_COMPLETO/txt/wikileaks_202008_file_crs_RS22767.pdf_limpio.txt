holds congress attended by some 2000 senior party members to authorize important policy and leadership decisions within the party for the coming five years in addition to authorizing substantive policies the party at its congress selects new central committee comprised of the most important figures in the party government and military1 the central committee in turn technically selects new politburo and new politburo standing committee comprised of chinas most powerful and important leaders the appearance generally is given that these choices are being made at the party congress itself but the decisions almost always are made ahead of time by select group of senior leaders then ratified at the congress in public demonstration of political unity that belies months of political infighting negotiation and compromise the october 2007 session was the 17 th of these party congresses held since the founding of the chinese communist party and the first full congress held under the leadership of party secretary hu jintao who ascended to that post at the 16th party congress in 2002 g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g7g150g153g145g138g156g146g156g561 the 17th party congress brought surprises in terms of substantive policy decisions in keeping with established practice party general secretary hereafter secretary hu jintao opened the congress by presenting lengthy political report extolling the partys accomplishments over the past five years and noting problems the party still has to address the report the product of months of work among senior leaders includes issues on which the party has been able to agree the catchphrases in the report continued to be to build welloff society xiao kang she hui in an allround way and to adhere to the scientific development conceptboth core ideas developed by secretary hu the scientific development concept has been described as new concept of development one that moves away from chinas previous development at all costs approach and toward economic and social progress that is peopleoriented comprehensive balanced and sustainable 2 according to the political report that secretary hu delivered at the opening of the congress components of scientific development include emphasizing issues that would improve peoples livelihood including employment health nati onal education renewable energy resources and environmental quality3 as indicated by early rumors and news reports the congress voted at its closing session on october 21 2007 to enshrine the scientific development doctrine in an amendment to the party constitution4 this elevates this doctrine of party general secretary hu to similar level of importance in the partys thinking as those of his predecessors5 g22g138g146g160g138g151g561 hus report also

china continued market reform and continued integration of china into the global system according to secretary hus political report the party also endorsed the goal of moving away from purely investment and exportdriven economic growth model to one that includes expansion of domestic consumption 7 other economic goals included developing and improving modern service sectors promoting rural development including protecting arable land strengthening rural infrastructure enhancing food security preventing animal and plant diseases and narrowing gaps in urbanrural development promoting private companies and individual entrepreneurship by removing institutional barriers and promoting equitable market access improving fiscal tax and financial restructuring in order to improve access

congress us chinawatchers followed remarkably public prc debate on political reform that hinted at ongoing internal party dissension between conservatives and reformers this debate was carried out in number of articles by notable prc academicians and scholars appearing in respected prc journals citing deficiencies in the partys ability to govern and calling for greater democratization and political reform8 secretary hus report at the congress made several references to these deficiencies suggesting that problems of governance continue to preoccupy central leaders the partys ability to govern has not been fully competent to deal with the new situation and tasks and the democratic legal building is still unable to completely ad apt to the requirements of expanding peoples democracy

17th party congress endorsed major political reforms and further made clear that its monopoly on power would continue but in clear sign that the party is feeling increasing pressure from public sentimentwhat hu in his report acknowledged as the growing enthusiasm of the people for participation in political affairshus report called for modest controversial and potentially farreaching democratization reforms but only within the party itself these included allowing greater public participation in nominating party leaders at grassroots levels allowing ordinary party members to participate in direct elections for lower level leaders and expanding the role of party congress delegates beyond choosing central committee members10

institutional levels the story is somewhat more complex with attending implications likely to be unfolding for some months to come and number of trends potentially significant according to one analyst the make up of party leadership that emerged from the congress has some unique collective characteristics11 these include significant number 32 of the central committee from the socalled lost generation of the cultural revolution when the countrys educational system ceased to function and chinese teenagers were dispatched to the countryside to spend years working alongside peasants decline in those with technocratic and engineering educational backgrounds and an increase in those educated in the social sciences higher number of foreigneducated members greater percentage 76 of the politburo of members with provincial leadership credentials and higher number of entrepreneurs and corporate ceos these characteristics suggest senior leadership that may be more familiar with the problems that the disenfranchised in chinas interior provinces face more personal experience in the social and economic disruptions that can come from an excess of ideological political zeal and loss of central government control and greater feel for the global business environment in addition rather than the standard practice of designating an heir apparent to succeed secretary hu jintao the 17 th party congress appeared to field two potential candidates for this post such move could serve to institutionalize certain amount of democratic choice in chinas leadership succession arrangements but the prospe ct of two rival candidates competing with one another for the next five years also could raise new uncertainties in the succession process 12 10 hu jintao ibid p 26 11 cheng li in

sits at the top of the chinese communist partys political structure the 17th party congress announced the selection of 25membe r politburo including nine new membersten if counting as new the promotion of previous alternate to full member this is an expansion from its predecessors membership of 24 members which included 17 new members plus 1 alternate officially the politburo in beijing is the prcs chief decisionmaking body in the past its relatively unwieldy size and its lack of k nown formalized meeting schedule have suggested that the full politburo has been involved only when the stakes are highas when considering major policy shifts dealing with matters of immediate urgency or when higher level of legitimization of particular policy direction is necessary but some now maintain that the politburo emerging from the 17 th party congress may end up being more involved in routine decisionmaking than previous politburos broader politburo participation according to this view is more likely under the increasingly collective leadership that china has been moving toward in the years since chairman mao zedong as paramount leader effectively wielded vast decision making power13 with only one female memberthe newly appo inted liu yandongthe new politburo continues the prc tradition of maledominated decisi onmaking bodies four wellknown politburo members all born before 1940 stepped down from those positions at the 17th party congress they included wu yi frequent contact for us government officials and named by forbes in 2007 as the worlds second most powerful woman and three members of the politburo standing committee zeng qinghong chinas current vicepresident wu guanzheng primarily responsible for chinas anticorruption work and luo gan the only protégé of former premier li peng named to the previous 16th party congress politburo14 the retirements of these four suggest the seriousness of the prc leadership about mandatory retirement for politburo members at the age of 68 the establishment of unofficial retirement age requirements for party cadres at senior levels of leadership and the imposition of term limits for toplevel positions in the party and government have been part of the incremental political reforms prc leaders have made since 1978 the 17th congress demonstrated the partys continued willingness to adhere to these agreedupon requirements in the absence of statutory discipline or electoral fiat then the party appears to be counting on precedent to try to institutionalize leadership succession issues and avert potentially divisive power struggles 13 remarks by jing huang at the brookings institution chinas 17th party congress looking ahead to hu jintaos 2nd term october 30 2007 14 premier li peng achieved prominence in western accounts as the chief public spokesman for the central government during the tiananmen square crackdown of 1989 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22767g5g145g146g151g138g514g156g561g343 g349g157g145

psc the smaller group of elite party members that wields much of the political power in china the new 17th congress psc has nine members including five returning members and four new members of the latter twoxi jinping and li keqianghave been tipped as frontrunners to be hu jintaos successor as party secretary at the 18 th party congress in 2012 the two are the only psc members to have been born in the 1950s making them the first of the fifth generation of chinas potential leadership to rise to this level if accepted retirement practices hold true only these two will be young enough to remain in the politburo after the 18 th party congress all others will have to retire one expert holds that xi and li each sit at the pinnacle of what effectively is an equal psc split between two distinct leadership camps the populist group represented by li keqiang protegee of hu jintao and the elitist group represented by xi jinping one of the socalled princelingsmeaning child of one of the early senior officials of the chinese communist party and thus someone with elite personal connections 15 according to this analyst the populist group favors balanced economic development focus on improving the lots of the poor and disenfranchised and an emphasis on the principles of harmonious society the elitist group favors continued rapid and efficient economic development less emphasis on social issues and an emphasis on nurturing the entrepreneurial and middleclass populations according to news accounts li keqiang is close protégé of hu jintao and is his presumed preferred choice but xi jinping who has slightly higher ranking than li on the psc and is also the new head of the secretariat the front office of the politburo has emerged from the congress in slightly better position both xi and li have doctoral degrees in law and in economics respectively and thus bring different background and set of experiences to the prc leadership than the revolutionary generation of mao zedong or the technocratic generations of deng xiaoping and jiang zemin 15 cheng li ibid xi jinpings father was xi zhongxun top government official in early communist china the elder xi served as vicepremier

central military commission cmc the most senior military decisionmaking body in china as expected secretary hu jintao as head of the party remained the head of the cmc like its predecessor in the 16
