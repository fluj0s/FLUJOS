education act summary the rising cost of attending us colleges and universities is growing concern as most americans believe that college is out of financial reach for qualified students for federal policymakers concerns focus on issues of affordability access for low income students and whether federal student financial aid is keeping pace with rising prices this report presents the current status and historical trends of college costs with an emphasis on the prices undergraduate students are ultimately charged at the varying types of institutions of higher education and how they pay for postsecondary education using student financial aid college tuition and fees have been rising more rapidly than household income over the past two decades in 20052006 the average price charged for tuition fees room and board at fouryear public and private institutions was 17447 577 increase from 30 years ago on the basis of the mean household income of household in the bottom fifth of the population the price of college in 2005 was 713 of their income historically congressional involvement with issues of college costs and prices has focused on issues related to student access to postsecondary education however as congress has considered the reauthorization of the higher education act hea attention has been given to additional actions that could be taken at the federal level to address college costs and prices actions considered have included creating price indices providing incentives for controlling costs making it easier for students to earn college credits reducing regulatory burden and increasing the availability of relevant public information it is not clear which of these strategies would be most effective at addressing the issue of college costs or prices or whether some of these strategies would be more effective if implemented at the state or institutional level as congress continues to debate the reauthorization of the hea an expanded federal role

for reauthorization of the higher education act introduction the rising cost of attending us colleges and universities is growing concern as three out of five americans believe many qualified people will not have the opportunity to pursue college education and large majority of americans believe that the students who do make it to college have to borrow too much to go1 for students and their families these concerns raise questions as to whether they will be able to afford college education and whether their choice of postsecondary institutions is limited by price for federal policymakers concerns focus on issues of affordability access for lowincome students and whether federal student financial aid is keeping pace with rising prices the public lawmakers researchers and the higher education community offer numerous theories as to why the costs of providing college education continue to rise but there is little consensus as to either root causes or ways of mitigating the problem this report presents the current status and historical trends of college costs with an emphasis on the prices students are ultimately charged at the varying types of institutions of higher education ihes and how they pay for postsecondary education using student financial aid although prices are certainly an issue for graduate and professional education the focus of this report is on undergraduates particularly fulltime undergraduates2 college tuition and fees have been rising more rapidly than household income over the past three decades in the 19761977 school year the average price charged to students for tuition fees room and board at fouryear public and private institutions was 2577 in 20052006 it was 17447 577 increase3 looking at family resources to pay for college

households for households in the bottom fifth of the population their mean household income increased 5 from the mid1980s to the mid1990s and declined by 04 during the following decade in general complex set of factors affects college prices directly and indirectly making it hard to say definitively what are the underlying causes of price increases this complexity coupled with the tremendous diversity of institutions that constitute postsecondary schools makes it difficult to determine what can or should be done about the issue of rising college prices historically congressional involvement with issues of college costs and prices has focused on issues related to student access to postsecondary education however as congress has considered the reauthorization of the hea attention has been given to additional actions that could be taken at the federal level to address college costs and prices actions considered have included creating price indices providing incentives

available at httpwwwblsgov and us census bureau historical income tables households table h6 at httpwwwcensusgovhheswwwincomehistinch06arhtml and table h3 at httpwwwcensusgovhheswwwincomehistinch03arhtml crs3 definitions of cost and price in discussing how much it costs to attend college how much it costs to educate students or how much families need to save for college it is critical to distinguish between two concepts cost and price college costs generally refer to what institutions spend to provide education and educationalrelated services to students price commonly refers to what students and their families are charged for higher education and what they pay as discussed throughout this report these amounts are not necessarily the same three distinctions are frequently made in the definition of price first there is sticker price this is the tuition and fees that institutions charge eg the published price the second distinction is the total price of attendance which is often referred to as the cost of attendance coa5 this includes the tuition and fees that institutions charge students as well as other expenses related to attending that institution these expenses may include room and board for oncampus housing rent for offcampus housing books and transportation third distinction in the definition of price involves net price this is what students pay after financial aid is deducted from the total price of attendance educators and policy makers commonly look at the effects of net price in two ways the first is measure of affordability subtracting only grants from the total price of attendance loans remain in the total price of attendance for this measure as loans must ultimately be repaid by the student or students parents this may affect decisions to attend college if students and their families are considering the overall outofpocket today or future price of college attendance the second is measure of access subtracting all financial aid including loans from the total price of attendance this measure focuses on the amount of money student would need to attend college in given year without considering how much money will ultimately have to be repaid over time students generally are awarded financial aid based on merit or financial need these awards may take various forms including grants loans and subsidized work opportunities thus financial aid may increase access to postsecondary education but not necessarily reduce the ultimate price students will pay to attend for the purposes of this report the term price generally refers to the sticker price references are also made to net price but the specific net price measure considered depends on the data that were available for the analysis6 5 coa is used in determining federal student aid packages for more information on coa see crs report rl33266 federal student aid need analysis system background description and legislative action by charmaine mercer 6 an effort will be made to distinguish whether reference is being made to price net of grant aid only or to price net all student aid crs4 cost of college education few students in american higher education are asked to pay the full cost of their education although tuition and fees are an important source of revenue at all types of institutions other sources of revenue help defray the total costs and students are then asked to pay significantly less as shown in table 1 for public institutions the primary source of subsidy revenue is state appropriations and local appropriations for some community colleges and public institutions are increasingly relying on private philanthropic support and endowment income as well private nonprofit institutions rely heavily on donations income earned from endowments supplements from affiliated religious organizations and other sources of support private for profit institutions by contrast are most likely to be tuition dependent and to have few other sources of revenue two approaches to cost revenues and expenditures are discussed below because both are used in discussions of college costs however references to college costs in the remainder of this report refer to expenditures7 revenues sources of revenues for institutions of higher education have shifted over time and vary by type of institution table 1 shows revenue sources by institution type for 20032004 the most recent year for which data are available the greatest revenue source for public institutions was from state support amounting to 28 of revenues without large public appropriations private institutions are more tuition dependent than public colleges sixteen percent of public institutions revenues come from tuition and fees but approximately 29 of private notforprofits revenues and 90 of forprofits revenues are from student tuition in addition not forprofit institutions realize 35 of their revenues from private donations and endowment income the mix of revenue sources has also changed over time for public institutions of higher education direct state appropriations not including statefunded grants and contracts have risen from 190 billion in 19801981 to 539 billion in 20032004 but this represents decrease in share of revenues from 44 to 248 although state support has grown over the past 25 years public college budgets have grown faster and have come to depend more heavily on sources other than appropriations private support from donations and endowment income has grown from 3 of public college revenues in 19801981 to 7 in 200320049 even as colleges aggressively seek increased private support over the past two decades tuition has 7 the use of expenditures in this report as measure of college costs should not be interpreted to imply that these expenditures are necessarily efficient analysis or judgment about what it costs to provide service is made 8 ed digest 2006 table 339 9 ed

all sources expenditures economist howard bowen developed the revenue theory of costs the theory states that college revenues determine college expenditures that is institutions attempt to raise as much money as possible and then spend the money on various activities including teaching research administration and service according to this theory single standard could not be used to determine how much college should cost as colleges make expenditure decisions on the basis of their particular circumstances11 postsecondary institutions expenditures generally are grouped into several broad categories educational and general eg expenditures auxiliary enterprises 10 ibid 11 dw breneman an essay on college costs in us department of education national center for education statistics 2001

of expenditures in 20032004 sticker price of college education the price of higher education has increasingly become topic of both public and congressional debate it should be noted however that during the 20072008 academic year over half of fulltime undergraduates at all fouryear institutions attended institutions charging less than 9000 in tuition and fees17 at fouryear public institutions 45 of fulltime undergraduates attended institutions charging less than 6000 while 6000 or 9000 may still be more than most students can afford to pay the issue of price may be more productively viewed through this lens rather than one colored by the relatively high prices of the most selective institutions in the country only 9 of undergraduates attended institutions charging more than 30000 for tuition all of which are private institutions there are also public misconceptions about the price of college for example study conducted for the american council on education found that the general public substantially overestimates the price of tuition at public institutions in answering questions about the price of tuition the average respondent estimate put the price of tuition more than three times higher than the average actual price18 13 continued instruction are reported only for all private degreegranting institutions as opposed to being reported separately for private notforprofit and private forprofit institutions for 1980 1981 the percentage of expenditures on instruction for all private degreegranting institutions in 19801981 was 27 ed digest 2006 table 345 14

american council on education attitudes toward public higher education national survey results 2002 at httpwwwacenetedunewspress_release200202february nationaldatappt crs8 increases and decreases in tuition fees and financial aid may affect student access to college choice of schools affordability and ultimately the completion of degree or certificate program this section focuses on sticker price data on net price are discussed in subsequent section subsidizing costs the cost of educating college students exceeds the sticker price charged by institutions that is in general those students who pay the full price of their bills out of their own pockets do not pay actually pay the full amount it costs an institution to educate them institutions make up the difference between what students pay and the actual cost of providing an education through subsidy payments supported by other sources of revenue such as state appropriations endowment earnings private donations and federal grants both public and private institutions provide some level of subsidy to students19 to illustrate how the subsidy works assume that the cost of education at given institution is 1000020 the institution receives 8000 per student in state appropriations and charges 2000 in tuition thus each student is then facing tuition level of 20 of the actual cost21 thus all students even students who pay the full 2000 in tuition are subsidized as some researchers have noted increases in college price do not necessarily mean that costs have increased but could mean that source of revenue used to support the subsidy has decreased returning to the previous example suppose the next year that the state appropriation per student is reduced to 7000 while the cost of providing an education remains at 10000 tuition is raised to 3000 to accommodate the change in state appropriations thus each student now pays 30 of the actual cost but tuition has increased by 50 as discussed elsewhere in this report the proportion of revenue that institutions derive from tuition and fees has been increasing over time in the previous example the subsidy came simply from state appropriations which is the largest source of revenue for public institutions the largest source of funds for subsidizing education costs at private notforprofit institutions however 19 for more information on subsidies see for example gc winston higher educations costs prices and subsidies some economic facts and fundamentals in us department of education national center for education statistics 2001 study of college costs and prices 198889 to 199798 volume 2 commissioned papers at httpwwwncesedgov pubsearchpubsinfoasppubid2002157 hereafter cited as ed costs and prices volume 2 20 this analysis assumes that students do not receive grant loan or other types of student financial assistance beyond the subsidy 21 this assumes that the entire 8000 received in state appropriations for each student is used to offset the cost of providing education there is some debate in the literature about whether this actually occurs for example some researchers argue that revenue may be diverted for other purposes such as faculty or graduate student use see dw breneman an essay on college costs in ed costs and prices volume 2 crs9 is investment income from endowments and annual donations even public institutions are increasingly relying on philanthropic support for operations and capital projects by contrast private forprofit institutions are tuitiondependent and in keeping with their business model price the education they provide higher than cost in order to make profit instate versus outofstate tuition at public institutions the majority of this report focuses on instate tuition students and families tax dollars support public institutions in the form of appropriation subsidies to state colleges and universities public institutions then grant their state residents greater subsidy in the form of lower tuition than is provided to outofstate students who have not paid state taxes further state leaders contend that it is in the best interest of the state to educate its residents in order to subsequently realize longterm human capital gains thus to encourage attendance and increase access to higher education for state residents institutions charge lower price for instate residents than for outofstate residents although outofstate tuition is higher than that charged to resident students the differences in these two prices vary from state to state22 several states charge outof state students tuition at or near the full cost of instruction other states index non resident tuition to the price charged for resident students note that although non resident students are charged higher sticker price they still might be subsidized in other ways states and institutions often have pricing policies and scholarship aid designed to encourage resident students to stay or to encourage outofstate students to enroll price of attendance trends in tuition and required fees point to steady increases in current dollars over the past 30 years table 323 from 19761977 to 20052006 tuition at all institutions increased from 924 to 7601 an increase of 723 the rate of increase in tuition and fees was higher at fouryear institutions 744 and lower at twoyear institutions 599 an examination of institutions by control over the same time period reveals that tuition and fees at public institutions increased more rapidly than tuition and fees at private institutions among all public institutions tuition and fees rose 709 compared with 665 increase at private institutions 22 for more details about current outofstate tuition setting policies see state higher education executive officers 2006 state tuition

319 24 in this example fouryear public universities are used because continuous data are available for this type of institution universities are the subset of fouryear public institutions that are often the most prominent in the state consisting of an undergraduate college diverse graduate programs and professional schools regardless of recent mission expansions at some other fouryear institutions nces has not expanded the list of universities since 1982 25 crs calculations from data in ed digest 2006 table 319 26 note however that as tuition and fees increase over time subsequent increases in tuition and fees of the same dollar amount result in lower percentage increases for example if tuition and fees increased from 1000 to 2000 over 10 years an increase of 1000 or 100 subsequent 1000 increase over the next 10 years from 2000 to 3000 will result in only 50 increase in tuition and fees crs12 other ways of interpreting price in addition to simply viewing college prices and changes over time there are alternate ways of analyzing price one approach looks at price in relation to overall inflation increases second looks at price as percent of family incomes tuition and fees adjusted for inflation examining tuition using current dollars identifies changes in tuition over time but fails to take into account inflationary factors affecting college price adjusting college prices for inflation using an index such as the consumer price index for all urban consumers cpiu27 enables direct comparisons in college price to be made across years by adjusting all prices to be comparable with base year more simply adjusting for inflation means that the price of tuition in given year such as 19811982 has been recalculated to determine what the price of tuition that year would have been in todays dollars when increases in tuition are considered in constant dollars ie dollars adjusted for inflation the increase in tuition over the past 30 years is substantially lower see appendix table a1 from 19761977 to 20052006 the tuition increase in constant dollars for all institutions was 140 compared with an increase of 723 in current dollars similar differences in increases are evident for fouryear twoyear public and private institutions for example in constant dollars the increase in tuition at public fouryear institutions over this time period was 153 in constant dollars compared with 767 in current dollars an alternative method of using inflation to analyze price is to consider whether price increases are outpacing inflation whether annual percentage increases in tuition exceeds annual percentage increases in the cpiu any such increase that exceeds the inflation rate can be thought of as an increase that outpaces inflation from 19761977 to 20052006 average tuition at public and private institutions increased by 723 at fouryear institutions the growth has been even higher 744 while it was 599 at twoyear colleges by comparison the cpiu grew 243 from 1976 to 2005 by this estimation fouryear college tuition has risen by more than 3 times the rate of inflation over the past 30 years looking more specifically at yeartoyear changes figure 2 shows annual price increases for just one segment of higher education institutions public fouryear universities in comparison to annual changes in inflation 27 the cpiu is measure of the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for specific goods and services it is often used as proxy measure for the cost of living see crs report rl30074 the consumer price index brief overview

and board charges for all fouryear universities ed digest 2006 table 319 and inflation as measured by the cpiu bureau of labor statistics at httpwwwblsgovcpidata price as share of family income an alternate perspective is to consider college prices as share of family income researchers have found that family incomes have not kept pace with tuition increases particularly for the lowest income families28 this analysis focuses on overall mean household income and the mean household income of households in the lowest and highest 20 of households according to mean income as well as households in the middle of this distribution of mean income ie third or middle quintile the share that college prices represent relative to family income has been growing over the past two decades because tuition is increasing faster than income from the mid1980s to the mid1990s increases in tuition levels averaged across institutions were about four times higher than growth in mean household income while the discrepancy in growth diminished during the following decade tuition increases continued to outpace the growth in mean household income across public and private fouryear institutions and

degreegranting institutions was 12108 the average tuition fees room and board at private nonprofit and forprofit fouryear degreegranting institutions was more than twice this amount the difference in average tuition fees room and board charged by public and private fouryear degreegranting institutions was driven primarily by differences in average tuition and required fees 5351 versus 19292 respectively as the difference in average room and board between public and private fouryear degreegrant institutions was about 1300 the average tuition and fees at public twoyear degreegranting

and at private forprofit institutions 15700 influences on college costs and prices researchers have been studying the issue of tuition increases for many years on the basis of their work it has been determined that the price of postsecondary education is established in multiple ways and differs for public and private institutions because of limitations in the data however it has been difficult to determine specific internal and external factors that have strong relationship with price increases influences on costs researchers have studied whether institutional costs that is trends in the cost of items for which colleges and universities pay drive increases in price current analysis suggests that there is not strong relationship between costs colleges incur and price41 although evidence does not point to strong relationship it could be argued that revenue must cover or exceed institutional costs or an institution may go into debt researchers have determined however that most postsecondary institutions do not function like businesses with the notable exception of forprofit colleges the laborintensive nature of providing higher education makes it difficult to realize productivity gains for example increasing class sizes to reduce costs might result in decline in quality rather than an increase in productivity42 39 us department of education national center for

factors that drive institutional costs for example recent summary of relevant literature identified five primary cost drivers 1 revenue availability 2 institutional aid 3 mission and discipline 4 faculty compensation and workload policies and 5 class size43 other researchers have pointed to specific costs that institutions are facing including the provision of technology increasing health care costs burdens associated with government regulation facilities enrollment and student expectations44 more specifically for example the mission and discipline of an institution can have substantial cost ramifications as institutions with research programs graduate education and public service missions have higher costs than other institutions45 these costs may be even higher if the institution offers engineering or other science programs with laboratory components providing students faculty and staff with access to technology incurs infrastructure costs as well as costs associated with continual updating of hardware software and connections some institutions have imposed new technology fees to have students cover some of these costs establishing price at public institutions states differ in the basic philosophy that guides their decision making with respect to setting tuition levels for public institutions the majority of states have embraced philosophy of low tuition to maximize access to postsecondary education by making it as affordable as possible46 states that have adopted philosophy on the basis of higher levels of tuition on the other hand often provide substantial student financial aid to help ensure access for lowincome students primary authority to establish tuition levels may rest with the legislature state coordinating or governing agency individual system boards or individual institutions in 13 states the state coordinatinggoverning agency has the primary authority to establish tuition levels fourteen states delegate this power to individual institutions with varying levels of discretion while 26 states rely on individual 42 continued education 43 ed costs and prices volume 1 p 21 44 see house education and the workforce

appropriations have the most significant influence on this decision48 for most states there are formal incentives to limit tuition increases but many operate under informal incentives such as the desire to provide an affordable education49 states or institutions also may opt to place selfimposed limitations on tuition increases50 for example state higher education executive officers study found that 18 states had applied some type of limitation on tuition increases during the previous three fiscal years including capping tuition increases at certain percentage freezing tuition at specific level or indexing tuition to measure of inflation an ncescommissioned study examining college costs and price provides some evidence as to factors that may be related to tuition increases the specific factors differ according to the level and control of the institution at public fouryear institutions decline in state appropriations revenue was found to be the most important factor associated with changes in tuition according to the institute for higher education policy ihep the increase in price results from institutions attempting to maintain their total revenue when state appropriations decline51 an increase in instructional expenditures also was associated with changes in tuition but the relationship was not as strong at public twoyear institutions changes in revenues including state appropriations and expenditures accounted for only small proportion of changes in tuition this is attributed to overriding efforts by public twoyear institutions to maintain relatively low tuition these institutions often will opt to make other changes such as reducing courses eliminating programs or reducing services before they will increase price thus tuition changes at public twoyear and public fouryear institutions are affected by different factors state support for fy2006 state tax funds appropriated for higher education operating expenses eg colleges and universities student aid governing boards totaled 672 billion52 this represented an overall increase of 71 in appropriated funds from the previous year and 144 increase in appropriated funds from 47 ibid note that states may have identified more than one tuitionsetting authority reflecting differences in policy among various state institutions 48 see for example sheeo state tuition and fees ihep reauthorizing

available at httpwwwgrapevineilstuedufifty_state_summaryhtm appropriations for capital outlays and debt service are not included in the total amounts reported by states in addition appropriation of funds derived from federal sources student fees auxiliary enterprises and other nontax sources were also excluded crs26 fy2004 looking at trends over time from fy1996 to fy2006 overall state appropriations increased 547 with increases in appropriations occurring in every state for which data were available53 when states contend with serious financial difficulties resulting in smaller increases in support for higher education than in previous years or outright reductions in support for higher education public institutions are affected by these decisions substantial decline in state appropriations especially at fouryear institutions may lead to large percentage or dollar increases in tuition or both regardless of whether the actual cost of providing the education also increases in addition as enrollment in higher education continues to increase per student appropriations may be reduced if corresponding increases are not made in state appropriations for higher education research has shown that changes in revenues and expenditures do not have as substantial an effect on tuition at public twoyear institutions these institutions may maintain current tuition levels or eliminate the need for large tuition increases by reducing course offerings services or enrollment these types of changes ultimately may be restricting access to postsecondary education as there may be fewer seats or services available this could be particularly troublesome for lowincome students nontraditional students and individuals seeking to return to school for additional training decreases in state appropriations may also mean less money is available to support institutional aid which may in turn reduce student access to postsecondary education for example institutions that rely on state appropriations to offer institutional aid may find that they need to shift money that would have been used to provide aid to other purposes they might use available state appropriations to affect tuition levels rather than using state appropriations to support student aid although this practice may be beneficial to all students in terms of the price of college low income students dependent on institutional aid may longer receive needed support establishing price at private institutions in discussion of primarily nonpublic institutions ihep divides the nonpublic sector into three markets 1 highly selective institutions predominantly private notforprofit institutions as well as few highly selective public institutions 2 competitive institutions and 3 proprietary institutions54 highly selective institutions are primarily private notforprofit institutions that experience excess demand for their available openings these institutions tend to compete against one another on the basis of nonprice mechanisms such as institutional reputation they generally have similar prices and often have higher levels of institutional wealth than other types of institutions55 53 ibid 54 ihep reauthorizing hea p 116117 55 in the 1980s the us department of justice launched an investigation into possible antitrust violations by private institutions the primary focus of the investigation was on continued crs27 competitive institutions also compete with their peer institutions but on regional rather than national level they tend to compete through nonprice mechanisms and tuition discounting for specific groups of students prices within specific group of peer institutions tend to cluster in narrow range less is known about proprietary institutions however by definition these for profit institutions exist to make profit as previously discussed tuition is their primary source of revenue so the costs of educating students at these institutions may be more closely related to price than at other types of institutions the nces study examining college costs and prices found that factors affecting tuition at private notforprofit fouryear institutions are more varied56 that is unlike public fouryear institutions single factor is strongly related to tuition changes rather prices at private notforprofit fouryear institutions are driven by internal institutional budget controls and external market conditions among the internal factors associated with higher tuition were higher costs for institutional aid and faculty salaries and declining revenues from endowments and private giving among the external factors associated with tuition changes were the availability of institutional aid price of public institutions in the same state and per capita income in the state tuition discounting and net price tuition discounting is practice by which institutions charge students less than the sticker price this is intended to increase net revenue attract minority students increase enrollment or attract academically talented students57 it is unclear whether this strategy ultimately accomplishes these goals for example one question focuses on whether reductions in tuition provided for students who are able to pay based on formulas such as the expected family contribution efc but are unwilling to pay the sticker price results in enrollment in the institution that otherwise would not have 55 continued the 23 institutions including all of the ivy league universities composing the overlap group which met annually to compare financial aid offers made to students admitted to two or more member institutions as result of the suit the institutions discontinued their collaboration with respect to financial aid packages through the higher education act however congress has authorized an exemption for institutions that do not consider familys ability to pay in making admissions decisions needblind admissions to permit them to discuss their financial aid policies the exemption currently is approved until 2008 pl 10772 56 the nces study only included private notforprofit fouryear institutions private not forprofit twoyear

health tuition discounting and enrollment management in ed costs and prices volume 2 crs28 occurred potentially contributing to net revenue another issue focuses on whether by subsidizing students able to pay to attend college funds are being diverted from needy students or from improvements in academic programs or services third issue focuses on whether the practice of tuition discounting causes institutions to raise prices knowing that many students will not pay the full sticker price ultimately last the question remains whether an alternative strategy of acrosstheboard reductions in price to the level at which tuition is generally discounted would result in increased enrollment increased net revenue or recruitment of the desired student body recent study conducted by the lumina foundation examined the use of tuition discounting58 researchers state that the practice does work successfully at some institutions but that when institutional aid practices are examined across all institutions tuition discounting has some adverse financial effects on lowincome students in terms of accessibility and affordability for example researchers suggest that if institutions use financial resources to attract students that could afford to pay to attend then institutions had fewer funds to provide institutional support to low income students researchers support this argument on the basis of data from the national postsecondary student aid study which show that between 19951996 and 20002001 institutional grant aid for higherincome undergraduates rose more quickly than for lowerincome undergraduates at fouryear institutions the lumina foundation study also found that the use of tuition discounting does not always produce the desired result of increased net revenue nor does it necessarily lead to the recruitment of the most academically talented students based on the median sat scores of the students attending institutions using tuition discounting federal policy effects on college price in analyzing college prices researchers have considered whether relationship exists between federal aid and price increases although federal grant aid does not seem to affect college prices directly less is known about the effects of federal loans and tax credits direct relationship between loans and higher tuition has not been identified but an indirect relationship may exist with respect to tax credits limited evidence suggests that relationship may exist under certain circumstances federal financial aid and sticker price federal student aid takes many forms including grants loans and education tax credits concerns have been raised by researchers interest groups and some members of congress about whether increased federal aid contributes to increasing college price debate about whether federal financial aid provides incentives for tuition increases was widespread in the 1980s59 by the 1990s much of the debate had narrowed to focus on the relationship if any between federal loan aid and price 58 lumina foundation for education unintended consequences of tuition discounting may 2003 at httpwwwluminafoundationorgpublicationstuitiondiscountingpdf 59 ed costs and prices volume 1 crs29 students apply for federal grants and loans using the free application for federal student aid fafsa form based on information reported on the fafsa ed calculates the efc in general most institutions use the efc to determine students financial need by determining the difference between the price of attendance and the efc since this calculation takes the price of attendance into account direct relationship between federal aid and price only would be likely if increased financial need resulted in increased federal aid however federal grant and loan aid are capped at specific amounts60 these amounts generally are lower than the price of attendance at many institutions thus an incentive for institutions to increase their price in anticipation of students receiving additional financial aid may exist for institutions with relatively low prices but it is not as clear that this is so at institutions whose price already exceeds available federal aid61 according to one of the major recent reviews of research in general research has shown that relationship exists between federal grants and college prices62 research on the relationship between federal student loans and tuition however has been less conclusive with some researchers believing that there may be an indirect relationship between federal student loans and college price for example institutions may raise prices knowing that students can apply for loans to cover tuition increases institutions then may use revenue from tuition increases to provide additional institutional aid to make it possible for some students to access and afford the price of college at the same time increased loan availability could reduce the need for institutions to increase price to generate revenue to provide institutional aid because students can receive aid in the form of loans thus it is difficult to determine whether federal student loan programs are contributing to tuition increases in its examination of college costs and prices nces found virtually associations between price and most student aid variables including federal grants and loans and tuition the only association that was identified was that institutional aid had positive association with tuition increases at comprehensive public institutions and comprehensive private notforprofit institutions63 this could be related to institutions increasing tuition to increase revenue to provide institutional aid to students thus in the nces study federal grants and loans were not found to have positive relationship with tuition increases 60 for more information about federal grants and loans see for example crs report rl30655 federal student loans terms and conditions for borrowers by adam stoll and crs report rl31668 federal pell grant program of the higher education act background and reauthorization by charmaine mercer 61 incentives for price increases also may be created when grant and loan limits are increased and an institution currently charges price below these levels 62 ed costs and prices volume i 63 for the purposes of this study the researchers developed modified version of the carnegie classification codes comprehensive institutions include institutions offering full range of bachelors programs that are also committed to graduate education through the masters degree these institutions award 20 or more masters degrees annually in one or more disciplines crs30 federal tax legislation and sticker price limited data are available about the effect of federal tax credits on tuition increases64 recent government accountability office study concluded that data and methodological challenges make it difficult to identify and isolate the effects of tax credits as well as grants and loans on attendance choice completion or costs65 in recent survey of state higher education agencies few states reported raising tuition in response to new tax credits or taking federal tax credits into account when calculating student aid eligibility66 most states reported taking advantage of opportunities to create taxadvantaged state prepayment or college savings plan and many states indicated they publicize the availability of federal tax credits to help finance college however an analysis of the effect of tax credits on state support for higher education and changes in college prices found that relationship does exist between tax credits and state appropriations and tax credits and price under certain circumstances67 for example the study found that when other factors were held constant state appropriations to public twoyear institutions charging less than 2000 fell relative to other institutions after the introduction of tax credits at the same time states that had developed track record of supporting student aid programs continued to support and possibly bolster these programs despite the availability of additional federal aid at the institution level incentives existed for institutions to increase their prices for students who benefitted from the tax credits that is the tax credits increased student income providing students with more money to pay for college evidence indicates that public twoyear colleges raised prices higher than what could be explained by fluctuations in state appropriations and the increases were greater at schools with higher percentages of tax crediteligible students68 64 the aforementioned nces study of college costs and prices did not include federal tax credits in its analysis 65 government accountability office then called general accounting office september 2002 student aid and tax benefits better research and guidance will facilitate

the state and institutional levels congress may include provisions related to college costs and prices in hea reauthorization legislation but there are also steps to increase affordability that could be taken or are being taken by states and institutions that could either complement federal actions or minimize the need for federal action in some areas69 this section provides several examples of strategies currently being implemented by states and institutions to address issues of college costs and price more specifically the overview focuses on three key areas 1 tuition and fees 2 reducing costs and 3 college credits tuition and fees states and institutions have taken variety of approaches to making college more affordable for students for example harvard university and the university of virginia have eliminated tuition and fees for students whose family incomes fall below specified level70 colorado implemented voucher system that provides directs stipends to students for tuition payments71 arizona mississippi and new york are considering or implementing tuition policies that link tuition increases to increases in measures of inflation72 for example the former chancellor at the state university of new york suny proposed tying tuition increases to the higher education price index hepi discussed below other states have proposed freezing tuition and fees at certain level for specific number of years for example illinois implemented strategy to keep tuition at constant level for four years for each entering class beginning fall 200473 and similar policies are being or have been considered in other states such as kansas texas and indiana74 under policy that locks in tuition the tuition charged to cohort of freshman students will remain constant for four years or more this enables families to plan for the price of college essentially making payment for college education similar to mortgage payment that can be anticipated monthly questions have been raised about tuition freeze proposals including concerns that there will be substantial differences in the price charged from one cohort to another 69 for examples of recommendations of state and

reducing costs many states and institutions have already taken the initiative to reduce costs75 for example with respect to health care institutions have formed their own healthcare consortia linked employee contributions to health care costs to salary meaning that staff members with higher salaries pay more and focused on employee wellness to achieve costs savings76 other institutions have focused on finding cost savings by sharing other services for example five colleges in massachusetts built their own fiberoptic network rather than paying high fees for broadband internet service77 institutions in wisconsin formed consortia to share office functions while enhancing services at reduced cost78 some institutions have accepted greater financial risks in exchange for likely longterm savings79 for example institutions are raising insurance deductibles and altering borrowing strategies to get better interest rates while assuming more risk others are considering energy efficiency in their building designs and renovations to achieve longterm savings80 more widespread costsaving initiative is to replace tenured fulltime faculty with lowerpaid parttime faculty81 some institutions have instituted differential tuition levels whereby students in more expensive programs eg engineering are charged higher tuition institutions are also outsourcing services82 although this has been done for number of years with respect to bookstores and food services institutions have now started to outsource facility management oncampus housing payroll and printing83 college credits one of the major areas in which states and institutions are focusing their efforts to reduce college costs and the total price of college attendance is with respect to enabling students to earn college credits prior to college attendance and ensuring that credits earned at one institution will be accepted at another institution according to data collected by the education commission of the states ecs dual enrollment policies have been implemented through state statute board 75 as previously discussed as institutions implement strategies to reduce costs the general concern is reduction in the quality of the education and services provided to students 76 gose g colleges rely on consortia contractors and ingenuity to cut costs the chronicle of higher education january 27 2006 hereafter referred to as

levels of performance on the related tests texas recently implemented law that provides students graduating from texas high school with an ib diploma and specific scores on the ib exams with at least 24 semester credits upon enrollment in texas public ihe85 all states have some type of agreement with respect to the transfer of credit86 these agreements may be established by legislation or created voluntarily on coursebycourse departmenttodepartment or institutiontoinstitution basis often these agreements are created between twoyear institutions and fouryear institutions to facilitate the transfer of credit as students move from one type of institution to the next they may also exist solely among fouryear institutions twoyear institutions group of institutions or just two institutions the more extensive the agreement in terms of the number of institutions included the greater the benefit to the student some states have enhanced their articulation agreements by establishing set of general education core curriculum requirements general education core curriculum generally refers to set of courses that fulfill lowerdivision general education requirements at all institutions participating in the core curriculum system some states have adopted common general education courses while others have identified blocks of courses that are guaranteed to transfer from one institution to another overall 37 states have general education common core courses that transfer from one institution to another under specific circumstances87 the completion of these requirements often carries some type of benefit such as transferring from twoyear institution into fouryear institution with junior status nine states have also developed common course numbering88 having common course numbers at twoyear and fouryear institutions makes it more likely that students will enroll in courses that will ultimately transfer from one institution to another89 84 hale g 2001

and has continued through the 110th congress during this time congress has held numerous hearings on and introduced and passed bills addressing affordability and accessibility issues clearly there are concerns about students and their families ability to afford college and consequently their ability to access postsecondary education opportunities congressional involvement with the issue of college price has historically been limited focusing on issues of access this raises the question of what the appropriate federal role is if any in relation to college prices concomitantly second question of whether congress has tools at its disposal that will effectively address issues of college price and cost can be asked key issue is how to develop and implement effectively federal policy related to college price given the diversity of institutions policies and price drivers affecting those institutions nationwide90 regardless of the approach ultimately selected congress faces the need to balance concerns about affordability and access with the goal of maintaining high quality system of postsecondary education price indices traditionally congress has not embraced policy role with respect to the prices charged by public and private institutions choosing instead to address issues of access and affordability from the student financial aid perspective however proposals for indexing increases in college price to some measure have been introduced in the 108th 109th and 110th congresses91 for example proposals have been introduced that would compare an institutions percentage increase in tuition and fees against two times the increase in the consumer price indexall urban consumers cpiu and require institutions whose percentage increase in tuition and fees exceeded two times the increase in the cpiu to submit to additional reporting requirements or other penalties congressional debate may continue to focus on the use of price indices as means to temper anticipated increases in tuition when considering the implementation of price index requirement perhaps the most obvious issue is what to select as the measure to which tuition and fees will be indexed three options have been considered in recent years the first is the cpiu produced by the bureau of labor statistics bls the cpiu is measure of changes in the price of market basket of goods and services purchased for consumption by all urban consumers92 bls also produces indices that make it possible to examine changes in the price of college textbooks and college tuition and fees although these items have not been included in single index93 90 ncc college costs prices p 21 the national commission on the cost of higher education argues against onesizefitsall approach for reducing price or controlling costs 91 see for example s 1642 in the 110th congress and hr 609 and s 1614 in the 109th congress 92 for more information see httpwwwblsgovcpihomehtmoverview 93 these indices may be calculated at httpdatablsgovpdqoutsidejspsurveycu crs35 second measure that has been discussed is the higher education price index hepi94 the hepi was created in 1961 by dr kent halstead and was first published by the us department of education in 1975 since 2005 the hepi has been managed by the commonfund institute95 according to the commonfund the hepi measures the average relative level in the prices of fixed market basket of goods and services purchased by colleges and universities through current fund educational and general expenditures excluding expenditures for research96 the hepi is calculated using regression formula that includes professional salaries eg faculty and administrative salaries nonprofessional wages and salaries eg clerical salaries fringe benefits contracted services supplies and materials and utilities97 it functions as tool to examine the purchasing power of colleges and universities that is by reporting only price changes without quality or quantity changes the index essentially tells institutions how much it will cost to maintain the status quo although there are several differences between the cpiu and the hepi two in particular are worth considering first as previously discussed most spending by colleges and universities is for personnel primarily faculty salary increases for postsecondary education personnel are different from those included in the cpiu which includes urban wage earners and salaried clerical workers in addition the hepi focuses specifically on goods and services purchased by colleges and universities while the cpiu also includes housing transportation medical care and other items while the cpiu does have separate index for tuition and fees for example this index has not been considered for use in hea reauthorization bills that have been reported out of committee in recent years finally the third index option that has been considered is to create indices using market basket of higher education goods and services possibly having different index for different types of institution on the basis of level and control it is unclear exactly how this type of index would be different from the hepi for example except that the indices may be designed to further account for distinctions among different types of institutions second difficulty associated with using price indices is related to differences between 1 percentage increases in price and 2 dollar increases in price if certain percentage increase is set as limit in price increases institutions with relatively low tuition may be penalized for making small changes in the actual dollar amount being charged to students while institutions with already high tuition levels may be able 94 the discussion of the hepi is based on information available from the commonfund college and university higher education price index 2004 update at httpwwwcommonfundorgtemplatesinvestorservicesresource_request targetpdfres_guid2ce78a523b5640e68744cce745989978 hereafter referred to as commonfund hepi 95 the commonfund institute focuses on providing nonprofit organizations with investment information and professional development programs it is the education and research arm of the commonfund an investment firm 96 commonfund hepi p 16 97 hepi was originally based on 25 budget components that were organized in 8 categories eg professional salaries nonprofessional wages contracted services utilities crs36 to make relatively small percentage increases resulting in relatively large dollar increases without penalty similar problems could arise from establishing specific dollar increase as price increase limit one possible way to address these problems in part would be to establish an index by which to evaluate percentage increases in tuition and fees while including an exception for institutions for whom violation of the established requirement is associated with relatively small dollar increase in tuition and fees another issue to consider is that depending on the implementation timeline of such policy in the years just prior to the policy taking place institutions nationwide may seize on their last opportunities to have relatively large tuition and fee increases in dollars percentages or both without being subject to penalties controlling college costs college costs as previously discussed refer to what institutions actually expend to educate students in examining ways to reduce price increases experienced by students some attention has been given to reducing college costs as means to reduce the need for institutions to increase their prices one problem with this approach is the subsidy that students at public and nonprofit institutions receive even students paying the sticker price to attend college are not paying what it actually costs institutions to educate them therefore it is possible that institutions may raise their prices to reduce the subsidy provided to students rather than to address an actual increase in costs congress has proposed addressing college prices via college costs through incentive programs for example demonstration program could provide grants to consortia of institutions working together to reduce costs eg by sharing administrative functions or purchasing health care collectively98 as previously discussed institutions are already forming these consortia on their own but it is possible that more consortia would be formed if incentives to do so existed it might also be useful to examine the levels of costs savings and areas in which cost savings have been achieved by existing consortia to help determine how to structure an effective incentive encouraging institutions to control costs might be more appealing and more feasible than other routes for controlling price increases but these strategies may not have as large an impact on prices as desired as productivity gains in laborintensive enterprises are difficult to obtain in addition efforts to control costs could inadvertently result in diminished quality and quantity of courses programs and services finally providing funding directly to institutions as incentives to increase college affordability rather than to students through the federal student aid system has not been the primary traditional role of the federal government in higher education in general however congress has not focused as intensively on college costs as it has on college prices but it could be argued that college costs could be addressed indirectly by legislation focused on college prices that is by encouraging institutions to reduce their price increases institutions may find it necessary to also reduce their cost increases 98 for example see s 371 in the 109th congress crs37 earning college credits another approach to making college more affordable for students focuses on the development of articulation agreements the transfer of credits dual enrollment and programs to help students finish their coursework although many of these proposals also represent actions that could be taken by states and institutions congress may continue to examine ways to encourage these practices these types of measures may result in cost savings to institutions and reduce the overall price students pay for higher education for example articulation agreements also known as cooperative agreements transfer agreements and transfer of credit agreements are generally established to facilitate students transfer of credit from one postsecondary institution to another they are intended to help students understand which of their credits may be accepted at another institution reduce the time effort and money required to review transcripts and determine compatibility between courses reduce the number of courses that student may need to repeat thereby saving the student time and money and potentially reduce the amount of federal aid needed by student to complete an education99 congress could also consider addressing the transfer of credit issue more specifically by requiring institutions to make public their transfer of credit policies or place restrictions on these policies such as prohibiting institutions from denying the transfer of credit on the basis of the accreditation held by the sending institution100 while transfer of credit requirements may be helpful to students in many of the same ways that articulation agreements are beneficial they may also result in increased costs at ihes that had previously made decisions about the transfer of credit on the basis of the accreditation held by the sending institution that is if ihes were required to examine every transfer applicants transcripts on an individual basis it could increase the amount of time and effort needed to make determination about the transfer of credit these costs could potentially be passed on to students resulting in increased tuition and fees the use of articulation agreements however could help to reduce these potential burdens and widely publishing institutions transfer of credit policies may help students make more informed decisions about their postsecondary education 99 for example hr 2739 and hr 2960 in the 109th congress would have established articulation agreement demonstration programs s 1642 in the 110th congress would require institutions to provide to current and prospective students list of other institutions with which they have established articulation agreements 100 for examples of proposed transfer of credit policies see s 1642 in the 110th congress and hr 609 and s 1614 in the 109th congress for more information about transfer of credit issues see crs report rl32989 accreditation and reauthorization of the higher education act by rebecca r skinner and jody feder crs38 relieving regulatory burden regulations encompass requirements that function as control strategies eg accountability measures but these regulations often add to the costs institutions shoulder in providing higher education to students postsecondary institutions and some researchers have agreed that institutions may already be overburdened by regulation most agree that public accountability is essential but there are questions about whether public accountability could be maintained through less costly and cumbersome measures and whether the related savings would be passed on to students for example performancebased models and requirements could be implemented allowing institutions to determine how to meet specific requirements rather than specifying both standards and procedures for meeting standards congress has previously considered implementing demonstration program that would have supported innovative approaches in the delivery of higher education and student financial aid at reduced costs for students and institutions101 specific goal of the program would have been to identify specific statutory and regulatory requirements that should be modified to allow for the more efficient and effective delivery of federal student aid as well as to provide access to distance education to enable students to complete their postsecondary education more efficiently it is possible that continued consideration may be given to relieving regulatory burden as congress continues work on hea reauthorization102 providing better public information another possible approach to the issues of price and cost is to provide potential and current students with more and better information about these issues enabling them to make more informed decisions about their postsecondary education that is providing information to enable the higher education market to operate more efficiently without controls or incentives some information is available to the general public through various college guides and websites but concerns have been raised by researchers that there is not enough information available it has also been suggested that data related to college costs and price should be designed to be useful accurate timely and understandable on the basis of the bills already introduced by congress related to these issues103 congress may continue to consider how to make better information more readily available to current and prospective students while congress may consider addressing the need for more useful information to be made available to the public eg additional data on instructional expenditures completion and graduation rates or faculty information it might do so by building on existing data collection strategies current legislation mandates that the national center for education statistics nces collect data from postsecondary institutions and that institutions respond to the integrated postsecondary education data system ipeds surveys in timely manner there are some concerns however that 101 see for example hr 609 in the 109th congress 102 see for example hr 3746 in the 110th congress 103 see for example s 1642 and hr 3746 in the 110th congress and hr 609 and s 1614 in the 109th congress crs39 institutions do not respond appropriately to ipeds104 in addition there are time lags between when the data are collected and released to the public this could be problem however with any data collection designed to include the universe of institutions in addition existing hea legislation requires institutions to provide current and prospective students and their families with variety of institutional information105 while institutions are required to tell enrolled students what information is available congress could consider strengthening existing requirements by specifying how data must be presented in terms of userfriendly formats and how individuals must be notified about the existence of the data and how to easily obtain it there also is discussion of adding additional accountability measures for institutions if these measures are added provisions could be made to ensure that this information is made available to students and their families the us department of education currently maintains an online database of information about postsecondary institutions known as the college navigator106 congress could use the college navigator as one venue for making any additional information about postsecondary institutions available to the public and could consider whether changes are needed in the design of the website or in the information presented on the current site to improve the usefulness of the data 104 in july 2003 ed announced that about 470 institutions had failed to complete at least one of the 10 ipeds surveys in august 2003 ed announced that it was fining about 80 institutions 105 hea section 485 106 the college navigator was formerly known as the college opportunities
