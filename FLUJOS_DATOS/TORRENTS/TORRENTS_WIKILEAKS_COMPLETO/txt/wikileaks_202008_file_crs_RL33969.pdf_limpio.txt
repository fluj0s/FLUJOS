ida lend directly to governments to finance projects and programs ida was established in 1960 16 years af ter the creation of the world bank to address concern that the poorest countries could not afford to borrow at the near market rate terms offered by the ibrd consequently ida was established as revolving fund providing concessional loan s to the poorest countries subsidized by donor contributions and transfers from the ibrd ida assistance is highly discounted it is increasingly provided as grants and only available to lowincome member countries since ida provides loan s and grants to the poorest countries at subsidized rates its resources must be periodically replenishe d donor nations have replenished ida 14 times since its founding on march 5 2007 donor nations began

replenishment of funds for the world banks the bank cessional lending facility the international development association ida this is the first replenishment since the 2005 g8 summit at the gleneagles resort in sco tland where world leaders proposed the creation of the multilateral debt relief initiative mdri the mdri cancels the remaining debt of the worlds poorest countries and pledges to double the amount of aid to subsaharan africa between 2004 and 2010 primarily in the form of grant based assistance1 it is also the first replenishment since the 2005 paris declaration on aid harmonization in which ida and over 100 ot her signatories agreed to increase coordination among donors in an effort to ra ise aid effectiveness the declaration was prompted by concerns that aid is in effective under the current structure the lack of coordination of donors on the one hand and the increasing restrictions on projects themselves through donor earmarks and time limits on the ot her have raised the cost and difficulty for implementing foreign aid according to one foreign aid expert managing aid flows from many different donors is huge challenge for recipient countries since di fferent donors usually insist on using their own unique processes for initiating implementing and monitoring projects recipients can be overwhelmed by requirements for multiple project audits environmental assessments procurement re ports financial statemen ts and project updates2 thus the role of ida in the international aid architecture has emerged as the dominant theme of the ida15 negotiations higher levels of debt relief will lead to lower levels of ida assistance unless donors increase their contributions signif icantly over the next several years according to bank economists and outside expert s some argue that by forgiving the repayment of debt owed to ida the ba nk has substantially reduced the amount of money it has to fund new operations th bank asserts that without additional compensation from donors and an increase in regular contributions idas future commitments would remain flat in nominal terms and decrease by 2 per year in real terms concerted effort toward aid coordination would likely result in higher levels of ida fundinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33969crs2 3 andrew powell and matteo bobba multilateral intermediation of foreign aid what is the tradeoff for

and cons of providing foreign assistance through multilateral organizations rather than solely on bilateral basis in addition to the aid fragmentation problem discussed earlier it is believed by many that multilateral aid is more effective since it is likely to be better insulated from political pressure than bilateral assistance in the world banks case since the banks ch arter disallows its involvement in the domestic politics of any of its member nations many analysts believe that the bank has greater degree of credibility among borrower nations and is thus better able to secure often difficult and economically painful reforms3 furthermore some analysts argue that major benefit of the world banks multilateral assistance is that the bank is not directly subject to th often shifting prior ities of individual donor nations and is thus able to focus on longterm multisectoral development assistance for example some point out that the current international focus on combating hivaids and other infectious diseases may have implicati ons for cost of service of other healthcare programs drugs and availability of resources in addition to possible braindrain as doctors and medical professionals switch focus to work for programs with higher profile and greater availability of funding in these cases the world bank often plays an important ro by focusing on countrys overall development needs through their country assistance strategies and continuing to provide assistance to all sect ors of countrys economy on the other hand some analysts raise cerns that the united states loses too much control over the provision of its aid with multilateral approach first they argue it is very difficult for donors to earmark funds when they are contributed multilaterally if other donors are not in br oad support of the us aid agenda the united states might be able to achieve its foreign policy objectives more directly by providing bilateral aid through the us agency for international development usaid or another us agency second since the united states does not have veto power on world bank lending the bank so metimes provides assistance to countries despite strong us opposition for example the world bank has several loan projects in iran country that the united st ates has designated as statesponsor of international terrorism although congre ss requires the united states to oppose any world bank loan to iran or any other country sodesignated by the state department since the united states does not have veto seve ral projects to iran have gone through over the past few year s most recently the world bank approved 224 million water supply and sanitation project in may 2005 currently the world bank has ten active projects in iran worth 136 billion4

and programs the ibrd provides middleincome devel oping countries with loans at near market rates using funds raised by th world bank on the international capital markets while many of these countri can borrow on the international capital markets and are increasingly doing so some seek loans from the world bank to gain access to world bank technical assistance and advisory services as well as the prestige and perceived legitimacy that come with world bankbacked projects ida was established in 1960 16 years af ter the creation of the world bank due to concerns that lowincome countries coul d not afford to borrow at the nearmarket rate terms offered by the world bank6 consequently ida was established as revolving fund providing concessional loan s to the poorest countries and subsidized by

and ida14 20062008 total resources for ida have increased on average 95 per year in nomin terms over the threeyear ida14 period ida will provide 33 billion in cessional assistance in real terms however since ida6 19811984 availabl resources for ida have been flat figure 1 source world bank the donor replenishment process donor contributions account for over 70 of all resources available for ida providing about 138 billion the remai nder is funded by internal ida resources primarily principal repayments from i da borrowers and transfers from ibrd net income internal resources have account ed for about 46 billion of idas funding while transfers from the ibrds net inco and budget surplus have provided 117 billion to ida as of the end of the world banks fy2006 ida s total assets were 1029

millionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33969crs5 9 the establishment of ida meant the reco gnition that there was legitimate need for concessional assistance and that the bank could provide this assistance without compromising its strict standards for nding however ida with its periodic replenishments by member governments meant that the bank had to pay increasing attention to the views and priorities of th parliamentary bodies that provided the replenishment funds whereas the bank had pr eviously to consider only the productive and economic aspects of lending now the internal politics of the shareholding governments began to play larger role in the banks activities world bank profile of its third president eugene r black cited in aid architecture every three years ida donors meet to negotiate the terms of new round of ida since 1960 there have been 14 such replenishments negotiations for the 15th round began march 5 2007 at the replen ishment donors revisit the overall amount of ida financing for the round in ddition the replenishment is the primary opportunity for donor nations to in fluence world bank policy making9 for the united states ida contributions are typica lly the largest component of the annual us contributions to the international financial institutions ifis ida replenishments comprise two distinct phases negotiating the replenishment round and annual contributions first th donor nations negotia the overall amount of threeyear replenishment indivi dual donor contributions and general policy considerations for the round following this each member country seeks annual contributions typically through its legislative process to meet their ida commitments for the united states participation in any given ida replenishment requires congressional authorization of the total ida package following this authorization the president seeks annual appropriations to the us share of each round this bifurcated process where the executive branch commits to overall replenishment amount prior to annual cont ributions are appropr iated has led to an arrearage problem since th united states is obligat ed to contribute the amount agreed to at the replenishment congress authorizes us participation in the replenishment agreement including the terms of that agreement when it authorizes funding for us contributi ons to the plan the constitution does not require however that congre ss appropriate the sums necessary to meet the terms of international agreement negotiated by the executive branch and authorized by congress us arrears to ida are 3779 million these arrears have had bandwagon effect unpaid us contributions have triggered prorata withholding of contributions during ida12 and ida13 by three other ida donors totaling about 72

multilateral aid idas share of multila teral oda declined from 42 in the 1970s to an average of 20 in the 20012005 period12 the primary cause of this decline is the increasing fragmentation of donor

critics and supporters of the mdbs have cited need to better measure the performance of world bank projects criticism often voiced by the us administration is that it is unclear what mdb assistance

the new york times july 27 2003the focus on performance requirements nd measurable results follows from analysis undertaken by world bank economists that suggested that foreign aid such as that provided by the world bank is mo st effective for countries that have good policies according to the report aid has positive impact on growth in developing countries with good fiscal monetary and trade policies in the pres ence of poor policies on the other hand aid has positive effect on growth emphasis added16 the notion that effective aid is c onditional on underlying economic policy performance has become central to the bush administrations foreign aid strategy and policy toward the world bank the bu sh administration s made measuring results and performancebased allocation central to us foreign assistance and has made the practice of these ideas central to the operations of new foreign aid initiative the millennium challenge account mca17 reportedly this plan was based heavily on world bank research18 most analysts agree that improvements in health and edu cation levels good governance reduced corruption increased opportunities for private enterprise and improvements in the trade capacity and inve stment climate are n ecessary in order to raise quality of life and the st andard of living in developi ng countries some argue however that the obstacles that block pr ogress in these areas are substantial and much effort and time may be needed to realize gains furthermore the administrations emphasis on growth may be g the question of income distribution it is unclear how the administrations empha sis on growth fits with the assertion by the mdbs and their executive boards that poverty alleviation should be the mdbs principal goals introducing stronger performance requi rements thus became one of the administrations most sought after goals at ida building on the new results measurement system the us administration would like to channel more ida resources to the strongest performing count ries this would mirror new domestic us foreign assistance programs such as the millennium challenge corporation mcc that were designed with perform ancebased allocation strictly in mind the ida14 performance measurement syst em is twofold assessing both 1 progress on aggregate country outcomes and 2 idas contribution to country outcomes to assess country performance the world bank monitors set of 14 country indicators for all ida countries to analyze ida performance the world bank created output indicat ors measuring idas

performance can increase ida allocations exponentially grants the united states has advocated for several years the use of grants rather than loans at the mdbs concessional lending facilities this view is response to the debt situation of many of the poorest countries principally in sub saharan africa20 bilateral and multila teral debt of the poorest countries increased heavily between the 1970s and the present it has become increasingly clear that the poorest countries are unable to service th eir old loans let alone new debt thus president bush introduced proposal in 2001 that the world bank shift its assistance to the poorest countries away from loans to grants21 for ida14 deputies agreed on 30 of total ida assistance in the form of grants an 8 increase from ida13 according to bobby pittman us treasury deputy assistant secretary for multilateral development banks grants can be useful for ending the lendandforgive cycle22 other donor countries agree with the concept of grants yet assert that without commensurate incr eases in ida funding the banks financial strength may suffer they also note that most ida loans are repaid in full and on time and only minority of borrowers have needed debt cancellation some analysts argue that an unstated component of the longterm us administration policyshift towards increased mdb grants may be shrinking of the institution barring additional donor funds the capacity to provi future assistance will decline because of fewer loan repayments money from loan repayments accounts for about 40 of the resources available for ida to fund ne w aid without these funds new ida aid would have to shrink critics of grants also note that the world banks ida loans are already provided on highly concessional terms with little or

idas role in the international aid architecture 2 the role of the world bank in postconf lict reconstruction and fragile states and 3 improving the effectiveness of ida assistance negotiations for

donations of 43 billion over three years making it the largest single donor to ida15 the united states increased its pledge by 30 to 37 billion and will see its share rise from 138 to 147 this will be the first time in idas history that the united states is not the largest shareholder24 several countries are contributin g to ida for the first time china cyprus egypt and estonia latvia and lithuania25 idas role in the international aid system during the runup to the ida15 negotiations idas role in the international aid system emerged as the most pressing issue for ida deputies as noted earlier in this report the proliferation of providers of foreign assistance and its increasing fragmentation among narrowly defined pr ojects has emerged as concern among foreign aid professionals responding to these concerns analysts have suggested that the trend of decreasing multilateral assistance be reversed and that greater percentage of foreign assistance be channeled through ida or other multilateral providers according to one brookings institution analyst bilate ral donors should put the politics aside and get serious on aid scaleup and harmonization through ida26 possible questions identified by the world bank that ida 15 deputies may discuss during the ida15 negotiations include 1 idas role in the global aid architecture 2 concerns regarding vertical or global aid funds id programs that focus on specific policy issues rather than countryb ased assistance 3 idas ro at the regional level and the best division of labor between ida and the regional development banks 4 implications for ida of the 2005 paris decl aration agenda on aid harmonization 5 idas role be in building country institu tional capacity to promote good governance especially at the local

the soviet union and the rise of civil conflict in many countries throughout primarily afri ca and south asia the world bank has significantly enhanced its involvement in postconflict countries and other socalled fragile states in 2002 the world bank unched the licus low income countries under stress initiative to provide special assistance for highrisk countries defined as scoring 30 or less on the world bank s cpia rating in january 2006 the bank adopted the term fragile states to refe r to licus countries and the program as of 2008 there are around 25 countries cla ssified as fragile states by the bank the goal of the licusfragile states program is to provi additional and coordinated assistance targeted to the needs of fragile states which are characterized by weak policies institutions and governance thus many analysts argue that world bank assistance in fragile states requires additional focus on statebuilding and peacebuilding objectives in addition to the banks trad itional emphasis on economic growth and poverty alleviation during ida15 member countries and i da officials are exp ected to further refine the ida strategy for fragile states this may involve be tter integrating fragile states issues in idas work for exampl staff incentives increased analytic work of fragile state needs increased coordi nation with bilateral donors and the creation of results measurement systems designed specifically for fragile states the bank may also revise the types of financial assistance that it currently provides to fragile states for many fragile states and ot her postconflict countries the world bank is unable to lend because the fragile state eith er does not have functioning government or is in arrears to the world bank in these cases where the world bank cannot lend directly trust funds have been establis hed to channel donor f unds earmarked for specific country or project ida officials have recognized this challenge and are looking to establish framework for arrears clearance in ida15 ida and development effectiveness building on efforts undertaken in ida14 increasing the effectiveness of ida assistance is the third focus of ida15 th challenges facing ida as well as the rest of the aid system are formidable according to one study of world bank evaluation despite the billions of do llars spent on development assistance each year there is still very little known about the actual impact of projects on the poor27 2006 report from the world banks inde pendent evaluation group ieg found that while the bank has instituted numerous policies and procedures to manage better for results these efforts have not translated into improved bank processes at the operational project level28 according to the report bank managers and staff continue to struggle to link operations to cl early defined goals moreover the report found that performance indicat ors are inadequate staff are unclear how to usehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33969crs15

culture acts as disincentive to managing for resu lts by focusing on the amount of projects and money lent rather than the quality of individual projects members of congress have exhibited significant interest in improving the effectiveness of ida assistance nate hearing in spring 2006 focused on improving the effectiveness of world bank lending and several proposals were discussed which may resurf ace during ida15 for example several development experts discussed at the hearing the need for better results measurement and proposed creating fully independent evaluation group for the world bank while the bank renamed its internal evaluation group from the operations evaluation department oed to the i ndependent evaluation group in 2005 it is not truly independent since oed staff are world bank employees and frequently rotate between oed and other bank offices howe ver the ieg reports directly to the executive board not the bank president according to one hearing participant the world bank makes some attempt to achieve independence for its operations evaluation department oed which reports directly to the board of the world bank not to the president however staff move back and forth between oed and the rest of the bank negative evaluation could hurt staffs career prospects the oed evaluation is subjectiv unclear methods lead to evaluation disconnects it has to be asked how the largely positive findings of the evaluations can be reconciled with the poor development outcomes observed over the same period 1985199529 another testified that independence at the bank is purely cosmetic for temporary change of desk and new nameplate do not alter the sign ature on the paycheck nor the rewards of the banks personnel system th independent evaluation group is department of the bank like any other save the ceremony of reporting to an executive board that is passive at best for everyone save the titular director general revolving door leads back to standard line jobs and advancement at the bank because results are published there is strong pressure to display success outside verification is precluded because there is public access to the underlying data this hardly fosters disi nterested and rigorous judgments even though the bank boasts that staff cannot review projects that they themselves designed30 in response to these concerns expert s at the hearings proposed creating an outside independent evaluation group that w ould be able to perform rigorous and independent impact evaluation of what doe s and what does not work in world
