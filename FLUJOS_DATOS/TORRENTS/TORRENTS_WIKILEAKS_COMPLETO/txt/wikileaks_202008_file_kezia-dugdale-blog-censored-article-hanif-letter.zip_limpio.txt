suspended snp councillor jahangir hanif raised number of very serious allegations concerning councillor hanifs conduct this letter was removed from this site after councillor hanifs solicitors intimated their intention to raise summons in the court of session for interim interdict the firm of bannatyne kirkwood france and co gave this site 15 minutes to remove the letter this site complied with that request we do not have the means or resources to engage in expensive litigation we can only hope that the first minister alex salmond who ms noor hanif addressed her said letter to will have the courage conviction and responsibility to respond to the allegations raised therein and take the appropriate action thereto posted by kezia dugdale at 2103 labels blogging labour snp the censored blog article spot the difference httpkeziadugdaleblogspotcom200809spotdifferencehtml by kezia dugdale hanifgunsjpg the difference between these three pictures of politicians holding and firing guns is not the colour of the skin of one but the backdrop to the situation cllr hanif took his kids to pakistan and made them shoot ak47s gun which shoots up to 600 rounds minute and has killed an estimated 1 million people in the last 5 years its simple to use inexpensive to manufacture and easy to clean and maintain this reliability comes at the cost of accuracy put simply you dont use an ak47 for target practice whatever you think of todays fmqs turn your eye to this letter from cllr hanifs daughter to alex salmond its the letter he said hed seen but hadnt read but would reply to when hed received it im not going to comment on it its long i know but just read it and tell this guy shouldnt be permanently suspended from the snp dear first minister i have read the newspaper reports and i want you to know what my dad is really like firstly i want to explain what really happened when our dad took us to durra i dont think we should ever have been taken there to lawless area which i have read is the worlds largest illegal gun market it was not the kashmir border this is on the afghan border and is far more dangerous if we had known he was taking us to somewhere like that we would never have gone but my dad is dominating man and we all lived by his rule of law otherwise we knew the consequence he would tell us what to do and we would have to obey if we disobeyed him he flew off in rage of temper which was very scary i still have nightmares about that day in durra the people were scary with their faces covered like in the movies and the gun shots were deafening it really hurts your ears and you never forget that sound people were pointing the guns in each others directions i felt scared when firing the gun anything could have happened i was very nervous and was relieved to leave i never want to go to pakistan again he was saying look at these people my friends i could have anyone shot i felt like it was threat he had been telling us we would have to get married in pakistan from the time our plane landed my brother was to be put in so called military school for these reasons i cannot believe he has been let off as he is dangerous and scary man my siblings and i were put in an environment where people were pointing loaded ak47 guns at each other i cannot believe you have taken it so lightly secondly what people dont know about him jahangir hanif snp councillor for govan is why we dont see him and why he only sees my youngest sisters sana and amina in monitored mediation centre under adult supervision he was investigated by the child protection agency living with him was hell and it was getting worse because he was getting increasingly violent this is why i want nothing more to do with him here are just few examples of what our life was like living with him unfortunately there are many many more he constantly told us we were worthless and that he only stuck around for my youngest sister sana he told us to go to hell and he treated us like dirt he always made us feel like we were worth nothing i feel like it wasnt just physical abuse but also mental abuse he would hit us with anything he could get his hands on this would often be with shoes brooms sticks hardback books and belts anything really as long as it ended in our tears he would also play cruel mind games he told my younger brother ameer that it was his fault that our parents were splitting up ameer became very upset he couldnt sleep and he felt guilty unfortunately this has left an everlasting psychological effect on him he would also play mind games with my little sister zainab treating her cruelly and constantly undermining her and then showing particular affection towards sana he was constantly telling zainab off and shouting at her without reason he is bully and control freak we were at my aunts house in mearns my brother who was only 10 at the time and small for his age accidentally tripped over our handicap cousin who was lying on the floor he apologised ignoring his apology my dad got up angrily off the sofa grabbed him violently by his collar lifted him up with his right hand and threw him across the floor ameer was screaming ive not done anything but my dad continued laying in to him in front of everyone slapping pushing and punching him till he was red in the face everyone in the room was yelling for him to stop beating him even my handicap cousin was crying and telling him to stop my uncle his brother finally intervened and pulled my dad away our dad loved to show that he is the big man in front of other people by humiliating us his attempt always ended in our unhappiness i always found him distant and cold i saw my dad arguing with ameer it ended up with ameer being dragged to the garage outside in the dark our garage was derelict and at the other end of the garden with dangerous tools lying around and lights he locked ameer in the garage which was pitch black and full of insects ameer was yelling and screaming he said he felt as though he would be left to die there our dad finally came out after almost an hour and let him out after we were all pleading and begging him to ameer was crouching in corner in the garage scared and alone he then dragged him back into the house and beat him up more punching ameer in the face bursting his lip when mum got back he was in the bathroom rinsing the blood out of ameers mouth in the sink she tried to come in and dad yelled at her to get out mum threatened to call the police and he stormed out of the house not returning till the next morning i felt like i had to protect my younger sisters when our dad got mad by taking them in to another room and closing the door to calm them down as they would cry hysterically his violent behaviour terrified making feel helpless it was winter it was freezing cold and dark outside amina who was only 5 at the time was playing with sana loudly dad shouted at her to shut up he could not handle the noise of kids playing together or arguing with each other as children naturally do he would often come home late stressed and worked up in bad mood we felt as though he was never there for us as father should be we never had the affection that other fathers gave their children he dragged amina tightly by the wrist pushed her out the back door and slammed the door shut amina was wearing nothing but her pyjamas and was bare foot she was screaming and crying outside because she was scared and cold and is normally scared of the dark anyway he just closed the door to the lounge so he could not hear her and went back to watching tv mum must have heard the screams because she came downstairs and sneaked amina back in he then had go at my mum and said butt out and dont interfere swearing at her loudly in urdu the next day i discovered that aminas wrist was bruised but i did nothing i was naive and unaware of laws to protect children he got worse when we went to pakistan my mum could not threaten him with calling the police when he got mad on one occasion we were in van my sister and i were arguing about which seat to sit on our dad had another outburst of anger as he got up off the front seat came to the back grabbed my younger sister huma by the hair to drag her out but she would not get out so he got angrier came in and was punching her in the face and bashing her head against the window her glasses broke against her face and cut her nose and there was blood everywhere huma cried and bled for the rest of the journey later that night she told i hate papa he is ruining my life it was the morning before school amina went in ameers room they were arguing about something jahangir went in yelled at him and then completely lost it and started strangling ameer ameer was crying and pleading saying he couldnt breathe and was choking i felt horrified because i thought he was going to kill my little brother his face was turning blue we all screamed for him to let him go then ameer got away and ran out of his room shouting that he hated him and for him to just leave him alone but my dad chased him down the hall ameer was crouching and begging on the floor while he continued beating him up and was kicking him like football we were very upset we told our school teachers what had happened everyone was scared of him the school contacted social services and they started an investigation he told us that if we said anything against him he would disinherit us and we would suffer for the rest of our lives i felt betrayed by the system when they failed to do much but at least he knew now he was being watched he took and all my sisters and brother to pizza restaurant he lost his temper in there picked up knife and waved it violently at us he was holding the knife so tightly that his arm was shaking he threatened our mums family i can wipe them off the face of the earth i have the connections noone will ever know holding this knife i just wanted to go home when he drove us back his driving was erratic and fast we were all scared he was going to crash he kept putting the brakes on hard as well all of sudden i think he was trying to scare us that night because social services interviewed him i didnt think we would get home alive when we finally got home and this incident was reported to the police we all gave statements the police said that we shouldnt worry he wont get away with this kind of behaviour with us sana woke up having nightmares that night she thought our dad was trying to stab our grandfather i felt scared and worried for the safety of my family after that day we didnt go to see him on our own again when we lived in one of his offices for 6 months as home he would send us to bed and stay up watching porn movies there was small window into the office so we could see what he was watching i was disgusted and humiliated by my dads actions we logged on to his computer when he was out and there were lots of disgusting porn sites in the history he used to preach to us and then do all these kind of things himself i think he is liar and hypocrite he told us not to socialise with white friends yet he was having an affair with white woman for many years he made lot of racist remarks against sikhs hindus christians and jews he was always putting my mum down and swearing at her in front of us most of the time she wouldnt say anything but she would just cry he didnt let our mum make friends and made her stay home all day he treated her like slave and said that women should stay at home and cook my sisters and i thought that our futures would be to become slaves we felt as though we had future i remember one occasion he was pushing my mum around the kitchen and reached for knife zainab jumped in front of mum to protect her yelling at him he stormed out of the kitchen i was angry at his behaviour yet too afraid to speak up i envied zainab for her guts to confront my dad and was surprised he didnt use the knife on her he always said he would get us married to his relatives in pakistan when we were 16 and that there was need for girls to go in to further education i felt like he was intimidating and bad tempered but i was too afraid to do anything i was scared that i would be forced into marriage and have to leave school and thought i would be taken to pakistan without choice in the matter we didnt know until only recently that he has always been millionaire he was always telling us he didnt have any money mum didnt even have money to buy herself new clothes the little money she got she would spend on buying us clothes like school uniform and there was hardly anything left after that he never remembered our birthdays and never even bothered to get card this made feel neglected and unloved he said he couldnt afford presents we always seemed to be living on building site because he would do house up while we were living there and then sell it once when sana was few weeks old she was lying on the sitting room floor she started crying and my mum picked her up and walked towards the door few seconds later the ceiling collapsed and crashed on to that floor where she had just been she was lucky to be alive rats were running around outside and rubbish was piling up i always felt like i was living in dumpster the neighbours were always giving us dirty looks because he annoyed them he always argued with the neighbours and we were never on good terms you should ask our neighbours what he was like even though our neighbours were nice to us my dad would come and ruin it he always ruined everything good there were electrical wires everywhere in the house he would fix electrical wires himself because he didnt want to pay anyone to do it many times we didnt have hot water or heating even when it was snowing outside even when we did he would turn it off when it was cold he used to keep the heating off and said that he didnt have enough money to pay the bills it was normal for us to wear our jumpers at home he would only put the heating on when people were visiting i remember the gas people come over and switched off the gas and put big warning sticker which said dangerous not safe to use when they left he would just take the sticker off and reconnect the gas the carbon monoxide alarm would go off but he would take the batteries out and open the windows he would always lie about everything i felt like we could not trust him our aunt his sister said that he has always been like that and he is born liar and hypocrite i still have nightmares of him in his temper rages so do my sisters and brother even though its been two years since we saw him if you want to ask anything you can i am not so afraid of him anymore but i am afraid of what he could do to sana and amina if he has his temper rages and they are ever left alone with him i think he should be fired to make an example so that other people think twice before playing with guns and putting children in harms way i dont think that you have taken this matter seriously enough how can man who cant look after his children be allowed to represent the public yours sincerely noor hanif posted on
