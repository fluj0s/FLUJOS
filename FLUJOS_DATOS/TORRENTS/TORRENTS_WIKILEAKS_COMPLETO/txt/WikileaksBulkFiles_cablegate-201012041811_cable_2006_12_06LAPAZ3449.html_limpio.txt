the dcm met with european union chief of mission ambassador andrew standley and united nations representative jose manuel martinez morales to discuss reactions to the gobs new coca strategy which was announced at december 18 ceremony in the chapare poloff also attended as notetaker the gobs plan includes an increase of 8000 hectares of coca cultivation above the 12000 currently allowed under bolivian law the united nations and european union representatives admitted that their respective organizations lacked clearly defined response to the gobs announced plan ambassador standley said that eu member countries were all concerned with the gobs plan and that they preferred discreet response rather than public rebuke the dcm explained that bolivian antinarcotics review in march rested on number of factors but that the gobs 2007 strategy if implemented could complicate the review the dcm repeatedly stressed the need for the international community to have united and clear response to the gobs new plan his peers concurred and discussed convening minidublin group meeting in early january 2007 end summary background 2 c at december 18 ceremony in the chapare president morales unveiled the gobs 2007 counter narcotics strategy the cornerstone of the strategy is the gobs commitment to containing coca cultivation at 20000 hectares an increase from the 12000 allowed under bolivian law morales also committed to improving drug consumption prevention programs strengthening interdiction promoting the industrialization of coca products and changing international conventions to decriminalize coca leaf united nations european union position 3 c the united nations and european union representatives admitted that their respective organ izations lacked clearly defined response to the gobs announced plan mr martinez opened with the point and all parties agreed that the gobs plan was violation of both international conventions 1961 single convention on narcotic drugs and bolivias own narcotics law known as law 1008 ambassador standley said that eu member countries were all concerned with the gobs plan and that they preferred discreet response rather than public rebuke standley stated his personal opinion that the gob will never find widespread legal industrial uses for bolivias excess coca mr standley noted that the gob continues to stall eu efforts to perform study on the size of bolivias licit coca market he mentioned that he recently met with pablo solon bolivias ambassador at large for integration and trade issues who assured him the gob was still interested in the study and that it would move forward on it in january standley was most interested in hearing how the united states was planning to respond to the gobs plan and how it would impact bolivias narcotics certification in march 2007 dcm urs remarks 4 c the dcm explained that embassy paz had been warned that the gob was planning change in licit coca growing targets and that the ambassador had expressed the usgs concern over the gobs plan prior to its announcement the dcm concurred that strong public denunciations of the gobs plan would be counter productive the dcm explained that the usg was prepared to sign its annual letter of agreement with the gob on counter narcotics that same day and would not abandon its antidrug efforts at this time however he emphasized that usg officials will state both privately and publicly that that the gobs new strategy is step backwards and seems to violate international commitments 5 c the dcm explained that white house review of bolivian counternarcotic efforts in march rested on number of factors but that the gobs 2007 strategy if implemented would seriously complicate the review he explained that the usg position would push for bolivia to move forward on the eus proposed coca study in response to this potential requirement mr martinez observed with hint of sarcasm that the gob was likely to announce its plan to begin the study on february 28 2007 6 c the dcm repeatedly stressed the need for the international community to have united and clear response to the gobs new plan the dcm suggested that mini dublin group meeting be convened to develop common position ambassador standley and mr martinez concurred with the dcms suggestions and the three agreed that january 8 or 9 would be suitable date for the meeting
