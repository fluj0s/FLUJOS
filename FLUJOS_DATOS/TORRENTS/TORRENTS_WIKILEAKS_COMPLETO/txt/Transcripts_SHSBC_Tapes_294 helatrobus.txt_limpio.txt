the helatrobus implants 21 may 1963 by l ron hubbard thank you people of earth we come in peace we bring plowshare not sword but we wont use any clouds to spread the message oh i see you characters havent been really up to the front of the track yet all those bhelatrobusb implants of course came out of clouds originally you know and this is the 21st of mayo ad 13 galactic ye well thats beside the point you dont look to like youve been making the progress you ought to you just dont look to like youve been making the progress but possibly if youd taken retread in the keokuk central office maybe you would have made better progress an interesting problem has presented itself and so forth every once in while an industrious d of t will treat an hpa like somebody in coaudit you know and give them all the latest tapes and materials and just overwhelm them but good you see and never teach them how to audit and would you like to be handling the material you are handling without knowing how to audit be rough wouldnt it well the degree that we dont make good auditors and the degree that we cant give saint hill training to as many as possible we are actually holding back scientology youre in just little bit of breathing space right at the present instant this is just little bit of breathing space i was playing tag with the atomic war and the enthusiasm with which certain misguided degraders wish to launch off the bomb and all of this sort of thing actually stood across our track rather hard and it caused tremendous acceleration in research which ordinarily would have been plotted out across much longer space of time and gives us something of an emergency characteristic on this because weve still got to beat this line weve still got to beat this and these characters dont know what theyre doing i can imagine them now you know saying saying quotwell to be happy or not to be happy you know i i dont knowquot i can see kennedy walking around now quotwell is it really the beginning of heaven or the end of heavenquot you see and so on hes going over and see the pope and theres the pope sitting there and so forth and hes got an electronic that is cutting his guts out you know and hes saying quotbless you my uhh bless you my sonquot you know wild game going on and these are the characters who are telling you whether or not you can launch bomb or not launch bomb you see so theres good sense involved in any of this and its sort of in the cards and were winning were winning hands down now our technological advance at this particular time is sweeping on much faster than i can give you all of the fine bits of so that i can give you the technology and the way you arrive at the technology and this is the best that i can do now weve long talked about clears and so forth and thats fine there is nothing wrong with that and there are clears and so forth and we can make clears by our own definition and as far as the public is concerned why this is very interesting advance and as peter once told he says quotmanquot he says quotbut i need thisquot he says quotto interest people out in the public dont go knocking out this grade of clearquot see well hes perfectly right see perfectly right but in actual fact the state of clear is not only attainable but is being attained today here and there without any hardly any remark at all now for instance in the last eight and half hours of auditing ive found three goals and run three banks on pc three complete gpms well this is this is rather dizzy rate of speed dont you see all right now you havent got any time to celebrate thats whats wrong with that youre achieving these things and theres chance to to state to the pc quotnow you have to break out the champagnequot you see because it usually happens in the middle of session by the middle of the next session or the end of the session hes already gone beyond it youre achieving these various points now if youre achieving this now you might be quite interested in the fact that states of beingness undreamed of before exist immediately before you theyre in your very immediate future before christmas probably if you keep your nose to the grindstone and keep your case going youre youre right there now the technological win is tremendous and there are only about five percent of the cases youre going to run into that are going to give you bit of thetan ache because they dont have what i choose to call now because it was the nation or small government that did these things bhelatrobusb not to be confused with helatrobe helatrobe is the galactic confederation its bhelatrobusb call these things the bhelatrobusb implants for lack of better designation because 43 trillion isnt accurate for all cases dont you see and that sort of thing you cant give it by time date and there is reason to keep calling it by time date lets call it by something that was less well known but that we can identify call them the bhelatrobusb implants and it tells you these are the implants which begin with the electronic clouds over planets and and the dichotomy plus and minus and so forth and sweep on through in certain series and people have been through them once twice three four times and they have we have the patterns of the first series very accurately well shortly have the patterns of the second series all that makes very easy auditing we even have technique that handles this now 3n which has just been released and thats the same patter that youve been using speeded up bit and theres even shortened version of that which you will need very soon you need this youll go right on needing this from here on out with pc youll need whats called 3n but 3n has to be shortened after pc has gone for three or four banks because the pcs running too fast and for instance ive gotten pc up to point of the ri blows on statement this pc has been very carefully textbook audited and is now blowing on statement theres you call it back and it doesnt even flick so you have to say quotthat rocket readquot see quotit that rocket readquot but why because well it rocket read when they said it but you havent even got tail on the rocket read lot of the timeyouve got the accelerated start but instead of tail on it youve got blowdown see the thing doesnt have chance to do complete rocket read it disintegrates it does an accelerated beginning goes like mad the tone arm moves down pc says quotfinequot you read the thing back and its quiet as mouse you cant get tick out of this thing you havent even opposed it yet and you cant even get tick out of it all right well that of course after while when pcs doing this its waste of time to read the ri back to him so you get 3n2 which is an abbreviated form of 3n just like 3n is an abbreviated form of 3m2 dont you see but you wont be using 3m2 on these implants because the other is too easy now what can you cut out well i just leave it up to you what can you cut out because your job let tell you this very straight from the shoulder your job is to make sure that the charge is blown out of that ri and that is your job as an auditor and let let put bug in your ear right now dont you let any pc talk you out with arc breaks or anything else out of getting that charge off you understand because the pc will natter the pc will yap the pc will this and will that about your reading it second time how youre crosschecking or doing anything like that because you can do these things without losing too much speed but the pc starts suppressing his cognitions in order to make speed you see suppressing this suppressing that and all of sudden youve got little fluky rr that goes flickpow and you see it stop its its choked down pcs suppressing almost as fast as hes giving it to you and you say the pc is very nattery and the pc is this way and that way and therefore you mustnt go in and clean that up well youve been defeated as an auditor the moment you make that conclusion you got it let the pc yap because your payoff your payoff comes in the next two or three gpms and if youve done that well in the first that youre running then your blows through the second are easier the third the fourth gpm and youre just flying by enunciation and recognition you understand and youll be running maybe gpm every fortyfive minutes of auditing time you got that now now all you have to do is get quotnelson eyequot on the emeter britishism he put the telescope to hiis blind eye they told him to withdraw you see and he said he didnt see anything there is where your danger lies because this thing chokes you didnt get nice rr you say quotwell ill let it go because the pc is running so well and this pc gets so nattery and arc breaky every time i stop himquot and reason reason reason reason reason now youre just made tremendous quantities of work for yourself every time you strike that item again in the next bank youre going to find out that you didnt clear the charge of it in this bank not only are the next few ris going to be impeded but that item in the next bank comparably is going to be badly impeded and you are going to stack the case up you hear now arc breaks wont stack the case up but unblown ris will and its your job as an auditor to get that charge off and thats your job and dont let any pc talk you out of it see youve got two choices on running these days youve got two choices that you can make and one of them is wrong and that is have the pc alwaye happy and cheerful and the other is have the charge gone and you just forget about that first choice because how anybody could run the bhelatrobusb implants and be happy and cheerful i dont know oddly enough after while they will be happy and cheerful but only if you get the charge off early on so nag them all you want to now you can nag them to point where the charge wont blow see where your judgment lies you can get them so upset and so enturbulated and so jumped up that the charge wont blow youve gone the wrong direction dont you see but then that was necessary thing youre making mistakes then in order to do this you get yourself good clean rr thats disintegrating at the end and its blowing its obviously going this rr is going to be gone and you read it back and you read it back and then you say quotwell it didnt rr againquot and you read it back and you say quotare you doing anything are you thinking about anything it didnt read ill read it again wantably fantastic it didnt read that time whats the matterquot and next thing you know the pc is saying quotwhats hap whaaa whi where am i goingquot you see well you made mistake the place to really get skilled is to recognize the quality of rrs now some hpa thinks quotwell im doing pretty good ive learned what an rr isquot you take off from there you get pretty good and learn what choked rr is and what disintegrating rr is and then youll be in business you get some rrs you could actually see the pc suppress them as they happen for moment there you can see that rr stop and you can say to the pc quotwhat happenedquot pc says quotwell it wasnt much i well i just had little cognitionquot for interest of speed of run they start suppressing their cognitions almost fatal dont you see and you say quotthats fine thank youquot call the item again and by golly therell be the full rr see you have to learn to interpret an rr there is nothing anybody can do to help you really beyond you finding out what one is these wide loose disintegrating rrs speed rapidly at the beginning if you dont get the instant spurt at the beginning youll never see it as an rr because it hasnt got any rr on the end its disintegrated already you see an rr as it goes over has hook tail and many an auditor gets so educated into recognizing an rr by its hooked tail that when he gets to disintegrating rr he sees hooked tail but he missed the spurt beginning now of course the meter is already in motion at the time that the auditor starts to interpret it you see hes used to having his attention caught by the fact that the thing is moving he gets his attention so he says quotif it needle starts moving then i should look at it and see if its an rrquot well of course then he only sees the end of it and it looks like fall ah but it had spurt beginning hes looked at disintegrated rr the thing has disintegrated before its gone see that thing has blown its blown completely theres nothing smoke left on it you call this thing again and it doesnt fire at all and you say quotwell i must have the wrong item lets random list for fortyfive minutesquot oh hells bells you could run whole bank in fortyfive minutes its nonsense you see why thats because the auditor doesnt have his attention on the meter to catch the beginning spurt see an rr is characterized by spurted accelerated beginning which is gives it its name it looks like something taking off you know like being shot shot away from its start its spurting beginning it goes psshh see and then its other characteristic is curled end after it gets passed over here it go khihh and an rr is always characterized by these two things beginning goes psshh and the end go slhhp all right the disintegrating rr doesnt go slhhp it only goes pssht all right so if you have to have your attention caught by the meter already being in motion you miss the beginning spurt so you dont know if youve got an rr or fall then youll see an rr start off beautifully you can gauge the speed of an rr of how far it will run by just watching it you can get used to that and it starts off beautifully it goes pssht and it it didnt go anyplace thats choked rr and theres suppress or cognition suppressed or the pc has done something there pc has suddenly wondered if it wsb quotcovitiviwiwibiblyquot or something see halfway through having said it something has happened here and that rr isnt blown and it wont blow until you ask the pc what happened and get rid of that suppress and then the pc says quotwellquot the pc says quotwell i was soandso and soandso and i thought it might be because theres two here on the sheet and so forth and i thought it might be and therefore soandsoquot and you say quotall right now im going to say the item again inevitable catsfish inevitable catsfish all right that rocket readquot and it will it rocket read beautifully where was the charge the charge is insisted on you must realize that these ris dont have any more charge on them than you see on the meter just mark that down this meter is not indicating the presence of charge the rocket read doesnt tell you that there is some charge someplace just do total associate see the rocket read is the charge all the charge that is going to come off of that thing is seen in and has velocity in that rocket read that is the charge now you could be very pedantic and say quotwell actually the thetan in the facsimile is subjected to certain impulses which causes him to impulsify and the 76volt or 9volt current which is being passed through the corporeal resistance chamber known as human body is therefore modulated and monitored by the various circuits which are approached from the righthand electrode and which terminate in the lefthand electrode and theres magnetic influence so that you get visual response in the ohmmeterquot ohdamniter some poor dear in scientology every once in while tells quothuh but you talk so much about electricity ihehheh i dont know anything about these thingsquot i always shake them by the hand and say quotthat makes two of usquot other people pretend they know something about it see well this is an interesting piece of magic youve got here in an emeter thats for sure this is an interesting piece of magic and isnt it interesting that it doesnt exist elsewhere on the whole track oh recording devices and detective devices and thisas and thatas and the other thing all exist on the whole track and there are all kinds of things and my old pals in certain sections of this universe well in the galactic confederacy particularly would be absolutely horrified if i said quotwell we developed meter we dont have herequot because their pride is that they have all the equipment that was all has ever existed or that will ever be developed and they know every electronic activity that has ever existed or will ever exist anywhere and that ends their modesty on the subject see and you say quotwell heres box of tricks that does something that none of our meters doquot it wouldnt be popular statement but itd be true one its quite remarkable that it does it so lets not worry why it does it lets not worry at all why it does it lets worry much more succinctly about the information it gives the auditor and the information it gives the auditor is there is something there there is nothing there or what is there is beyond the pcs reality it gives us there is something there that will be real to the pc and thats all fine we know all that but lets take the next step that this thing is charged and is discharging now youve customarily in the past read this on your tone arm well you dont read these bhelatrobusb implants on your tone arm we dont care whether the tone arm moves or not just skip it out in 3n thats too much bother because you do bank or two and the tone arm starts moving down matter how high the thing has been stuck and all the charge that was on the original bank you were doing is coming off its coming off on the needle but youll also see the needle action reflect over onto the tone arm so that is all the charge there is on an ri dont imagine that sleeping beneath the surface is slumbering volcano that something elec can trigger sir there is such thing when you read one of these things and it goes pssheww and then you read it again ordinarily early on in case you only get half the rr or thereabouts and when you read it again you get fzzt very tiny rr about quarter of an inch and when you read it again it goes thi tick thats early on in case well what happened to the rest of the rr youve got to recognize that something happened to this rr otherwise youll be nagging the pc to find out what happened to the rr well the rr evaporated thats what happened to it now youve got to tell the difference between an rr that evaporated and an rr that was choked to death because they look different on the meter and you just have to get your eye educated to be able to tell the difference and its pretty hard to do and its not hundred percentprecision i had to study in meter i dont know hour or two or three and certainly something on the order of about five or six hours of auditing paying attention to just this one thing until i finally got the subtle nuances of difference between them so its case where experience is very good thing to have well we can make some very good general statements you can see the back break on one of these things too although what that means is just more choke see and then youll run into this one the thing fell when he said it and then you had him give you another version quotcovetingativablyquot and something and quoterradicably catfishquot and quotwingabingably catfishquot and all of sudden youll see this fantastic rocket read on something that has nothing to do with the price of oranges you see and you say quotgive the original item againquot and you get gorgeous rocket read in other words you had rocket read sitting on top of it something in his own existence had pressed down on this thing and had transferred the read from the ri to this other thing in other words it ate up the rocket read and the rocket read was encysted and this one was therefore wasnt on your plot thats always what happens when you cant get plot item to read it isnt that the plot item isnt there electronics were broken down that way the bhelatrobusb boys really ought to get the manufacturers seal of approval and the service seal of approval because i have been looking in vain to have one of their damn squawk boxes not fire its obvious with that many squawk boxes and electronic implant boxes in any existing series that well it is obvious that their repairmen werent all that good because theyre on cables and so forth particularly those strung outside those that are on the last implant of the first series that were just there open to the weather oh i consider it very remarkable that they stay in operation i keep looking for hole to occur in the line plot dont you see ive had my eye open on this now for the last two or three thousand items you know everything working quotwantably fantasticably catfishablyquot and pow its working there it reads so i just dropped it out of the line that theres something wrong with the electronic implant equipment as the pc went by see i dropped that out the reason i bring that up that might occur to some of you quotwell i guess that box wasnt working that dayquot see well its always possible that that is true but i havent found it to be true they always worked they should get the manufacturers seal of approval and so forth their production boys and their service unit should have gotten the leather medal pinned on with blanket pin very deep but the point i am making here is that theres something wrong with the way the pc has approached this thing and as your pc gets to flying on down the line you less and less will have trouble with this the point im trying to make to you you do your job well at first and your job gets easier and you do lousy job at first and your job will not get easier and it might even get harder now the point where you make speed is to do your originals and earlies right and then youll make more and more speed more and more speed more and more speed it goes faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and dont pull colossal blunders like letting your pc miss an item which remains fully charged even though he hit it you know you couldnt get any rocket read so just went on by it and then find your pc leaping into the second series the source of all skips is missed ri and theres two ways to miss one just not have it at all or not discharge it in other words skip flying into another bank flying elsewhere bouncing off the track not being there in the incident anymore is caused by missing an ri either by not calling it at all we go from quotcovetablyquot to quotinevitablyquot or something of the sort and we dont get the nix in see or we call it it didnt fire we dont get the charge off of it and simply go on the next action the pc is liable to do is skip you skip something so he qsandas and he may go into the identical or the similar implant of the second series and you suddenly find yourself running the second implant series and you wonder whats all this the pc is being torn to ribbons nothing is rring right the thing is the words arent right and all of sudden he says quotimpassably and insurmountably inevitably catfishquot and you say quotthat isnt in the line plotquot its in the second series not those words are in the second series i havent got the second series plot ive got some of it though and you say quotwhere did all this come from what happened what happened what happenedquot well good way to do that is to get your pc oriented early as to his surroundings have him close his eyes and take look he doesnt want to look very much when you first start to run it he will tell you its terribly unreal and he cant see very much and after you have done bank or two his reality on visio will be getting greater and greater and better and better and its usable by the auditor now pcs go up steps and down steps in the first implants and they dont always just go down they sometimes also go up because thats more confusing they dont turn around in the middle of set of steps and go the other way but theyll start bank and itll go backwards to the last bank so forth so this is all very confusing but you get pc so dont tell him you always go downstairs because sometimes they go up see and sometimes the oppterms are on the right and sometimes theyre on the left which also makes it interesting and sometimes pc is sitting there with line plot and says quotthis line plot ought to be printed in reverse you knowquot well you can say its printed right for at least half of the gpms because it is about half of them it is reversed see now as the pc goes along you can actually and you can overdo this you can make him put too much attention on and work him into it and yap at him and nag him and so forth but it helps you out and you say quottake take look there what do you seequot and he says quotwell i see flight of stepsquot and you say quotwell are any of them grayquot quotyeahquot he says quottheres one down there thats grayquot thats an ri you didnt get quotare any of those steps blackquot quotyeah well theres one over here thats black and the rest of them closer to are whitequot brother somethings wrong here somethings missed see thats pretty crude repair i myself dont use it but i like to hear pc tell quotthose steps are all white nowquot oh thats very nice thats very nice that tells you you havent got speck of charge left behind you because those charge those steps were black as ink the first time you went over them see but ri by ri they turn white see interesting isnt it you can even orient the pc this is real trickery i mean these guys really set it up well this is real trickery on part of an auditor tricky sneaky before you list for the next goal have the pc close his eyes and tell you what he sees find the next goal and its top oppterm then have the pc close his eyes and tell you if hes in the same locale that he was in before because if hes in different locale youve missed whole bank tricky huh you get what i mean these banks usually end at the top or bottoms of stairs youve just gotten the last item you see he closes his eyes quotall right where are youquot quotwell im on this landingquot quotall right you got that oh youre on the landing thats fine all rightquot now were going to get the next goal and we get the next goal and as soon as weve got it and then weve got its the top oppterm of it we have the pc close his eyes again and we say quotnow where are youquot quotwellquot he says quotim in the same place but just one step downquot quotthats finequot tricky thats using the scenery to confirm the fact you dont skip anything youll find out the pc has never had any visio these implants are marvelous to run because the pc has never had any visio has never seen anything has never heard anything has sonic has visio has tactile kinesthetic nothing and hes been in this state ever since anybody has ever tried to run an engram on him now this has been the bane of everybodys existence you run him halfway through bank or quarter of the way through the first bank and all of sudden hes got dim visio you run him all the way through couple of banks and boy hes got visio you run him through three banks and hes got kinesthesia you can hear these crazy he can get one of these crazy theta poles wobbling he can feel it wobble see and hell come up to full sonic on this quite remarkable weve sweated for years all kinds of trickery to turn on the perceptics of pc well its in the bhelatrobusb implants right on the button you run them you got it well you can use the scenery of the implant to orient the pc and tell whether or not youve missed items in fact theres lot of trickery involved in this see as far as the auditor is concerned he can get pretty slippy now i dont ask you to get this slippy but on certain flights of stairs apparently there are electric switches on the walls that tell you what goal the next bank is turned to thats pretty good isnt it its not in english but the pc understood the language when he went through pc told him quotwell i know its undoubtedly the right goal because its marked up there on the wallquot the way you turn over the switch over to the goal quotto be happyquot apparently this shifted all the relays and everything that was going on in the squawk boxes by just shifting one lever i like to think that one of the operators accidentally threw the activation switch one day while setting up one of the series of goals i like to think that happened anyhow because actually the controls were on the landings and stairs pretty tricky now all of this is very good news and its very good news from several quarters one the bhelatrobusb implants are incredible its unbelievable man in the street can run them however you just find quotto forgetquot on the top oppterms and just go along with your 3n patter give him the thing you dont have to write it all out for him you shouldnt write somebodys whole bank out for him he should have to think it out that much to keep him in the incident you understand you can give him the number and so forth and you just tell him how to do this he maybe even have had to go home and read his dictionary and study to find out what quotablyquot was and so forth but he doesnt know anything more about it than that and hell run this thing and hell run just about so long and all of sudden hell start telling you that this was long time ago and that this was this and this was that and hell really start holding forth on the subject in other words it runs as gently as that it requires education but the incredibility of it keeps it from being believed or usurped and used for evil purposes until we can control it youd be surprised the degree that we use incredulity as protective security mechanism in scientology just never forget that because its marvelous one its marvelous one quotoh that scientology its balderdash those people believe that cult believesquot and so forthh i very often feel like just patting those horses heads just very smoothly and nicely and neatly and saying quotgood show brother good show thank youquot because theyre operating as security screen far more effective than any security screen any of us could devise you realize that the psychiatrist has just now found birth and prenatals hes been chewing away on birth and prenatals for some time now and hell eventually graduate up to it but whats to stop some russian from putting these one of these banks on tape recorder and playing it off to somebody whats to stop them they dont think theyll go nuts the only thing that will stop them is because quotwell those scientologists they have some ridiculous beliefsquot and that actually will protect us right up straight up to the point when we dont need any protection which point will happen suddenly so dont always revile this type of an attitude recognize that it has its uses it wasnt designed that way but it does have its uses you realize that we might very well be under the gun of some government or we might be here we might be there we might be or there might be barbed wire around saint hill here until you couldnt get mouse through or an english rabbit you know guards all over the place quothup 2 3 4 blahblahraharhgrrrgrrr all this stuff ill just show halt where you are hush hushquot see can you imagine what that would do to you supposing i just heard today that somebody more or less didnt talk to the public about implants well all right the factor of incredulity tends to slow them down little bit theyre afraid somebody will get in their faces but remember this theyre putting themselves on withhold i almost classified the line plots then i said quotno i wont put anybody on that much of withhold on this stuff because its too tough it would be too tough on themquot well just continue to depend upon incredulity now that factor doesnt keep you from auditing pc however you dont have to tell the pc anything ian is auditing pc in here that never heard from nothing and she ran down through the bank quotto forgetquot gorgeously feels fine feels wonderful doesnt even know where she is didnt know at the time so whats the difference you dont have to totally educate the pc except maybe in word endings or something like that in order to run them cold take the milkman out here sit him down get quotto forgetquot to fire get quotforgottenquot get quotnix forgottenquot he says quotwhats this nix quot quotwell thats just what you say at this stagequot and you say quotall right now give number 3 there on the paper i gave you you have to fill in the forgotten after itquot and he says quotwhats that meanquot quotwell thats doesnt matter what it means say itquot all right thats fine that rocket reads beautifully and so forth there we go on 3n just roll it see keep rolling it this guy goes on and he says these things says quotssssssssssssquot he ends up at the other end of the line you say quotnow we have to find what the next goal isquot you know quotgoalquot quotyes yes now who or what would to forget oppose just keep telling mequot quotoh well you want it that wayquot and he goes on and he gives it to you whatever it is quotrememberquot and so on you say quotthat fires thats thats itquot he says quotyou know ive got feeling that is itquot take him right on down i dont think you could run him halfway through the first implant but what he says quotnow wait minute now this happened long time ago now i know youre going to argue with but its sort of like this i get an idea i was living on this planet see and thats funny because you knowquot so you see that incredulity might deny you some pcs and may give you some catcalls but it doesnt actually keep you from auditing anyone you understand you dont have to sell them on whole track before you audit them on whole track now because theyre sitting right there man theyre right there theyve been there ever since and it flies and your job as an auditor is just to do technically perfect job on the thing the only rough spot in auditing all these is auditing goal you have that you havent had run that is about to be run on you things tend to go kind of solid but fortunately there was quite lot of variation in these goal patterns and you dont follow that it would be quite strange to have three banks simultaneous between auditor and pc thats lucky break isnt it they change the thing often enough to keep it from being too restimulative while auditing all right this then gives the auditor little bit of pause the only place you really run into this is quotto forgetquot therefore one of the first duties an auditor has is to get the bank quotto forgetquot run out very cleanly indeed and hell feel fine because the second bank doesnt much restimulate while you are auditing the thing ive audited one of these recently on bank that wasnt run out and i felt like i was getting ead knocked off and knew what it was and knew why and it was uncomfortable but that was remediable because the bank to be restimulative to that degree must be very ripe and ready to be run almost at once anyway dont you see so its coming straight up and it will be run thats the only liability there is to this stuff now the fact that they can all be audited out very rapidly gives you alibi whatsoever not to get them audited out you havent got any excuse at all not to audit them out now the only excuse you pardon you do have one excuse not to audit them out if you dont have them now how many people have got these well its the wildest kind of guess but i think were up to about 5 percent dont dont have the bhelatrobusb implants or its over their heads its very small percentage and weve certainly moved up in percentage because everybody under the sun moon and stars weve been grabbing hold of have got these but we do have our 5 percent used to be far far greater percentage dont you see so weve closed it down to that degree now what do you do with that 5 percent you are going to have certain amount of trouble with some of the 95 percent because theyve only got the second implant see or something like that i could anticipate running into some trouble of that character but that isnt any trouble because they audit just like the first implant except they have different pattern until you get that pattern in your hands just dog it off somehow or another and do the job what about this remaining 5 percent what can you do for those fellows they fall into two categories based on the mechanics of the time track they fall into categories that do have the implants but cannot approach them and those that dont have and so they arent there to be approached theres implants to be run that is to say theres implants on the case but they are not the bhelatrobusb implants and that fellow to some slight degree is slightly out of luck because hes got implants that are just as vicious as the bhelatrobusb implants one way or the other but they arent the same pattern they dont have patterns of that character you cant handle them in the same way and hes under that much liability and so forth thats sort of bad luck bad luck well how did this fellow escape them well he didnt escape them by being tough and hairychested you know and not being picked up and all that sort of thing he escaped them because hes from another galaxy he aint not native to this ere galaxy you may find somebody who is native to this galaxy who never went through it he was in so lousy condition they ignored him or something of the sort i think youll find that very rare if it exists at all now we have to take up the possibility not the possibility we have to look at the factor we have to look at the factor of the fact that this is rim system that we are in right now this is sun 12 and it is rim tiny microscopic terribly insignificant little bunch of apace dust not to do it down particularly but compared to other systems galaxies confederations and that sort of things and other possessions of confederations and so forth this is nothing thats why its left alone but it stands pretty well alone its peculiarly isolated this is also true of most of the stars out in this end of this wheel you know the galaxy is big wheel and the galaxy has hub and it has rim and we are very close to the rim you look down into the southern horizon you notice the stars in the southern hemisphere look terribly big and terribly bright well it isnt that they are so much terribly bigger than other stars thats just the end of the galaxy that you are looking at thats the end theres just that many between us and more this galaxy see its very close and people wishing to get rid of troublesome characters captives anybody you can think of you know around city dumps you know they always have trouble around cities because people start using certain areas of the city for dumps you know and they take use it as dumping ground for the ice cube and for other thing unwanted beings unwanted people unwanted personnel like you overthrow the old regime you see and you throw them through good stiff implant that mixes them up so they cant tell north from west and you throw them into an ice cube capsule of some kind or another and what do you do with them well the primary threat to system is the strength of thetan thats the primary threat in the view of some very aberrated character he thinks the main danger in the planet or main danger in the system or the galaxy or so forth is free thetan the possibility also that person in who is acting as doll or something like that can exteriorize from where he is and go home pick up another body and come back and raise the devil with him in other words these people are have overts so they try to protect themselves from the vengeance of free thetan and they compound the possibility and the potentiality of this particular universe as trap and they make these people very thoroughly trapped well they dump them they dump them pretty well far from home they try to dont even try to they dont dump them close in they dump them way out well bhelatrobusb threw any people that it implanted as far as possible oh some of them were wandered back and some of them stayed around and some of them didnt get badly affected and reported back and that sort of thing but they also dumped people pretty far out so this particular system got dumping and the marcab confederacy and some of the other stars around here just got terrific concentration of people being dumped from the center of the hub you know they dont want to go over to the next galaxy so they just take it out to the edge of the city you know all right and this is close enough to other galaxies that ambitious characters over there trying to get rid of people out of their galaxies and systems and so forth would also use these rim stars now you get down toward the center of this galaxy and the possibility of finding somebody without the bhelatrobusb implants of finding any foreign implant system will probably be totally negligible probably nonextant you see but out here you got mixed bag and we dont know what they did in the next galaxy see now science fiction writers following the cue of some chap ive forgotten his name now einstein beinstein something like that who said that mc squared over c wouldnt go man and that the speed of light could not be excessive and actually i was looking up some speed tables the other day and trillion light years per day is not full throttle on space wagon so theres traffic between galaxies and theres traffic between islands of galaxies and other islands of galaxies interesting has lot you say well this is science fiction the only part of science fiction there are is the mistakes the science fiction writers have made while writing about their own past theyve made lot of errors there the truth of the case is that its it has lot to do with you as an auditor suddenly not that you have to embrace science fiction but you have to look at this possibility youve got to face up to the isness of the thing mans greatest trouble in solving his own problems see he didnt have enough on the ball to face up to the isness of existence and the reasons for that are very plain short succinctly stated that case which evinces the greatest unreality about things is that case most subject to bank solidification in an effort to remember thats technical statement i just made and has lot to do with your engram running its directly proportional his effort to remember increases the solidity of his bank which is painful to him which then brings about his statement concerning unreality see thats proportional the amount of unreality evinced by case then is proportional to the amount of solidity caused in his time track by his efforts to remember if his bank goes solid every time he tries to remember something this becomes painful so then he counters this by saying it is unreal this fellow that tells you quoti dont believe in past livesquot is saying quotmy time track goes solid when i try to rememberquot and it has an awful lot to do with you as an auditor because that case that evinces great unreality must be given very gentle handling and you cannot run an engram on that case not only you must not run an engram on that case because the bank will go solid now you could take almost anybody here and run them through an engram once lets take lateonthechain engram we could run them through the engram once wed get away with it we can run them through twice we can get away with it this is not basic on chain see we run it three times it starts to get kind of solid and we run it four times and by golly thats getting awful solid and we run that engram five times and rrahhrrw its getting tough man and we run it six times well just freeze him in it it takes three to ten days for the thing to key out and go soft again which it will do now thats true of anybody here im talking about something late on chain you understand those engrams have always given us trouble theyve always been sticky and it even says in book one dont run them you have to brush them off enough sometimes you can always take case through them once you know to get back early by the time youve taken them through two three times you wish you hadnt the banks going solid well now this case of tremendous unreality goes solid on one pass you practically cant examine the bank its practically as much as your lifes worth to even date this character if you could perfectly and accurately date without any flaw in your auditing yes it would soften up the bank but if youre clumsy in dating and you date this fellow without any great reality anyhow the little errors you make will throw him off enough to beef up the bank and he gets greater unreality than before there is coordination between unreality and solidity which is reversed the greater solidity the more unreality the person will advertise even though the engram gets very real to him when it gets solid general bank solidification and so forth brings about unreality why is this because the basic mechanism of the time track has the liability of making the thetan go solid how does thetan cease to be clear and start going solid how does he become solid probably by making time track in the first place of course and the more this track is jammed and the less he has to do with it of course the less is asised about it well thats just general time track now what about implants why do we specialize in implants its because an implant is the product of an arc break plus solidification if you wanted to run old arc break straightwire quotrecall an arc break recall an arc breakquot you would find the guy sitting eventually 3d in an implant this guy sees theta trap thats warning to him that hes not wanted around here and it causes an arc break and all these traps and such devices and so forth and betrayals are basically arc breaks now the method thetan uses to handle an arc break is to bring about an unreality which he usually does with quotnotisquot dont you see and it becomes the common denominator of the bank then to have an unreal bank because if it gets real it hurts too much so your effort to persuade him that this is real that he is looking at of course does him tremendous disservice because it hurts like the mischief the only safeguard he has against being caught in solid bank you see and being upset by solid bank is by saying it is not real and not permitting you to find anything real on it now that type of case is going to give you some trouble because you will try to prove to the case the reality of what youre doing and because what you are doing is real you can do that very easily and it just results in total overwhelm of the case you can all too easily prove that what you are doing is real so when somebody starts telling you about how unreal it all is if youre running the bhelatrobusb implants you go right on running them man because that will do the most for him that can be done you see the most that can be done for the case is get those implants run real or unreal but you cant find those implants and he says its terribly unreal and all is unreal and everything is unreal and you cant find quotforgottenquot and quotnix forgottenquot and so forth and you just cant get any place like this brother you watch it one of two things is true you either have your paws on somebody who is not native of this universe i mean this galaxy hes native of an adjourning adjoining galaxy and you dont know the pattern of his implants or youve got on your hands somebody who has been so implanted so often that just the thought of five minutes ago gives him headache why does it give him headache because he thinks of five minutes ago and the action of remembering causes solidification of the bank which causes pressure to come in and he got headache so his only protection against this is to make you unreal and notis it his last weapon on the bank is to notis and in the absence of his notis he damn near dies you see what do you do with him well this is not i havent time to give you all the data on some of the material ive been unearthing with regard to this but ive been developing quite bit of little odds and ends of technology concerning the time track and its automatic nature and its state of manufacture and that sort of thing i just realized just this afternoon that we have straightwire process that does an awful lot for this case were making him remember and the track is going less solid ill be developing quite few ill tell you just to not to leave you on the hook there is an involuntary intention ive discovered an involuntary intention you have involuntary muscles and youve got habit patterns and training patterns and all this sort of nonsense well add to up that in thetan to an involuntary intention he wants to open the door and so he just bluh opens the door see see he involuntarily opens the door in other words he just opens the door my father used to answer telephones this way plunk you know and telephone rings plunk you know telephone appears you know off the hook and so forth actually youve intended it up there you got the idea its been intended into new position well thats an involuntary intention and apparently its the same mechanism that increa creates the time track its an involuntary create you see so thats an involuntary intention and it belongs to this set of thetan muscles if youll forgive which operate without intention without knowing intention but have subawareness intention and thetan can do this he doesnt have to have bank machinery or anything else he just simply can do it well that forms the time track now solidification of the track is caused by combat of the postulate quotbe solidquot you see everybody wants you to be solid you dont want to be solid that makes enough fight right there to solidify something well it goes worse than that the solidification mechanism is composited by remembering naturally and you as an auditor are actually handling when you handle the time track the involuntary intention of the thetan thats what the time track is its an involuntary intention to create it just responds automatically and you say go here go there do this do that and he has pictures where do pictures come from well they come from this involuntary intention youre just handling that mechanism well you can handle that mechanism directly you can handle the mechanism directly and if you could get case unbailed enough this is actually the plot you get case unbailed enough and go early enough on the time track and you can actually snip the whole track see it just rolls up like its just nowhere now see its the existence of the time track that makes memory impossible but it is the obsession to remember which makes the time track involuntary intention take place in the first place see so any goal like quotto rememberquot raises hell with solidification or any implant that louses up and they all do thetans memory or sense of time result in the solidification of the time track by taking over the involuntary create that brings about the time track see that so you say quotwhat quot you say to the pc quotwhat instinctive action has been regrettedquot i dont care what fancy wording just as long as it adds up to that sense in other words what involuntary action have you engaged in which you then choked off and made an enemy out of see what instinctive action was regretted what instinctive action have you disliked you know anything you wanted to go at it youve got straightwire process which actually runs implants it runs chem at the rate of snail racing madly alongside of the quarterhorse of doing the bhelatrobusb implants but you nevertheless there is door open in other words the door is not slammed tight in these fellows faces even if they are not native to this uni this particular galaxy and even if their sense of reality is so great that all this could happen and ill develop few of those processes and oddly enough i dont think the patterns are innumerable i think possibly maybe five or six different case patterns maybe more than that but if you come up against one of them as an auditor and you decide the only thing you can do is just run engram after engram after engram watch it man because youre going to get solidification of the track and youre going to get that pc in trouble so dont go in for this engram after engram after engram you see hit them lightly with feather now if you are lucky enough to be able to get basic like 360 trillion years ago and its an overt and its basic on ch oh youre in man you can handle that because of course that will erase and so forth but how about this fellow who is very unreal you going to get 360 trillion incident when he cant get breakfast youre sure not you see in other words its all done with the feather you run into the case that hasnt got the helatrobua implants you handle with feather huh dont go charging and barging around open that case up gently and ill try to give you some straightwire processes and things like this that gradually gradually pet the shadow of the cat okay well theres lot of stuff turning up on this that and the other thing its all very interesting it mostly comes under the heading of phenomena and data and that sort of thing and ive recently been understand been studying the power activities and habits of an operating thetan just from an intellectual basis but with some view of reality which i really havent had on this too well before i find we have here fairly complex being and very very formidable one his ethical level and that sort of thing deteriorating was what got him into trouble in the first place so when you put him back together again of course his ethical level will have to be put back together again too otherwise hed just get into trouble and get everybody else in trouble but the point im making here is that the state of ot is so far above anything we have ever dreamed of that i say our breakthrough our breakthrough along this line is tremendous so tremendous that we had better start getting our house in order not to protect ourselves from ots that isnt the point but it means that political breakthrough is puh you have any trouble eating breakfast see we would be shooting mice with an elephant gun dont you see and were not about to attack anybody or do anything bad like that but we might have few hearttoheart talks so actually i have had to be plotting up in front of us bit politically about where did we go and how do we relate to and i find some very interesting data probably some of you have past connections of one kind or another when you suddenly say quothuh i wonder how i forgot thatquot you probably have to go take care of these things but the basic thing is that this planet is peculiarly susceptible to be rehabilitation base and so forth at this part of the universe and i think that can be sold to even most of the confederations i dont think we have to sell it to much of anybody else i dont think theyll be in position to argue theyve only got atom bombs weve got ots okay thank you very much
