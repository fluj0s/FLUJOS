savings and slippage convention in previous years since not all corps activ ities are accomplished as planned appropriations fo r the principal corps accounts included reduction for savings and slippage to account for the slip of spending eg due to delays caused by weather nonfederal sponsor financ ing or decision not to proceed and the savings from project costing less than estimate d application of the ss contributed to the quantity of the reprogramming being performed by the corps the approach taken in the conference report is to stop applying ss and reduce the need for

manageme nt reprogramming and contracting t h conference report included compromise nguage between the house and senate appropriations committees which had expressed in their respective reports different levels of dissatisfaction with the corps financial management particularly the reprogramming of funds across projects and th use of multiyear continuing contracts for projects language in hr 2419 af ter conference would change the corps ability to reprogram to use continuing c ontracts and to allocate project funds on quarterly rather th an an annual basis2 corps budget and the agen cys backlog of projects the corps civil works program has been criticized by some observers as an agglomeration of projects with underlying design these observers see the corps backlog of authorized activities as one example of this lack of focus estimates of the backlogs size vary from 11 billion to more than 50 billion pending on which projects are included although some observers view the backlog as nothing more than to do list for the corps others are concerned that projects are facing constructi on delays and related cost overruns because of the spread of av ailable appropriations across an increasing portfolio of projects httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32852crs6 the conferees requested from the corps list of its 10 priority flood damage reduction and navigation projects following hurricanes katrina and rita based on the agencys professional engineering judgement however according to the conference report the conferees have largely provided the budget request for individual water resources pr ojects because of the agencys inability to provide congress with the requested prioritysetting information many corps policy proposals in the presidents fy2006 budget request were aimed at reducing the constr uction backlog while making progress on corps projects within current fiscal constraints and national priorities the request attempted this largely by starting new projects and di stributing funds across projects based on performance measures although the house bill adopted some of the changes proposed by the administration the h ouse appropriations committee expressed view of how to structure the corps portf olio that would go beyond the changes proposed by the administration hrept 10986 stated the civil works program needs to be managed as program and not as collection of individual projects to respond to what the committee sees as little or systematic approach to the nations water and coastal in frastructure underlying the lection of which projects received funding the house appropriati ons committee reiterated in its report the value of fiveyear plan and stra tegic vision to guide budget requests the report by the senate appropriations committee approached the corps budget from perspective distinct from th at of the house and the administration the senate report referred to the benefits of the previous big tent budgeting approach where all aspects of water resour ces were jointly deve loped and discussed the senate report however was critical of the lack of leadership at the agency performancebased budgeting the fy2006 request tackled the corps construction backlog on number of front s one way the fy2006 request tried to address the corps backlog of projects wa s to develop the budget request using performancebased budgeting approach for termining which projects to fund for construction and to lesser extent maintenance the performance measures were based on their economic and environmenta l returns the construction projects selected for funding were chosen largely on their having either high ratio of remaining benefits to remaining costs or for environmental projects high cost effectiveness the house appropriations committee noted in its report that it supports the concept of focusing limited resources on completing highvalue projects already under construction and the committee recommendation is based in large part on the administration s performancebased approach in its report the senate appropriations committee in contrast largely rejected the administrations performancebased budgeting and suggested that the agency seriously reexamine its budget model the report argues that the approach used in the fy2006 budget request promotes di scord among various water resources interests led to skewed set of results with few strong winners and many losers and is very unbalanced among planning constructi on and maintenance the senate report includes funds for numer ous projects funded in neither the house bill nor the administrations requestshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32852crs7 the conference report acknowledged the administrations efforts but recognized the limitations of the administr ations metrics accordingly the conference report directs the corps to contract with the national academy of public administration to study and recommend metrics for allocating corps construction appropriations across projects priorities and new starts to address the budget backlog the administrations request limited the number of new activities started to only one construction project and three planning ac tivities the presidents request would fund construction projects that could be completed in fy2006 and projects considered by the administration to be priorities similar to the presidents fy2005 request the nine national priority projects for fy2006 included the new york and new jersey harbor deepening project restoration projects in the florida everglades and the upper mississippi river system and projects to meet environmental requirements in the columbia river basi n and the missouri river basin hrept 10986 for the most part adopts the ne w starts of the presidents request however not all of the presidents prior ity projects receive the full amount requested and some appropriations were added to some ongoing c onstruction projects srept 10984 rejected the decimated planning program commented on the importance of planning for the agency and would fund much larger set of projects than the administrations request and the housepassed bill the senate and conference reports did not comment on new construction starts project suspensions using the performancebased budgeting criteria the administration identified 35 active construc tion projects to be studied for possible suspension ie to buy out current construc tion contracts rather than to complete them the fy2006 request would provide an 80 million fund with which to cancel contacts for these projects most of the projects proposed for suspension were included in the fy2005 request and have local project sponsors that have made investments and raised funds for their shar of construction costs the house chose not to restore funding for about half of the projects on the suspension list rather than funding suspension account the committee re quested more information on the cost of suspending these projects the senate and conference bills restored funding for more than twothirds of the projects proposed for suspension ecosystem restoration significant addition to the corps mission in recent years is role in large environmen tal restoration programs raising concerns that funding for these programs could di splace funding for other traditional water resources activities many largescale ecosystem restorations are in the planning phases or are awaiting congressional author ization these will require additional funds as they move into the more cost intensive constructi on and implementation phases other restoration activities are taking place in th context of addressing the environmental and species impacts of prev iously constructed projects the fy2006 request would provide 510 million for aquatic ecosystem restoration coastal louisiana the conference report provides 10 million for coastal louisiana ecosystem restor ation studies which is less than the 20 million requested by the administration the conference report provides 8 million for comprehensive coastal hurricane protecti on study which had not been included in the presidents request httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32852crs8 3 for more information on the modified waters deliveries project see crs report rs21331 everglades restoration modified water deliveries project by pervaze

million in the housepassed bill would fund everglades activities that were previously budgeted separately the central and southern florida project the kissimmee river restoration project nd the everglades and south florida restoration projects and the modified water deliveries project 35 million in corps appropriations for fy2006 the add ition of the modified water deliveries project followed the presidents budget propos that the project longer be funded solely through department of interior appropriations3 the budget request called for the corps to broaden its role in the project by having the agency jointly fund it with the department of the interior the administrations position is that the corps should pay for 124 million of the remainin g 191 million required to complete the project during fy2006 through fy2009 this pr oposal has raised question is the corps authorized to receive appropriations to work on the project according to the hrept 10986 the corps has sufficient au thority to receive and expend funds to proceed with project construction but according to srept 10984 the senate appropriations committee did not fund the modified waters project b ecause it does not believe sufficient current authorizati on exists for the corps to fund the work the senate bill also rejects the consolidation of the everglades projects together in one lineitem

hazardous and economically uncompetitive nuclear power 2010 president bushs specifi c mention of safe clean nuclear energy in his 2005 state of the union address indicated the administrations interest in encouraging construction of new commercial reactors for which there have been us orders since 1978 does efforts to restart the nuclear construction pipeline are focused on the nuclear power 2010 program which will pay up to half of the nuc lear industrys costs of seek ing regulatory approval for new reactor sites applying for new reactor licenses and preparing detailed plant designs the program is intended to pr ovide assistance for advanced versions of existing commercial nuclear plants that could be ordered within the next few years the nuclear power 2010 program is help ing three

two liquidmetalcooled and one moltensalt concept some of these reactors would use plutonium recovered through reproce ssing of spent nuclear fuel the administrations may 2001 national energy policy report contends that plutonium recovery could reduce the longterm envir onmental impact of nuc lear waste disposal and increase domestic energy supplies however opponents contend that the separation of plutonium from spent fuel poses unacceptable environmental risks and because of plutoniums potential use in nuclear bombs undermines us policy on nuclear weapons proliferation advanced fuel cycle initiative the development of plutoniumfueled reactors in the generation iv program is closely related to the nuclear energy programs advanced fuel cycle initiative afci for which the administration requested 700 million 38 above the fy 2005 level according to the budget justification afci will deve lop and demonstrate nuclear fuel cycles that could reduce the longterm hazard of spent nucl ear fuel and recover additional energy such technologies would invol ve separation of plutonium uranium and other long lived radioactive materials from spent fuel for reuse in nuclear reactor or for transmutation in particle accelerator the program includes longstanding doe work on electrometallurgical treatment of spent fuel from the experimental breeder reactor ii ebrii at inl the house added 55 million to the afci budget request to accelerate the development and selection of separations technolog later than the end of fy2007 that can address the current invent ories of commercial spent

nuclear hydrogen initiative an increase of 124 from the fy2005 level the house approved the same amount and the senate appropria tions committee recommended 300 million the conferees approved 250 million according to does fy2005 budget justification prelimin ary estimates indicate that hydrogen produced using nucleardriven thermochemical or hightem perature electrolysi s processes would be only slightly more expensive than gasoline and result in far less air pollution an advanced reactor that would dem onstrate coproduction of hydrogen and electricity the next generation nucl ear plant ngnp was allocated 250 million from does generation iv progra m by the fy2005 omnibus appropriations conference report the senate bill directed that 40 million of the

sites within the nnsas accounts c traditionally the annual federal payment to the uranium dd fund within the defense environmental cleanup account is treated as an ffset with respect to the total environmental management program funding level the conference report attributes portion of the decrease at the hanford site to delays in construction of the waste trea tment plant wtp the purpose of this facility is to vitrify highlevel radioactive waste removed from underground storage tanks vitrification involves the solidification of this waste and encasing it in glass logs for permanent

million remains available from fy2005 that could be used in fy2006 in reference to construction delays the conferees commented that doe needs better control and oversight of the scope cost and schedule of this project and directed doe to report to the appropriations committees by december 1 2005 on the actions taken to rectify the management failures of this project and to report quarterly on the status of this project beginning in 2006httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32852crs39 10 these sites include 1 nevada test site 2 sandia national laboratory 3 separation process research unit 4 kansas

is source for drinking wa ter and agricultural irrigation across the pacific northwest doe re ports that more than 270 billion gallons of groundwater covering an underground area of over 80 squa re miles at hanford is contaminated at levels that exceed federal drinking water standards members of congress states and communities have expressed ongoing concern regarding the risk to human health and the environment posed by the migration of this contamination into the river the conferees noted that current technology used in several remedies is not performing satisfactorily and there is lack of new t echnologies to address contamination issues in response to this concern the conf erence agreement pr ovides 10 milli on for assessing the migration of groundwater cont amination into the columbia river and for introducing new technologie s to protect water quality the conferees did not approve does pr oposed transfer of seven sites within the environmental management program to the national nuclear security administration nnsa10 instead the conferees increased funding above the request to continue support for these respons ibilities within the existing programmatic structure however as the administra tion proposed the conference agreement does not provide funding within the envir onmental management program for the continued disposal of waste at lawrence livermore national laboratory in california and at the y12 site in tennessee which is newly generated as result of activities conducted by the nnsa rather funding fo r the disposal of newly generated waste at these two sites is provided in the nnsas accounts cleanup status in addition to debate over annual appropriati ons there have been many longstanding issues associat ed with does environmental management program much attention has focused on the resources and time needed to clean up environmental contamination and to manage and dispose of radioactive and other hazardous wastes to date there are 114 geographic sites within the environmental management program includi ng the seven sites that doe proposed for transfer to the nnsa which were contaminated fro m nuclear weapons pr oduction or civilian nuclear energy research according to doe all response actions were complete at 76 of these sites as of the end of fy 2003 congress had appr opriated pproximately 70 billion through fy2003 for cleanup and si closure since the environmental management program was established in fy1989 doe expects cleanup to be complete at three additional sites by the end of fy2005 and at ven additional sites by the end of cy2006 yielding total of 86 of the 114 sites with cleanup complete efforts to accelerate cleanup although cleanup is projected to be complete at many of the remaining sites within decade cleanup at the most contaminated sites is not expected to be complete until 2035 does most recent estimate of future costs to complete its planned waste disposal and cleanup activitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32852crs40 is 95 billion from fy2004 through final site closure in 2035 this is substantially lower estimate than in past years as result of cost and time savings doe expects from its cleanup reform initiative doe launched this initiative in fy2003 and signed letters of intent with the environmental protection agency and the states to accelerate cleanup at its major sites doe also prepared performance management plans for many of its sites which ou tlined how cleanup would be accelerated and costs reduced in developing its plans to accelerate cl eanup doe established baselines for the completion of its planned waste disposal and remedial actions reflecting defined scope costs and schedules according to doe its goals of faster and less costly cleanup are being accomplished throug h awarding competitive contracts renegotiating existing contracts with performancebased incentives working with regulators on more efficient technical and regulatory approaches deploying innovative technologies and c oordinating with stakeholders and regulators to better define end states ie the intended condition or use of each site once cleanup is complete however the reductions in costs and time frames resulting from does planned acceleration of cleanup are merely estimates actual costs and time frames could differ depending on numerous factor s such as the regulatory approval of actions that doe wishes to take in the fu ture and the adequacy of these actions to protect human health and the nvironment over the long term questions have been raised as to how doe would accomplish its goals of faster and less costly cleanup without weakenin g environmental prot ection some have contended that more contamination may be left on site rather than removed because of the substantial amount of time required for certain types of radioactivity to decay arguments have been raised that contamination left in place may migrate in unexpected ways over the long term and re sult in pathways of exposure that could not have been predicted when the remedy was originally select ed others counter that completely removing radioactive contamination from all sites to permit unrestricted future land use and eliminate all future pathways of exposure would not be economically feasible and in some cases would be beyond the capabilities of current cleanup technologies the conferees noted their continued interest in does cleanup acceleration efforts specifically whether doe is meetin g its cleanup goals at sites scheduled for completion by 2006 2012 and 2035 respectively the conferees requested that doe submit milestone report twice year to the house and senate appropriations committees by march 1 and september 1 of each year milestones typically are individual cleanup actions to be completed by specific date which doe epa and the states have agreed would fulfill applicable regulatory requirements as described by the conferees this new report w ould track accelerated cleanup milestones at individual sites indicate whether milestones are being met and include estimates of annual funding needs and total lifecycl costs to complete cleanup the house appropriations committee had requested similar milestone report in its report on hr 2419 the senate appr opriations committee did not request such report but commented that doe has succeeded in making significant progress in accelerating cleanup and encouraged doe to continue to keep the remaining sites on track in addition to language in committee re ports on the fy2006 appropriations bills members also expressed concern about cl eanup progress at h earing held by thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32852crs41 senate energy and natu ral resources committee on november 15 2005 although members complimented doe for its effort s to accelerate cleanup at certain sites such as rocky flats they also commented that improvements could be made in increasing the pace of cleanup and lowering costs at other sites such as hanford disposal of tank wastes one of the more controversial issues regarding does cleanup acceleration in itiative has been how to dispose of radioactive and chemical wastes stored in underground tanks at the hanford site the savannah river site and the idaho national laborator for fy2005 doe requested 350 million for highlevel waste proposal account to prepare for the classification and treatment of some of the tank wastes as incidental to reprocessing and to eventually dispose of it as lowlevel waste or tran suranic waste of the 350 million request 249 million would have been for operatin g expenses mostly associated with removal of the liquid tank waste the remaining 101 million would have been for the construction of three facilities to treat the liquid waste that would be removed from the storage tanks and to process it to separate out the highlevel waste for permanent storage the most contentious element of doe s proposal was to leave some of the waste in the tanks and to dispose of it as lowlevel waste by mixing and immobilizing it with cementlike grout to seal it in place some members of congress states environmental orga nizations and communities opposed does proposal arguing that none of the tank wast should be allowed to remain in place among the chief concerns was the possibility that the grout might not mix thoroughly with the residual waste to contain it safe ly and prevent leaks however others asserted that there would be limited environmenta l and public health risk benefit to be gained by removing all of the waste from the tanks there also were concerns that removal of all of the waste would be tec hnically difficult pose significant health and safety risk to the work ers and be very costly after considerable debate the 108th congress included authority in the ronald w reagan national defense authoriz ation act for fy2005 pl 108375 for doe to classify some of the tank wastes at th savannah river site and the idaho national laboratory as other than highlevel waste and to dispose of some of the tank waste by grouting it in place if certain conditions are met however the authority was not extended to washington state where most of the tank waste is located at the hanford site for further disc ussion see crs report rs21988 radioactive tank wastes disposal authority in the ronald w re agan national defense authorization act for fy2005 coordinated by david bearden congress did not create separate account for does highlevel waste proposal in fy2005 however with the above authority c ongress appropriated 292 million out of the former defense site cceleration completion account for activities needed to reclassify and treat tank wastes at the savannah river site and the idaho national laboratory in preparation of grouting the residual wastes in place congress did not allocate any of this f unding for tank waste reclassification at hanford as the above authority was not extended to washington state instead other funds were allocated for ongoi ng tank waste activ ities at hanford the administrations fy2006 request did not include lineitem for high level waste proposal account as it did fo r fy2005 although doe planned to closehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32852crs42 one tank at the idaho national labor atory in fy2006 with the new waste reclassification authority the administrati ons request did not specify the amount of funding for the closure of this tank it also did not specify the amount of waste in the tank that may be reclassified and grouted in place the conference agreement did not specify the amount of funding for the closure of this tank either the fy2006 request did specify nearly 84 million for the construction of three waste treatment facilities at the idaho national laboratory and the savannah river site which were included in does orig inal request for the highlevel waste proposal account in fy2005 these facilities w ould be necessary for doe to process the waste removed from the tanks prior to grouting any residual waste that may remain upon closure the conference ag reement provides 45 million for these three construction projects including 92 million for project engineerin g and design for the sodium bearing waste treatment facility at the idaho national laboratory the same as the administration requested 353 million for project engineering and design for the salt wasteprocessing facility at the sa vannah river site 31 million more than the administrations request of 43 million and 500000 for construction of the salt waste processing facility at the savannah river site 695 million less than the administrations request of 70 million as noted earlier the significant reduction in funding is due to construction delays as result of unresolve d seismic issues office of legacy management related to the environmental management program the conference agreement provides almost 79 million for does office of legacy
