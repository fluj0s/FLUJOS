analyst in latin american affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division article 98 agreements and sanctions on us foreign aid to latin america summary during 2006 the administration and congress began to reassess some aspects of us policy towards the international criminal court icc because of unintended negative effects of that policy on relations with some icc member countries especially in latin america in congress support for aid restrictions on foreign aid to icc member countries that have not agreed to exempt us citizens from the courts jurisdiction has diminished this policy shift has occurred largely because of increasing concerns about the negative effects that iccrelated sanctions have had on us relations with latin america particularly in the area of security cooperation in july 2002 the rome statute that created the icc the first permanent world court created to judge cases involving serious human rights abuses entered into force the united states is not party to the icc and does not recognize its jurisdiction over us citizens since 2002 the bush administration has sought bilateral agreements worldwide to exempt us citizens from icc prosecution so called article 98 agreements there has been strong bipartisan support in congress for legislation aimed at protecting us soldiers and civilian officials from the jurisdiction of the icc in 2002 congress passed the american servicemembers protection act or aspa pl 107206 title ii which prohibits military assistance to countries that are party to the icc and that do not have article 98 agreements the nethercutt amendment to the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act hr 4818pl 108447 and fy2006 foreign operations appropriations act hr 3057pl 109102 prohibited some economic assistance to the governments of those same countries nethercutt aid restrictions continued in the fy2007 continuing appropriations resolution pl 109289 as amended and are likely to be included in the fy2008 foreign operations appropriation bill the fy2007 defense authorization act hr 5122pl 109364 which president bush signed into law on october 17 2006 modifies aspa to end the ban on international military education and training imet assistance to affected countries restrictions on foreign military financing fmf remain in place on november 28 2006 pursuant to section 574 of pl 109102 president bush waived nethercutt restrictions on fy2006 economic support funds esf to 14 countries including bolivia costa rica ecuador mexico paraguay and peru while some members of congress advocate ending all iccrelated sanctions others believe that some aid restrictions should remain in place in order to encourage other countries to sign article 98 agreements the issue of whether to continue these aid restrictions is likely to be considered during the 110th congress this report may be updated contents introduction 1 background 1 the international criminal court icc 1 us policy on icc immunity 3 bilateral immunity article

icc and article 98 agreements in latin america and the caribbean as of march 2007 5 article 98 agreements and sanctions on us foreign aid to latin america introduction in the past year policy consequences of us aid restrictions on international criminal court icc member countries that have not signed agreements exempting us citizens from icc prosecution have prompted policymakers to alter the policy somewhat latin america has been at the forefront of that reassessment in particular some negative consequences for us relations with latin america have occurred as result of iccrelated sanctions restrictions on military training aid have resulted in dramatic decline in the number of latin american military personnel receiving training in the united states similarly restrictions on economic aid have hindered the ability of us democracy and rule of law programs to work with governments in the region especially in the andean countries although most members of congress still support efforts to shield us citizens serving abroad from icc prosecution many are beginning to oppose the use of sanctions to attempt to persuade countries to sign bilateral immunity socalled article 98 agreements some members of congress advocate ending all icc related aid restrictions while others believe that at least some restrictions should remain in place in order to encourage other countries to sign article 98 agreements the issue of whether to continue these aid restrictions is likely to be considered by the 110th congress this paper discusses the evolving policy debate in the us government concerning the use of iccrelated foreign aid restrictions it focuses on the case of latin america and the caribbean region in which twelve countries including brazil bolivia ecuador and mexico have faced aid cutbacks for failing to sign an article 98 agreement background the international criminal court icc in july 2002 the rome statute that created the international criminal court icc entered into force the icc is the first permanent world court with jurisdiction crs2 to try individuals accused of war crimes and other serious human rights abuses1 the united nations human rights groups and most democratic nations supported the creation of the icc as of march 1 2007 104 countries have ratified the rome statute and are currently members of the icc2 the united states is not party to the court and does not recognize icc jurisdiction over us soldiers or civilians serving in other countries3 the icc comprised of eighteen judges and based in the hague may hear cases referred to it by the security council or by the states that are parties to the court the iccs lead prosecutor may also initiate investigations before case may be tried the icc must work with national law enforcement agencies that with support from the international community must make arrests and send defendants to the hague since its creation the icc has received three referrals by state parties and the security council also referred the situation of allegations of atrocities being committed in darfur sudan to the prosecutor4 the prosecutor has opened investigations into the cases involving the democratic republic of the congo the republic of uganda and darfur sudan in october 2005 the icc issued its first arrest warrants to five individuals implicated in connection to the situation in northern uganda some analysts have recently asserted that the bush administration has begun to soften its once vocal opposition to the international criminal court icc they argue that strong opposition to the icc within the administration has been gradually dissipating particularly since the us government allowed the security council to refer the darfur sudan situation to the icc in march 20055 according to state department spokesman sean mccormack we the us government fully support bringing to justice those responsible for crimes and atrocities that have occurred in darfur we are at point in the process where we could call upon the sudanese government to cooperate fully with the icc6 other analysts remain skeptical about whether fundamental shift in us policy towards the icc is occurring and believe that regardless of the courts merits the us government is going to continue to do all that it can in order to protect its military and civilians serving abroad from icc prosecution 1 these include genocide crimes against humanity war crimes and potentially the crime of aggression 2 see international criminal court assembly of state parties available at httpwwwicc

united states initially supported the idea of establishing an international criminal court fundamental objections to the proposed courts jurisdiction led the united states to vote against the rome statute the united states primary objections to the rome statute focus on the iccs possible assertion of jurisdiction over us soldiers who could be charged with war crimes resulting from legitimate use of force or us civilians who could be charged for conduct related to carrying out us foreign policy initiatives accordingly the united states has sought immunity provisions through the security council for authorized peacekeeping operations and has pursued bilateral agreements with countries that are parties to the icc in order to preclude extradition or surrender of us citizens from each respective country to the icc bilateral immunity article 98 agreements since 2003 the bush administration has sought bilateral agreements worldwide to exempt americans from icc prosecution socalled article 98 agreements on may 2 2005 angola became the 100th country to sign an article 98 agreement7 the state department has not publicly announced the signing of any other article 98 agreements since that time but few more agreements may have been concluded article 98 agreements involve each state promising that it will not surrender citizens of the other signatory to the icc unless both parties agree in advance to the surrender supporters of the policy say that these agreements are not unlike the status of forces agreements sofas routinely negotiated to protect us soldiers serving abroad from prosecution in foreign courts and are consistent with article 98 of the rome statute critics have dismissed article 98 agreements as unnecessary and accused the us government of blackmailing developing countries many of which are heavily dependent on us assistance into adopting them8 article 98 agreements with latin america the united states has concluded article 98 agreements with fifteen countries in latin america and the caribbean thirteen of which are in force table 1 depicts the status of each country in the region with respect to the icc and article 98 countries that are subject to sanctions under legislation are those that are both parties to the icc and that have not entered into an article 98 agreement with the united states those countries include barbados bolivia brazil costa rica ecuador mexico paraguay peru st vincent and the grenadies trinidad uruguay and venezuela although it has not signed an article 98 agreement argentina is exempt from sanctions as it was declared major nonnato ally in 1998 bolivia initially received sixmonth waiver from cuts in us military assistance that began in july 7 us signs 100th article 98

had signed but not ratified an article 98 agreement the waiver expired in early 2004 most of the article 98 agreements for latin america that are currently in force were signed in 2003 in the past two years only four additional countries in latin america and the caribbean are known to have signed article 98 agreements some countries have vocally opposed us efforts to persuade them to sign article 98 agreements in june 2005 thenpresident of ecuador alfredo palacios said that washington is free to defend its policies with respect to the icc but not at the expense of ecuadors sovereignty and legal standing9 other politicians in the region have accused the united states of blackmailing latin american governments into signing an agreement they oppose in principle10 the article 98 campaign has been particularly unpopular in south america region in which majority of the citizens support accountability for past human rights abuses international law and the icc in october 2005 mexico became the 100th country to ratify the rome statute despite the prospect of losing military and economic assistance from the united states11 at that time mexican government spokesman said that mexico will be irrefutable in supporting the protocols of the international court whatever the cost12 chile is considering ratifying the rome statute and is also unlikely to conclude an article 98 agreement

for those countries that were not original signatories of the rome statute crs6 legislation there has been strong bipartisan support in congress for legislation aimed at protecting us soldiers and civilian officials from the jurisdiction of the icc until recently there had also been strong support for sanctioning some foreign assistance to governments of countries that are parties to the icc and that do not have article 98 agreements with the united states the american servicemembers protection act aspa the american servicemembers protection act or aspa pl 107206 title ii prohibits military assistance to countries that have not signed article 98 agreements on july 1 2003 pursuant to the aspa the bush administration terminated military assistance to governments of countries that had not signed article 98 agreements under the legislation nato countries or major nonnato allies are exempted from those military aid restrictions13 aspa also gives the president the authority to waive the prohibition on military assistance without prior notice to congress if he determines and reports to the appropriate committees that such assistance is important to the national interest aspa has affected international military education and training imet and foreign military financing fmf assistance the nethercutt amendment the nethercutt amendment to the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act hr 4818pl 108447 prohibited economic support funds esf assistance to the governments of countries that have not entered into an article 98 agreement with the united states some countries including nato members and major nonnato allies are exempted from that aid restriction the president could also waive the prohibition on economic assistance for selected countries without prior notice to congress if he determined and reported to the appropriate committees that such assistance was important to the national interest the language also stipulated that countries that have been deemed eligible for millennium challenge account grants will not lose mca eligibility status due to the article 98 issue the nethercutt amendment was reenacted by the 109th congress as part of the fy2006 foreign operations appropriations act hr 3057pl 109102 unlike the fy2005 appropriation however the fy2006 act requires that the president give congress notice before he invokes waiver but that waiver may apply for any country that he deems to be of strategic interest to the united states it also stipulates that since esf may be obligated over twoyear period any leftover funds from fy2005 may now be made available for democracy and rule of law programs notwithstanding the provisions of sec 574 of pl 108447 13 major nonnato allies of the united states include argentina australia bahrain egypt israel japan jordan kuwait morocco new zealand pakistan the philippines south korea and thailand crs7 nethercutt aid restrictions continued in the fy2007 continuing appropriations resolution pl 109289 as amended and are likely to be included in the fy2008 foreign operations appropriation bill fy2007 defense authorization act modifies aspa on september 30 2006 the senate unanimously consented to conference report on the fy2007 defense authorization hr 5122s 2766 which was passed by the house on september 29 the conference agreement following the senate version of the bill modifies aspa to end the ban on international military education and training imet assistance to countries that are members of the icc and that do not have article 98 agreements in place the president signed the bill into law pl 109364 on october 17 restrictions on foreign military financing fmf remain in place under aspa other relevant legislative proposals during the 109th congress another bill was introduced hr 5995 engel that would have ended all restrictions on us aid to countries that are members of the icc and that do not have article 98 agreements in place if it had passed the bill would have required the repeal of both aspa and the nethercutt amendment article 98 and us aid to latin america the aspa and the nethercutt amendment have had an impact on us foreign assistance to latin america and the caribbean military assistance pursuant to the american servicemembers protection act or aspa pl 107 206 title ii the bush administration terminated military assistance to governments of countries that had not signed article 98 agreements as of july 1 2003 the military assistance prohibition has included international military education and training imet and foreign military financing fmf the imet program provides training on grant basis to students from allied and friendly nations fmf provides grants to foreign nations to purchase us defense equipment services and training in fy2003 prior to aspa the united states provided some 465 million in imet among the 12 countries sanctioned by aspa this funding enabled 771 military officers and civilian officials from those countries to receive training in the united states in fy2004 aside from bolivia which received temporary waiver from aspa provisions none of those countries participated in imet asparelated sanctions resulted in loss of 19 million in imet funding in fy2005 although military assistance losses may not be significant when viewed from regional perspective they have resulted in some acute aid cuts for particular countries including bolivia ecuador and peru some analysts also assert that fmf cutbacks totaling some 44 million in fy2005 and 3 million in fy2006 have made some military modernization projects crs8 difficult for the affected countries to continue others have responded that the effects of imet and fmf funding restrictions have not been that significant when one considers that they have been divided among several countries and have only been in effect for few years economic assistance through the securityrelated esf program the united states provides economic aid to countries of strategic interest to us foreign policy funding decisions on the esf program are made by the state department programs are managed by usaid and the state department strategic countries of interest to the united states are generally located in the middle east or south asia but 11 latin american countries have received some esf funding in recent years with bolivia ecuador mexico and peru among the largest recipients in fy2004 esf assistance to countries that are now subject to nethercutt aid restrictions totaled at least 426 million including some 114 million for mexico and 105 million for ecuador esf funds were spent on variety of projects including democracy rule of law and economic growth programs shifting policy debate over latin america in the last year policy consequences of the aspamandated aid restrictions have prompted debates within the administration and in congress in particular consequences of aid cutbacks for us security cooperation in latin america have begun to be examined and have led to some policy shifts this shift became evident in administration policy congressional hearings and in new legislation at the beginning of 2006 the bush administration appeared to be divided over whether to continue linking us assistance to article 98 agreements secretary of state condoleezza rice acknowledged that invoking aspa sanctions on key us military allies may be sort of the same as shooting ourselves in the footand that waivers of military aid restrictions are being considered on casebycase basis14 in addition the defense departments quadrennial defense review called for possible delinking of military training programs from aspa although the defense department and particularly the us southern command opposed aspa sanctions on military aid the bureau of politicalmilitary affairs of the state department reportedly strongly supported keeping the sanctions in place15 on june 22 2006 adolfo franco assistant administrator for latin america and the caribbean at the us agency for international development suggested that the bush administration was considering lifting iccrelated sanctions against latin 14 pablo bachelet us sanctions could be waived the miami herald mar 15 2006 15 us department of defense quadrennial defense review feb 6 2006 available at httpwwwforscomarmymilreeng1pmd2006qdrpdf jackson diehl losing latin policy are we about to punish democratic allies washington post mar 10 2006 crs9 american countries he stated that the administration had not yet decided whether to lift the sanctions on all countries affected in the region or only for select few some analysts asserted that the administration might lift the sanctions in order to improve the united states image in the region16 similar policy debates occurred during congressional hearings held early in 2006 that mentioned the effects of article 98 sanctions on us relations with latin america on march 8 2006 the subcommittee on western hemisphere affairs of the senate foreign relations committee held hearing on the consequences for latin america of the american servicemembers protection act subcommittee chair senator norm coleman expressed concern that as result of the aspa sanctions the united states is missing key opportunities to engage officers from the sanctioned countries and that this could lead to loss of us diplomatic influence in the region17 witnesses focused their testimonies on describing the political and military effects that aspa and nethercutt sanctions have had on countries in latin america and the caribbean one analyst asserted that the loss of imet is severing an important linkage between future military leaders from the region learning aboutthe us model of civilian control of the military reduced opportunities in the united states he added may lead countries in the region to look elsewhere including china russia or venezuela for training similarly esf restrictions may hamstring both us bilateral and regional efforts to push desperately needed structural reforms especially in the andean countries18 another analyst asserted that the implementation of aspa has damaged us standing in the region and that the effort to punish countries that dont sign article 98 agreements has been perceived as bullying or armtwisting19 the witnesses suggested several ways to mitigate the possible negative consequences of aspa on latin america and the caribbean those suggestions included encouraging the bush administration to issue national interest waivers to key allies in latin america or declare more countries in the region to be major non nato allies thereby exempting them from the aid restrictions another suggested option would be to repeal section 2007 of the aspa and omit the nethercutt provision from 2007 foreign operations appropriations legislation 16 linking of iccrelated sanctions seen

relations committee mar 8 2006 crs10 on march 14 2006 general bantz craddock thencommander of the us southern command while testifying before the senate armed services commitee stated that the aspa continues to have unintended consequences for latin america and that without imet funding countries have been unable to afford the unsubsidized cost of courses offered in the united states he stated that this loss of engagement prevents the development of longterm relationships with future latin american military and civilian leaders senator john mccain agreed with general craddocks concerns about aspa sanctions he asserted that the united states was paying very heavy price in countries where military aid programs have been cut his concerns about military aid cuts were echoed by senators john warner carl levin hillary clinton and james inhofe20 on june 21 2006 representative dan burton former chair of the house international relations committees subcommittee on the western hemisphere publicly asked the bush administration to changes its policy regarding aspa sanctions citing congressional concerns about chinas expanding influence in the region21 by the fall of 2006 the bush administration was ready to use waivers to waive restrictions on fy2006 imet and esf funds on october 2 2006 president bush directed the secretary of state to waive fy2006 imet restrictions for 21 countries barbados bolivia brazil costa rica ecuador mexico paraguay peru st vincent and the grenadines trinidad and tobago and uruguay were among the countries that received presidential waivers22 on
