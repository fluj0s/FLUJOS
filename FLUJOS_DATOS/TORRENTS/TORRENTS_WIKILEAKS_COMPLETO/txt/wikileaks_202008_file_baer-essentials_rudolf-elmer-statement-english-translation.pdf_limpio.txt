as an insider whistleblower i am able to disclose certain statements of affairs of bank julius baer the main intention of this letter is to disclose methods used and still being used by bank julius baer to avoid or decrease tax payments i have been the chief operational officer coo of bank julius baer trust ltd cayman i have been asked to transact unethical and immoral business for the bank i have cooperated firstly out of naivite and then for an annual salary of chf 220000 fact is that tax fraud evasion as well as massive aiding hereunto are part of the repertoire of this cayman bank owned by the swiss it succeeds to unjustifiably minimize taxes via julius baer and trust co ltd cayman islands and the julius baer holding ag zuerich unethically and immorally deprive the swiss people of tax funds evade banking regulations this report intends to protect my family as the public needs to know that i want to contribute to the swiss people understanding the operations of bank julius baer bringing tax evaders and defrauders to light in that their methods will be revealed stopped and longer be treated as peccadillo reconsideration of the interpretation of tax evasion fraud and the planning of this and maybe qualify it as exofficio matter for the future tax evasion and fraud being treated as preliminary stage for moneylaundering as this is the case in the us and germany more money flowing to the swiss and other states tax entities for them to achieve their tasks the swiss banking comission reconsidering and tightening their regulations and practices the swiss financial world by my account becoming more honest ethical and moral offshore investors becoming more aware of the risks they are running into as seen with swisspartner and other vehilces my wife and child not longer having to fear stalking by bank julius baer and threats from third persons what is this about bank julius baer is systematically moving taxable funds to the offshoreisland cayman islands as well as luxemburg or the taxhaven guernsey to minimize or reduce to zero their tax burden and that of their customers i call such entities bellevuegriten little whores i sometimes felt like the guard of those ladies who essentially are being abused the story is about the following limited liability companies of the julius baer holding ag which offer their services as offshoreentities of julius baer holding ag in the caymans islands julius baer bank and trust co ltd cayman islands the bank julius baer trust co ltd cayman islands the administrative company ursa ltd cayman islands the insurance company baer select management ltd cayman islands the investment manager creinvest ltd cayman islands the hedge fund shape ltd cayman islands the private equity company the common goal of these companies is to establish transactions only possible because of the lack of financial regulation and jurisdiction on the caymans as compared with wellregulated countries reduce the taxable revenues of the julius baer groups in switzerland and other countries for itself and its customers offer vehicles to swiss and foreign customers for tax evasion or even tax fraud offer the ability to swiss and foreign trustees to found companies on the caymans as well as guernsey and luxemburg in order to profit from this situation protect investors and naturally reduce taxes for the julius baer group only the mother company julius baer bank and trust co ltd cayman islands the bank is owned directly by julius baer holding ag zurich all other companies are owned by julius baer bank and trust ltd directly or indirectly and therefore only julius baer bank and trust co ltd cayman islands the bank appears to the outside this is effective as all other companies stay hidden neither the eidgenoessische banken kommision swiss federal banking comission nor the tax administration are ever shown the balances or profit calculations of these companies due to the confidentiality law on the caymans similar to the swiss banking law under which there is right for examination the estimated quantum of the tax reduction can be determined from the calculations at the end of this document this is not about an exact figure of the loss of tax revenue in switzerland but an order of magnitude and especially the methodology of offshore entities the numbers presented represent the beginning of this decade and are very likely much higher today in light of the growth of the group julius baer bank and trust co ltd cayman islands sole shareholder of julius baer bank and trust co ltd caymans islands the bank is the julius baer holding ag zurich this banked finances itself from switzerland via callmoney up to chf 160000000000 during my time of clients itinvests this money into the corporate bond portfolio which is actively managed from switzerland via the asset liability management the decision maker in zurich all investment decisions are make in zurich financing of bond purchases including assignment of customer call money is made and controlled in zurich buy and sell decisions are made in zurich and the risk management is facto exercised in zurich nevertheless it is feigned that the management had made decisions on the caymans i had to allot orders via lotus notes email an internal communication system even though the orders had long been placed the climax was that the bank kept these transactions in management protocols of julius baer and trust co ltd cayman islands formulating them to appear as if the decision making for buying and selling had taken place in the caymans this added up with my email order to originating the decision to the caymans these weekly management protocols had to be sent to zurich to the general administration the further proceedings with those protocols are not known to the bond portfolio not only holds longterm investments obligations of international financial reporting standards irfs category hold to maturity but also is trading book for instance liquibaer julius baer fund or also the legendary long term capital fund see attachment link the frequent acquisitions and sales of liquibaer shares were not to be booked only at the end of the month was the stock reconciled naturally fees were calculated on these acquisitions and sales foreign transactions even though all transactions were made via an account in zurich with bank julius baer account number 7265062 the acquisitions and sales generally pertained to accounts in zurich account and bondadministration is thus also done in zurich violation of tax laws swiss banking law clearly states that when administrative tasks are being accomplished in switzerland and an organizations only purpose is to circumvent tax regulations the organization is to be treated as swiss entity under swiss tax laws to avoid such treatment the business activity of the organization has to be independent and either investment decisions or strategic investment planning has to be performed by the foreign organization foreign organizations are only not subject to swiss tax laws if the following criteria is met taken from an english text an independent business activity should be performed at the foreign domicile in which either decisions for investments are made in person or that at least strategic investment plans are developed there in order to prepare respective decisions of other companies julius baer bank and trust co ltd caymans the bank is not acting independently in foreign domicil and thus is not subject to tax exemption as the decision takers for ie bond acquisitions and sales are domiciled in switzerland asset liabilty management of julius baer ag zurich the professional knowhow is nonexistent in the caymans and thus real administration is done there in reality only shadowaccounting is in place at julius baer bank and trust co ltd cayman the bond portfolio and the financing of the portfolio are held in zurich the profits of julius baer bank and trust co ltd cayman islands the bank and its daughter organizations roughly chf 1030000000 per year and probably much more today flow back as dividend to julius baer holding zurich the holding allowance is applied and the caymans interest yield is not taxed the foreign domicile should be furnished with infrastructure the offshorecompany must hire own staff which in act is working at the foreign domicile and possesses the required professional qualifications so that thereby the management of the offshorecompany on site is ensured not sufficient is this respect is the engagement of loan staff by the offshore company the offshorecompany has to obtain all necessary approvals and licenses with regard to the local legislation for its business the sole purpose of the vehicleconstruction should not be to minimise tax exposure in the home country if only one of the abovementioned criteria cannot be proved then the offshore company is qualified as passive investment entity this classification leads to extensive tax consequences ie direct federal taxes state and local taxes withholding taxes in switzerland violation of matching maturities bank julius baer and trust co ltd cayman islands the bank is financing longterm bond portfolio obligations with bonds of ifrs category hold to maturity as well as speculative tradingbook with customer and bankowned callmoney callable in 23 days in switzerland holding shortterm financing such as callmoney in amounts as julius baer bank trust co ltd caymans islands the bank is unlawful especially under swiss banking law and therefore not possible to do legally it is ridiculous that cayman bankinglaw allows for shortterm financing customer callmoney up to 90 of the balance and longterm obligations and speculative tradingbook investments of that money that customer callmoney is being used for financing of longterm bond portfolio is clearly in violation of swiss banklaw matching maturities naturally bank julius baer argues that things need to be regarded from the perspective of the holding not single organization or offshore entity in bankruptcy cases there is corporate liability which causes higher risk on the offshore investment it has never been the idea of the swiss legislator that shortterm investments callmoney should reside with 100 controlled group organizations the idea was to manifest risk distribution which means the money was supposed to be invested with third banks and not holdinginternal offshore organizations that renowned private bank is holding an offshore tradingbook is certainly despicable this is very risky as clear banking regulations regarding risk management can be avoided there is professional risk management in the caymans ursa ltd cayman islands 100 shareholder julius baer bank and trust co ltd cayman islands ursa is group internal insurance pseudocompany of the bank in place to reduce tax liabilities in switzerland and other countries by deducting insurance premiums as business expenses of bank julius baer zurich and other group organizations this concerns insurance premiums of ca chf 500000 per year probably more today the benefits from the bond portfolio and the gains from pseudo insurance premiums of group organizations make up the equity capital of ursa of around chf 25000000 ursa has not paid for one groupinternal insurance claim in the last 15 years as all losses are directly charged to the baer organizations which furthermore lead to local tax liability reduction the company has real administrative efforts and operative costs as it has employees decisions on the bond portfolio are made in zurich and london these services are not invoiced and therefore neither london nor zurich generates any incomes or tax liability moreover valueadded tax is being applied to the premiums even though ursa is indirectly held by julius baer holding ag zurich renderer and beneficiary of service are both in switzerland ursa is an instrument with the sole purpose of minimizing and evading taxes baer select management ltd cayman islands 100 shareholder julius baer bank and trust co ltd cayman islands the purpose of this organization is to act as an investment manager and employee investment advisors to delegate investment decisions to professional managers this is the height of tax minimization as the management fees investment advisory fees and partly the performance fees of swiss stocknotated companies creinvest ag zug and shape ag zugfreienbach are collected tax free offshore the company holds employees or furniture but manages the investment management mandate of diverse baer funds creinvest shape fixed income hedge funds and newly diverse other hedge funds baer select management ltd caymans islands investment manager has the mandate to perform investment management services via an investment advisor for instance for creinvest ltd cayman which is held by creinvest ag zug the services are charged with creinvest ltd cayman holding bond portfolio in zurich and new york at julius baer companies so taxfree profits can be generated in the cayman islands creinvest ag zug holds just enough dividend that operation costs can be covered and only very small profit is made in switzerland profitmanipulation naturally creinvest ltd cayman is profiting as the offshoreentity from the acquisitions and sales with many fewer charges and sketchy legal regulations in the cayman islands while swiss law for investment funds is rigorous such laws are nonexistant in the caymans also shape cayman and shape freienbach kanton schwyz the swiss tax haven are structured in the same manner creinvest ag zug and shape ag freienbach are assigned to the swiss stock exchange but the investment management appears to be moved to the caymans as result investment management fees and performance shares can be collected offshore by baer select management ltd cayman this again reduces taxable earnings due to switzerland and other countriesfurther funds like julius baer diversifed fixed income hedge fund cayman jb black sea frontier fund 2007 and julius baer equity hedge fund cayman are structured in the same way the management performance and investment management fees accumulate offshore with baer select management ltd cayman it also has to be regarded that creinvest ag zug as well as shape ag freienbach are using swiss infrastructure as they are listed on the swiss stock exchange swx the profits are entirely made by baer select management ltd caymans islands please see below these profits flow back as dividend to the julius baer holding ag zurich via julius baer bank and trust co ltd cayman the fact is that the winfee ratio definition difference between charged fees for investment management mandates and paid fees to socalled investment advisors that are economically generated by switzerland or another country accumulate offshore and are then transferred back to zurich to julius baer holding ag in this process the holding allowance is asserted and therefore profits are never taxed the ripoff especially the case of shape is violation of corporate governance the majority of customers who have invested in this product are customers of bank julius baer these customers gave mandate for asset management to the bank the management has exploited this and indirectly forced their own consultants to buy shape bonds for the customers this amounts to chf 130000000 that has forcibly been invested to make success of the shape entity in respectively generating more fees offshore the shape stock is an underperformer compared to the market the bank profits around 15 from the chf 130000000 though which equals to 2000000 annually it generates untaxed profits from its suffering customers assets calculation of fees for both organizations creinvest zug respectively cayman fund volume usd 340000000 fees range of 2 investment management advisory fees custodian fees for investments transaction fees performance fees the offshore organization baer select management ltd cayman gained around the year 2000 ca usd 12000000 per year taxexemptshape zugfreienbach respectively cayman fund volume chf 130000000 mainly customers with asset management mandates fees up to 2 investment management advisory fees custodian fees 02 transaction fees 10 performance fee is farce the performance is rarely if at all achieved the offshore organization baer select management ltd cayman generates ca 3700000 per year taxexempt is this us dollars or chf besides creinvest ltd cayman and shape ltd cayman the baerowned hedge funds pay fees to baer select management consequently baer select management is an actual cash cow that produces taxexempt profits offshore and moves these back to zurich julius baer trust and co ltd cayman islands the purpose of this organization is to offer the following services administration of mutual funds administration of trusts companies principally this organization also offers services to independent swiss asset managers who exploit the holes arising from the lack of knowledge of the cayman legislation and also generate certain management fees offshore that the swiss federal tax can be deprived of classic example is that of mr c l jr the former representative of julius baer mexico city and former member of the advisory board of julius baer cayman the julius baer corporation had to do moonlight flit there because of c l jrs involvement in the salinas story the swiss criminal prosecution has been investigating c l jr since 1995 for moneylaundering drugtrafficking misappropriation of funds and other criminal matters in detail bge 125 iv 165 on the 15th of november 1995 c l jrs assets in zurich were seized due to preliminary proceedings initiated by swiss authorities he was the trusted investment advisor to members of former mexican president raul salinas family and had also been involved with the assets of salinas brother at bank julius baer zurich it is known from reliable sources that the proceedings against him and the bank closed the due dilligence investigation in the salinas case was sloppy and is thus not punishable this leads to the assumption that sloppy due dilligence is treated as peccadillo in switzerlandthe cayman unit also offers trust company services to ascribe money back to switzerland via detours ie in forms of grants and thereby generate taxexempt interest from the credits offshore the concept of these fintex corporations is that money can be deposited on the account of customers offshore company with julius baer in zurich this offshore company is administered by the julius baer bank and trust co ltd cayman to make the money usable for the mother company the cayman corporation grants credit with profitable interest rate the expenses for interest are now declared justifiable as pertaining to business expenses and again swiss tax revenuesare reduced julius baer is aiding here actively to avoid taxes this offshore entity is also needed to make payments to third parties that are not liked by corporate accounting the question remains as to what return services are offered by the receiver in fact this company is bellevue grite julius baer bank trust co ltd cayman has also been used for course maintenance of the creinvest ag zurich stock creinvest stock was purchased in large volume to keep the stock up the companys own stock was up 40 at certain points in time bank julius baer zurich would not have been allowed to hold more than certain amount of stocks without involving the federal tax office thus the major part was transacted via julius baer bank trust co ltd cayman calculation of swiss tax losses due to

applicable to direct federal tax direkte bundessteuer state and local taxes staats und gemeindesteuer as well as withholding tax in case of payout of dividends these payouts would also be taxed as income if pertaining to human person all these tax burdens are not there for the offshore entity these numbers are based on experience from 1997 to 2003 and it is therefore clear that the massive growth of the baer group asset under management 2002 ca chf 170000000000 and 1900 employees versus chf 400000000000 and 4100 employees in 2008 must mean these numbers are pretty conservative and today are multiple due to higher transaction volumes and further funds on the caymans handling of offshore constructs by the cantonal tax office of canton zurich the responsible people with julius baer will respond to the facts presented in this report that all efforts have in detail been coordinated with the tax authorities the intermingling of the cantonal tax authorities with the zurich finance world has to be assessed critically from my perspective it is understandable that the canton zurich does not want to disgruntle the big tax payer julius baer and therefore grants socalled tax rulings but when the zurich tax authorities have once agreed to an offshore entity lot is needed before coming back to this decision the dimension of the profit that is generated offshore is not revealed when presenting the construct initially this would raise questions about the construct the cantonal tax authority thus grants permit without being able to know the dimension of tax loss furthermore as soon as construct has been ackonwledge by the tax authorities via written acknowledgement it is protected by cayman banking secrecy the tax authorities can then longer ask for disclosure the tax authorities therefore also never see balances of profit calculations from the cayman corporations and will never know the degree of taxsavings also interesting is that neither the confederate tax administration eidgenoessische steuerverwaltung nor the confederate withholdingtax authority or department for addedvalue taxes ever are consulted for such taxruling negotiations or have any right of codetermination it is the sole realm of the cantonal tax authority to pass such rulings julius baer argues that these offshore entities have been agreed upon with the tax administration and there also would be the arms length principle and therefore all is lawfully sound nevertheless the effect is that julius baer pays massively reduced taxes swiss small and mediumsized businesses can not afford such entities the people and the state lose tax revenue tax authorities are not allowed to use data caymandata that has lawfully come into my posession can not be used by the confederate tax administration for investigation as the responsible person for the bank i had to take tape copy home with to make sure bank data could be reconstructed timely in case of fire this would also have been the case for hurricane in which case i had to fly the data out of the island which i have done couple of times my employment contract was been cancelled while i was on holidays in the hospital in zurich for spinal surgery therefore one has asked for this data i therefore assert that i have lawfully obtained the data from the caymans there can be talk of theft this has also been stated in written form by the zurich prosecutor also the cayman jurisdiction has not accused but the weltwoche lukas haessig and sonntagszeitung meinrad ballmer started media campaign against as data thief ballmer went as far as to calling psychically suffering person even more aggravating is that the zurich judges denied the confederate tax administration the right to analyze the related files therefore making an investigation into baercaymancustomers and the bank itself impossible this has been confirmed by the confederate tax administration estv in letter the esvt has been denied access to records of the criminal prosecutor of the canton zurich against rudolf elmer this has been justified with the claim that the by the prosecutor illegally obtained files from bank julius baer are still subject to swiss banking secrets in proper criminal investigation the prosecutor would not have been able to seize customer data from daughter company of bank julius baer in foreign country as rudolf elmer is still subject to the banking secrecy the estv can not use any oral or written statements from you in any investigation against particular persons or organizations as this information would have been obtained illegally by us this justification is ridiculous and only an argument pushed forward to deny access to records in contrast the prosecutor has granted access to even those files to the compensation fund of the banks ausgleichskasse der banken which lead to the bank having to remargin thousands of franks of social security payments obviously the rights of the confederate department of finance and the confederate department of social insurance to access the files are being judged differently by the zurich judges this shows clearly that the swiss legislation is just not sufficient in such cases the bank can optimize its tax evasion and the state can not call this bank to account when it learns about it the wrongly manifested statements in the management protocols on the caymans that account for acquisition and sales decisions being taken in the caymans 67 hours after the actual transaction occured can thus not be prosecuted discussion about the ethics and morality of such behaviourdecision is superfluous responsibilities the following people know about and have the responsibility for the activities of bank baer on the cayman islands raymond baer vr

oetterli director baer select management ltd caymans islands director bank julius baer co ag zurich protection of the investor this example shows how important it is that the investor have control over his offshore vehicle and does not give full management mandate to an unprofessional consultant this pertains to the offshore proeduct swisspartner an example in english languagea united states resident claims he lost 22 million as result of the mishandled restructuring of his offshore account made necessary by swiss banks agreeing to cooperate with the irs at the center of the allegations are bank julius baer and dexia private bank both of switzerland and investment firms controlled by liechtensteinische landesbank ltd of liechtenstein anthony defries of berryville virginia alleges the value of his securities portfolio plummeted after he was induced by his advisers to give up direct control in order to comply with u s tax laws four months later the portfolio had lost 22 million as his money managers failed to implement limit strategy or obtain insurance as they should have it was alleged in an effort to recoup his losses defries filed civil complaint at the u s district court for the eastern district of virginia on october 29 2003 alleging securities and insurance fraud defendants are swiss partners investment network ltd of liechtenstein swiss partners insurance company

baur residing in switzerland and alfons widmer residing in switzerland defries indicated his lawsuit may turn into class action on behalf of any policyholder who participated in or purchased insurance products from swiss partners insurance company spc during the relevant period the defendants have been requested to provide details of the holders of optional variable annuities so that those holders might be asked if they wished to pursue such class action but the defendants have failed and refused to provide any such information he alleged defries claims that from 1997 to 2001 the defendants dealt in unregistered securities in violation of the securities act 1933 and sought to pass off those securities as unlicensed insurance products defendants further engaged in conspiracy with each other to set up market disseminate and sell unregistered securities and unlicensed insurance products and socalled purported deferred variable annuity insurance policies in the usa and in switzerland and carried out course of conduct involving such fraud conspiracy reckless behavior and attendant actions occurred in the period between 1997 and 2001 defries claims that his own problems began in april 2000 when rainer moser of spinspc advised him of new irs ruling under which all us equity holders who were us residents would be required to pay full withholding tax and penalties moser said that the swiss banking community had agreed to cooperate with the irs and disclose the us resident owners of all swiss accounts the deadline for such disclosures and penalties was december 2000 spin advised defries that reconstruction of the portfolio and the necessary insurance protection in the form of deferred variable annuity would have to be implemented before that date they insisted that the account management be made entirely local at spin with direction from defries or the us they specifically described insurance guidelines and restrictions as requiring complete cutout of any us direction management or control defries claims that he relinquished direct control of his account in july 2000 and that by november 2000 his securities portfolio had suffered losses of approximately 22 million much of the loss was incurred in the stock of bookham technology plc whose shares are listed on the london stock exchange and nasdaq stated defries he said he made profit of 15 million on an initial investment of 500000 in bookham in 1999 when it conducted very successful ipo in 2000 the bulk of this profit was subsequently lost by failure of spin to take required and requested action to protect the stock he alleged as bookhams share price fell from 40 to 12 spin failed to act on defries request to establish limit strategy for bookham to protect the entire position at 35 to 40 this is only one example of many incidents within julius baer group it can be acknowledged here that julius baer warned the customerthe second whistleblower letter will be dedicated to the topic of taxruling of the zurich tax department and the role of wellknown law firm in the bahnhofstrasse zurich in this the third whistleblower letter will deal with the topic of practices pertaining to single formerly existant cases to demonstrate in what ways external asset managers use offshore vehicles rudolf elmer february 2008
