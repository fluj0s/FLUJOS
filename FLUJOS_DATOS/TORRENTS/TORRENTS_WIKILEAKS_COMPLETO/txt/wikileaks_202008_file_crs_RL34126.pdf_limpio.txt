commodity issues may occupy center stage in policy discussions of the periodic omnibus farm b ills rural comm unity and economic development are also topics of congressional concer n and separate title within the farm bill since 1973 omnibus farm bills have included rural development title the most recent is title vi of the food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110246 positioning rural areas to better compete in global economic environment is one of the key issues framing the current debate about the future of rural america when agricultural production and re lated businesses dominated rural economies policies that strengthened and improved agriculture tended to strengthen and improve the wellbeing of most of americas small communities and rural residents as the strength of this linkage has declined the need for new sources of rural economic development has become more apparent to policymakers and rural development practitioners congressional interest in rural policy encompasses wide range of issues including agriculture forestry and mining community infrastructure natural resource conservation and management medical care bioenergy and economic development current challenges to and reform of existing federal rural policies are evolving in an environment of increas ing concern about ec onomic competitiveness shift away from agriculture toward manufacturing and services new federal political strategies and the emergence of new political interests in farm bill deliberations changing rural america is also producing pressures for different policies and raising ne w questions about what congress s role should be in shaping rural policy both agriculture and manufacturing issues are increasingly seen as elements of global and regional restructuring which have significant implications for rural areas especially those areas where these pro duction sectors remain dominant today nearly 90 of total farm househol d income comes from offfarm sources1 manufacturing now accounts for about 25 of rural private sector earnings and about 12 of all rural jobs the service sector as with the us domestic economy as whole now dominates the rural labor market although the rural service sector differs from the metropolitan service sector in terms of job categories skills and wageshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34126crs2 the rural development title of farm bills generally supports 1 the infrastructure of rural areas with traditional assistan ce for housing electri cal generation and transmission water and wastewater nd community capacity 2 agricultural development and 3 rural business cr eation and expansion more recently policymakers have pushed for programs that support innovative and alternative business development and innovative mechanis ms to finance it pressure for such alternative approaches is expected to continue as policymakers recognize the changing structure of agriculture and the great diversity among rural communities with some rural areas growing and prospering and others falling further behind as their primary industries including agricultu re either decline or adapt to global economy such adaptation and disloca tion over the past decade has often meant fewer rural employment opportunities nd significant population outmigration for many rural communities to emphasize the importance of agricu ltural production in the local economies that still characterize many rural areas gislative support for technologies to help farmers with planting decisions and local investments in industries that will add value to their products have become impor tant aspects of rural development policy research is also increasingly focused on improvements in agricultural waste management and environmenta l protections traditional strategies notably value added agriculture eg regional food pr ocessing plants cooperatives organic farming biofuels are being promoted by many in the farm sector while holding promise for agriculture and surrounding communities there remain limits on the extent to which agriculture and other ma ture industries can become significant engine for renewed rura l economic prosperity while commodity policy dominates much of the debate and most of the funding production agriculture remains comparativel small and shrinking part of the rural economy with less than 8 of the rural population employed in agriculture there is growing recognition that farmers in many rural areas depend more on healthy rural economy than the rural economy is pendent on farmers for its vitality the need to strengthen the capacity of rural areas more generally to compete in global economy is becoming more widely appr eciated as the limitations of commodity subsidies peripheral manufacturing and physi cal infrastructure as mainstays of rural development policy become more obvious issues influencing the rural development title emerging policy issues surround the ques tion of whether current farm policies which rely heavily on commodity suppor t payments and subsidies to few production sectors help hinde r or have little impact on the future development of economically viable rural communities rural manufacturing which tends to be lowerskilled and lowerwaged is also unde rgoing restructuring with the loss of manufacturing to foreign competition wh ile transformation to service economy continues in rural america service employment in many rural areas tends to be in lowerwage personal services rather than business and producer services continuing population and economic declin in many farming and rural areas is compelling policymakers and rural areas to create new sources of competitive advantage innovative ways of providing public services to sparse populations and new ways of integrating agriculture into changing rural economieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34126crs3 more recently economic development fforts in some areas have targeted various entrepreneurial st rategies and microenterpri development these approaches attempt to capitalize on particular areas distinctive social economic and environmental assets nd advantages to build endogenously on existing local and regional strengths developing local nd regional entrepreneurial culture seems to be an important approach in these effort s successes linking public and private sources to build business incubators is common strategy as is developing new commercial ties with area colleges and universities communities are also applying such entrepreneurial energy to making th eir local governments schools and hospitals more efficient through for exam ple telecommunication innovations the trends noted above suggest range of issues that are important in shaping the provisions of the rural development title of the 2008 conservation and environmen tal restoration as rural employment opportunities stemming rural popula tion outmigration vertical integration and coor dination of agriculture into supply networks and their implication for rural areas developing rural trepreneurial capacity rebuilding an aging rural physical infrastructure public service delivery innovations in sparsely populated areas increasing suburbanization and the conflicts between agriculture and suburban development human capital deficiencies in rural areas regionalbased efforts fo r economic development connecting businesses and rural communities with broadband telecommunica tions infrastructure the rural development title of the 2008 fa rm bill has taken shape against this backdrop of shifts in the rural economy widespread and longterm poverty in some rural areas outmigration in other rura l areas dwindling economic opportunity in rural areas gaps in critical infrastructure and growing appreciation in many quarters of the limits of existing rural deve lopment programs to respond to the great diversity of rural places and socioeconomic circumstances such issues give rise to several policy rele vant questions how effective are current federa l programs in improving the competitive position of rural areas can broadbased federal rural programs be better targeted to the critical needs of particular rural areas how might regional funding appro aches be better integrated into federal policy for rural areas how can federal policies better assist entrepreneurial efforts in ruralcommunities how might the biofuels emphasis in the upcoming farm bill beconnected to rural development programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34126crs4 2 more information on individual usda rural development programs can be found in crs report rl31837 an overview of usda rural development programs federal rural development programs more than 88 programs administered by 16 different federal agen cies target rural economic development the rural deve lopment policy act of 1980 pl 96355 however named usda as the lead federal agency for rural development usda administers most of the existing rural development programs and has the highest average of program funds going directly to rural counties approximately 502 three agencies are responsible for us das rural development mission area the rural housing service rhs the rural businesscooperative service rbs and the rural utilities service rus an office of community development provides community development support through rural developments field offices it is important to note that most loan and grant programs administered by usda rural development are funde d through annual discreti onary appropriations the rural development title of omnibus farm bills does not address every program administered by the three usda mission agencies these various programs are permanently authorized of ten through amendments to the consolidated farm and rural
