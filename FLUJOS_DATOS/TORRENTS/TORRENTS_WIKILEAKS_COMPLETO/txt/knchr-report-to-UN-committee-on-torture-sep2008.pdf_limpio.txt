presentation to the committee against torture to inform its review of kenyas initial country report on the implementation of the conve ntion against torture and other cruel inhuman and grading punishment or treatment cat prepared by the kenya national commission on human rights knchr september 30 2008 table of contents introduction 2 review of state report 2 part i 2 part ii 3 article 1 3 article 21 4 article 22 5 article 7 5 article 12 6 article 14 6 article 16 7 conclusions and recommendations 7 introduction 1 the kenya national commission on human rights hereinafter knchr or the commission is an independent national human rights institution established by an act of parliament kenya national commission on human rights act 2002 the knchr is broadly mandated under section 16 of its cons titutive statute to protect and promote human rights through among ot her things acting as the chief agent of the government in ensuring compliance with the governments obligations under interna tional human rights tr eaties and conventions 2 kenya acceded to the convention ag ainst torture and other cruel inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment hereinafter cat on 21st february 1997 and submitted its first state report on 16th august 2007 to the committee against torture fo llowing the drafting and validation of the same as national human rights institution the knchr participated in critiquing of the re port on the basis that it was the duty of the state to write the report and that the commission alongside other stakeholders could make comments on the veracity of the report without prejudicing their ability to provide information if and as necessary to the committee against torture 3 the knchr wishes to make the following comments on the country report that may assist the committee when reviewing and preparing its concluding remarks on kenyas report review of state report part i 4 the knchr commends the govern ment for ratifying the core international and regional human right s instruments on protection against torture including cat itself most r ecently the government ratified the international convention on the rights of persons with di sabilities which also includes specific provisions protect ing persons with disabilities from torture or cruel inhuman or grading treatment or punishment 5 the knchr however decries the governments slowness in the implementation of the provisions of cat the knchr also notes the reluctance by the government to acced to or ratify the optional protocols to various conventions including the optional protocol on the convention against torture cruel or inhu man and degrading treatment or punishment opcat in failing to ratify optional protocol such as opcat the government continues to restrict accountability mechanisms and limit access to detention centres by both local and international institutions 6 the knchr also recognizes kenyas dualist system which requires domestication of international inst ruments through acts of parliament while some aspects of cat have been domesticated for example via amendments to section 14 of the po lice act forbidding the police from employing torture the knchr not that proper and effective domestication of cat still needs to happen via amendment or repeal of legislation which undermines im plementation of the convention 7 the country report states on page 7 that the bill of rights in the constitution does not provide for economic social and cultural rights and the knchr wishes to stat further that as well as economic social and cultural rights the const itution does not provide fo r group rights nor does it cater for rights of vulnerable gro ups including disabled persons and other minorities 8 the knchr reiterates the averment s in paragraph 38 of the country report and notes the challenges in accessing credible information and statistical data noting that as result of the failu re by the government to collect and ensure storage of such data the country report falls short of providing requisite data th at would better illustrate certain information and give better picture of the status of torture in kenya including among other issues the number of law enforcement of ficers who have been charged in courts for perpetrating crimes of torture b the number of law enforcement fficers who have been dismissed for perpetrating torture and c the total number of cases where victims of torture have been compensated including the period of time between the decision of the case and the actual compensation part ii article 1 9 despite being created by law and being empowered to monitor and investigate human rights abuses th knchr has on many occasions been thwarted by government agencies such as the police force from undertaking its monitoring and investig atory work while the government has made many statements about its commitment to protecting kenyans against torture these have in many instances not been backed by actions while the knchr recognizes that its mandate to visit prisons has been used to good effect the knchr note s the need for the government to open up places of detention to scru tiny by other institutions through among other ways acceding to opcat the knchr also appreciates the need to harmonize the workings of the police with those of the knchr to ensure that the two bodies work in harmony article 21 10 the knchr commends the government for opening up the nyayo torture chambers to the public however the knchr notes that this is not enough the government should institute cases against perp etrators of the crime of torture and provide redress to the victims of the torture chambers this will curb the culture of impunity existent in kenya which promotes instances of torture particul arly during arrest search and seizure as well as when suspects are in rema nd in police stations and prisons the knchr therefore recommends that the government s hould ensure that all instances of torture are promptly and independently investigated in thorough manner 11 the knchr recognizes the existence of the constitutional office of the attorney general mandated under section 26 of the constitution to institute and undertake criminal pro ceedings as well as to task the commissioner of police to investigate alleged offences there is need for the attorney general to take up complaints on allegations of torture by victims of torture as well as by institutions mandated with the investigatory role such as the knchr or nongovernmental organizations that engage in investigations into incidences of torture including the institute of medical legal unit 12 the knchr further notes that despite the governments reluctance to ratify opcat it has deployed tw frameworks which allow for independent visitation to places of tention as stipulated by the prisons act as well as the constitutive act of the knchr the provisions empower the district commissioner resident magistra judges and all administrative officers to be visiting ju stices of prisons as well officials of the knchr visit prisons despite the existence of such frameworks there are various shortcomings including that the provisions have for long time largely remained dormant the prevalent culture in government was to deny the existence of torture in prisons and the national psyche has been that prisoners have rights further many of the appointments of visiting justices were not backed with ppropriate resources and capacities as such many of the justices have either capacity to carry out the task or have not take n the exercise seriously b there is mandatory obligation on the visiting justices to visit prisons c there are provisions requiring visiting justices either to publicise or follow up on their recommendations d there are also obligations on th prisons authorities to comply with the recommendations article 22 13 the knchr notes that although secti on 83 of the constitution provides that the prohibition of torture is on of the rights that are nonderogable even in times of war there were numerous instances during the post election violence when members of the public were subjected to torture by security personnel as well as in mount elgon where torture was used by the kenya armed forces to quell viol ence such instances highlight the governments continued failure to prevent use of torture against members of the public 14 following its investigations into the post election violence the commission in its report on the brink of the precipice human rights account of kenyas post elec tion violence reported widespread instances of use of excess force by members of the kenya police particularly in nyanza province 15 in another report highlighting instances of extrajudicial killings titled cry of blood the commission highlight ed instances of disappearances including from police custody and deaths of mainly young men suspected of belonging to gang known as mungiki according to post mortem reports over 500 young men of kikuyu origin are alleged to have died of gun shot and other wounds with some having been shot in the back of their head 16 in the mount elgon oper ations by the kenyan army and police there were complaints by some members of the public and human rights institutions of excessive use of force indiscriminate bu rning of houses and food stores rape of women and young girls and killings of innocent people the commission draws particul ar attention to its report titled mountain of terror of may 2008 in that report the commission noted that security forces deployed by th government to mount elgon in the rift valley province to combat the insecurity caused by the sabaot land defence forces militia and recover illegal arms used torture as tool to obtain confessions from members of the sabaot community concerning membership of the militia and illegal arms despite members of the public having suffered violations of human ri ghts and in part icular torture during the military operations in their rebuttal the armed forces were adamant that the use of force was coincidental to their duty during the operations article 7 17 the knchr further notes that alt hough section 72 of the constitution provides that persons who are arrested for crimin offences shall be produced in court within reasonabl time ranging from 24 hours to 14 days after arrest the unavailability of legal aid particularly for persons charged with serious crimes mean s that such persons do not have representation further although the prisoners may be presented to court within the requisite time they may be required to represent themselves thereby being denied of fair treatment in certain cases some prisoners are kept in custody for more than th 14 days for capital offenders and 24 hours for other offenders which amounts to cruel and inhuman treatment it should be noted howev er that recent court decisions have been firmer to protect accused persons where they have been held for more than the constitutionally provided time article 12 18 the knchr notes the need for reforms of the police force currently police officers who are accused of perpetrating torture are investigated by fellow police officers with the increase in incidences of torture particularly within the police force the knchr calls on the government to undertake reforms to create transparency and ensure victims seeking redress are guaranteed the requisite redress in relation to the post elections violence for example the knchr proposed that where the police force is accused of perpetrati ng violence against civilians the government should appoint special in vestigator and special prosecutor to investigate and prosecute arising cases article 14 19 the knchr notes that while limitations exist with regards to the amount of time which complainant has to in stitute legal suit for compensation the same limitation does not exist as to the period for consideration of any case section 72 of the constitution provides that where person is arrested or detained they should be tried within reasonable time notably the constitution does not define reasonable time the country report also notes that victim of torture can obtain monetary compensation from the government upon institution of claim in civil court the knchr notes that while th is is true monetary compensation of victims is in various instances slowed because of the delays in conclusion of cases and in certain cases victims have died prior to receipt of their compensation although the family may institute legal suit to claim compensation on behalf of th eir deceased family member the knchr notes the need for redress to be guaranteed upon the victim as priority article 16 20 the country report notes that children ar not held in the same enclosures as adults while this is true the knchr has established isolated cases in various prisons including industrial area kamiti kericho and bungoma prisons where children were held in the same enclosures as adults in other institutions such as police stati ons the knchr has also encountered incidences where children have been tained with adults more so hard core criminals the onus is on the government to ensure that where children are with their parents in dete ntion centres they are not subjected to degrading treatment conclusions and recommendations 21 the knchr appreciates the efforts of the government in the promotion and protection of its citizens against torture the knchr recommends that the government should domesticat cat domestication will at least in part guarantee its implementation 22 kenyas judiciary should be educated and encouraged to enforce constitutional provisions agains t torture innovatively even where substantive domestication is still being awaited tribunal of the knchr in 2006 made specific ruling providi ng monetary redress for journalist who proved his case to the effect that kenyan police had tortured him contrary to section 73 of the constitution the makori case 23 the knchr further notes the need to sensitize the public on the existence of the convention and particularly its provisions the knchr is playing key role in educating law enforcement officers as well as prisoners on their rights by among other things putting information education and communication iec materials in prisons the commission has for number of years now been negotiati ng with the police force so that billboards setting out the rights of arrested persons may be erected within police stations such activities will help to curb practices of torture and the culture of impunity sensitization w ill also educate the public on the various aspects of torture including mental torture 24 the knchr also notes the need to build capacities for specialized institutions to provide counselling serv ices to victims of torture including victims of the nyayo torture chambers 25 the knchr notes that under kenyan law the offen ces of murder treason and robbery with violen ce carry mandatory death sentence kenya has not executed any convict since 1987 and therefore while kenya has not jure abolished capital punishment practice facto testifies to the presence of an unofficial moratorium on enforcement of the death sentence the nonenforcement of the death penalty leaves persons on death row with great anxiety on account of the reality of death hanging on them from the moment of sentencin g and this amounts to cruel inhuman and degrading treatment 26 the knchr notes that couple of ne w innovations have been established legislatively or administratively by the government with the aim of preventing or investigati ng torture these include passage of the witness protection act of 2006 and the admini strative establishment in september 2008 of the police oversight board with mandates to investigate police abuses including torture unfortuna tely this board does not have statutory basis and its ability to operate independently will thereby be greatly undermined 27 finally the knchr notes that combati ng terrorism has also resulted in accusations that agencies of the state or even agents of foreign states have participated in acts against kenya n citizens or residents which may amount to torture claims involving the rendition of kenyans to ethiopia and even guantanamo bay have been recorded and the kenyan state has not given satisfactory explanations on these cases again however the courts have on occasion passed firm judgement where violations of the constitution have happened
