eig legislative attorney american law division summary several bills introduced during the 106th congress would ease restrictions that deny aliens with criminal recor ds chance to have their ties to the us considered before being deported one of these bills hr 5062 passed the house september 19 2000 since the 1980s congress has made discretion ary relief from deportation increasingly unavailable to aliens who have engaged in serious criminal conduct in 1996 however congress broadened the automatic disqualification from relief to cover much wider range of criminal activity than had been covered before furthermore the expanded disqualification now covers previously nondisqualifying activities that occurred before the 1996 changes were enacted generally the proposals pending before congress would ease current relief restrictions without restoring pre1996 standards in full some would apply their standards to longterm residents who were denied relief because of the retroactivity of the 1996 changes this report will be updated as legislative developments warrant introduction in setting rules for which aliens may enter the us and the conditions of their stay here the immigration and nationality act of 1952 ina as amended 8 usc 1101 et seq both lists classes of undesirable aliens and provides possible relief from removal for certain aliens within those classes various categories of criminal aliens aliens who have engaged in criminal activity have long been among the classes of undesirable aliens who may be denied admission into and removed from the us in the 1980s congress designated specified crimes as aggravated felonies under the ina and singled out aliens who commit such crimes as an immigration enforcement priority the ina softens its deportation provisions by allowing aliens who have long resided here to have their community and family ties taken into account before being forcibly removed historically this discretionary relief from removal has been most broadlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20681crs2 available to aliens who have been admitted for permanent residence also known as legal permanent residents lprs or green card holders however two laws enacted in 1996 have made it more difficult for longterm aliens facing removal including lprs to have their ties here taken into account in the removal process these two laws the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa pl 104132 and the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira division c of pl 104208 especially affect those who have committed crimes since aedpa and iirira were enacted there have been many stories in the press on lprs and other longterm residents becoming subject to mandatory removal on the basis of crimes some regard as insuff iciently serious to bar all consideration of an aliens position in the community some of these accounts pertain to aliens whose crimes occurred well before aedpa and iirira became law several bills introduced during the 106th congress seek to reverse the 1996 restrictions at least in part some would also apply their standards both prospectively and to aliens already affected by the 1996 changes cancellation of removal background prior to 1996 discretionary relief based on longterm presence included 212c relief which was limited to lprs and suspension of deportation in order to be considered for either of these an alien had to 1 meet durational presence requirements and 2 not fall within specified disqualifying classes additionally an alien seeking suspension of deportation had to show that specified degree of hardship would result from his or her removal more specifically to be considered for 212c relief an alien had to be an lpr and have been maintaining an unrelinquished domicile in the us for at least seven years and not i be in either the national security or child abduction classes of inadmissible aliens or ii have served at least five years in prison for one or more aggravated felonies before the 1996 amendments an alien who was deportable on criminal fraud or security grounds was nonetheless eligible to be considered for suspension of deportation if the alien had been physically present for 10 years the alien had good moral character which by statute and case law is precluded by certain criminal activity and the aliens deportation would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien or to the aliens citizen or permanent resident spouse child or parent less strict standards 7 years presence and extreme hardship existed for aliens who were deportable on other grounds while even more eased standards existed for certain abused spouses and children 1996 amendments aedpa and iirira together tightened the eligibility for 212c relief and suspension of deportation and consolidated them into new form of relief known as cancellation of removal httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20681crs3 as stated above 212c relief had been unavailable to certain child abductors national security risks and convicts regardless of the length and depth of their presence enacted in april 1996 aedpa greatly expanded the category of criminal aliens who were barred from applying for 212c relief to include all aliens who were deportable on criminal grounds as opposed to only barring those aliens who had served five years for one or more aggravated felonies congress nominally eased these aedpa restrictions in iirira which became law on september 30 1996 when it restricted the bar to aliens who had been convicted of an aggravated felony nevertheless iirira concurrently narrowed the scope of this change by significantly expanding the number of crimes that constitute aggravated felonies also iirira imposed new limits on what periods of time spent in the us may be included in counting toward the requisite physical presence meanwhile iirira restricted what had formerly been suspension of deportation through among other changes adoption of longer and stricter presence requirements and more demanding hardship standards current requirements under current 240aa of the ina an lpr who is otherwise inadmi ssible or deportable may nevertheless be allowed to retain permanent residency status if the alien has been an lpr at least five years the alien has resided in the us continuously at least seven years after having been admitted in legal status though not necessarily in lpr status eg in student nonimmigrant status and has not been convicted of an aggravated felony both the presence requirements and criminal disqualifications under current law are more restrictive than their pre1996 counterparts first the requirement that an alien have been an lpr for minimum period in addition to having had an unrelinquished domicile for at least seven years and being an lpr when applying is new second while the aggravated felony ground for disqualification is narrower than the shortlived aedpa restrictions it is far broader than the pre1996 ground that only those aliens who served at least five years were disqualified iirira provisions on aggravated felonies and tolling presence further narrow relief aggravated felonies term added to immigration law in the late 1980s to target serious criminals was originally limited to murder and trafficking in drugs or firearms after iirira aggravated felonies includes 19 types of federal state or foreign offenses among them all thefts or crimes of violence for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year although the generic classes crimes of violence and theft crimes were used in defining categories of aggravated felonies prior to 1996 only those crimes of violence and theft crimes for which at least five years imprisonment was imposed were included beyond significant reducti ons in the imprisonment threshold for disqualifying crime iirira also added provi sion to the ina 101a48b that requires that all references to terms of imprisonment in the ina be coun ted by including any period of imprisonment that was suspended in addition to broadening the class of aggravated felonies iirira also restricts eligibility for discretionary relief through its timestop provisions prior to iirira the period of physical presence required for relief could be accumulated even during the pendency of administrative or judicial removal proceedings though delay to acquire the requisite time could be taken into account to deny relief in the exercise of discretionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20681crs4 iirira however added statutory timestop provisio n that stops the continuous presence clock at the time removal proceedings are initiated or when the alien commits deportable offense regarding suspension of deportation comparable relief under cancellation of removal 240ab now requires that the alien be physically present in the us continuously for least 10 years immediately preceding the application for relief have been person of good moral character during that period not have been convicted of an offense within the grounds of inadmissibility or removal and establish that removing him or her would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the aliens citizen or lpr spouse parent or child thus current law generally applies the steeper presence and hardship requirements that previously applied to criminal aliens who sought relief while now making criminal aliens themselves generally ineligible for relief under any circumstances also the same time stop rules that now apply to former 212c relief also apply here and degree of hardship to the alien himself or herself as opposed to hardship to close relatives may be considered retroactivity of current provisions postiirira cases in general changes made in iirira including those on cancellation of removal apply in removal cases begun after the iirira effective date april 1 1997 nevertheless determining eligibility for cancellation of removal in these new cases with its presence and good behavior requirements neces sarily involves assessing past activities iirira appears to make clear that its standards are to be used in assess ing these past activities even though standards for immigration relief may have been significantly different when the activities occurred thus an lpr who entered the us in 1984 and pled guilty in 1990 to theft felony carrying twoyear sentence could arguably now be doubly ineligible for relief on timestop grounds and aggravated felony grounds regardless of whether the lpr would have been eligible for relief under 1990 standards judicial opinions that have addressed the merits of retroactive application have tended to disfavor attaching new immigration disqualifications to past criminal pleas growing number of us courts of appeals have held that the post1996 any aggravated felony disqualification cannot be applied to lprs who pled guilty to crimes that did not disqualify them from relief on aggravated felony grounds under the law as it existed at the time of the plea for example the us court of appeals for the second circuit held on september 1 2000 that post1996 relief standards cannot apply to such pre1996 pleas caselaw in the fourth circuit is to similar effect panels of the first ninth and seventh circuits have found retroactive application impermissible if it can be shown that criminal alien entered plea knowing that the plea entered would not preclude an application for immigration relief under then existing law httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20681crs5 retroactivity of current provisions timestop provisions as stated above iirira generally applies only in cases begun on or after april 1 1997 with limited authority being given to the attorney general to apply iirira standards on casebycase basis in cases pending on that date therefore aliens seeking discretionary relief in cases started prior to april 1997 seek 212c relief or suspen sion of deportation not cancellation of removal nevertheless iirira as clarified in the nicaraguan adjustment and central american relief act nacara title ii of pl 105100 contain s one significant deviation from this effective date rule the timestop rules under iirira apply to discretionary relief applications made in cases carried over from the preiirira period thus for example an alien who entered in 1989 and put in deportation proceedings in 1995 would be considered as having only six years of continuous presence for relief purposes selected proposals the following bills are among the proposals that would ease current eligibility standards hr 5062 representative mccollum this bill is sponsored by senior majority member of the house subcommitte on immigration claims and is cosponsored by several members of both parties who had introduced earlier proposals on their own on september 19 2000 the house passed hr 5062 by voice vote hr 5062 would ease some but not all of the effects of the 1996 changes in discretionary relief for lprs whose criminal activity occurred before iirira became law for example time stop provisions that stop the continuous residence clock on the date crime was committed would not apply to lprs whose offenses occurred on or before september 30 1996 however the time stop provisions that stop the continuous residence clock when removal proceedings are instituted would continue to apply regarding the current disqualification of all lprs convicted of an aggravated felony hr 5062 would generally retain both the expanded definition of aggravated felony and the standard that disqualifies all aliens convicted of any aggravated felony nonetheless for those lprs whose criminal activities occurred before the 1996 changes only those crimes that were aggravated felonies under the ina on the date they were committed would be disqualifying note however that hr 5062 would continue to apply the current any aggravated felony disqualification to pre1996 conduct thus an lpr who pled guilty in 1995 to crime that was an aggravated felony when committed single firearms offenses for example in exchange for suspended sentence might continue to be ineligible to be considered for relief even though the ina at the time of the guilty plea only disqualified lprs who served at least 5 years for an aggravated felony in such circumstance the caselaw discussed above on pre1996 guilty pleas would be relevant hr 5062 would apply its eased standards retroactively it would allow all aliens who were made ineligible by the 1996 changes but who would be eligible under hr 5062 chance to have their cases reconsidered the relief proposed in hr 5062 is limited to lprs seeking cancellation of removal under provisions that are comparable to former 212c relief hr 5062 would not affect the 1996 changes to the former suspension of deportationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20681crs6 other bills on october 1 1999 representative bill mccollum introduced legislation to allow certain longterm permanent residents to apply for discretionary relief from removal despite the 1996 amendments to the definition of the term aggravated felony under this bill hr 2999 the fairness for permanent residents act of 1999 legal permanent residents with criminal records could apply for discretionary relief for which they otherwise would be eligible but for changes in the aggravated felony definition enacted in 1996 with limited exception comprehensive reform bill introduced by representative john conyers on july 26 2000 the restoration of fairness in immigration law act hr 4966 addresses criminal alien issues more extensively and in many instances its proposed changes would apply both to future and past conduct hr 4966 would broadly adopt sentencing thresholds for many aggravate d felonies that reflect pre1996 standards only aliens sentenced to 5 years would be cove red for most crimes instead of the current 1 year threshold also the attorney general would be given new authority to waive the aggravated felony consequences in cases of crimes for which an alien served less than 1 year in prison furthermore the bill would ease the current standards that tightly restrict the ability of immigration authorities to allow longte rm aliens who commit crimes to remain here based on their community ties family ties and other equities lprs who were affected by the 1996 restrictions on relief could have their cases reconsidered the criminal alien proposals of the keeping families together act hr 3272 introduced by representative bob filner on november 9 1999 are similar to if somewhat more narrowly focused than some of the provisions in hr 4966 among its provisions hr 3272 would adopt former ina standards to make it easier for certain criminal aliens especially legal permanent resident aliens lprs to have their community and family ties taken into account before they are deported on april 20 1999 representative barney frank introduced the family reunification act of 1999 hr 1485 which also would allow certain criminal aliens to apply for relief from removal even though they would be disqualified from doing so under the 1996 changes this legislation would not fully restore the pre1996 standards for relief but rather would impose standards that lie somewhere in between the pre and post1996 rules hr 1485 also would revise rules for relief being sought in cases started before the general effective date of the 1996 reforms finally the bill would create new type of hardship relief for immigrants who otherwise would be ineligible on aggravated felony grounds in the senate legislation introduced by senator moynihan s 173 addresses relief for longterm residents immigrants would only be disqualified from seeking relief because of an aggravated felony conviction if the crime was punishable by imprisonment of at least 5 years s 3120 the immigration fairness restoration act was introduced by senator kennedy on september 27 2000 in addition to its detention and review provisions s 3120 proposes to freeze the immigration consequences of criminal act to those that existed on the date the crime was committed the punishment thresholds for including certain crimes as aggravated felonies would be increased from 1 year to 5 years discretionary relief would be precluded only to those aliens who were sentenced to at least 5 years for an aggravated felony
