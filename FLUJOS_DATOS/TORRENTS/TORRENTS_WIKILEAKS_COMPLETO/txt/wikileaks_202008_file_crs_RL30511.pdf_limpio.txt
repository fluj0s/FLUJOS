fy2001 foreign operations plus 125 billion in fy2000 supplemental funds congress approved some of the supplemental spending in pl 106246 but in october 2000 reconsidere d and approved as fy2001

134 billion for fy2001 foreign operations appropriations the measure was about 65 million less than fy2000 enacted and about 17 billion or 11 below the presiden ts initial fy2001 request major new initiative in s 2522 was the creation of global health account 691 million population aid would have increased by 110 million and new set of conditions on family planning programs would have

continuedappropriations for fy2001 foreign operations export financing and related programs most recent developments for the most controversial fy2001 foreign operations issue international family planning congress increased spending to 425 million lawmakers however restrict ed the obligation of funds until after february 15 2001 on january 22 2001 two days after taking office president george w bush issued memorandum to the usaid administrator directing him to reinstate in full all of the requirements of the mexico city policy in effect on january 19 1993 separate statement from the presidents press secretary stated that president bush was committed to maintaining the 425 million funding level for population assistance because he knows that one of the best ways to prevent abortion is by providing quality voluntary family planning services on february 15 2001 usaid released specific policy and contract guidelines to implement the presidents directive these guidelines were reissued by the white house on march 28 in order to block an early congressional vote to overturn the mexico city restrictions previously on november 6 2000 president clinton signed into law 149 billion foreign operations appropriations for fy2001 pl 106429 hr 4811 the spending measure includes both regular fy2001 requested programs as well as selected fy2000 supplemental funding proposals that congress had rejected earlier in the year the enacted legislation falls about 550 million or 35 below the presidents combined fy2000 supplementalfy2001 requests but is substantially higher than the roughly 134 billion spending measures passed by the house and senate during the summer moreover pl 106429 fully funds several top administration priorities including 435 million for international debt relief under the heavily indebted poor country hipc initiat ive congress further boosted funding for several global health programs including 315 million for hivaids and 60 million for malaria control introduction the annual foreign operations appropriations bill is the primary legislative vehicle through which congress reviews and votes on the us foreign assistance budget and influences executive branch foreign policy making generally1 it containshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30511crs2 1 continued aid spending measure it does not include funding for all foreign assistance programs food aid administered under the pl 480 program and managed by usaid is appropriated in the agriculture appropriations bill furthermore the foreign operations measure includes funds for one activitythe exportimport bankthat is not regarded as foreign assistance but rather as us government activity promoting trade opportunities for american businesses in recent years funding for food aid and the eximbank have been about the same so that the foreign operations appropriation and the official foreign aid budget are nearly identical throughout this report references to foreign operations and foreign aid are used interchangeably 2 another international humanitarian aid program food assistance or pl 480 title ii grants is funded under the agriculture appropriations billthe largest share about twothirds of total international affairs spending by the united states see figure 1 the legislation funds all us bilateral development assistance programs managed mostly by the us agency for international development usaid together with several smaller independent foreign aid agencies such as the peace corps and the interamerican and african development foundations most humanitarian aid activities are funded within foreign operations including usaids disaster program and state departments refugee relief support2 foreign operations includes separate accounts for aid programs in the former soviet union also referred to as the indepe ndent states account and centraleastern europe activit ies that are jointly managed by usaid and the state department security assistance economic and military aid for israel and egypt is also part of the foreign operations spending measure as are smaller security aid programs administer ed largely by the state department in conjunction with usaid and the pentagon us contributions to the world bank and other regional multilateral development banks managed by the treasury department and voluntary payments to international organizations handled by the state department are also funded in the foreign operations bill finally the legislation includes appropriations for three export promotion agencies the overseas private investment corporation opic the exportimport bank and the trade and development agency from the perspective of congressional oversight and involvement in us foreign aid policy making the foreign operations bill has taken on even greater significance during the past 15 years congress has not enacted foreign aid authorization bill since 1985 leaving most foreign assistance programs without regular authorizations emanating from the legislative oversight committees as result foreign operations spending measures developed by the appropriations committ ees increasingly have expande d their scope beyond spending issues and played major role in shaping authori zing and guiding both executive and congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives it has been largely through foreign operations appropriations that the united states has modified aid policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the cold war the legislation has also been key tool used by congress to apply restrictions and conditions on administration management of foreign assistance actions that have frequently resulted in executivelegislative clashes over presidential prerogatives in foreign policy makinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30511crs3 figure 1 international affairs budget fy2001 status table 1 status of foreign operations appropriations fy2001 subcommittee markuphouse reporthouse

november 6 2000 pl 1064293 foreign operations funding trends as the united states has adjusted its foreign and defense policy to postcold war environment one of the major foreign assistan ce challenges for congress and executive branch policymakers has been to formulate the most effective foreign aid program amidst tightening resource base dominant characteristic of foreign operations funding trends in the most recent years has been the degree to which foreign policy contingencies and international disasters have created demands for additional resources beyond those originally requested by the president congress approved substantial amounts for fy1999 and fy20 00 through emergency or supplemental appropriation mechanisms amounts that are over and above what is enacted in regular foreign operations bills after peaking at 207 billion in fy1985 foreign operations appropriations began period of decline falling to about 123 billion in fy1997 foreign aid spending cuts were especially sharp in fy1996 when congress cut funding by 115 billion nearly 9 from the previous year many government and nongovernment experts argued that these budget reductions seriously undermined us foreign policy interests and limited the ability of american officials to influence overseas events after foreign operations funding levels fell again in fy1997 although by much smaller amounts the state department and other executive agencies launched an aggressive campaign to reverse the decad elong decline in the foreign policy budget this effort coincided with congressional approval of near 1 billion increase for fy1998 setting foreign operations appropriations at 1315 billion foreign operations funds rose again to 154 billion in fy1999 when lawmakers at the urging of the white house added nearly 900 million in the final days of the 105th congress and another 21 billion for central american hurricane relief and kosovo emergency assistance in supplemental funding amounts enacted for fy2000 165 billion were also augmented by lateyear emergency addons recom mended by the president including 18 billion for the wye rivermiddle east peace accord and 11 billion supplemental assistance mostly for new counternarcotics initiative in colombia as shown in table 2 the amount for fy2000 is the highest in six years and the largest funding level in nominal terms for foreign operations since fy1985 nevertheless when calculated using constanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30511crs5 dollars taking into account the effects of inflation fy2000 foreign operations amounts are 47 less than the high point of fy1985 15 less than the annual average appropriation during the late 1980s and 3 less than fy1992 year that might be considered the first postcold war foreign aid budget fy2000 foreign operations spending level represents 091 of the entire federal budget and 28 of total discretionary budget authority by comparison these same figures in fy1985 were 2 and 46 respectively table

appropriations bill includes one mandatory program that is not included in figures and tables usaids foreign service retiremen t fund the retirement fund is scheduled to receive 446 million for fy1999 in addition funding levels and trends discussed in this report exclude us contributions to the international monetary fund imf proposals that are enacted periodically about every five years in foreign operations bills congress approved 179 billion for the imf in fy1999 the first appropriation since fy1993 including these large infrequent and uniquely scored imf appropriations tends to distort general analysis of foreign operations funding trends although congress provides new budget authority through appropriations for the full amount of us participation the transaction is considered an exchange of assets between the united states and the imf and results in outlays from the us treasury in short the appropriations are offset by the creat ion of us counterpart claim on the imf that is liquid and interest bearing for more see crs report 96 279 us budgetary treatment of the imf foreign operations the fy2000 budget resolution and section 302b allocations usually appropriation committees begin markups of their spending bills only after congress has adopted budget resolution and funds have been distributed to the appropriations panels under what is referred to as the section 302a allocation process reference to the pertinent authority in the congressional budget act following this house and senate appropriations committees separately decide howhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30511crs6 4 the fy2001 budget resolution assumed that congress would enact as it did funding for the entire plan colombia counternarcotics initiative as an fy2000 budget item including the 256 million proposed for fy2001 using this assumption the 20 billion for international affairs was 11 less than the presidents requestto allot the total amount available among their 13 subcommittees staying within the functional guidelines set in the budget resolution this second step is referred to as the section 302b allocation as noted above foreign policy funds are appropriated within four bills with foreign operations having the largest share of around 6770 in most years how much foreign policy money to allocate to each of the four subcommittees and how to distribute the funds among the numerous programs remain decisions exclusively reserved for the appropr iations committees nevertheless overall ceilings set in the budget resolution can have significant implications for the budget limitations within which the foreign operations subcom mittees will operate when they meet to mark up their annual appropriation bills the fy2001 budget resolution that cleared congress on april 13 hconres 290 strongly indicated that the foreign operations subcommittees would receive significantly reduced section 302b allocation from that assumed in the presidents budget hconres 290 sets 20 billion target for total international affairs discretionary budget authority figure about 12 below the request4 on may 4 house and senate appropriations committees released section 302b funding allocations for each of their 13 appropr iation bills in the house foreign operations programs received 1328 billion sharply below the presidents 151 billion request 148 billion if plan colombia funds were enacted as they were in fy2000 see footnote 3 the allocation was over 3 billion less than total amounts approved for fy2000 and 213 million below the base fy2000 appropriation after deducting the wye rivermiddle east peace money the senate panel approved slightly higher foreign operations level 1339 billion but this would still be insufficient to fund increases sought for fy2001 and at best would result in an overall total slightly below freeze as compared to the fy2000 base amount practices in the past few years suggest however that the initial 302b allocation for foreign operations as well as other spending bills would change significantly especial ly at the latter stages of the appropriations debate in 1999 for example house and senate foreign operations subcommittees received allocations of 126 billion and 127 billion respectively levels which established the ceiling for house and senate passed bills hr 2606 and s 1234 nevertheless following presidential veto of hr 2606 because of low funding levels and continued white house pressure to raise foreign aid spending during endofthe session negotiations congress agreed to 153 billion for foreign operations much of the additional funds were designated as emergency appropriations amounts that did not count against allocation limitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30511crs7 although the early 302b allocation for foreign operations resulted in house and senate bills of around 133 billion the administration pressed for additional funding throughout the process between june and october house and senate appropriations committees filed numerous revisio ns to the original 302b allocatio ns culminating on october 25 in new foreign operations level of 149 billion this subsequently allowed congress to approve on the following day 149 billion foreign operations appropriations for fy2001 foreign operations appropriations request for fy2001 and congressional consideration in february 2000 president clinton asked congress to appropriate 151 billion for fy2001 foreign operations there were two basic ways in which to compare the proposal with existing spending for fy2000 the first was to make straight comparison between enacted fy2000 foreign operations levels and the fy2001 request using these reference points the fy2001 budget recommendation was about 14 billion or 8 less than total fy2000 appropriations another means of comparison and one that was frequently used by congressional budget and appropriations committees was to compare funding for foreign aid programs continuing from year to year that would deduct appropriations provided under special circumstances such as emergency requirements onetime unique initiatives or supplemental funding for fy2000 congress approved under an emergency designation onetime 18 billion aid package for israel jordan and palestinians in support of the november 1998 wye rivermiddle east peace accord congress further enacted in pl 106246 an additional 11 billion in fy2000 foreign operations supplemental spending mostly for counternarcotics in colombia under this second comparison approach which adjusts the fy2000 appropriation level from 165 billion to 135 billion the fy2001 foreign operations request was 12 higher than fy2000 spending table 3 summary of foreign operations appropriations

every account was funded below the administrations request and several were reduced from fy2000 enacted amounts usaid operating expenses 510 million was 10 million below enacted and requested amounts at this level usaid would most likely face the choice of reducing plans for growth in either staff salaries and benefits overseas support costs or information technology enhancements former soviet union aid 775 million declined by about 65 million compared with enacted and proposed levels but because earmarks in s 2522 for ukrai ne 175 million georgia 94 million and armenia 89 million were slightly higher than amounts requested the overall account shortfall likely would have fallen most heavily on aid to russia proposed at 162 million interamerican foundation recei ved funding in s 2522 for fy2001 the legislation further authorized but did not require the president to abolish the foundation last year congress also authorized the president to terminate the interamerican foundation appropriating 5 million for the small grassroo ts development organization an amount believed to be sufficient to cover existing grants and contract obligations and to conclude any other outstanding operations of the foundation the president however did not exercise this authority and requested 20 million for fy2001 programs the senate appropriations committee believed that there would be enough funds carried forw ard into fy2001 that would cover foundation termination costs peace corps as proposed by the committee bill peace corps funds 220 million would have fallen below fy2000 enacted 245

peacekeeping operations funds 85 million were well below fy2000 153 million and fy2001 proposed 134 million amounts the senate appropriations committee assumed funding for operations in haiti 4

development bank african development fund and other multilateral organizations in few areas s 2522 increased foreign operations spending over enacted amounts supporting in some cases administrat ion priorities the major senate committee initiative was the creation of global health account within development assistance spending this account which incorporated much although not all of the child survival and infectious disease fund represented comprehensive funding approach to protect global health attack poverty and shield americans from infectious diseases easily transmitted across borders the 691 million appropriated in s 2522 including senate floor amendment adding 40 million to the committee recommendation provided earmarks for hivaids 255 million malaria 65 million tuberculosis 51

approved 149 billion for foreign operations spending in fy20018 the total however includes not only amounts requested for this year but also several items proposed as fy2000 supplementals prior to reaching agreement house and senate conferees reconsidered some of the fy2000 supplementals that lawmakers rejected earlier in the year and included about 470 million as part of the 149 billion total after adjusting the combined presidents request to include both fy2000 supplementals and regular fy2001 proposals the 149 billion foreign operations appropriations falls about 500 million or 35 below the administrations request nevertheless pl 106429 represents substantial increase over the roughly 1335 billion funding bills passed previously by the house and senate moreover pl 106429 fully funds several top administration priorities including hipc debt relief contributions major items enacted in the fy2001 foreign operations bill include hipc debt relief is set at 435 million as requested in both fy2000 supplemental and fy2001 requests in addition hr 4811 authorizes the united states to support the full imf gold revaluation transaction which provides the fund with the necessary resources to cancel debt owed by hipc qualifying countries global health programs receive substantial funding increases under the enacted legislation with spending on hivaids activities climbing to 315 million malaria 50 million tuberculosis 45 million and gavi 50 million are also funded at or well above the requested amounts the child survival and disease program fund is funded at 963 million nearly double

the total falls about 200 million below the request the world bank ida receives 775 million the same as in fy2000 but 60 million less than proposed major policy and spending issues in the foreign operations debate in addition to funding decisions made by congress in the foreign operations appropriation bill the annual spending measure also includes wide range of policy provisions that frequently raise contentious foreign policy disagreements between the president and congress as mentioned above because congress has not enacted foreign aid authorization bills for over decade the foreign operations appropriations legislation often becomes the vehicle for debate on the conduct of us foreign policy more generally many of these policy provisions take the form of condition s or restrictions on how the president can use money included in the spending bill many of these provisions are opposed by the administration as excessively limiting its ability to manage american foreign policy the legislative executive policy differences have in the past delayed the enactment of the foreign operations bill or have prompted presidential veto httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30511crs16 among the most significant funding and policy issues raised during congressional debate in 2000 on the foreign operations appropriation measure were conflicting executivelegislative branch development assistance strategy priorities and new administrat ion initiatives restrictions on international family planning programs regional and country aid allocations and efforts by the administration to secure funding to reduce debt burdens of the poorest developing countries development aid policy priorities since the end of the cold war recurring debate has focused on what should replace the anticommunist foreign aid rationale of the past 50 years more fundamental question raised by some especially critics of development assistance is whether the united states needs to maintain an active globally focused economic aid program many of these critics argue that aid can be transformed into smaller more targeted and often privatized instrument to support only the highest priority us foreign policy interests although there has been definitive consensus on priorities the clinton administration has strongly supported the retention of an activist foreign aid policy which can be used to bolster variety of us foreign policy initiati ves around the world in early 1994 usaid released its blueprint for postcold war development aid policy based around the goal of sustainable development and its four strategies of promoting economic growth stabilizing global popu lation protecting the environment and advancing democracy more recently usaid added fifth strategy aimed at developing human capacity through education since adopting these strategies in 1994 usaid has maintained that they operate as interlinked mutually reinforcing elements of an overall us effort to promote the advancement of market economies and democratic transitions in developing nations officials argue that us aid is justified until countries reach point of sustainability that longer requires external aid funding reductions congressional restrictions and fluctuating administration priorities however have required usaid to alter the mix of resources devoted to each of the strategies raising questions over whether the integrative mutually reinforcing rationale can be maintained congress for example limited development aid for population programs in fy1996fy2000 to roughly two thirds of the amount provided in fy1995 see below for more discussion on family planning restrictions further the state departments bureau of global affairs has in the past placed high priority on environment programs and pressed usaid to allocate the maximum amount possible to such activities as result the environment sector of sustainable development has not declined as much as it might have

efforts against hivaids and other infectious diseases despite cutting overall development aid in fy1996fy1997 by about 23 from fy1995 levels congress earmarked children and disease programs at amounts equal to or somewhat greater than those allocated in fy1995 making the cuts on all other elements of sustainable development closer to 30 congress reduced the presidents fy2000 development aid request by 80 million overall but lawmakers set funding targets for child survival and infectious disease activities 18 million higher than propose d as result usaid cut funding for economic growth programs by 49httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30511crs18 9 selected elements of economic growth programs that have broad congressional support such as microenterprise and agriculture activities were unaffected by reductions elsewhere in this sector 10 usaids child survival budget however when combined with appropriations for unicef and planned 50 million us contribution to the global alliance for vaccines and immunization gavi initiative that is funded under the multilateral assistance title would boost overall us funding for child health and survival efforts by about 10 11 the reduction in agriculture funding was largely due to shift in program emphasis in egypt where less esf funding in agriculture is projected congress recommended 305 million target for agriculture resources across all accounts the past two yearsmillion environment projects by 37 million and democracy promotion activities by 18 million below what the agency had planned for fy20009 congressional proponents of the child survival priority argue that even though budget pressures require the united states to reduce or hold the line on foreign aid spending the protection of children remains core american value demanding that cuts should be implemented without putting at risk the lives and wellbeing of small children in developing nations they further point out that the spread of infectious diseases poses direct threat to us citizens and that american national interests require continued support for global efforts to reduce or eliminate such illnesses although agreeing with the importance of child survival and infectious disease programs usaid officials apply broader definition to the terms arguing for example that efforts to protect small children go well beyond immunizations and access to other health services the quality of childs life they assert also is determined by an array of other factors including the degree of relative stability in society protection of the surrounding environment access to adequate shelter and implementation of sound economic policie s that will ensure jobs and economic opportunities in the future consequently they contend that the squeeze that these targets place on other areas of sustainable development partiall undermines the success of other programs that benefit children fy2001 request as has been the pattern the past few years usaids economic assistance request for the agencys five main objectives in fy2001 reduced or maintained at fy2000 levels funding for several congressional priorities while increasing aid overall by 377 million or 7 after excluding from fy2000 the one time wye rivermiddle east peace package the 59 billion request would have cut funds for child survival programs by 25 million and infectious diseases other than hivaids by 7 million from fy2000 appropriations10 the proposed budget further held spending steady for microenterprise and reduced amounts for agriculture and food security programs by 18 million11 both of these latter activities are targets of special congressional interest usaid requested significant increases for several other sustainable activities plus funding to launch few new initiatives programs

pl 106264 was enacted into law authorizing 300 million for hivaids programs12 population assistance represented the largest single funding increase for fy2001 rising by 169 million or 45 from fy2000 amounts last year the white house reluctantly accepted new congressional restrictions on abortion and eligibility of foreign family planning organizations implementing usaid population programs the administration wanted to restore family planning assistance funding to levels enacted for fy1995 the year before congress and the president began to engage in contentious debates over abortion and international family planning see next section for further discussion on this issue environmental funding would have grown significantly in two environmental sectors under the administrations request for biodiversity and for new clean energy initiative last year congress directed usaid to restore biodiversity funding to the same proportion of development assistance funds it received in fy1995 while usaid met the roughly 100 million congressional target for fy2000 under the proportional requirement the administration sought 26 million or 27 increase for fy2001 usaid also planned to launch new 30 million clean energy initiative congressional action the senate approved bill s 2522 set usaid economic assistance combining all accounts supporting the agencys development goals at 58 billion about 100 million below the request for sustainable development assistance specifically the senate measure set the budget roughly mid way between fy2000 enacted and fy2001 requested levels the 217 billion sustainable development appropriation an amount that for comparative purposes includes unicef contributions was nearly 230 million or 12 higher than fy2000 spending the centerpiece of the senate proposal was the creation of new 691 million account for global health the global health account replaced the child survival and infectious disease lineitem in the fy2000 measure incorporatinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30511crs20 13 basic education for example was not included in the global health account but was funded at 100 million 98 million enacted and requested within

9 and in the administrations request committee earmarks and report recommendations allocated resources for several priorit ies including hivaids tuberculosis malaria polio and maternal health for other nonhealth development activities s 2522 directed that usaid allocate at least 310 million across all accounts for agriculture programs 11 million higher than fy2000 amounts population assistance also would have increased under s 2522 although not to the level proposed by the administration see table 5 below for specific amounts and comparisons with house administration and enacted levels although earmarks and directives in s 2522 protected and increased resources for senate priorities especially in the health area the overall funding level for usaid sustainable development programs would have resulted in cuts for other non earmarked activities such as those for private markets and democracy promotion usaid calculated that development programs not earmarked in s 2522 would fall

25 million less than the senate the house measure maintained the child survivaldisease account at 886 million an increase of 159 million over amounts enacted in fy2000 and like the senate measure included number of earmarks and directives increasing number of priorities especially in health and children programs see table 5 for specific amounts and comparisons with senate administration and enacted levels although the house continued its practice of recent years of providing higher funding for children activities and cutting requests for other development objectives the committees report acknowledged the need for broader social and economic development the committee encouraged usaid to increase spending on economic growth and private sector programs aimed at increasing the number of jobs educating the population and providing better health care in developing nations the house panel further encouraged increased funding for agriculture activities and microenterprise program of 152 million nevertheless with the number of earmarks and priorities in the children and health sectors endorsed by the house panel usaid would most likely need to make substantial reductions in variety of nonhealth program areas enacted legislation increases usaid funding above levels approved earlier by the house and senate and protects and in some cases adds to amounts for activity of special congressional interest overall usaid administered programs in support of its five key goals are set at 5835 billion about 60 million or 1 less than requested but 200 million and 35 million higher than passed by the house and senate respectively sustainable development funds total 2268 billion also more than 100 million higher than approved earlier by the house and senate nevertheless congressional directives and earmarks allocating usaid funding will alter in some cases significantly how the agency distributes appropriated resources among the five core goals child survival health including hivaids and basic education will receive substant ially higher amounts than requested because of overall reductions protection for priority activities and some spending limitations funding for private sector environment family planning and democracy programs will fall below proposed levels and possibly under fy2000 amou nts usaid decisions on how to allocate fy2001 appropriations are underway but will not likely finalize until early next year table 5 however provides tentative estimate of how some of the key usaid programs will be funded especially those for which congress has included specific earmarks in pl 106429 population and family planning assistance another aspect of the discussion regarding policy priorities of us development aid is the continuing controversy regarding international family planning restrictions for fy2001 the president sought 5416 million for usaid population programs 169 million or 45 increase over fy2000 levels the white house further proposed 25 million us contribution to the population fund unfpa the same as appropriated for fy2000 us international family planning programs had been one of the largest growth areas of the foreign aid budget in the early 1990shttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30511crs22 from an average of about 250 million in the late 1980s fy1995 spending across all foreign operations accounts totaled approximately 541 million in the following years when congress deadlocked over aborti onrelated restrictions and us population aid policy situation that blocked movement of the entire foreign operations bill lawmakers adopte d interim provisions that among other things strictly limited the amount of funding for usaid family planning programs the appropriation cap of 385 million enacted in each of fy1997fy2000 is roughly two thirds the amount provided in fy1995 the principal dispute over population assistance however goes well beyond funding issues center ing more directly on abortionrelated activities of foreign recipients of usaid grants for over 15 years congress has engaged in contentious debates over us international family planning policy often as part of the foreign operations appropriations family planning and abortion restrictions the debate over international family planning policy and abortion began nearly three decades ago when congress added provision to the foreign assistance act of 1961 prohibiting the use of us appropriated funds for abortionrelated activities and coercive family planning programs during the mid1980s in what has become known as the mexico city policy because it was first announced at the 1984 mexico city population conference the reagan and later the bush administrations restricted funds for foreign nongovernmental organizations ngos that were involved in performing or promoting abortions in countries where they worked even if such activities were undertaken with nonus funds several groups including international planned parenthood federationlondon ippflondon became ineligible for us financial support in some years congress narrowly approved measures to overturn this prohibitio n but white house vetoes kept the policy in place president clinton in 1993 reversed the position of his two predecessors allowing the united states to resume funding for all family planning organizations so long as us money was used by those involved in abortionrelated work during the past five years the house and senate have taken opposing positions on the mexico city issue that in each case held up enactment of the final foreign operations spending measure the house position sponsored by representative smith nj and others supported reinstatement of the mexico city policy restricting us aid funds to foreign organizations involved in performing abortions or in lobbying to change abortion laws or policies in foreign countries the senate on the other hand has rejected in most cases house provisions dealing with mexico city policy favoring positio n that leaves these decisions in the hands of the administration moreover administration officials routinely said that president clinton would veto any bills that included the housepassed mexico city restrictions threat he carried out in october 1998 when he rejected legislation authorizing family planning programs that included mexico city policy hr 1757 unab to reach an agreement satisfactory to both sides congress adopted interim arrangements for fy1996fy1999 that did not resolve the broad population program controversy but permitted the stalled foreign operations measure to move forward the annual compromise removed houseadded mexico city restrictionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30511crs23 but reduced population assistance to 385 million and in several years metered the availability of the funds at rate of onetwelfth of the 385 million per month the fy2000 debate however concluded far differently than the previous four years as congress and the white house searched in november 1999 for final fy2000 budget agreement international family planning and population aid issues became one of the last and most contentious aspects of the negotiations congressional leaders insisted that if the president wanted congress to approve legislation authorizing the payment of nearly 1 billion of us arrears owed to the united nations the white house must also accept revised mexico city language adding abortion restrictions to us population assistance policy in order to remove the obstacles to arrears payments reluctant president clinton agreed to the abortion restrictions marking the first time that mexico city conditions had been included in legislation signed by the president enacted in the foreign operations act for fy2000 hr 3422 incorporated into hr 3194 the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 pl 106113 under the terms of section 599d of hr 3422 private foreign non governmental and multilateral organizations must certify that they neither perform abortions nor lobby to change abortion laws in foreign countries in order to receive usaid population aid grants in fy2000 section 599d allows the president to waive the certification requirement for up to 15 million in grants to groups that would otherwise be inelig ible but with the penalty that 125 million of the 385 million population aid appropriation would be transferred to child health programs the restrictions apply only to fy2000 and expired on september 30 2000 one day after signing the legislation the president exercised his waiver authority november 30 1999 thereby reducing fy2000 population aid funds to 3725 million he further instructed usaid to implement section 599d in way that will minimize the impact on us funded family planning programs under agency guidelines all nonus ngos whether nonprofit or forprofit and multilateral organizations that are prime ctors grantees and cooperative agreement recipients must certify and collect the same certification from their subcontractors that they will not engage in three types of activities with either usaid or nonusaid funds from the date they sign an agreement to receive fy2000 usaid population funds through september 30 2001 perform abortions in foreign country except where the life of the mother would be endangered or in cases of forcible rape or incest violate the laws of foreign countr concerning the circumstances under which abortion is permitted regulated or restricted or attempt to alter the laws or governmental policies concerning circumstances under which abortion is permi tted regulated or restricted if an organization declines to certify or does not return the certification form it will be ineligible to receive fy2000 usaid population fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30511crs24 except for the loss of 125 million in funding it appears that on programmatic basis the certification requirement has not had significant impact on usaid family planning programs key issue has been whether the 15 million in total grants allowed under the waiver authority was sufficient to cover all foreign organizations that declined to certify regarding their involvement in abortionrelated activities although there is still some uncertainty about how many groups have not responded because they disagree with the certification terms ippflondon and the world health organization have refused at some point usaid will review the cases of all foreign organizat ions that have not responded or declined to certify nine currently and decide how to allocate the 15 million availab to such groups agency officials believe that they will not exceed the 15 million cap critics of the certification requirement oppose it on several grounds from an administrative standpoint they say it will increase usaid costs to manage family planning programs because of the additional paperwork and will delay implementation of projects usaid has

the restrictions and do not want to risk losing eligibility for usaid funding opponents also believe the new conditions will undermine relations between the us government and foreign ngos and multilateral groups creating situation where the united states challenges their sovereignty on how to spend their own money and imposes socalled gag order on their ability to promo changes to abortion laws and regulations in developing nations the latter these critics note would be unconstitutional if applied to american groups working in the united states supporters of the certification requirement argue that even though permanent law bans usaid funds from being used to perform or promote abortions money is fungible that organizations receiving americantaxpayer funding can simply use usaid resources for permitted activities while diverting money raised from other sources to perform abortions or lobby to change abortion laws and regulations the certification process they contend

where the united states had programs prior to 1990 grew to represent over 16 of american bilateral assistance funded in the foreign operations bill by the end of the decade number of observers including some members and congressional committees believed these shifts in regional aid allocations had swung too far this was particularly true in the cases of asia and latin america given the asian financial crises and significant us interests in promoting economic development in latin america in order to counter the trend of rising illegal immigration to the united states foreign operations appropriation measures in recent years have emphasized the need to maintain or increase assistance especially to latin america and more recently to the philippines thailand and indonesia

the administration launched joint initiative to create special legislative authority for us economic aid to africa the development fund for africa dfa authorized in chapter 10 of the foreign assistance act of 1961 was intended to extend more flexibility to usaid program managers and to protect aid resources for africa from being transferred to other regions as new foreign policy crises unfolded at its peak the united states channeled about 800 million annually through the dfa although the dfa authorization law remained in force congress ended the practice of direct dfa appropriation

higher levels provided in previou s years the administration proposed direct dfa appropriation account for fy2000 congress rejected the dfa recommendation but approved sufficient development funds so that africas level grew from 703 million in fy1999 to 737 million estimated for fy2000 the fy2001 request once again sought the restoration of the dfa account that when combined with child survival funds would allocate 836 million to afric an increase of 99 million although some of the additional assistance would support the hivaids initiative family planning and other health activities would

egypts request to receive part of its military assistance early in the fiscal year rather than over much longer period of time as payments become due for defense purchases for number of years congress has directed that economic and military aid for israel be disbursed within the first month of new fiscal year allowing israel to invest the funds and earn interest prior to using the money to service debt owed to the united states and make payments on military procurements last year the administration asked congress to allow egypt to receive 475 million in early disbursements an action that would have increased foreign operations outlays by an equivalent amount with extremely tight limits on outlays for fy2000 the appropriation committees could not accommodate the request instead however congress added 25 million for egypt under the wye river aid package an amount roughly equal to the interest egypt would have gained from an early disbursement for fy2001 the administration proposed somewhat different mechanism to achieve the same purpose that egypt receive by october 31 2000 or within 30 days of enactment of the appropriation whichever is later the amount of military aid that omb estimates will be disbursed to egypt throughout fy2001 egypt would place the funds in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve and earn about 25 to 30 million during the course of the

international financial institutions emerged as one of the key foreign aid issues in 1999 and continued as white house priority in 2000 at the cologne summit in june 1999 g7 leaders endorsed substantial expansion of the heavily indebted poor country hipc initiative largely along the lines of policy changes recommended by the united states and britain the world bank and imf institutions that manage hipc debt relief adopted these enhancements in september in late 1999 congress approved some of the legislation requested by the administration for full us participation in hipc but left several matters incomplete primarily those associated with the cancellation of multilateralhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30511crs36 debts in 2000 the white house sought congressional approval for authorizing and appropriating issues left over from 1999 for the past decade the united states has engaged in various forms of debt relief for developing nations resulting in the cancellation of about 147 billion of foreign debt much of it 101 billion resulted from special cases involving key us national interests for egypt in 1990 7 billion for poland in 1991 25 billion and for jordan in 1995 635 million us debt reduction policy for other nations based strictly on need has been guided by the principle that eligible countries must have demonstrated strong and sustained commitment to economic policy reforms prior to receiving debt relief under budget rules instituted in 1992 congress has had to appropriate funds in advance representing the costs of canceling debt the cost determination methodology is based on complicated formula that takes into account among other things the loans net present value its interest rate and the likelihood the loan will be repaid for especially poor countries with particularly large debt overhangs the appropriation requirement may be quite small relative to the loans face value perhaps 10 or less when it was introduced in 1996 hipc was hailed as the first arrangement that included relief from debts owed to the world bank the imf and other international institutions organizations that hold over 25 of debt owed by the most heavily indebted nations previously multilateral organizations had declined to participate in debt cancellation arguing that it would increase their costs of raising new money to lend expenses that would have to be passed on to borrowers fortyone countries mostly in africa are eligible for hipc although only those determined to have unsustainable debt would qualify for hipc terms the initial hipc framework came under heavy criticism in early 1999 especially among nongovernmental organizations and religious groups working in developing countries they charged that hipc terms were not deep enough that 90 or 100 of bilateral debt owed should be canceled and that six years was far too long qualification period for full hipc relief they further believed that the non sustainable debt criteria based largely on ratio of countrys debttoexports was too high and therefore excluded many countries that were also in need of debt relief some critics opposed the economic reform requirements and argued for unconditional debt reduction number of organizations further advocated instituting mechanisms that would ensure that savings realized by debtor governments would be channeled into spending on basic services such as health and education that would improve the quality of life of the very poor many of these arguments were reflected in legislative initiatives launched in 1999 including hr 1095 debt relief poverty reduction act of 1999 hr 772 hope for africa act hr 2232 debt relief and development in africa act of 1999 and s 1690 debt relief for poor countri act of 1999 complicating the expansion of hipc and enactment of these bills however was the large additional costs that would be associated with efforts to broaden deepen and accelerate hipc or us bilateral debt reduction policies following agreement to expand hipc and insert strong poverty reduction requirement president clinton amended in september 1999 his pending fy2000 foreign aid request increasing debt relief from 120 million to nearly 1 billion over four years congress agreed to 123 million for bilateral debt cancellation at the parishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30511crs37 26 the hipc initiative has two major components cancellation of bilateral debt owed to the united states and other creditor governments and reduction of debt owed to the world bank the imf and other regional ifis creditor governments cover their own expenses individually for the forgiveness of bilateral debt at the paris club an informal arena for negotiating debt reschedulings and reduction of publicly held loans to finance the cancellation of multilateral debts the world bank and imf created the hipc trust fund into which ifis and aid donor governments would deposit contributions the bank and the fund will cover their own costs but other ifis especially the african development bank do not have enough resources to cover the losses of cancelled loan repayments donor governments have agreed to make up the gap for those ifis with insufficient funds 27 the actual process by which the gold was revalued involved several steps first the gold which is carried on the imf books at the original price of 48 per ounce was purchased at current market value over 270 per ounce by member country about to make large payment on an imf loan after buying the gold the country immediately made its loan payment to the imf but in gold that it just purchased rather than hard currency the imf invests the profits of its gold transaction in security instrument and uses the earned interest to pay for the costs of canceling hipc debt over 20year period club in 2000 but rejected the 600 million proposed for hipc trust fund contributions fy2000fy2003 hr 3422 as incorporated into pl 10611326 the president had also asked congress to allow the united states to support an imf plan to draw on resources in contingency fund and to revalue some of its gold holdings at current prices through an offmarket gold sale that would allow the imf to cancel hipc debts owed to the fund27 congress authorized the use of the contingency fund but placed restriction that the imf could only use 914ths of the gold transaction profits for hipc debt relief hr 3425 as incorporated into pl 106113 legislative issues in 2000 the administration asked congress to approve items carried over from 1999 hipc trust fund 210 million contribution as an fy2000 supplemental appropriation hipc bilateral and multilateral debt relief request of 225 million for fy2001 tropical forestry debt relief initiative of 37 million hipc bilateral and multilateral debt relief advance appropriation fy20022003 of 375 million authorization for the us to participate in the hipc trust fund and authorization permitting the us to support the full use of the imf for gold transaction profits for debt relief administration officials were especially concerned about appropriations for the hipc trust fund contribution they argue that the absence of us payment had convinced other creditor governments to hold back their own pledges until the us acted they further contended that while most of the existing trust fund pledges were earmarked for african nations that would be among the earliest qualifiers resources for latin american debt relief for bolivia and honduras were not available without us contribution they said debt workout for bolivia had been delayed because of inadequate resources critics of multilateral debt relief includinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30511crs38 some in congress argued however that before the us contributes to the trust fund multilateral institutions should agree to suspend new lending to hipc countries for period of time once they received debt relief so that they would not return to severely indebted state congressional action prior to consideration of the fy2001 foreign operations spending measure lawmakers dealt with other aspects of the hipc requests in the fy2000 supplemental appropriation hr 4425 congress rejected the presidents request for the hipc trust fund supporting other administration requests however the senate foreign relations committee reported on april 7 legislation s 2382 authorizing us participation in the hipc trust fund and us approval of the entire imf offmarket gold sale mechanism that bill after referral to the senate banking committee did not receive full senate consideration s 2522 provided 75 million in debt reduction for fy2001 far below the combined fy20002001 requests for 472 million the legislation permitted the administration to use the resources for either bilateral debt relief or contributions to the hipc trust fund because several hipc countries were nearing consideration for hipc eligibility it was possible that reduced funding in s 2522 if enacted at that level would have resulted in further delays for debt workout negotiations hr 4811 provided 238 million for debt reduction the house appropriations committee bill had provided 824 million for debt reduction well under the administrations request during floor debate however the house adopted an amendment waters 216211 that increased the debt relief allocation by 1556 million as reported by the committee however hr 4811 required that before any us contribution to the hipc trust fund the administration must report to congress that the hipc beneficiary country would not receive any new marketrate loans from international financial institutions for 30 months or concessional loans for 9 months the administration opposed these limitations the house committee expressed support for economic reforms undertaken by bolivia and mozambique and its expectation that all of the debt reduction funds for hipc would go to these two countries the house measure further indicated that 13 million of the debt reduction appropriation was reserved for the tropical forestry debt initiative the enacted bill provides total of 448 million for debt reduction consisting of 435 million for hipc the combined fy2000 supplemental and fy2001 regular request and 13 million for the tropical forestry initiative of the hipc funds roughly 75 million will be used for bilateral debt relief and 360 million as trust fund contribution countries which will receive benefits from us contributions must first agree not to borrow at market rate terms for two years the limitation on concessional financing as passed by the house was dropped from the conference agreement instead conferees endorsed consideration of policy in which the world banks internationa l development association would expand grant assistance to hipc countries the legislation further includes new reporting requirements regarding implementation of the hipc initiative that will allow congress to monitor actions taken in the coming year more closely pl 106429 does not however approve the full us pledged commitment to the hipc initiative the administration is asking congress in the fy2002
