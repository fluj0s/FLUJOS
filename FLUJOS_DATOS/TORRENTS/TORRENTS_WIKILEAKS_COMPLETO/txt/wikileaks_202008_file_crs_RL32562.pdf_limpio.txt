summary the united states border patrol usbp has long and storied history as our nations first line of defense against uthorized migration today the usbps primary mission is to detect and prevent the entry of terrorists weapons of mass destruction and illegal aliens into the country and to interdict drug smugglers and other criminals along the border the ho meland security act of 2002 dissolved the immigration and naturalizati on service and placed the usbp within the department of homeland security dhs within dhs the usbp forms part of the bureau of customs and border protection under the di rectorate of border and transportation security during the last decade the usbp has seen its budget and manpower more than triple this expansion was the direct re sult of congressional c oncerns about illegal immigration and the agencys adoption of prevention through deterrence as its chief operational strategy in 1994 the st rategy called for placing usbp resources and manpower directly at the areas of gr eatest illegal immigration in order to detect deter and apprehend aliens attempting to cross the border between official points of entry post 911 the usbp refocused its st rategy on preventing the entry of terrorists and weapons of mass destruc tion as laid out in its recently released national strategy in addition to workfor ce of over 17000 agents the usbp deploys vehicles aircraft watercra ft and many different tec hnologies to defend the border in the course of discharging its duties the usbp patrols 8000 miles of american international borders with mexico and canada and the coastal waters around florida and puerto rico however there are significant geographic political and immigrationrelated differences between the northern border with canada and the southwest border with mexico accord ingly the usbp deploys different mix of personnel and resources along the two bor ders due to the fact that over 97 of unauthorized migrant apprehensions occu r along the southwest border the usbp deploys over 90 of its agents there to deter illegal immigration the border safety initiative and the arizona border control initiative are both focused on the southwest border the northern border is more than two times longer than the southwest border features far lower numbers of aliens attempting to enter illegally but may be more vulnerable to terrorist infiltration as consequence of this the usbp has focused its northern border efforts on deploying technology and cooperating closely with canadian authorities through the creation of international border enforcement teams some issues for congress to consider could include the slow rate of integration between the usbps biometric database of illegal aliens and the federal bureau of investigations fbi biometric database of criminals and terrorists the number of unauthorized aliens who die attempting to enter the country each year the increasing attacks on border patrol agents and the threat posed by terrorists along the sparsely defended northern border as well as the more porous southwest border this report will be updated as circumstances warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32562contents

aborder security the role of the us border patrol background founded in 1924 by an appropriations act of congress act of may 28 1924 43 stat 240 the united states border patrol usbp has long and storied history as our nations front line in the struggle to secure our borders the usbps mission has historically been to prevent unauthorized aliens from entering into the country as such until recently the usbp formed pa rt of the immigrati on and naturalization service ins the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 merged most interior and border enforcemen t functions of the departme nt of agriculture the ins and the us customs service to form the directorate of border and transportation security bts within the department of homeland security dhs using the authority given by congress in the homeland security act the administration sub divided bts and placed the border enforcement functions including the usbp within the bureau of customs and border protection cbp this consolidated all the agencies charged with border enforcement duties with the overarching goal of enhancing security by allowing for the freer sharing of information and resources between all the organizations with presence on the border1 although cbp is charged with overall border enforcement within the bureau distinction is made cerning border enforcement at and between points of entry as currently comprised the usbps primary mission is to detect and prevent the entry of terrorists weapons of mass dest ruction and unauthorized aliens into the country and to interdict drug smugglers and other criminals between official points of entry usbp agents have official role at points of entry instead cbp inspectors stationed there are responsible for conducting immigrations customs and agricultural inspections on entering aliens the usbps statutory authority for border enforcement powers derives from section 287 of the i mmigration and nati onality act ina2 the ina gives immigration officers as designated by federal regulations the statutory authority to search interrogate and arrest unauthorized aliens and l others who are violating immigration laws the ina also bequeaths immigration officers broader statutory authority to make arrests for any felony cognizable under the laws of the united states federal regulations then designate usbp agents as immigration officershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32562crs2 3 8 cfr 2875 4 the usbp does not patrol the border between alaska and canada for the purposes of this report the northern border is the border betwee n the

powers3 this means that the usbp is not statutorily defined agency instead its role is delineated through federal regulations in the course of discharging its du ties the usbp patr ols 8000 miles of our international borders with mexico and canada and the coastal waters around florida and puerto rico the united states nor thern and southwestern borders differ radically in geography climate and length the northern border with canada touches 12 states and is over 4000 miles long4 among its many challenging natural features are vast mountain ranges such as the rockies the great lakes many different river systems and in the winter heavy snow and bitter cold temperatures conversely the southwestern border with xico touches only four states and is less than half as long featuring large tracts of desert land where temperatures average well over 100 degrees for much of the ear mountain ranges and the rio grande along the texas border patterns of illegal immigration differ widely between the northern and southwest borders the s outhwestern border accounts for over 97 of all illegal alien apprehensions and thereby commands the lions share of usbp resources and manpower not surprisingly the usbps main emphasis along the southwestern border is containing uthorized immigration the northern border conversely poses severe logistical challenge given its length geographic complexity and comparative lack of manpow er along the northern border the main concerns are the borders vulnerability to terrorist infiltration and the proliferation of crossborder smuggling organization and composition as an executive branch agency most usbp initiatives are initially administrative measures however the us congress has st rongly supported many of them through the appropriations process evolution of the national strategic plan in 1993 study commissioned by the offi ce of national drug control policy concluded that the southwest border was b eing overrun noting as an example that 6000 illegal immigrants atte mpted to enter the united states every night along 75 mile stretch of the san diego border the study also concluded that drug smuggling was serious threat all along the southw est border and recommended that the then ins change its focus from arresting illegal immigrants to preventing their entry5 partly in response to public and congressional concerns about the number of illegal immigrants and drugs entering the country in 1994 the usbp began implementing its first national strategic plan nsp httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32562crs3 6 us customs

2003 developed as an effort to gain and main tain control of the borders the original nsp was multiphased approach to deploying and focusing usbp resources on the areas of greatest illegal entry of people nd goods the nsp called for calibrated balance of personnel aircraft equipment t echnology and tactical infrastructure the focus of the nsp was an operational st rategy known as prevention through deterrence the strategys goal was to place usbp agents and resources directly on the border in order to deter the entry of illegal aliens rather than attempting to arrest aliens after they have already ente red the country this had largely been the strategy prior according to cbp achieving optimum deterrence would mean that increasing the number of agents and resour ces in sector would not result in an increase in the number of unauthorized migrants apprehended in that sector6 the prevention through deterrence policy was embraced by congress with both the house and senate appropria tions committees in 1996 directing the ins to hire new agents reallocate usbp agents stationed in the interior to front line duty and staff the interior offices with investigative staff instead7 phase i of the nsp involved the hold th line program in paso texas and operation gatekeeper in san diego california in addition to placing more agents on the line these operations utilized landing mat fencing8 stadium lighting and cameras and sensors to deter and detect unauthorized alie ns phase ii of the program included the expansion of operation safe guard 1999 in tucson arizona operation rio grande 1997 in the mc allen and laredo sectors of texas and an increased emphasis on securing the northern border phase iii was set to i nvolve the remaining areas of the southwest border as well as the coastal waters around florida and puerto rico although cbp maintained that the p revention through deterrence strategy applied to both the southwestern and nor thern borders the mix of usbp resources used to enforce it differed markedly be tween the borders along the southwest border the nsp emphasized the following mix of resources in descending order of importance personnel equipment

homeland security bureau of customs and border protection national continuedconversely the northern border emphasize d different mix of resources and activities intelligence liaison technolog equipment and personnel last10 the emphasis on intelligence gathering and coordination with canadian immigration and security agencies along the northern borde r was due in part to the comparatively smaller amount of people attempting to cr oss over illegally from canada as well as the geographic enormity of the border additionally it also reflected the growing concern with terrorist infiltration in the wake of 911 the bp refocused its priorities to place greater emphasis on protecting against terrorist pene tration as security efforts at official ports of entry become more sophisticated and stringent it is believed that terrorists and other criminals may attempt to illegally enter the country betw een points of entry in order to prevent and deter terrorist entry the bp in conjunction with immigration and customs enforcements ices antismuggling units and cbps office of intelligence focuses its in telligence and surveillance ope rations on known smuggling operations that have previous ly trafficked aliens from si gnificant interest countries additionally the agencies develop joint operations to target and disrupt these especially highinterest smuggling activities11 the bp also coordinates and shares intelligence with canadian and mexican authorities along the northern and southwestern borders it is important to note however that the increased emphasis on preventing terrorist entry into the united states did not change the scope of the bps mission preventing unauthorized aliens from entering the country national border patrol strategy shortly after the creation of dhs the bp was directed to formulate new national border patrol strategy ns that would better reflect the realities of the post 911 security landscape in march of 2005 the bp unveiled the current strategy which places greater emphasis on interdicting terrorists and features five main objectives establishing the substantial probability of apprehending terrorists and their weapons as they attempt to enter illegally between the ports of entry deterring illegal entries through improved enforcement detecting apprehending and deterring smugglers of humans drugs and other contraband leveraging smart border technol ogy to multiply the deterrent and enforcement effect of agents reducing crime in border communities thereby improving thequality of life and economic vitality of those

the ability to detect respond and inte rdict border penetrations in areas deemed as high priority for threat potential or other national security objectives13 the strategy places greater emphasis on hierarchical and vertical command structure featuring direct chain of command from hq to the field the ns builds on the prevention through deterrence strategy but places added emphasis on enhancing the border patrols ability to rapidly deploy its agents to respond to emerging threats tactical operational and strategic intelligence is critical to this new emphasis on rapid deployment as it will allow the border patrol to assess risk and target its enforcement efforts the border patrol believes that much of this intelligence will be generated through the use of next generation surveillance systems including cameras sensors and other technologies however recent pilot programs of these nextgeneration technologies have yielde d mixed results additionally the border patrol will coordinate closely with cbp s office of intelligence and other dhs and federal agencies intelligence apparatuses lastly the new border patrol national strategy formulates different strategies for each of the

patrol continues to use ident to identify and track illegal aliens ident combines photograph two fl at fingerprints and biographical data into two databases which can be used to track repeat entrants and better identify criminal aliens the ins settled on two fingerprint based system because it was deemed adequate for identification purposes and also due to concerns about the time it would take to process the thousands of aliens apprehended each day with ten rolled fingerprint system this has made the ident system difficult to integrate with criminal databases such as the fbis integrated automated fingerprint identification system iafis which are based on ten rolled fingerprint database identiafis integration will be discussed in more detail later in this report the ident system is administered in the field by border patrol agents using dedicated workstation that features digital camera and an electronic fingerprint scanner after an alien s two fingerprints photograph and biographical information are entered into the ident workstati on the system electronically sends the information to the main ident database at the justice data center the fingerprints are then checked against the two separate databases that form the integral part of the ident system the lookout and recidivist databases the biometric information entered into the system is first checked against the lookout database of criminal aliens aliens are entered into the lookout database if they are convicted of an aggravated felony multiple crimes or crimes of moral turpitude are known or suspected to be narcotics weapons or hum an smugglers or are inadmissible due to security concerns including terrorists or other related grounds if the alien registers as hit on the lookout database border patr ol agents are authorized to arrest and remand them to the proper authorities the fingerprints are also checked against recidivist database of aliens that have been apprehended trying to enter the count

border patrol however the number of apprehensions may be misleading statistic for the reasons discussed below multiple apprehensions border patrol data is limited by its focus on events ie apprehensions rather than pe ople thus if one unauthorized migrant is caught trying to enter the country three time s in one year he would count as three apprehensions in the data set the border patrol has not released any data concerning how many unauthor ized aliens are apprehe nded multiple times each year this could mean that apprehensions sta tistics overstate the act ual number of people trying to cross the border successful illegal entries there are reliable estimates for how many aliens successfully evade capture and ter the country most estimates cited calculate the growth in the unauthorized migrant population in the united states as such they cannot take into account the number of unauthorized migrants who enter the country stay temporarily and then leave for example the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the unite d states grew by 500000 people year from 35 million in 1990 to 111 milli on in 200534 however this data is limited most estimates of the unauthorized popula tion derive from the current population survey which does not ask about legal st atus but does ask whether someone is citizen35 since unauthorized immigrants often enter and leave the country many times this figure and others like it probably understate th number of people successfully entering the country each year lastly there is way of knowing what percentage of the people he re illegally entered the count ry through the land border and what percentage entered through port of entry but then overstayed their visa multiple correlations it is impossible to gauge solely

border patrol has drawn criticism from human rights activists who claim that the agencys migrant death count understates the numbe r of fatalities some cont end that the border patrol undercounts fatalities by excluding skeletal remains victims in car accidents and corpses discovered by other agencies or local law enforcement officers60 others point to inconsistencies in how the agency counts migrant deaths with some sectors counting smugglers and guides who perish but others excluding them even though official border patrol policy is to include all deaths in the 43 counties within 100 miles of the usmexico border61 border patrol officials counter that local law enforcement agencies often do not inform the border patrol when they encounter dead migrants and that deaths that ccur outside the 100 mile belt or on the mexican side of the border are outsi their operational purview62 the ratio between migrant deaths and apprehensions shows how many unauthorized immigrant fatalities there are for every apprehension made by border patrol agent along the southwest border because apprehensions are within their previously discussed limitations the best statistic available for

fy1999 to 55 deaths per 10000 apprehensions in fy2008 th is suggests that even as apparently fewer individuals have been entering the c ountry illegally over the past few years the border crossing has become increasingly dang erous for those that do attempt to cross into the united states illegally source crs analysis of cbp data the border patrol has taken several st eps to address this problem in recent years including the previously discussed border safety initiative and the specialized borstar search and rescue teams in orde r to continue addressing this issue the border patrol announced in may 2003 that it would add 150 agents to lineduty in the tucson sector place 20 rescue beacons in the desert and enha nce cooperation with mexican border authorities63 potential oversight issue for congress includes whether the steps taken by the border patr ol are an adequate response to the problem of migrant deaths and injuries along th border given the data presented above showing the border crossing may be increas ing in danger for unauthorized migrants attacks on border patrol agents the border patrol only recently began co llecting data on the attacks endured by agents in the line of

shootings they are nevertheless dangerous to agents figure 11 shows that since the border patrol began collecting data there has been marked increase in the number of incidents from 773 in fy2005 to 1097 in fy2008 this increase in violence against agents may be related to the increasing enforcement at the border as increasing numbers of border patrol ag ents are assigned to the southwest border there are more targets for unauthorized migrants and for smugglers to attack additionally the prevention through deterre nce strategy with its focus on placing agents and border patrol resources directly on the border may increase these kinds of attacks by providing more visible targets source crs presentation of cbp data potential oversight issue for congre ss could include whether border patrol agents have sufficient protection from these kinds of attacks including whether the gear they are assigned is adequate or wh ether additional safety equipment is required another oversight issue could include wh ether the border patrol has sufficient contingency plans in place to evacuate ag ents who are wounded in the line of duty lastly congress may be interested in studying whether these attacks are linked in any way to smuggling organizations and if so what can be done to interdict these groups before they attack agents020040060080010001200 fy2005 fy2006 fy2007 fy2008figure 11

undersecretary for bts asa hutchinson noted that these particular sweeps violated dhs policy because they were not authorized in washington dc but that the sweeps in general were legal and may be

patrol agents will be deployed to interior locations where there is direct ne xus to border control operations such as transportation hubs airports and bus stati ons to confront routes of egress for terrorists smugglers and illegal aliens70 possible issue for congress is whether the border patrol should have role in in terior enforcement and if so how far that role should extend some might argue that border patrol resources would be more effectively deployed solely along the bor der and that border patrol interior enforcement efforts duplicate the efforts of ot her agencies such as ice others might note that the border patrol is uniquely situated to provide an interior enforcement function because it has intima knowledge of illegal immigra tion activity and

linked to database that holds over 40 million records including wanted persons stolen vehicles deported felons gang members and terrorists71 integration of the two systems is widely regarded as vital co mponent of tightening border security as it would allow cbp inspectors and border pa trol agents to access the fbis criminal database in order to estab lish whether apprehended aliens have outstanding warrants or criminal histories however integration has proved difficult for various technical and organizational reasons the most pressing technical issue according to an oig report72 is related to the lower quality of fingerprint images in the ident system with 20 to 30 of ident fingerprints being unacceptable in late 2003 other technical issues identified by the oig report relate to the usvisit program73 whose development has siphoned off some of the dhs staff working on the identiafis integration project additionally the implementation of the usv isit program required some

would be achieved by the end of calendar year 2004 but that this longer seemed to be the case75 cbp recently announced that it has deployed in tegrated identiafis workstations to every border patrol station seemingly ddressing congressional concerns about the slow pace of the integration project however while the integrated identiafis workstations allow border patrol agents to check the fbis biometric criminal database they do not allow agents to access the name based consolidated terrorist watchlist maintained by the tsc as previously mentioned possible issues for congress to consider may be whether the border patrols lack of access to name based terrorist watchlists at their stations presents weakness in our nations border security pl 108458 called for the inte gration of all

dhs in itially believed that comprehensive sbinet solution would be deployed to the entire southwest border by 2011 and that some basi c functionalities would be ployed by the end of 2008 however in

sbinet has turned out to be more difficult to implement than dhs origin ally thought rather than extending comprehensive virtual fence across the entire southwest border by the end of 2008 as sbinet

will deliver these factors may be of concern to congress as it oversees the programs development nd considers whether to tinue to fund the program moving forward coordination with other federal agencies recent gao report criticized the border patrol for failing to coordinate its activities with the federal land management agencies operating along the border the federal land management agencies with some role at or near the border listed in the gao report are the bureau of land mana gement the fish and wildlife service the national park service the bureau of indian affairs and the forest service while the gao found that some coordination ex isted at the fieldlevel as of may 2004 neither the border patrol nor dhs had issued any national level plans detailing how interagency coordination would occur the report points out that while the agencies have separate and distinct ssions along the border when confronted with illegal activities both the land management agency law enforcement officers and border patrol agents must enforce federal laws and regulations and have the legal authority to bear arms interdict criminals and make arrests the gao report found that the level of bor der related criminal activity reported by the land management agencies including drug smuggling and unauthorized alien crossings had increased significantly ce the late 1990s the report notes that the department of the interior saw unauthorized alien appr ehensions on its lands within 100 miles of the arizonamex ico border increase drama tically from 512 in 1997 to 113480 in 2000 and that officials reported th at the number of unauthorized aliens crossing through its lands continues to rise the gao notes that this increase in illegal activity adversely affects not just the agencies law enforcement officers but also the civilians who visit the various parks along the borders endangered species and the land itself78 possible oversight issue fo r congress concerns whether the lack of national level inte ragency coordination along the border poses potential threat to border security if so c ongress might consider whether increased interagency coordinati on would increase bureaucracy and reduce the efficiency of the border patrols activities along the border or whether increased coordination would increase efficiency by better allocating and deploying resources civilian patrol groups an issue that has gained national prominence in the past two years has been the proliferation of civilian organizations ope rating along the border some of these

summer of 2003 two such groups ranch rescue and citizen border patrol significantly curtailed their activities on the arizona border due to mounting concerns about their practices80 more recently the minuteman project in arizona drew national media attention to the problem of unauthorized migrati on the minuteman project drew hundreds of volunteers from across the united states to watch stretch of the eastern arizona border with mexico near douglas in the tucson sector according to the minuteman organizers the project succeeded in dramatically reducing the flow of illegal immigration in arizona the border patrol contests this claim noting that while apprehensions in eastern arizona declined from 24842 in april of 2004 to 11128 in april of 2005 apprehensions in western arizona increased from 18052 in 2004 to 25475 in 200581 border patrol officials also stated that the volunteers were disrupting their operations by unwittingly tripping sensors deployed along the border forcing agents to respond to false alarms others believe that the decrease in eastern arizona is attributable to increased patrolling on the mexican side of the border by mexican police and military authorities82 some argue that these civilian patrol gr oups are vigilante organizations that are taking the law into their own hands and th at their operations can conflict with those of border patrol agents wasting valuable taxpayer dollars and distracting agents from the job at hand83 others counter that these groups are harmless and provide valuable assistance to the border patrol by identifying and sometimes capturing unauthorized migrants as well as by drawing attenti on to the problem of unauthorized migration84 possible oversight issue for congress may be whether the presence of civilian patrol groups along the border interferes with border patrol operations or poses danger to unauthorized migrants civilian humanitarian groups other border organizations such as huma ne borders samar itan patrol and

specific activities by civilian border groups that negatively impact the border patrol staffing and training issues border patrol agent manpower has been increasing steadily since the adoption of the prevention through deterrence strategy which focused on placing increased amounts of agents and resources directly on the southwest border figure 12 demonstrates the increasing manpower availa ble to the border patrol with agent staffing levels almost tr ipling between 1990 and 2002 this rapid increase in agents allowed the border patrol to place more agents directly on the border but also resulted in dilution of the level of experience of the agents in the field general accounting office gao report in 1999 noted that the average experience level of border patrol agents had declined agency wide and that the percentage of agents with less than two years of experience d almost tripled from 14 to 39 between 1994 and 199886 the gao report goes on to observe that attrition rates were

workforce since that peak the attr ition rate declined to 4 in fy2005 before increasing again to around 10 the in fy2007fy2008 the high rates of attr ition from 2000 to 2003 made it difficult for the
