dissemination of br and prtt results as distributing information to external customers in any form to include oral or written form lets say you perform br or prtt query using rasapproved identifier and the query returns good foreign intelligence information based on unique br or prtt metadata that you would like to report to intelligence community customers what should you do in this topic we will discuss to what extent we can use standard processes and procedures for the dissemination of this information and to what extent we must use special processes and procedures for the dissemination of this special foreign intelligence information given the sensitive nature of this program you will not be surprised to hear that there are special rules that apply to the dissemination of this

does not apply to br or prttderived non us person information or br or prttderived minimized us person information the dissemination tracking requirement applies to all br and prttderived information tssinf ogc attorney first of all every disseminated report from nsa must include sourcing information so that we know where the information came from as well as follow all ussid sp0018 minimization requirements and procedures for br and prttderived information the analyst or reporte needs to make sure that the information included in that report is properly sourced to the appropriate br or prtt authority tssinf in addition the court orders for both the br and prtt authorities have imposed two unique stringent requirements with respect to disseminating information from these authorities the first is the counterterrorism or ct nexus requirement and the second is the dissemination tracking requirement comment sls18 update 71311 from the smes please record at ussid 18 do not say spew or spow just ussid 18 top secretsinoforn page 29 of 39 top secretsinoforn top secretsinoforn page 30 of 39 top secretsinoforn tssinf hmc character recall the ras process and how you derived this information the identifier you used to i approved based upon the ras standard it was found to be an identifier reasonably believed to be used by someone i lenerate this information was tssinf hmc character it might seem as though the information would most certainly be counterterrorismrelated since due to the ras approval process you wouldnt have this us person information from query of br or prtt if it werent related to counterterrorism in the majority of cases it will be counterterrorismrelated however the nature of the counterterrorism target is that it often overlaps with several other areas that include counternarcotics counterintelligence money laundering document forging people and weapons trafficking and other topics that are not ctcentric thus due to the fact that these authorities provide nsa access to high volume of us person information for counterterrorism purposes the court order requires an explicit finding that the information is in fact related to counterterrorism prior to dissemination therefore one of the approved decision makers must document the finding using the proper terminology it must state that the information is related to counterterrorism and that it is necessary to understand the counterterrorism information tssinf ogc attorney while the ussid sp0018 process is the most familiar method of governing the dissemination of unminimized us person information obtained from traditional sigint means the ct nexus requirement is an additional protection for us person information being disseminated when the br or prtt authorities and metadata obtained by virtue of those authorities is the source of the information the fisc wants to ensure that the authorities are being used for counterterrorism purposes as intended so consider the ct nexus requirement step above justifying foreign intelligence requirement top secretsinoforn page 31 of 39 top secretsinoforn top secretsinoforn page 32 of 39 top secretsinoforn tssinf ogc attorney it is important to note that the authority to approve the dissemination of us person information cannot be delegated this responsibility is assigned only to the positions named in the br and prtt court orders lets say for example that the chief and deputy chief of information sharing services office the two individuals who on normal daily basis would be making the decision are both on vacation on the same day in this instance someone else within their office may be the acting chief on that day however the acting chief cannot make the decision to disseminate us person information tssinf hmc character under these circumstances if information about us person must be disseminated on that day then you should send your dissemination request to one of the other positions named in the orders this would logically be the nsoc soo tssinf ogc attorney with respect to nonus person information standard nsa practices and policies such as proper sourcing information apply top

in formal report as well as information disseminated informally such as written or oral collaboration with the fbi we need to count every instance in which we take piece of information derived from
