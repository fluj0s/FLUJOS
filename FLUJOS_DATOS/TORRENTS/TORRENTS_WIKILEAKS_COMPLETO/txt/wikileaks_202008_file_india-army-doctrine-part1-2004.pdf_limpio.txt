better than facing fearful odds for the ashes of his fathers nd the temples of his gods like all other modern armed forces the indian army has been considerably influenced by the revolution in military affairs and the great strides being made in technology development this has nece ssitated transformation in strategic thinking along with pa radigm shift in organization and conduct of operations as consequence military doctrines weapon systems and force structures need to undergo review our vision for the twentyfirst century is to have well equipped and optimally structured army enabling it to respond effectively to varied situations and demands whilst it continually adapts itse lf to meet future challenges such vision places emphas is on the ability to augment existing strengths develop new skills think imaginatively and attempt innovative approaches to cope with the emerging environment the challenges that we will be confronted with require us to visualize what our army of the future should look like and accordingly develop suit able approaches to structures equipping and training to emerge wit h flying colours in future conflict situations the impetus for change must come from within and flow through the entire army ii the indian army has to mainta in high level of readiness for war in varied terrain conditions and should have the capability to operate in the complete spectrum of conflict the indian army doctrine hereinafter referred to as the doctrine outlines framework for better understanding of the approach to warfare and provi des the foundation for its practical application funds scarcity or shortfall is challenge faced by all armies of the world and henc there is need for improved operating cultures and optimization of resources the winning armies of the future will not nec essarily be the ones that have greater combat power but ones that can visualize and comprehend battles more clear ly there will invariably be technological gaps between the systems that we possess and those developed up to that point in time notwithstanding this gap we have to continuously ut ilize all available resources imaginatively and effectively the emergence of information warfare as major force multiplier points clearly toward s the imperatives of network centric warfare additionally pr esent trends indicate marked shift towards the manoeuvre style of warfare and directive style of command concurrently the requirement for joint operations and the need for great er integration and inter dependence amongst the three services are viewed as being essential for success this doctrine emphasizes that th profession of arms is calling the hallmark of good soldier entails having sense of responsibility professional expertise and loyalty to the nation and the army the ethos and moral code set forth principles and ideals these ex hort every man in uniform to abide by his duty without regard to personal safety this ethos forms the bedrock of the army s preparedness in peace and is the key to its effectiveness in war indian army officers would do well to develop broad based allinclusive understanding of warfare and not become iii overly reliant on rigid adherence to prescriptive rules the nature of this doctrine is endur ing and yet dynamic it drives development of both the art and sci ence of war in the army it provides the focus for construc tive debate within wellinformed and professional circles and acts as guide to the younger generation training in the rmy should focus on management of change and operational adaptation to change towards this end providing the kind of ambience that encourages and facilitates intellectual devel opment should be an unceasing endeavour nc vij october 2004 general

section 1 doctrine concept and strategy doctrine is indispensable to an army doctrine provides military or ganisation with common philosophy common language common purpose and unity of effort general george h decker 1960 doctrine 11 military doctrines have prov ided the basic approach to all important aspects related to war for armies of most nations over the past few centuries pr evailing strategic realities threats challenges visualis ed opportunities and national aspirations are the major fact ors which have strong influence on the formulation of military doc trines doctrine is generally written document it could also be widely accepted understanding without being specif ically enunciated in the indian context the need for formulating and enunciating comprehensive military doctr ine has gained momentum with advancements in military tech nologies and the changing nature of war in our times m ilitary doctrine is neither dogma nor does it replace or take aw ay the authority and obligation of the commander on the spot to determine proper course of action under the circumstances prevailing at the time of decision 12 in simple words military doctrine is particular policy taught or advocated set of prin ciples by which military forces guide their actions in support of national objecti ves military doctrine can be defined as formal expression of military knowledge and thought that an army accepts as being relevant at given time which covers the nature of current and future conflicts the preparation of the army for such conflicts and the methods of engaging in them to achieve success it is authoritative but requires jud gement in application the illustration below depicts the input s that traditionally contribute to the formulation of militar doctrine and outputs that flow from its enunciation 4 future visualisation and strate gy doctrine equipment and infrastructure present nature of war and experience knowledge and understandin g organisation and force structure methodology of employing force and past wars concept 13 concept is defined as general notion or statement of an idea expressing how something might be done or accomplished that may lead to an accepted procedure in the nascent stage concept may be nebulous however it crystallises as it develops in the indian military context concept is generally enunciat ed at the strategic and operational levels it articulate s in very broad terms visualisation of t he manner in which op erations are to be conducted and focuses on the pr incipal elements which will drive them strategy 14 strategy is the art and sci ence of developing and using elements of national power including political economic psychological technological capabilities and military forces as necessary during peace and war to achieve national objectives military strategy is derived from the overall national or grand strategy winning strategists ar certain of triumph before seeking challenge loosing strategists are certain to challenge before seeking triumph sun tzu the art of war 5 section 2 environment and threat there can be four dangers to state that which is of external or igin and of internal abetment that which is of internal or igin and of external abetment that which is of external orig in and of external abetment and that which is of internal origin and of internal abetment kautilya general 15 india is country of c ontinental size with land borders shared with large number of countries 1197 islands and coastline of 7516 kilometres wit h vast exclusive economic zone despite her historically developed racial cultural linguistic and religious diversit india is nation with an innately allembracing secular polity that has welcomed and assimilated various cultures into her existing milieu her modern values are rooted in democratic governance and profound respect for human life we remain peaceful without being pacifists and have vision for the future with measure of confidence in ourselves as we strive for economic progress and integration in the global environment defending india calls for defending her physical economic and cult ural identity in the prevalent geopolitical milieu the geopolitical environment 16 the geopolitical scenario is fast changing and is likely to continue to do so in the coming decades although the usa remains the only super power t oday the world is witnessing the emergence of various cent res of power with india emerging as one of the leading gl obal players each centre of power is attempting to achieve balance of interest as opposed to the erstwhile balance of power greater reliance is being placed on democracy as factor contributing to conflict prevention and increas ing emphasis on bilateral or multilateral groupings as means to deter aggression against weak nations there is also growing concern about the 6 proliferation of w eapons of mass destruction and the spread of terrorism energy security and control of scarce resources are assuming transnational proportions 17 as part of the souther n asian region india has considerable interests in the ar eas stretching from west asia through central asia and south asia to so uth east asia the indian ocean region is of great importance to india and it assumes strategic significance due to the high volume of indian and international trade transiting through the indian ocean existing and emerging region groupings give rise to competitiveness with the attendant possibility of increasing instability due to inter and intra regional conflicts the region also includes number of nuclear weapon or nuclearcapable states in addition this r egion is witnessi ng an unprecedented proliferation in small arms and narcotics trafficking which in turn threaten the stability of st ates and societies transborder migration on economic grounds so raises serious security concerns 18 india is member of t he south asian association for regional cooperation saarc the association for south east asian nations regional forum arf and the indian ocean rim association for regi onal cooperation iorarc by virtue of her size and strat egic location in the indian ocean region india is expected to play her rightful role to ensure peace and stability in it the economic environment 19 with market forces playing an important role economic strength is likely to become the currency of power national economies are undergoing libera lisation to cater to globalisation the do minance of the developed world over the global economy is nonetheless likely to continue even so china and india have been cknowledged as emerging economic powers economic lin kages and interdependence amongst countries are likely to result in mutual security becoming an important issue wa ter energy sources mainly oil and even environmental iss ues may emerge as causes of future conflict between states 7 the security environment 110 the security challenges facing india are varied and complex india has two unse ttled borders the country has experienced four major convent ional border wars besides an undeclared war fought in kargil in 1999 she is engaged in an externally abetted proxy war fo r the last several years in jammu and kashmir and has been combating terrorism perpetuated by militant and terrorist groups sponsored by foreign state at the same time number of insurgencies spurred by tribal and ethnic aspirations in addition to left wing ideologies are being tackled in various parts of the country number of nuclear weapon states are in indias neighbourhood hostile radical or fundamentalist elements gaining access to and posing threat with weapons of mass destruction wmd is also possibility it is in such an environment that the indian army is required to fulfil its roles in varied operating conditions across the entire spectrum of conflict nature of future warfare 111 like terrorism today the likelihood of asymmetric wars becoming the form of warfare of tomorrow is being discussed quite widely nonetheless the fa ct that all countries continue to lay emphasis on preparedness for conventional war underscores the predominant view that asymmetric wars cannot replace conventional wars even though they can very much become an adjunct of and influence conventional wars themselves 112 future wars are likely to be characterised by emerging at short notice being of short duration and being fought at high tempo and intensity nonlinear conduct of operations deeper and wider combat zones due to increased reach of integral firepower and surveillance resources including spacebased systems 8 added emphasis on the all arms concept and need for increased jointmanship between the land naval and air forces enhanced reliance on variety of surveillance systems and resultantly gr eater availability of information contributing to increased transparency of the battlefield improved accuracy lethalit and standoff

india as major component of national power along with the indian navy and the indian air force the role s of the indian army are as follows primary role preserve national interests and safeguard sovereignty territorial integrity and unity of india against any external th reats by deterrence or by waging war secondary role assist government agencies to cope with proxy war and other internal threats and provide aid to civil authority when requisitioned for the purpose 114 command and control of the indian armed forces the president of india is the supreme commander of the indian armed forces as in all democracies the indian armed forces are controlled by the elec ted political l eadership of the nation government of india ex ecutive control is exercised sequentially through the union cabinet the defence minister the chiefs of staff committee c osc and the chiefs of army naval and air staff of their respective services the ministry of defence handles matters related to personnel financial and resource management 115 tasks of the indian army the indian army serves as the ultimate instrument fo r maintaining the unity and the integrity of the nation in the face of external threats and 10 internal unrest and disturbances the major tasks of the indian army are as follows effectively project deterrence and dissuasion through the medium of strong wellstructured combat capability be prepared to engage in and conduct all types of military operations singly or jointly in the entire spectrum of conflict provide the requisite land forces component of the strategic forces command provide aid to civil authority when called upon to do so for maintenance of law and order humanitarian aid and assistance during disaster s and calamities or any other circumstances including maintenance of essential services participate in united nations peacekeeping operations in consonance wit h indias commitment to the united nations charter be prepared to

peace conflict and war section 5 types of war section 6 principles of war 12 section 4 peace conflict and war the states of peace conflict and war 21 at any given point in time country will be in state of peace conflict or war or combi nation of these nations act in their own selfinterest which in cludes the pursuit of political economic ideological or cultural objectives when the interests of nations or group of nations are in harmony or at least pose real or perceived threat to each other there is peace however when the actions or policies of one nation are viewed as threat to the vita l interests of another condition of conflict arises conflict may scalate to war the illustration below depicts the entire spectrum of peace conflict and war nuclear war global war total war regional war conventional war limited war civil war revolutionary war proxy war insurgency subconventional war lico war peace operations other than war non combat operations probability of occurrence intensity or degree of violence note guerrilla war and terrorism may occur concurrently across the entire s pectrum of conflict violence occurrence spectrum of conflict there never was good war or bad peace benjamin franklin 1773 13 22 peace peace is defined as the absence of violence direct or indirect manifest or posed as threat peace is often viewed as temporary and fleeti ng condition to be enduring and genuine it must be based on mutual respect shared interests and common values peace is most often the result of balance of power and agreed polit ical spheres of interest between nations or ne nation manifesting superior political will this is invariably back ed by preponderance of force which is militarily unchallenged by others in either case peace is ultimately sustained by and is dependent upon the willingness of states to use force to preserve it as well as restore it when lost 23 conflict the essence of conflict is clash usually violent between opposing human wi lls each trying to impose itself on the other in both interstate and intrastate conflicts the means to impose ones will could include diplomatic economic and political mechanisms as well as the application or threat of violence by military force military action is just one instrument amongst several wh ich may be used to impose nations will armed conflict is synonymous with war today international mechanisms including the influence exercised by major powers are in place to resolve or limit conflicts because of their potential to lead to undesired war 24 the state of war war occurs when diplomatic and other negotiation mechanisms for resolving conflict or achieving desired political objec tives either fail or are not operative in such circumstances political aims and strategies are pursued by the use of armed force war is prosecuted by the employment of strategy which aims at breaking the enemys will to fight disengagement from war is difficult because it develops its own dy namics and pace which in themselves are unpredictable and could spin out of control while war is always to be avoi ded democratic societies must nonetheless be prepared to engage in it to safeguard their national interests 14 friend behold my chariot through which i am always decidedly victorious c ourage and tenacity are its wheels immutable truth and character are its flags strength

war conforms to the traditional image of war and is fought to achieve stra tegic and military objectives it does not include the use of nucl ear biological and chemical nbc weapons it may be total or limited in terms of duration the range of weapon systems employed scope obj ectives and its ultimate outcome given the prohibitive costs in terms of human lives and material as well as the rising lethality of modern weapons conventional war may be of short duration regional wars arise out of regional issues the gulf war 1991 and the kosovo conflict 1995 are two such examples even though they had repercussions at the inter national level global or general war is major unrestr icted conflict fought between major powers involving some or all their allies initially it is likely to employ conventional weapons but may then escalate to the use of weapons of mass destruction to deny victory to the opponents an extended global war of the second world war pattern is highly unlikely operations other than war 26 operations other than war ootw encompass wide range of activities where military power is used for purposes other than large scale combat operations normally 16 associated with war these in clude subconventional and non combat operations they usua lly involve the combined and coordinated effort of governmen t civil and military and non government agencies in essence ootw activities assist to deter war resolve conflict and promote peace and well being with use or demonstrated thr eat of use of force subconventional war 27 low intensity conflict lic lic is generic term encompassing all kinds of armed conflicts that are above the level of peaceful coexistenc amongst states and below the threshold of war these incl ude proxy war terrorism and insurgencies border skirmishes also fall within this category it involves protracted struggle of competing principles and ideologies low intensity conflict perations lico figures at the lower end of the spectrum of conf lict and is characterised by one or all of the following conditions asymmetry of force levels between the regular forces and the irregular opposition force the force applied and t he violence generated depends on the code of conduct and the capabilities of the weaker side laws of the land impose restrictions on the actions of security forces 28 proxy war proxy war is war conducted between nations utilising nonstate player s to fight on their behalf at least one of them employs thir d party to fight on its behalf the extent and type of support prov ided by the states involved in proxy war will vary but financial and logistic support are normally always provided an ex ample of proxy war is the foreign sponsored terrorism in jammu kashmir 29 insurgency insurgency is an organised armed struggle by section of the loca l population against the state usually with foreign support the many possible causes of an insurgency include nationalistic ethnic linguistic religious or cultural separatism poor gover nance economic deprivation corruption discrimination and oppression its goals may be seizure of power and replacement of the existing regime or 17 even liberation of defined area employment of military force may not be able to stamp out an insurgency but may help to contain it in most cases it is combination of military force backed by appropriate political and economic measures which can adequately resolve such situations the latter part acquires even more importance than the use of force 210 irregular war irregular war may take many forms of which terrorism and guerrilla war are two important ones terrorism is the unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence against people or proper ty to terrorise coerce or intimidate governments or societie s this is most often resorted to with the aim of achieving political religious or ideological objectives terrorism thrives on f ear psychosis and could be achieved by arson sabotage hijacking hoaxes maiming bombing seizure kidnapping assassination taking hostages raids ambushes and the threat to use or use of wmd guerrilla war is an irregular fo rm of warfare which includes acts of subversion assassinat ion attack on supply lines and terrorism terrorism and guerrilla warfare can be employed across the entire spec trum of conflict noncombat operations and ai d to civil authorities 211 noncombat operations are defined as military operations where the use of fo rce may not be necessary but at times the most minimal use of force or threat to use force may be required noncombat oper ations include aid to civil authorities disaster relief hu manitarian assistance and peacekeeping operations nuclear chemical and biological warfare 212 nuclear warfare conventional war may escalate to nuclear war when any of the belligerents decide to use nuclear weapons through any m eans of delivery to avoid defeat in the sphere of conventional warfare or to safeguard its vital national interests or even with the aim to bring the war to decisive end world opinion is against the use of such weapons india is nuclear we apon state and pursues policy 18 of credible minimum deterr ence and first use indias nuclear policy clearly states t hat she will not use or use the threat of use of nuclear weapo ns against those states which do not possess nuclear weapons or are not aligned with nuclear weapon powers india reserves the right to retaliate with nuclear weapons in case of strike against her by adversaries with nuclear chemical or biological weapons 213 biological and chemical warfare international conventions to which india is signatory along with large number of other countries have banned the use of biological and chemical weapons however their use by adversaries and nonstate actors cannot be ruled out chemical weapons are relatively easy to produce without any elaborate infrastructure as consequence our forces must be prepared for operations in biological and chemic weapons environment both active and passive defensive measur are being instituted to cater to this requirement slain you will obtain heaven victorious you will enjoy earth therefore stand up of kunti resolved to fight the bhagawad gita 19 information warfare information warfare in its most fundamental sense is the emerging theatre in which future nationagainst nation conflict at the strategic level is most likely to occur george j stein cyber war 2000 214 iw can be defined as actions taken to achieve information superiority by adve rsely affecting the adversarys information informationbased processes information systems and computerbased net works whilst simultaneously protecting ones own information informationbased processes information systems and computerbased networks correct and timely info rmation made available to commanders at all levels contri butes directly to effective command and control c2 and helps in shortening the observeorientdecideact ooda cycle also known as the ooda loop iw has vital impact upon the first three activities of the ooda loop by disrupting the enemys observation and surveillanc systems corrupting his orientation and misgui ding his perception and thereby inducing him to arrive at wrong decisions 215 objectives of iw the basic ingredients of iw are collection of data si fting to extract rele vant information analysis and assimilation of information to create intelligence which will help to achieve the objectives of iw these objectives are develop and maintain comprehensive information base of the capabilities of adversaries and forecast their likely actions deny information about own and friendly forces to adversaries influence perceptions plans actions and the will of adversaries to oppose own and friendly forces by offensive employment of iw techniques 20 influence noncombatant and neutral organisations to support friendly missions or at least not to resist friendly activities protect friendly decisionmaking processes information and information systems degrade the information systems of adversaries forms of iw 216 the seven forms of iw are command and control warfare c2w intelligence based warf are ibw electronic warfare ew psychological warfare cyber warfare economic information warfare and network centric warfare ncw these are discussed in succeeding paragraphs 217 command and control warfare the aim of c2w is to influence deny information to degrade or destroy enemy c2 capabilities while protecting own c2 systems against such actions c2w is dominant component of iw in the military arsenal c2w operations integrate and synchronise the capabilities of ew military dec eption physical destruction psychological operations and operational security 218 intelligence based warfare ibw is traditional component of iw and occurs when intelligence is directly fed into operations notably targeting and battle damage assessment to bring transparency to the battlefield rather than being used as an input for overall c2 ibw is the direct application of battlefield intelli gence instantaneously into the battle and aims at creating an asymmetry in the level of transparency or situational awarene ss in relation to the enemy 219 electronic warfare ew is set of military actions taken to deny the use of the electromagnetic spectrum to hostile forces while retaining the ability to use it oneself this basically implies that the endeavour is to deny degrade delay or disrupt information in order to create false pi cture so that the enemy is duped into making incorrect assessments and taking wrong actions ew involves the use of electromagnetic and directed energy to control the electromagnetic spectrum 21 or to attack the enemy one of the most important developments in the field of ew has been the introduction of automated and integrated ew syst ems which provide high degree of information in addition to interception direction finding and jamming activities 220 psychological warfare information is one of the several means to target t he human mind psychological warfare is achieved through mass media such as newspapers radio and television broadcasts nd distribution of leaflets the prevailing state of information technology allows effective psychological warfare to be conducted in very subtle manner in order to be effectiv psychological operations need to be conducted in conjunction with other operations during peace time and in lic perations this effort can be termed as psychological initiatives 221 cyber warfare this entails techniques to destroy degrade exploit or compromise the enemys computerbased systems cyber warfare includes exclusive attacks known as hacking on enemy computer netwo rks computer hacking has evolved to stage wherein in formation stored or passing through computer networks is interfered with to degrade the adversarys c2 structure 222 economic information warfare this form of warfare uses information as power to destabilise the economy of the adversary since all revenuegenerat ing industries of country such as aviation transport power banking and the like use computerbased systems iw at the strategic level can play havoc with the national ec onomy of the adversary 223 network centric warfare ncw focuses on the combat power that can be generat ed by the effective linking or networking of the warfighting machinery and organisations the basic elements necessary to generate the requisite shared battlespace awareness that can be exploited through selfsynchronisation to achieve the overall objective are given below virtual sensors grid that would provide grid of capabilities overlaying the battlespace instead of 22 series of independent single sensors this grid is termed as the surveillance grid to leverage the strength of the worldwide telecommunications infrastr ucture all communication networks could be viewed as virtual grids overlaying the tactical operational and stra tegic areas this grid is referred to as the communications grid an abstract grid that comprises weapons available sorted by suitability and availa bility against hostile order of battle is termed as the tactical grid 23 section 6 principles of war there exists small number of fundamental principles of war which m ay not be deviated from without danger and the appli cation of which on the contrary has been in all times crowned with glory jomini precis l art guerre 1838 224 the principles of war are broad guidelines which influence the conduct of war at every level of military operations they are based on pas t experience wherein their application with judgement led to victory they are not rules yet disregarding them involves risk and could result in failure these principles are outlined brie fly in succeeding paragraphs 225 selection and maintenance of aim the aim is expressed as an intention pur pose or end state it should be selected carefully defined clearly and stated simply and directly once selected it must be maintained 226 maintenance of morale morale is one of the more important elements of war high morale fosters the offensive spirit and the will to win 227 offensive action offensive action is the chief means of achieving victory it results fr om offensive spirit and helps in the seizure and maintenance of initiative 228 surprise surprise implies catching the enemy off balance thereby forcing him to give battle in circumstances unfavourable to him 229 concentration of force concentration of superior force at the chosen place and time ensures success in battle 230 security security relates to the physical protection of ground troops equipment materi and documents it also involves denial of information 24 231 economy of effort economy of effort connotes balanced deployment and judicious employment of forces to ensure success with minimum casualties 232 flexibility flexibility is the capability to react appropriately to changing situations 233 cooperation all agencies involved have to work jointly towards achievement of the overall aim to achieve success in war jointmanshi p leads to cooperation cooperation produces synergy 234 administration placing the resources required at the right place and time to help commanders at all levels to achieve their respective objectives is the function of administration 235 intelligence this is an addition to the widely accepted principles of war becaus of its preeminence in any future conflict military intelligence involves acquisition and exploitation of information about the enemy informatics plays major role in ensuring that intelligence is available in time and in the desired form war should be made methodically for it should have definite object and it should be conducted according to the principles and rules of the art napoleon maxims of war 1831 25 chapter 3 operational perspectives section 7 elements for operational success section 8 operational readiness and effectiveness section 9 surprise and deception section 10 impact of technology on operations and the revolu tion in military affairs 26 section 7 elements for operational success war is an art and as ch is not susceptible of explanation by fixed formula general george s patton jr war as i knew it 1947 31 operational success war is national undertaking that is coordinated from the highe st levels of policymaking to the basic levels of execution the objective of military forces in war is to achieve early and decisive victory over the opposing forces with minimum casualties to own forces the major aspects that contribut towards operational success are understanding the various perspectives of war employing operational art judicious application of combat power efficient exercise of c2 in the battlefield perspectives of war 32 the perspective of war varies based on which level it is viewed from even though the obj ectives to be achieved at strategic operational and tactical levels would flow downwards from the top for clarity of understanding of the complex nature of operational scenarios it is imperative that the commanders at all levels rec ognize the fine differences between the three levels of perspective given in succeeding paragraphs these perspectives are however not mutually exclusive and do tend to overlap at the fringes 33 strategic perspective viewed from the strategic perspective war is continuum to secure national policy objectives in concert with fined or perceived national security goals the end state of war must provide the 27 desired political advantage milita ry activity at the strategic level will thus be clearly influ enced by political and national considerations at the strategic level military power is one of the elements of national power av ailable to state to achieve its goals and enforce its policie s military co mmander at the strategic level would be required to render advice to political leaders which should be in the fo rm of strategic inputs through the established chain of command strategy itself has various levels at the apex there is gr and or national strategy which coordinates the overall approach pertaining to each element of national power such as national will economic political geographic and military power whereas military strategy is only concerned with military oper ations grand strategy must of necessity take longterm view and therefore encompass all elements of national power military strategy has been defined as the art of distributing and applyin g military means to fulfil ends of national policy more modern defin ition could be the art and science of employing the armed forces of nation to secure policy objectives by the application of force or threat of use of force in formulating m ilitary strategy it is important to note that it encompasses the following salient aspects identifying aims and objective s in theatre of war outlining the general cour of major operations and campaigns understanding the restrict ions placed on military operations based on national policy allocating adequate resources for successful conduct of operations 34 operational perspective the operational perspective focuses on achieving military aims or objectives at the theatre level and coordinating the effort of the land air and naval forces where and when applicable the operational level uses tactical results to achieve strategic objectives it involves planning of campaign within th specified time and space to achieve desired strategic goals viewed in comparison to the tactical level it covers larger ar eas of conflict has larger time and space horizon and has more critical impact on theatre 28 level operations major elements of the operational level of war are substantial combat power is kept out of contact till the opportune time this is in sharp contrast to the tactical perspective wherei n opposing forces actually see and engage each other and is thus more narrowly focused on specific military objectives the operational perspective provides wide enough view for the commander to enjoy independent command of military forces but is narrow enough to be relatively free of having to coordinate with the other elements of national strategy nonetheless there is need for clear understanding of the strategic perspective an operational perspecti ve prevents commander from overidentification with tactical battles it is concerned with translation of ab stract strategic aims to achievable tactical objec tives through the design organisation and conduct of major operations 35 tactical perspective the tactical perspective having the narrowest view in the hierarchy of war essentially concerns itself with optimising th application of military forces to achieve specified objectives this level focuses on the application of combat power to defeat the enemy in combat at particular time and place it includes the employment of firepower and manoeuvre the int egration of different arms and the exploitation of success co mmanders at this level concern themselves with purely military ob jectives laid down for them such as destroying enemy forces seizing specific objectives or denying specific pieces of ground and so on the means used in tactics are combinedarms formations and the ends are tactical victories these engagements may be more than one running concurrently in theat re of operations spread over hundreds of kilometres seemingly disjointed in application of force they are neverthele ss bound to common higher goal link is required to bring these various tactical pieces together to create the military conditions that can achieve strategic goals that link is the operational level and it is for this reason 29 that tactical battles are built and fought around an overarching operational design 36 level of conduct in our context the operational level of war is generally at the theat re or the command level while tactical level operations ar conducted at corps and lower levels however in certain cases where corps has been allocated an operationally strat egic objective it would be deemed to be conducting operations at the operational level at times depending upon the spectr um of conflict such as in lico there could be sit uations where even commanders subordinate to theatre command and corps will have to work on an operational perspective as their activities may directly influence the achievemen t of strategic objectives in theatre of operations 37 operational art in seeking to structure major operations battles and engagement s in pursuit of objectives the operational level commander should design his campaign plans around number of build ing blocks which help him to visualise as to how the operation w ould unfold his skills at this stage form the essence of operational art based on the desired end state he derives operational objectives decides upon the centres of gravity li nes of operation and decisive points and analyses the options thrown up by the conclusions drawn from these he must also keep in mind the importance of shaping the battlefield by t he employment of firepower and manoeuvre maintaining the tempo and factoring in operational pauses when drawing up plans end states 38 conflict termination conflict is either resolved or terminated military force contri butes by the defeat of an opposing force defeat is defined as diminishing the effectiveness of the enemy to the extent that he is either unable to participate in combat or at least not being able to fulfil his intention conflict rmination describes the point at which the principal m eans of conflict shifts from the use of force to other means of persuasion conflict termination may take several forms for exampl the adversary may surrender withdraw or negotiate an end to the conflict commanders and 30 staff must plan for conflict termination requirements when developing campaign plans 39 exit policy victory may not always be an appropriate term to describe the desired outco of an operation it may have to be defined in other terms such as reconciliation stabilisation acceptance of the status quo or acceptance of an agreed peace plan where such cceptance is hesitant or reluctant the prospect is of protracted involvement while planning conflict termination it will be prudent to plan suitable exit policy which should cater to various contingencies related to politicomilitary aims application of combat power 310 combat power combat power defines an armys ability to fight it s three basic components conceptual moral and physical have been dila ted upon in section 8 overwhelming combat power is achieved when all combat elements are brought to bear si multaneously with violence giving the enemy opportunity to respond in coordinated or cohesive manner and thereby achieve victory at least cost 311 modes of applicati on of combat power in combat the intention is to bring about strategic dislocation of the adversary by causing psychological paralysis amongst its decisionmakers in the physical and logistical planes this is produced by combination of iw securing or isolation of critical objectives threatening ot her objectives capture of high value territory and selective destruction of the adversarys combat potential the means to achieve such state include the following destruction physical destruction of the enemys capability to fight is but one of number of means to defeat him this would require focused and coordinated application of decis ive combat power attacking the enemys will conflict is subject to political economic ethical and moral constraints these limit the freedom of military action in this context attempting to destroy the enemys will solely by direct attack on his forces may be both costly and at 31 times counterproductive he must be made to feel constantly offbalance by one or more of the means enumerated below preemption to preempt the enemy is to seize an opportunity often fleeting before he does in order to deny him an advantageous course of action its success lies in the speed with which the situation is subsequently exploited preemptive operations rely on rapid decisionmaking and surprise rather than ponderous preparation dislocation to dislocate the enemy is to deny him the ability to bring to bear his strengths unlike preemption dislocation is deliberate act and is critically dependent on sound intelligence rather than intuition its purpose is much wider than the frustration of the enemys plan it is to render his strength irrelevant it seeks to avoid fighting the enemy on his terms and can be achieved by either avoiding his strengths or by so fixing them that they cannot be used effectively posturing deep penetration thrusts and envelopment are classic forms of dislocation disruption to disrupt is to attack the enemy selectively to break apar t and throw into confusion the assets which are critic to the employment and coherence of his fighting power its purpose is to rupture the integrity of the enemys fighting potential and to reduce it to less than the sum total of its constituent parts the enemys moral and physical cohesion can be shatter ed by manoeuvring in manner which surprises him using firepower selectively to attack target s that contribute to his cohesion and by imposing on him the effects of tempo and simultaneity command and leadership 312 command is the legal authority exercised by the commander over his troops to accomplish his mission it carries with it the responsibil ity for planning organising 32 training directing coordinati ng and controlling military forces to accomplish assigned implie d or inherent missions together with administrative re sponsibility for suppl health welfare morale discipline assignment and relief of personnel 313 exercise of command in battle the art of command lies in conscious and skilful exercise of authority through visualisation decisionmaking an d leadership effective battle command demands timely and correct decisions based on the accurate and skilful judgement of battle situations effective decisionmaking combines judgement with information as an element of combat power the commander must be able to perceive the plan being implemented and the critical junctures where his personal decisionmaking will facilitate success clear thinking and leve lheadedness in trying situations greatly help in recognising the practicabi lity of possible courses of action before embarking upon one of them 314 leadership in battle yet another essential quality of commander is effective and enlightened leadership he should be fully cognizant of the strengths and vulnerabilities of the force that he commands closely overseeing and monitoring critical junctures in battle being up forward to read the situations offering encourage ment and making onthespot decisions particularly in adverse situations are the hallmarks of good leadership military histor is replete with excellent instances of how great battles were won because of inspiring and decisive leadership 315 command and control command has two components the commander and the c2 systems communication systems surveillance systems and computer networks form the backbone of c2 systems and enable commanders to lead from any point on the battlefield reliable communications are central to such systems sound c2 should ensure unity of effort provide for centralised direction and centralised execution prov ide an environment for applying common doctrine and ensure interoperability centralised direction and decentralised execution are two key prerequisites for successful c2 centralised direction is provided by the national leadersh ip at the nationalstrategic level this is then converted to jointservices plan cojointly by 33 the three services and following which directives are transmitted to theatre commanders for execution information gathering and decisionmaking mu st be centralised to enhance coordination and control over subordinate forces albeit with requisite freedom of action for subordinate commanders war is science which depends on art for its application captain sir basil liddell hart strategy in encyclopaedia britannica 1929 34 section 8 operatio nal readiness and effectiveness the sword drawn to prevent the drawing of swords samuel purchas purchas his pilgrimage 1612 316 operational read iness is the state of preparedness of an organisation to perform the ssion for which it is organised or designed military effectiveness is the standard by which the army from the platoon to the hi ghest levels is judged in peace and war the efficiency with which operational readiness and effectiveness is achieved also needs to be optimised to ensure availability of maximum possible combat power when and where required the level of operational readiness and effectiveness of force has major bearing on its ability to launch and successfully conduc t operations ensuring operational readiness and effectiveness is command responsibility 35 combat power 317 the term combat power defines an armys ability to fight combat power has three basic components and their interrelationship is shown in the figure below 318 the conceptual component this can be described as the thought process behind the ability to fight it is vital component in that commanders at various levels have the benefit of the concept s and doctrines evolved over period of time as well as the experience of their predecessors it also helps commanders to imbibe common understanding of principles and yet allows the freedom of exercising individual styles of comm and the conceptual component comprises principles of war military doctrine and development the contribution of principles of war and military doctrine towards accomplishing oper ational readiness and effectiveness has already been amp lified in earlier sections of this book development requi res knowledge an innovative approach and mind open to all as pects of warfare this includes force organisation structuring and equipping of conceptual componen t thought process principles of war military doctrine development moral component ability to get people to fight leadership motivation basic morality management physical component means to fight manpower equipment logistics training national assets and infrastructure combat power ability to fight 36 various types of units commanders also need to keep abreast of developments taking place in the environment and should have adequate knowledge of m anagement of change so that they can work as facilitators the higher the level of commander the wider should be his knowledge horizon so that he can understand the necessi ty to implement the desired change 319 the moral component the moral component concerns the ability to get peo ple to fight maintenance of morale is principle of war and as such embraces the moral and physical aspects of combat power high morale stems from sound training conf idence in equipment and good administration as well as confidence in commanders discipline selfrespect and clear knowledge of what is going on and what is r equired yet the ability to get people to fight is not just question of morale it also involves the following aspects basic morality it is extremely impor tant that the basic morality of individuals in the indian army is always above board professional honesty courage of conviction integrity tolerance to accept reality and differing points of view are some of the essent ial qualities which should always be encouraged the higher the position in the hierarchy the greater should be the commitment to moral values in addition commander should posses the courage to take hard decisions motivation soldiers who are we ll motivated and well led work as team teamwo rk breeds comradeship which in turn leads to pride in belonging to team and fosters esprit corps motivation thrives on continuing sense of purpose and it is the job of the commander to instil this purpose although national will reflected in government directives serves to give the soldier this sense of purpose it is the responsibility of the commander to make soldiers fully identify with these it mu st be clearly understood that leading soldiers in pursuit of causes that they do not understand is daunting task 37 leadership there are many definitions of military leadership however most simply defined military leadership is the projection of personality and character by the leader to get soldiers to do what is required of them skill in the techniques of leadership is the foremost quality in the art of command and contributes very largely to success at all levels of war management good management can have considerable bearing upon morale and on military effectiveness it involves making the best use of available resources in accomplishment of the mission management skills are essential elements of good and efficient military leadership 320 the physical component the physical component is the means to fight it is defined as the total means of destructive or disruptive force which military unit or formation can apply against the opponent at given time the total means include the organising and provisioning of the main elements of combat power which are manpower equipment logistics training and national assets operational readiness 321 readiness of the indian armed forces to meet national emergencies is facet of national level endeavour it calls for synergised effort by all instruments of the government to ensure that these forces are moved to their areas of operations fully equipped and within an acceptable timeframe the government on its part would indicate and maintain clear and strong resolve to go to war when it orders general mobilisation there may also be other methods of preparation for war even without ordering general mobilisation on the part of the armed forces they are responsible for ensuring that they are operationally ready troops are in high state of morale and units are appropriately trained to execute the missions assigned to them 322 military mobilisation in the indian context involves considerable effort because of the wide geographical spread of the peacetime locations of our units and formations the considerable extent of our borders and the multiplicity of agencies that need to coordinate their actions in order to make it effective 38 section 9 surprise and deception generally in conflict the straightforward will lead to engagement and the surprising will lead to triumph sun tzu the art of war surprise 323 surprise in war is potent force multiplier the payoffs of surprise are almost alwa ys in geometric proportions and it multiplies the chances of achi eving quick and decisive military victory as decisive factor at all levels of warfare and duly acknowledged as an autonomous pr inciple of war surprise allows the side that achieves it to concentrate superior forces unnoticed at the point of decisio n and to beat the opponent in terms of time place method or new technologies the purpose of surprise in essence is to make the enemy react in an irrational and uncoordinated manner 324 strategic surprise can herald both the beginning and the end of war considering the scope of its effects and the level at which it is planned the phenomenon of military surprise can be classified as stra tegic operational or tactical however in practice the distin ction between the strategic and operational and operational and tact ical surprise is often hazy and they invariably tend to ov erlap with battlefield transparency improving by the day the ability to effect true surprise is progressively reducin g military planner s therefore need to concentrate more on dec eption as good and well coordinated deception plan would help to achieve surprise deception 325 deception needs to be developed as an integral component of peacetime and wartim national security policy deception is intentional purposef ul calculated and deliberate the target of deception should be the adversarys decision making system deception should create perceptions and thereafter reinforce them decept ion should aim at misleading an adversary with regard to tectable information whether 39 actual or notional by obscuring it often the best and simplest deception is the presentation of the truth but in such form that the adversary disbelieves it 326 it must be clearly under stood that given todays battlefield transparency deception in addition to surprise will be very difficult to achieve in the first instance retaining the advantage that flows from it for an appreciable period of time will be even more difficult for that reason alone this is one aspect which will require very thorough study preparation and conceptualization 327 military deception operat ions are an inherent and expected responsibility of co mmand at division level and above it needs to be coordinated at the highest level to be effective and should therefore be indivisible from all other parts of the conception pl anning and execution of military operations in peace nd war deception ought to be intrinsic to and inseparable from all milit ary thought and action rather than mere annexure afterthought or an adjunct the planning and practice of dec eption must be systematically integrated into devisin g military strategy 328 the process of deception is interactive and follows the sequential steps of planning evaluation coordination integration approval and executi on on completion of the last step of execution the situation needs to be reanalysed and process repeated if required the advent of iw offers unprecedented opportunities fo r deception operations in scope effect and imagination it is imperative that deception operations are planned as meticul ously as actual operations if not more deception plans may even be implemented by designated headquarters supported by suitable allocation of resources nothing should be left to chance as an unfounded or unacknowledged assumption supposition or assertion those charged with pl anning approving and executing deception operations as well as the operators must be absolutely adept in all the processes that these involve training and exercises shoul d integrate the aspect of deception and appropriate resour ces should be instituted to develop and refine the art modern technology provides battlefield transparency and hinders concealment audacity of plans and speed of operations could be potent instruments to gain surprise general nc vij 40 section 10 impact of technology on operations and the revolution in military affairs michael loescher cyber war 2000 information warfare has the potential not only to be force multiplier but also to be force equaliser impact of technology on operations 329 emphasis on iw with the induction of better communication systems and the creation of networked environment our ability to collect collate and analyse diverse inputs received from various agencies has been greatly enhanced however the vulnerabilities of such systems to disruption by the enemy have so increased and its resultant impact on conduct of operati ons would be magnified in proportion to the dependence on it due to the dependence of military forces on such systems the role of technology in future warfare has expanded considerably thereby enlarging our earlier concept of ew to c2w which incorporates all functions of command depend ent on communications and computers thus in net workcentric environment the emphasis will shift to iw and th various active and passive measures which form part of it 330 increased battlefield transparency and situational awareness today newer and better systems are available for the conduct of surveillance i dentification and monitoring of the enemy and these have improv ed situational awareness the nature of sensors and their platforms have extended the range of observation and enhanced the resolution thereby providing greater accuracy and tail in shorter timeframes the overall aim is to create technological asymmetry so as to be in better position to see locate and monitor enemy forces and to plan for their destruction degradation or disruption in such an envir onment newer techniques or methods would be required to ac hieve surprise and deception 41 increased reconnaissance and surveillance capability will enable manoeuvre force commanders to concentrate superior combat power at points of decision 331 enhancement in degradation capability the range precision and throwweight of weapon systems have increased substantially and have great ly enhanced the degradation capability of all forces these weapon systems coupled with air power will be used in exploiting gains in battlefield transparency to shape the battlefield enhanced precision and standoff engagement capability along with transparency sensors will act as force multipliers 332 reduced reaction time the time required for passage of information and or ders will be reduced due to improved communications and networking accordingly greater emphasis will have to be placed on directive style of command the use of command control communication computers intelligence in formation surveillance and reconnaissance c4i2sr systems will result in expansion of the battlespace and compression of the time dimension however the adverse impacts of information overload on the decisionmaking process of ow n forces need to be borne in mind and avoided 42 333 night fighting technology has significantly improved night fighting capab ility the ever increasing availability of new ge neration night vision devices will impact beneficially on tactical concepts 334 deception enhanced battlefield transparency will demand greater emphasis on decept ion so as to confuse or deceive the enemy about own mo vement concentration aim and intended area of operations management of the enemys perceptions through c2w would become important in the future this could well be achieved with modern technology by attempting to reinforce the enemys beliefs and thereafter employ the tools of iw to b lind or mislead enemy surveillance as part of well coordinated plan 335 enhanced mobility mobility of ground forces especially in the plains and deserts has improved considerably enhanced battlefield transparency will facilitate and even require shift from the existing attritionbased or positional concept of operations to that based predominantly on manoeuvre in offensive as well as defensive operations 336 enlarged battle area better surveillance capabilities enhanced mobility of forces in t he tactical battle area longer ranges of weapon systems stateofart communication systems information technology enabling effective c2 of forces over vastly extended areas ve enlarged the battlespace the ability to conduct nonlinear and simultaneous operations at greater depths adds to th battlespace over which commander needs to exercise c2 revolution in military affairs rma 337 recent conflicts have highli ghted the dramatic impact of technology on warfare this has caused significant shift in the very nature of warfighti ng and is bringing about rma although we may not have the wherewithal to draw full benefits from it at present the underlying message is unambiguous technology gives clear edge and needs to be exploited to our advantage we need to conceive and work towards homespun rma that meets our needs and gives us an edge over our potential adversa ries towards this end it will 43 be essential to institutionalis methods for assimilating technology and adapting and even anticipating changes in doctrine tactics and organisations in so doing special attention needs to be paid to the impact of rma on lic and asymmetric warfare waged by non state actors 338 rma is termed as major change in the nature of warfare brought about by the innovative application of new technologies which combined with the dramatic changes in military doctrine operati onal concepts and operations fundamentally alters the char acter and conduct of military operations 339 the main constituents of rma are doctrine technology tactics and training although the revolution is driven by technology changes in doctrine tactics and training are equally if not more important thus the rma apart from the aspect of routine evolution that an army undergoes in the process of modernisation invo lves transformation in the nature and conduct of military oper ations it is the synergetic outcome of advances in technology suitably absorbed and applied by armed forces there is need therefore to focus on emerging technologies avail able to the armed forces to meet the strategic op erational and tactical requirements of the future and analyse the effect of cuttingedge technologies on future requirements while doing so aspects relating to orchestration of human res ources and reorientation of training which are imperative for unleashing the full potential of emerging technologies must be factored in as technology alone can not influence the cour of war unless there is transformation in the manner arm ed forces think train and fight 340 the backbone of rma is c4i2sr system which facilitates dominant battlespac awareness and will therefore constitute major thrust area five major components of rma are iw dominant manoeuvre precision engagement full dimensional protection and focu sed logistics advances in c4i2sr also make possible new concept in war fighting viz ncw 44 341 analysis of major com ponents of rma indicates that they have great applicability in our context we may however have to follow an incremental approach in embracing these principles and acquiring the re levant technology iw will form key component of our war fight ing doctrine the excellent support base and infrastructure in information technology that is available in the country s hould be optimally exploited 342 ncw has great potential in our context we need to evolve our concept based on our security compulsions investment in infostructure is an absolute imperative this must be done jointly in conjunction with other services so that seamless operations can be under taken as we progress to higher levels of technology our ability to undertake ncw operations can be further refined the advantages of operating with geographically dispersed forces must be fully exploited particularly in the backdrop of nuclearised environment 343 meeting the challenge of rma may demand substantial changes in our concepts organisational philosophies and most of all attitudes conc epts and organisational structures for exploitation of rma woul d need to be evolved as the inevitable move towards greater use of high technology takes place 344 rma will have dramatic effect on the army and conduct of warfare through trends like lethality and dispersion volume and precision of fires and their effects processing and use of information invisibility and detectability technologies that would need to be invested in are in the spheres of projecting and protecting the fo rce decisive operations shaping of the battlefield and in tegrated logistics indigenous development of technologies to achieve self reliance will need sufficient investment to keep pace with rma 345 the impact of rma on lic is not as dramatic as in the field of conventional conflict th is does not imply that rma has little to do in lic on the contrary technology can play significant role in lic we need to constantly refine our doctrines concepts organisations and tactics so as to optimise the effect of rma in lic 45 ardant du picq battle studies 18211870 the instruments of battl are valuable only if
