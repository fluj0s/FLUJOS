rl30281 1999 federal mandatory minimum sentencing statutes an overview of legislation in the 106th congress crs report rs20307 1999 is sketch of related legislativ developments types of mandatory minimums mandato ry minimum statutes come in many stripes including some whose statu s might be disputed the most widely recognized are those that demand that offenders be sentenced to impriso nment for not less than designated term of imprisonment somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20306crs2 are triggered by the nature of the offense others by the criminal record of the offender few members of this category are some less mandatory than other s several of the drug related mandatory minimums in this category for instance are subject to safety valve that may make their minimum penalties less than mandatory for small time first tim offenders handful of the ot her notlessthan statutes permit the court to sentence an offender to fine rather than to mandatory term of imprisonment second generally rec ognized category of mandatory minimums consists of the flat or single sentence statutes closely related are t he capital punishment statutes that require imposition of either th death penalty or imprisonment for life the piggyback statutes make up third class the piggyback statutes are not themselves mandatory minimums but sentence offenders by reference to underlying statute with mandatory minimums r otherwise the final and least bvious group is comprised of statutes whose violation results in the imposition of mandatory minimum term of imprisonment by operation of law r more preci sely by operation of the sentencing reform act and the sentencing guidelines issued in its name most federal criminal laws do not mention mandatory minimu m sentence they simply establish maximum f ine and maximum term of imprisonment and indicate that subject to those maximum levels t he court may sentence an offender to either fine or term of imprisonment or both the sentencing g uidelines convert many of these simplemaximumfinemaximumtermofimprisonmentorboth statutes into what might reasonably be considered mandatory minimum sentencing statutes the feder sentencing guidelines are designed to eliminate unwarranted sentencing disparity they establish scorecard system that pre sents sentencing courts with narrow range within which the sentence to be imposed must fall the bottom of the applicabl range for most crimes calls for imprisonment constrain ts on the option of probation make sentence other than incarceration even more rare court may depart from the sentence the guidelines dictate if the case before it involves mitigating or aggravating factor s overlooked in the guidelines such departures are expected to occur only highl infrequently under the current guidelines and absent grounds for departure federal courts must impose sentence of imprisonment following conviction for any crime carrying maximum of fifteen years or higher they will enjoy greater discretion in most ten year felony cases or in many five year felony cases mandatory minimums and the sentencing guidelines even though the guid elines work to reduce judicial sentencing discretion and in fact might be characterized as creating host of new members of the species mandator minimums have been criticized as incompatible with the federal sentencing guidelines perhaps most prominent among its critics was the sentencing commission itself whic h found that mandatory minimums contributed to unwarranted sentencing disparity an d lacked the precision that would have otherwise been possible under the guidelines congress responded with the safety valve provisions of 18 usc 3553f unde r which the court may disregard various drug mandatory minimums and sentence n offender within the applicable sentencing guideline range as long as the offender was lowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20306crs3 level nonviolen t participant with prior criminal record who had cooperated fully with the government constitutional boundaries defendants sentenced to mandatory minimum terms of impri sonment have challenged them on number of constitutional grounds ranging from cruel and unusual punishment through ex post facto and double jeopardy to equal protection and due process eac h constitutional provision defines outer boundaries that mandatory minimum must b crafted to honor none confine legislative prerogatives in any substantial way cruel and unusual punishment mandatory minimums implicate considerations under the eighth amendments cruel and unusual punishments clause the clause bar s mandatory capital punishment statutes woodson v nor th carolina 428 us 280 1976 and although the case law is somewhat uncertain it seems to condemn punishment that is grossly disproportionate to the misconduct for which it is imposed harmelin v michigan 501 us 957 1992 in solem v helm 463 us 277 1983 the court declared that imposition of mandatory term of lif imprisonment under state recidivist statute constituted cruel and unusual punishment the objective criteria which guided proportionality analysi s included i the gravity of the ffense and the harshness of the penalty ii the sentences imposed on the other criminals in the same juri sdiction and iii the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions 463 us at 292 furman found that the eighth amendments cruel and unusual punishment clause made binding upon the states by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment precluded impositi on of the death penalty at the unguided discretion of the judge or jury the states initially travelled one of two paths to av oid the problems of unguided discretion identified in furman some eliminated discretion others provided guidance the second approach passed constitutional muster gregg v georgia 428 us 153 1976 the first did not woodson v north carolina 428 us 280 1976 mandato ry capital punishment offended the eighth amendment on three grounds woodson declared it w as contrary to the evolving standards of decency which mark the threshold of the amendments protection 428 us at 288301 it failed to address the objections of furman to impo sition of the death penalty at the unguided discretion of the judge or jury 428 us at 302 and it failed to permit consideration of individua l characteristics of the crime and offender the court regularly and consistently recognized the individual consideration s requireme nt in subsequent capital punishment cases although the logic would seem t apply with similar force in noncapital cases the court emphasized that the doctrine was limited to capital cases harmelin harmelin first time offender was convicted of possession of 672 grams of cocaine enough for possibly as many as 65000 individual doses under the laws of the state of michigan the conviction carried with it mandatory sen tence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parolehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20306crs4 harmelin contended that the sentence violated both the individual consideration and proportionality doctrines of th eighth amendment majority of the court rejected the individual considerations argument and plurality refused to accept the proportionalit assertion the court noted that in its opinions the penalty of death differs from all othe r forms of criminal punishment in its total irrev ocability in view of the differences the majority saw reason to extend this socall ed individualized capitalsentencing doctrine to an individualized mandatory life in prison without paro sentencing doctrine 501 us at 995 citations omitted the proportionality question proved somewhat more difficult justice scalia an d chief justice rehnquist simply refused to recognize an eighth amendment proportionality requirement at least in noncapital cases 501 us at 994 for three other justices kennedy oconnor and souter sentence which satisfies the first of the solem tests seriousness of the offense need not survive or even face comparisons with sentences for other crimes in the same jurisdiction and for the same crime in ther jurisdictions 501 us at 1004 more precisely the plurality emphasized that the eighth amendment does t require strict proportionality between crime and sentence rather it forbids only extreme sentences that are grossly disproportionate to the crime 501 us at 1001 after harmelin since harmelin the lower federal courts have regularly and uniformly rejected eighth amendment challenges to mandatory minimums in most of their variant forms including the piggyback mandatory minimums of 18 usc 924c the death resulting death penalty or mandatory imprisonment for life 18 usc 34 the arme d career criminal mandatory minimum 18 usc 924e the three strikes

while it remains basic principle of our constitutional s cheme that one branch of the government may not intrude u pon the central prerogatives of another loving v united states 517 us 748 757 1996 the supreme court has observed that congress has the power to define criminal punishments without giving the courts any sentencing discretion united states v chapman 500 us 453 467 1991 thus the wer federal courts have regularly upheld mandatory minimum statutes challenged on separation of power s grounds and the supreme court has denied any separation of powers infirmity in th federal sentencing guideline system which produces its wn form of mandatory minimums mistretta v united states 488 us 361 1989 crack and equal protection the equal protection objections to the mandatory minimums that attach to the sale and possession of cocaine base crack flow from the disparate treatment afforded the two forms of cocaine the penalties for p ossession with intent to distribute 50 grams of crackhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20306crs5 are the same as those for possession with intent to distribute 5000 grams of cocain powder the 1001 ratio between the two continues through the federal sentencin g structure with one exception there is mandatory minimum for simple possession of powder cocaine but simple possession of 5 grams or more of crack is punishable b imprisonment for not s than 5 years the sentencing difference has racially disparate impact that invites equal protection analysis statutes are subject to strict scrutiny under the equal protection clause when the contain express racial classifications as well as when though race neutral on their face they are motivated by racial purpose or object although insufficient on its own racially adverse impact is one factor to be considered in the determination of whether facially neutral statute is racially motivated statute will survive strict scrutiny only if narrowly ta ilored to serve compelling governmental interest statutory classification that is not racially motivated or similarly suspect and thus not subject to strict scrutiny will pass const itutional muster if it is based on some rational justification heller v doe 509 us 312 320 1993 only one lower federal court has concluded that the disparate penalties had disparate racial impact was subject to and could not withstand equal protection stric t scrutiny the decision was overturned on appeal under an analysis that rejected as have other courts strict scrutiny in favor rational basis standard recidivism ex post facto and double jeopardy double jeopardy bans trying defendant twice for th same offense and ex post facto bars retroactive criminal statutes more precisely the double jeopardy clause protect s against successive prosecutions for the same offense after acquittal or conviction an d against multiple criminal punishm ents for the same offense the ex post facto clauses on the other hand preclude laws that retroactively alter the definition of crimes r retroactively increase the punishment for criminal acts some argue that recidivist mandatory minimums offend both the double jeopardy and ex post facto clauses they are contrary to double jeopardy it is said because by using first convicti on to justify an increased penalty for second conviction they are in effect punishing the first offense twice they contravene ex post facto when they are used t sentence defendant whose first conviction predates the recidivist statute or so it i s contended the courts have rejected both arguments as the supreme court explained when it rejected the double jeopardy challenge to the california three strikes statute we have found double jeopardy protection s inapplicable to sentencing proceedings because the determinations at issue do not place defendant in jeopardy for an offense nor have sentence enhancements bee n construed as additional punishment for the previous offense rather they act to increase sentence because of the manner in which the defendant committed the crime f convict ion an enhanced sentence imposed on persistent offender thus is not to b viewed as either new jeopardy or additional penalty for the earlier crimes but as stiffened penalty for the latest crime which is considered to be an aggravated offens because repetitive one monge v california 118 sct at 2250251 some citation s omitted httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20306crs6 courts c onfronted with ex post facto challenges to recidivist statutes have similarly focused upon the latest crime and not upon the first
