bad indicators lecture given on 9 january 1964 okay how are you today thank you i like you too all right this is what the 9th of january is that it all right nine january ad 14 saint hill special briefing course and this is lecture on good and bad indicators and such other bricabrac as you might be interested in i probably should put that as an addendum on all my lectures shouldnt i the bricabrac department trouble is i come up with things you see that im not at all sure you have good grip on and i have to tell you about them as i go along what i want to cover today particularly is good indicators howd they do yesterday on that test did anybody look at those papers male voice well i havent heard the results but there were plenty of good indicators in the sessions there were good indicators in the session how do you think you did on that test yesterday well speak up i can hear you all right all right now are you getting the idea you getting the idea of good indicators all right are you getting so you can look at session and tell if its session and not session all right good now this will make great deal of difference to you in running co audit much less make great deal of difference to you as an auditor now in trying to relay truth it is always necessary to develop some breakdown of auditing or something of the sort and in trying to get something across to you why i ordinarily will develop some sort of of system by which it can be communicated and were particularly interested in this system which divides basic auditing technique and case analysis and all levels break down to these and you have in each level its basic auditing its case analysis and its technique now whats quite interesting here about good and bad indicators and what ive been working on and ive been springing on you here is is weve broken down case analysis ive found out this was the weakest point was the auditors understanding of what was going on with case so weve broken this down and case analysis breaks down into the general subject of case analysis and the system by which it can be employed at various levels but case analysis now and be alert to this because this is the way it is case analysis actually breaks down to good indicators and bad indicators and you recognize that i saw the frailty of case analysis here and actually almost unwittingly got to work on the subject and broke it down into good indicators bad indicators and the bad indicator system now case analysis then is something that progresses all the time regardless of what your basic auditing is and regardless of what your technique is and also regardless of what level is being run what level of scientology these things are always present always present and the running fire of case analysis the running fire of case analysis is simply noting that the good indicators are still with us and being alert when one drops out and then looking to see what bad indicator has appeared and remedying it which brings us back into the technique department do you see that now and case analysis actually considers the observation the observation of of the good indicators as continuous observation and knowing what they are and when one of them drops out then this is onetwothree proposition then noticing what bad indicator has appeared and the case analysis at that point will then tell you what technical action to take now that you take technical action isnt really part of case analysis so basically the case analysis whereby you find where the pc probably is or where hes located get some idea of where he thinks he is or something like that like he says hes in present time problem or something like that and you get his considerations about this and then you find out where hes really located you actually now technically very very very very precise being very picky about the matter that is really not case analysis because that goes from case analysis analyzing what the pcs got there back to technique which is process what considerations have you had about it and then back to case analysis the technique having been employed to make the case analysis easier you see that so that you have an interplay an interplay here between case analysis and technique and the technique you employ depends upon the case analysis that is done so therefore case analysis contains programing it says here is preclear i mean its as its corny as this you see i mean just as plain simple and stupid as this you see here is preclear all right thats case analysis and you thought i was going to say something else didnt you thats case analysis you got case there in front of you see thats case analysis all right now lets do most elementary case analysis you could think of see here he is in front of you all right so case analysis consists then of the existence or presence of pc elementary huh now lets go into the subject of bad indicators ive been teaching you about good indicators now lets go into the subject of bad indicators and lets go in this on very very broad subject just so you get better understanding of it these are not to be well of course you can if you want to list these things as bad indicators because they in essence are the very worst but you dont think of them as bad indicators because theyre all accepted on this planet but hes sitting in body see drag thats about the worst indicator you could have heres thetan thats wearing body so he obviously isnt an ot you get the idea all right bad indicator good indicator well hes there thats good indicator but until weve done little more education on the matter or little more thought on the case and so forth we cant really tell if thats good indicator or bad indicator because he might be not there hardly at all he might have been carted in on stretcher but lets take look at the fact that he is there and the good indicator lets get very elementary here the good indicator is he is there on his own volition he volitioned himself into your presence hes willing to be in your presence he is there you got the idea he is there now thats very good indicator that hes there on his own volition now lets take bad indicator now heres way you go about this see im going to break this down into the most elementary elements you ever heard of see hes there hes there and he doesnt he doesnt look like he wants to be there and he looks like hes going to depart and he looks like hes sad and sorry that he arrived at this point and hes wondering how he got here and you get the idea what is absent here is there on his own volition see thats good indicator see well its there on his own volition thats missing he apparently is not there of his own free will or free choice all right so we see that hes not comfortably there see we see hes not really there there you get the idea so we immediately say then that good indicators missing all right what bad indicator is present well he has to leave in few minutes he actually he actually has an appointment with aunt gertrude at 332 and its now 330 and so forth and really hed like some auditing next month but just now hes pretty tied up these are all bad indicators whats he telling you whats he telling you they all sum up to an unwillingness to be there and the case analysis point simply good indicator gone bad indicator not there on his own volition apparently and the rest of the case analysis then he must be there on somebody elses volition see thats the bad indicator thats the next obvious bad indicator and youll find out thats almost always to be true hes unwilling to be there himself well hes there because you told him to be there hes there because you sales talked him into being there hes there because his aunt agatha thinks hes crazy hes there because of this hes there because of that you get the you get the idea so forth well our first hurdle in auditing has been met and thats on the basis of free choice whats the remedy well the remedy well your technique but your case analysis is finished you see that that ends the case analysis its as elementary as that you see that ends the case analysis well what technique do we employ well now that depends on the level being answered up that depends on the level that depends to very very marked degree on what level the auditor is at and what level the pc is at now lets look at this case analysis consisted of what good indicator that you would expect now understand you would expect this good indicator you expect it and the expectation of this good indicator now please please understand this being in his native state in cleared condition and all that sort of thing would naturally act that way so youre really studying in good indicators what is the natural behavior of being what is his his ability to understand is pretty good now hed know you werent going to chew him up if he thought that he needed few cogwheels adjusted hed be perfectly happy to sit there and adjust them he can recognize somebody wants to help him out he can receive help hes in normally cheerful disposition hes normally fairly optimistic he normally is not in an agitated state but is pretty calm and so forth so youre looking at subject called basic behavior and looking at this subject called basic behavior we dont find basic behavior as it was represented in freudian analysis or as its represented in psyrology which is an animated brain pulsing about we dont find basic behavior of this kind basic behavior whooa in psychoanalysis whooa all due respect to good old papa freud we couldnt do without him but dear old papa freud hehheh he had the idea and that was the current idea of his day it wasnt necessarily his idea i dont think unless you inhibited the living daylights out of an individual he couldnt be happy well lets look at it well he might have looked at it and thought about this that you should uninhibit somebody and talked about this and so on but if that was the case why did he talk about this thing called censor why was this censor necessary well this censor was to take the basic nasty mean naggling critical vicious ornery rotten derogatory slimy sewerbrained thoughts of the individual and keep them from coming into social presence so freud salted everything down with the idea that you had to inhibit the living daylights out of somebody in order to get social presence you show some inhibited goon and ill show you an inhibited presence that compares to i dont know i dont know pretty pretty grim pretty grim presence 11 snarling and sniffing around and nyah and so on and making trouble for everybody and car this is the social behavior in other words what they accomplished there was fundamental error and the fundamental error was not knowing or having any real idea or any decent concept of what native behavior would be what is uninhibited behavior well the world has been crashing along on this crashing lie and that is that inhibited behavior is social behavior and that any uninhibited behavior is antisocial so the criminal is uninhibited so you have to take the criminal and punish him and put him in cell and do this and that to him you have to take the bad boy in school and you have to do this and that to him you have to punish him liberally and if you inhibit him enough you will make social being out of him well ive seen some of the products made that way and theyre not social beings theyre social catastrophes this is superinhibition now if you cant do anything about bad trait you can of course inhibit it but the net result of this is an inhibited being being who cant move cant reach cant communicate to whom nothing is real and who has the affinity of stab everything in the back if nobody was looking and he had chance this is your inhibited being but you can take somebody who has an obvious social quirk you see at parties he inevitably he inevitably will pour his drink on the piano keys it just seems to be something he does see well we can make so much disgrace out of doing this and so forth that he ceases to do it at parties however thetans forward push or forward force in any good direction is actually never lost i was very amused at something that edgar told he had picked up an old pc of his while he was off on vacation and the fellow he wanted to audit him and he wanted some auditing so the guy had an old failed goal of some kind or another way back somewhere so edgar could hear him about the failed goal so he went back and picked up this failed goal and what do you know he got the failures off the goal and the guy did an interesting resurge i think thats interesting isnt it in other words the goal had failed he had an old auditing goal i know not to be so colorblind or something of the sort you see and that thing had failed he hadnt mentioned it or said it in sessions for just ages its failed goal edgar goes back and he takes the suppressions off of this thing and sure enough here the fellow has this urge not to be colorblind now edgar didnt put anything there he took something off in other words thetans forward actions desires and so forth do not fade away they only submerge so we find our fellow remember that man you could learn more about handling men and people if you knew that one thing if you knew that one thing than any other single thing i could actually tell you in breath of equal length is their impulses do not vanish they only submerge you get mutinous army you get mutinous army and you hang the mutineers all right thats great thats great right up to the time they hang you yeah they will too the armys all snapping and popping and everythings going along fine and then they experience little bit of defeat and this old goal will come right up to the surface and they mutiny its very interesting you have to get at the basic causes of the mutiny not suppress the idea of mutiny you would have to eradicate the reasons and causes for the mutiny youd have to find out whod been whipping it up and if they had any real beef you know how the catholic church lost england dont you thats one of the biggest losses of more recent times more modern times only few hundred years ago that was great that was great its old henry the viii old henry the viii and he wanted himself divorce from catherine of aragon suzie was telling all about it this morning at breakfast and i kept telling her i said shes reading book on the subject and it reminded of those times and i kept saying well my wife really shouldnt be associating with such people thats for sure i was shocked at the whole thing anyhow what happened mr pope benedict pius innocent whatever he was at that particular time i think hed already had mutiny from his german troops who were now looting rome and shooting monks or something of the sort in other words he wasnt keeping very good house typical earth leadership and think hed gone and gotten himself captured or something and he was all messed up and henry the viii here was here was all of england which could have done something for him so in typical failure fashion one of his gpms went up not henry the viii but the popes one of his gpms went up into high level of restimulation and when henry the viii says hey pope give divorce from this babe you know or whatever language was used in courts at that time probably thats more polite that one why the pope says well fow wha we got to think our ecclisia oh uh if we hmm hmmhmmhmmhmm what can i get out of this see woffwoffwoffwoffwoff so he sent gouty old fool of cardinal up to hold court with orders that if they granted if the court in england looked like it was going to grant them divorce to henry the viii why then he was immediately to remove the court to rome and they were to continue the hearings in rome and so forth and he went on doodle daddling and monkeying and horsing about and getting place and so forth and he just had himself time the pope did you know and of course he was dealing with an inhibited humanoid called henry the viii and henry henry had very 11 characteristics he might have done great deal for england in some direction but he certainly did hold grudge and you know here he was pope says divorce henry the viii divorce so he fooled around and the court so on it goes on for years and he monkeys around they wont give him what he wants you see finally they more or less gave him what he wanted or he figured it out and they put some penance on him or something of the sort ive forgotten what they did to him its not important and henry the viii bided his time and that old goal im gonna get even with that pope that came right to the fore and we now have separate church of england he showed him you get that the pope really disciplined the living daylights out of him and lost england you got the idea that thetan didnt give up you know now old anne boleyn who still walks around the tower they tell up there with her head tucked underneath her arm she played footsies with henry for about nine years i think thats fascinating played footsies for nine years and kept him waiting and the duke of northumberland or the earl of northumberland or somebody on tenterhooks and she wanted to marry him and she kept giving the king the business and if you note amongst the tower exhibits you note amongst the tower exhibits i think you will find the ax that cut off her ead he married her all right but there was only one reason why he ever beheaded her he just wanted to get even he just never lost that impulse of hostility that she had generated through not being reasonable now you look through history you look through history and youll understand situations youll understand men youll understand people youll understand teenagers an awful lot better if you realize that those impulses never die the person wants to do something he wants to do something to him its perfectly reasonable probably is and he gets crossed up and somebody does something unusually or arduously complicated about it you see and inhibits him for some fantastic reason or another you are not now talking about criminal impulse were just talking about reasonable human impulse little boy he cant ever ride his bicycle because it hasnt got any new tires tires are all worn out and hes patched them up to point where theyre mostly patches and he has to walk every place and he keeps talking about it and the family isnt poor but he just somehow or another for the good of his soul never does get any tires and hell go on like that it wouldnt take anything that small hed have to be balked not on havingness basis which is mans adjudication hed have to be balked on an ambition basis for instance he wants to take some music lessons or something like that the family wont let him have anything to do with it somehow or another hes going to get even somehow or another hes going to get recompense now you want to know what teenage conduct is and the standard feeling toward the parent which customarily im informed takes place in the teens and rejection of the family on which tomes have been written and which the most learned minds have shown how unlearned they were and the great problem of juvenile delinquency all those things they arise out of this particular level of action it isnt so much the child actually never forgives the parents for certain things youll be amazed how tiny they are sometimes but they tend to mount up and he really never forgives them and you say forgiveness is the answer forgiveness is dropping down another tone to propitiation youve got to get to the source and cause of the matter its got to be brought to the fore auditing does this easily all the time but he just never never measures up to this and actually doesnt have it in the forefront of his mind so in his teens he does revolt against his parents and in his teens he gives kickback and so forth which is rejection now what is that hes just on the verge of being able to fly loose and hes saying all of these things now there is the heart of mans ingratitude theres the secret of leadership and so forth its the recognition of the fact that thetan never really gives up but when you know that when you know that you know more about behavior than were written in all the volumes of the greeks and you know something as an auditor because what are you auditing youre just auditing all the nutty aberrated inhibited times when he never gave up when he postulated something silly when he tried to do something stupid when he wanted to go forward in some direction and couldnt go forward and when he committed overts as matter of fact you can graph i suddenly realized here you could actually graph the where the innocent social goal of the individual dies down inhibited to warped more warped form which then is submerged to below that overts which then is submerged below that to withholds and you could graph that and you could graph that about any tone or ambition why does an individual have gpms why so forth well lets take it in the largest order of magnitude its on that scale there and out of withholds we get unconsciousness and we get unawareness so unawareness is the lowest level of that scale now actually unawareness itself has scale which goes down into actual unconsciousness you see some pc start to boiloff in session or something like that its usually compounded by withhold whether the withhold is actually part of what youre trying to get off the pc in other words hes already put his goal or something on the list or the items already on the list or the assessed thing is already on the list and you keep him listing well actually that thing that he put on the list becomes withhold and he starts boiling off and he gets dopey and he gets drowsy so theres the scale of how goal how goal becomes warped becomes an overt and below that level becomes withhold and below that level becomes unawareness and below that level becomes unconsciousness and below that level becomes humanoid all right so lets look at this boy who has come into your auditing session you thought id gone someplace and forgot what i was talking about didnt you i fooled you comes into your auditing session well whats wrong with this boy whats wrong with this boy whats wrong with this girl whats wrong with this person this being what are the good indicators actually the most the biggest good indicator is the fact that he is there on his own volition and thats the biggest indicator there is because surrounding him man there is nothing but bad indicators well you dont pay any attention to those bad indicators let give you an idea how to handle these things you dont pay any attention to all those bad indicators because you can do something about them and what you are going to do is one by one eradicate them and in any system in which you are using good indicators and bad indicators which is any auditing situation you note the good indicators present and think thats cheerycheery isnt that nice you understand and you can even go so far as congratulating the pc on them thats dandy we like all those thats fine pcs more confident the pc has less ptp you can even remark on them to pc thats fine fortify them validate them three cheers when an auditor doesnt by the way hes not really putting in hope factor what is hope factor hope factor is validating those indicators which those good indicators which are present and that is hope factor you say well you were talking much better in the last few sessions to you know hope factor maybe we can even improve it little bit more you know well youve seen little less pain you say in your head all right little less pain in your head well thats very good now maybe in few more sessions why well be able to handle it little bit further thats hope factor dont you see thats validating the good indicator which is lessening of the somatic or the condition all right the best one then is hes there the next best one is hes getting better now how do you mean getting better well hes restoring the native state hes getting more cheerful he has less problems hes less worried hes less anxious and reverse of all those things which i just described is humanoid you see hes getting better well i dont care what youre treating its getting better which we mean less present and betterness to us is less present all right his bad ankle is getting better all right great thats three cheers were very happy about that what do we mean exactly we dont mean his ankle is less present but we mean hes the badness of the ankle is less present so thats good indicator now how much less present the degree of the goodness of the indicator well its getting better swiftly well thats very good but its still just good indicator it is getting better slowly all right thats not so good but so forth its still good indicator see so we dont bother to grade it particularly its as long now get this as long as we can get lessening of the bad points present we are making progress and that is all we ask for and if you as an auditor never ask for any more than that youre going to know what an auditing win is and youre going to get auditing wins and so forth its been my experience with auditors they will sit and chew away on something endlessly as long as they are bettering the condition which they are attacking they will go on endlessly its when they dont go on that i worry about and that all adds up to the fact it the condition isnt getting any better theyre were not getting lessening of the condition so were because were not getting lessening of the condition we therefore have loses so betterment to us is lessening of bad condition now look at this as new look of auditing look at this as brand new look if all if all you did in an auditing session and you didnt do any more than this was eradicate eradicate points which detracted from the idealness of the session and if that was your total program with the pc you would have some miraculous wins now let state that in another way if you looked over the pc validated the good indicators that were present and then one by one and this is programing with regard to indicators and you have to know this to handle the case at all one by one attack the bad indicators and handle them see validate the good indicators and attack the bad indicators and handle them and restore more good indicators and if you just audited that way you didnt have anything to do with whether or not his lumbosis was better or worse or whether or not you flattened so many processes or added quantitatively up to youve gotten in eighteen dozen hours of auditing none of those none of those none of those things dont judge auditing that way thats quantitative judgment and itll wind you up in the soup its how many good indicators are you restoring now if you looked at auditing that way and you worked in that direction and only in that direction as just picky put well i just say this its like its like making one of these crosspatch quilts they used to knit patch and then they would sew the patch onto another patch and then they would knit another patch and they would sew the patch just endless quilting of one kind or another where they were making each one of the pieces and weaving each one of them and you just took the case and you just took all of the good indicators and recognized those because you see if you dont recognize the good indicators you cant look for any bad indicators and thats for sure recognize those good indicators and then and then look for the bad indicators and then instead of taking broad jump at the case and just hoping the good indicators will get better and materialize you carefully took each of the bad indicators that were present and without reducing the good indicators that were already present turn that bad indicator off and turn it into good indicator you understand now ill give you an idea of this if that was all you did in auditing at now im talking of course in auditing at level iv and below if that was all you accomplished in auditing at any level of auditing at level iv or below that was all you accomplished you would be the most successful auditor that anybody ever had anything to do with and that is the secret of it youd just be successful beyond all success this pc is always having present time problems and so forth and this you just go ahead your pcs perfectly cheerful perfectly willing to talk to you got all that handled and so on and you can go on but the pc always has had present time problems boy id just go to bat and id make project just out of this one thing well lets see if we cant reduce the incidence of present time problems in this case not by eradicating each problem as it comes up lets get at the root of the problemism of the case if we possibly can without of course going into vi level vi of course you would get at the problem because thats the whole basis of the case so what you want to do is destimulate the situation lets look this thing over and lets handle it on basis we dont care what this pc is talking about otherwise or doing otherwise and so on lets just get down and lets take this one bad indicator the pc has present time problems between every session lets then not sit there because thats bad indicator well of course these problems are serious enough but what is wrong with this case what is wrong with this case at this particular time the most dominant bad indicator present is the pcs having lots of present time problems between sessions all right lets take that up as project lets roll up our sleeves and lets just work on this how well all right at level i itd be on the matter of discussions the values of problems and what problems do and what they are and how one goes about solving problems lets just have highlevel discussion on the subject of problems and lets go on and on and on and let s ask him about what might be generating the problems in his life and lets just discuss this lets just whip this thing to pieces meanwhile keeping him talking happily and cheerily and so forth to us and all of sudden youre going to get the darnedest resurge in this case now it didnt matter you see whether you did this in week or ten weeks or five minutes it didnt matter how fast this was done that case going to get big gain that case going to get gain thats real to the case hes going to finally sit down and hes going to say you know i dont have any problems in this session he might not make big deal out of it because its negative gain always the disappearance you see thats one of the things thats very interesting you know once you get rid of bad indicator or something wrong with case the test of having gotten rid of it is whether or not the case ever talks about it again if case goes on talking about it then we havent gotten rid of it so weve got negative gain therefore we can conclude our philosophy about the fact that whats wrong with man is his additives his bad additives that is correct because when we delete them he is better so if we delete them and he is better our bad additives are gone and the fellow doesnt even think about the bad additives anymore thats one of the things that sometimes puzzles new auditor hes just gotten rid of all these fellows carbuncles you know and the guy was talking very interestedly about his carbuncles just one session ago but all of sudden they all went and he didnt have any carbuncles now and whats all this about well hows your carbuncles and the pc says what carbuncles oh the carbuncles oh yeah all right well what why do you mention the carbuncles the auditor says well i you know the pc has never never mentioned carbuncles at all pc is now interested in the fact that hes having dreams about freight cars and this is his problem negative gain youre always up against this negative gain because the auditor isnt trying to discipline the pc you see hes up against negative gain so if we just took these bad indicators one by one and we sorted them out maintaining the good indicators and taking the bad indicators away wed find more good indicators appearing and boy youd have velocity session theoretically you could build pc up this way to point where he would actually just blow clear on inspection theoretically hed become quite powerhouse all by himself and you know your gains at the lower levels of auditing are all based on that its all based on that theyre not based on plowing the pc in or eradicating something which the pc doesnt have anything to do with theyre based on technically destimulation from level iv down the more you try to run anything out at those levels why the more trouble youre going to be in level iv gets up there are some things you can run out and so forth but at lower levels youre going to run out all of this fellows somethingorothers and so on and youre going to run these out that is project in auditing thats lousy auditing goal were going to get rid of his bad indicators and build up and enhance his good indicators and thats what were going to do now that thats good auditing goal thats good thats good for an auditor to do now look at the things you could tackle and look at the very orderly progress that you could go forward with here number one number one the good indicators and so forth we have spotted and we notice that there is the pcs body is in an uncomfortable sort of state and so forth and we see in little examination of the thing that we have this indicator present the pcs nervous about being audited well thats blunt enough indicator isnt it its bad indicator pcs nervous about being audited now let show you just this this chart here id give great deal to have myself three or four months to sit down and get lot of material together and so forth im having quite time of it here im faced with fantastic quantities of research compilation and developments and getting just recording material and getting stuff down and its gotten just little bit overwhumped and id im trying to get around to giving you all the bad indicators and i must apologize for not having these things in complete scale form but ill give you the form in which they are in all right heres bad indicator number one pc nervous about being audited this is bad indicator number one see all right level 0 at level 0 you can explain scientology and what auditing is to the pc and see if the pc is there of his own volition and try to get him to come there of his own volition see in other words get him to decide not come there under protest level i of course all later levels have the earlier level in there too level i we reassure the pc that auditing is not an effort to make him guilty or accusation of insanity or something of that sort to make the able more able we get other peoples ideas opinions and so forth of treatment and what it might do to him on an intellectual basis try to cope with his various protests his auditings his selfdeterminism with regard to being audited in other words discussion of his being audited is really what this amounts to at level i but we assume as i just told you moment ago we assume that well hes not there on his own determinism hes there on yours or hes leery of this thing and so forth hes got to make up his mind individually to have goal not to be audited not to be forced to have an audit because he wont get anyplace weve had we had somebody around here for long time that just had had was there because somebody else wanted him to be there and so forth it goes this helly you see if an organization suddenly says to some poor staff member who has just found the most beautiful girl he has ever seen and so forth and hes making time here and all of this looks beautiful in the future and all of sudden the association secretary points long and accusative finger at him and says you are going to go get trained at saint hill and he suddenly sees hes there for year and his girl is going to run off with another man he knows whats going to happen and so forth and he doesnt want to go and he gets here and you know he cant really study and he cant really make case progress and he cant do anything else why well number one here is being violated the pc is not there under his own volition you can also say the student isnt there under his own volition the student or the pc isnt there under his own volition thats why by the way i was going to get out policy letter on this and i will and lets make policy right now if you dont have if you cant get somebody to be audited or trained on his own volition dont audit or train them and boy youre going to youre going to get rid of all your loses right there youll get rid of them before they begin and id like course administrator down here if somebody shows up to go over this rather rather strenuously with them if theyre here because they want to be here or if theyre here because somebody sent them or are they here for some other reason than to be trained or audited and somebody ought to take this up with them rather strenuously and if they are such thing as an organization personnel and we find out that well they were sent by the continental director and they really didnt want to come very bad but they were ordered here now the point is do we do anything to alter the situation by furnishing auditing or do we teach that organization particularly lesson by simply just putting the person back on plane and sending them back and i think the last answer is the right one because they had right to ship this person here under his own duress because he wont make any case progress and he wont make any class level progress or anything we know this see we know this weve got the records to prove it any time anybody was ordered to saint hill that didnt want to come or already thought this or already thought that it didnt matter who that person is now nattering around and any little rumor you hear about saint hill from jack was telling the other day he said you know i hear these rumors about saint hill all bad and so forth and everything is so tough and everything is so awful and so forth and he said its all its all come here and find well ordered well scheduled well conducted course and so forth and very helpful and so on part of this seems to be true at all now whered he get what was the source of those rumors well they must have been people the very few people its very few handful you see the bulk of the students here that are here under their own volition believe theyre climbing over hedges to get to saint hill but because this is so general and because everybody supposes everybody would want to go to saint hill and anybody ordering to go to saint hill never thinks twice this person might not want to this person might have some bad withholds or something hed be afraid id find out about or something like that and just feel awful at the idea of going to saint hill its terrible you know and come here and practically get sick and collapse and everything else you know all kinds of reasons back of this sort of thing the stunt here would be to better this bad indicator well audited under his own volition and as subhead of that is pc nervous about being audited see thats your bad indicator and your bad indicator leads you immediately to suppose that the pc is not there under his own volition see thats the conclusion and the level 0 of course all he can do is explain scientology and what it is to the pc and get him to make up his mind sell him little but we cant do very much about it but we could do something and at least find out who wanted him to have auditing and then at level i well as ive already given you reassure the pc and so forth and level ii level ii well level ii oh we can run such well lets get real corny ill show you how corny this could be just figure out some repetitive process at level ii of what have you had to do that you didnt want to do or what orders have you had to follow about your health see we could just dream one up that would fit the case all of sudden it turns out this fellows been in the army and he was always being sent down for inspections of some kind or another it was all very embarrassing and it was this and that and hes got auditing tied in you see with nonvolitional responses he didnt choose to be there so we straighten this up and at that level of course we can run general ow we could run general ow also as an action just general ow and we could get in such thing and well level iii level iii wed pull some missed withholds of course for person being audited on level iii hes been over the jumps but we could pull missed withholds about this and we could choose suitable subject on auditing or treatment or on past auditing or on auditing goals or on past auditing goals or some such subject like that and prepcheck it in other words this would tend to straighten out all of this and wed peel lot of idea about being audited under protest and being forced to be audited and so forth such as on being forced to be audited has anything been suppressed there you get the idea you see if you found this was really the case also at level iii why you could run what was formerly r2h or run 3h just arc breaks in general or something like this persons had arc breaks or remedy it by the early levels you might find out after while that somebodys missed this you know person came into scientology in order to make their husband guilty well theyve forgotten it thats whats the joke theyve forgotten it they wonder why they dont make any case progress and they waffwaffwaffwaffwawaffwaffwaff see youve got trouble trouble trouble what is all this trouble coming from its coming from their basic ideas about being audited and they never wanted to be audited and they never wanted this and they never wanted that and they sort of drifted along well harry would have left if i hadnt agreed to take the hpa course and heres one of our poor instructors down here beating their brains out trying to get this person to sit up straight in an auditing chair they cant do it you sit them up rag doll they fall off the side of the chair you know i mean cant confront cant run tr 0 just this somehow or another its all kind of missing somehow or another all right some smart auditor looks at this idea the pcs always late for his session hmmhuhuhuhuhuhuhu bad indicator and during session the pc seems to be nervous and so bad indicator whats missing here is calm pc on time for session see those are good indicators so those are missing look for this other one pc nervous and hes only late so forth wahdeda deda deda deda all right somewhere along the line here weve got audited not on own volition weve got in scientology not on own volition and so forth were going to plow into that man were going to straighten that up we give you the idea up here at level iii youd be using this kind of remedy dont you see ive just given them to you and we get over here at level iv oh my god level iv we just got the book open because we can find out how auditing being audited would make somebody or refusing to be audited would make somebody wrong and would make themselves right and weve got all the kinds of service fac stuff here and weve got assess for arc breaks with auditors practitioners and arc breaks with life or arc breaks with various processes that the persons been run on dont you see and we locate and indicate the bypassed charge on it and we run routine arc break assessments for the sessions and theyve had you know that kind of thing we just keep putting it together here but of course weve got all these earlier remedies and we that still goes back to possibility of audited under volition we if we found at by the time they got to level iv if we just found one session which they were audited and they were had withhold during the whole session they sure as hell didnt want to be audited during that session well get that and what do you know were going to get little resurge in that particular case because this is very key point very very key point all right so we straighten it up now lets take another lets take another bad indicator high generality bad indicator and we get pc unfriendly to auditor well that has varying degrees hes critical of the auditor or just cool and unappreciative now how many unappreciative pcs do you know well thats bad indicator all right so obviously the good indicator must be that the pc is friendly to the auditor and appreciative of what the auditors doing all right the bad in well thats not there look for the bad indicator and you all of sudden find the pcs kind of critical of this auditor and hes very cool about things and the pc is the pc the pc is perfectly cool calm and collected but never even says thank you for session now what do you think about that now how many of your pcs here and there have never done this all right thats bad indicator bad indicator now whats this mean whats this mean well were opening the door of course on the whole phenomena the whole vast phenomena of withholds overts communication cuts itsa cuts now cut itsa can be cut by the pc having withhold which prevents him from itsaing hes got the withhold the auditor doesnt have anything to do with it dont you see but the pc will be unfriendly to the auditor now how does the auditor get this how does he get this straightened out and thats the whole subject of how to get by this fantastic inhibited swirling howling mess of inhibitions and still string communication line how do you do it well sometimes its very tricky but if you just did that if you just worked on that get the pc to be friendly to the auditor well how would we do this wed run various processes wed handle it in various ways wed say well in general in life this pc well i mean we can defeat ourselves we say in general life this pcs pretty cool this pcs pretty cool this pc is not very friendly to people this pc is detached and so forth well to thatd just be challenge itd be challenge auditing can overcome that auditing consists basically of picking up the postulates incepts considerations ideas which the individual has had and the problems which the individual has faced or confronted and lower levels of auditing you usually address to just the one lifetime dont you get too specialized on solutions and so you never its true that solution gives you the tone arm action but if you totally ignore the pcs wish to talk about problems why youre not going to get more itsa one of the reasons why you run out of itsa is because you specialize in solutions and ignore problems and youve got to sometimes sacrifice some tone arm action and get the whamwhamwham in on the subject of what problems have you had fellow in order to get something to itsa remember this actually if you spent fifty percent of your time on itsaing solutions and fifty percent of your time on itsaing about the problems the individual has had your case would stay in balance and youd be stacking up tone arm action for the future even though it was cutting bit of tone arm action at present this is something that im sure youre hearing with great happiness right now because youre been little bit afraid to attack problems well ill sure never be afraid to attack problems im liable to go right on down the track and find some basic problem the pc has had and i dont care if i was sitting there for fifteen minutes with the tone arm not moving when i do bit the jackpot im going to get motion and im going to get motion in that tone arm and then the pcs yip yip yip on the subject of the solutions and what hes done about that and so forth thats going to more than make up for that lost time one of your reasons why your pc runs out of fat and you havent got tone arm action on him anymore is you really dont encourage him to dig up problems that he has in the past had to solve its fiftyfifty proposition the reason for that is of course at level vi you will find that fifty percent of the ris are oppterms and fifty percent are terminals and they give you an equal amount of ta action actually in running out and oppterms consist nothing of nothing in the world but stated problems and terminals consist of nothing in the world but solutions to those problems the fixed solution to the fixed problem so youve got the oppterm as the fixed problem youve got the terminal as the fixed solution so you see that if you could get somebody to state the real problem you would get as much tone arm action you see as youd get if he gave you the fixed solution see its all in the cards that itd be that way at an upper level but if you start working this too hard you move him back into bis gpms all right well you so therefore you handle problems little less heavily than you would ordinarily and you dont try to search arduously for problems in the pc but you dont start specializing hundred percent you really want to spin some pc just audit nothing but problems the pc talks about problems and just audit nothing but problems and ask the pc about now have you got any more problems uh oh yeah well thats pretty bad problem that one is and so forth and problems problems problems hundred percent about problem youre going to bog the pc similarly however youll bog the pc if you only talk about solutions without having any problems because of course the pc is going to become an unfriendly to the auditor if the auditor never gives him anything to talk about and the pcs basic interest is in some problem he has had or has do you see so youve got to give the pc something to talk about otherwise the pc cant itsa at all and you might find that the unfriendliness to the auditor is the fact just basically just the fact that the auditor makes the pcs case missed withhold makes the pcs problems missed withhold because the auditor will work for too long period of time stressing some particular point in pcs life and not let the pc branch off sideways into the ramification of other problems which have accumulated around that particular point but thats problem of just cut itsa were talking however in this bad indicator the pcs unfriendly to the auditor all right heh your zero trick would be to get the pc to explain the damage the auditor might do to him or her thats about as far as you could go on the 0 level what damage and so forth and the pc of course thats lousy solution by the way because the pc of course is going to add up bunch of critical overts and so forth in the thing but it is better than nothing and it will do something now if i could get somebody to explain why he shouldnt be audited you see thats the same question just tell why you shouldnt be audited i will get the fellow finally into very very friendly discourse ill finally get the guy into session so this is actually not necessarily the lowestlevel solution this is merely the crudest solution but its workable solution youve got old grandma shes sitting over there with her ear trumpet and shes saying this stuff scientology ever since george and charles got into scientology and so forth and sososo and nyahnyahnyahnyahnyahnyahnyahnyahnyahnyahnyahnyahnyahnyah nyah and we know that this is going to be mess man because weve got an unauditable person well we choose this pc as an auditor right away the pc is being audited not at her power of choice weve already broke the back of that one so weve got an uphill climb here man so we could kill the two birds with one pc on the basis of saying well just explain explain to why why you shouldnt be audited oh poohpooh nonsense uhho wa and so forth yipyipyipyip yip and the next thing you know she would be sitting there telling us well actually i have small pain in the back of my shoulder that i wish somebody would do something about of course you probably couldnt do anything about it but i wish somebody would do something about so forth this is one of the oldest tricks i ever saw i heard over the intercoms listen systems used in central organization one time in washington staff auditor back in those days giving the business to sea cook who had dropped in who was pretty drunk most of the time and he was clearing help and boy this guy just couldnt answer the question couldnt do anything he was actually upgrading this he should have started at lower level but he actually walked it in on the subject of help and i think at the end of one hour i think at the end of about an hour the fellow finally found way he could help the auditor he finally found it he got very expansive on this particular thing and really started to get very friendly and go into communication i could go out and find bottle i could find couple of boys out on the waterfront see and he could really help him by doing that and so on have have good time he really could help him and yeah he could help him and he started in and the next thing you know they were he just felt very friendly to the auditor and everything else wildest demonstration of something or other i ever heard of he was just remedying this one point the guy didnt want to talk to the auditor he didnt want to be audited either all right so dont sneer at your lowerlevel remedy your next level there of course i you could get the pc to explain any trouble hes gotten into by imparting confidences or talking too freely thats pretty pretty clever most anybody who is who is unfriendly to the auditor and so forth is afraid of talking thats sure because its all based on missed withholds of one kind or another but lets get him into this and of course that gets off few missed withholds get the pc to explain any trouble hes gotten into by imparting confidences or talking too freely now it gets the pc to give you long expositions at level i on the subject of the dangers of free communication and youre going to get yourself some interesting stuff this im giving you is grassroots stuff this is cold out of the out of the basic dregs of human relationships these things have worked these are the last tools in the kit ordinarily and therefore they are put at those particular levels there are lot of other such tools but those things have been very good and at level ii youd get what would you be willing to talk to about which is standard remedy or similar processes and dont get hung up on that as the only process use your wits and imagination youre trying to get the guy to asis various reasons he wont talk to you and run them out and so forth so youve got lot of processes there that you can use at that level and b level ii b would be general ow on auditing or auditors or general ow on auditor or auditors that would be the not auditing but auditors youll find youll find lot of stuff there man youll find lot of stuff you can really dig up lot of stuff now number three level iii of course youre getting into more high school actions you could pull missed withholds about auditors or auditors what withholds have auditors missed and that sort of thing and you could prepcheck auditors or practitioners and help or failed help as indicated see you could prepcheck in other words help or failed help see and youre getting into this auditorpreclear relationship thats all the thing youre trying to improve and then of course at level vi and so on why you start pulling the cork on the subject of help failed help on sort of service facsimile basis and so forth now if you were really helped by auditing if you were really helped by auditing and so forth if you were really helped by auditing how would that make you wrong interesting question and if you werent helped by auditing at all how would that make you right now the better question of course is how would you be made right by not being helped by auditing but thats quite of course quite accusative but youve got that and all the lower remedies now of course levels v vi vii we naturally use these lowerlevel remedies and they have their own bad indicator systems and we consider the individual is far above being unauditable and having such problems and as result why you find nearly all these problems occur at levels v vi and vii these problems occur you know unfriendly to the auditor and nervous about auditing and that sort of thing but they stem from the root stuff of the mind and the thing youve got to do is straighten out the track wheres the missed gpm you know wheres the missed items whats happened here wheres the bypassed charge whats thats that sort of thing now im just giving you some ideas here youll eventually get this stuff in the form of bulletins and so forth with scales and so forth providing i ever get myself squared around here to point where i can get you out the scale i dont know if you realize the level of precision thats required i worked for some little time to give you just the assembly of stuff on just those two points and so on it isnt that it took long actually to do it but it takes time to do and i like to give them with some precision now lets take up another bad indicator the pc nervous about being audited in selected auditing room in the selected auditing room the pcs nervous about being audited in that well thats the auditing environment now weve got the subject of auditing look how elementary were getting see back to 1955 the subject of auditing the subject of auditor the subject of auditing room and the good indicators are present when these things are accepted and cheerful and all that stuff and the bad indic and you when those arent present then you look for the bad indicators and youll find out that they run down to and get this these things always run down to magnitudinous present time problem of some kind or another which you could handle these things always get into that or they get into some horrendous arc break on the subject and you clear those things up youve done lot for pc dont think you havent now im not going to give you all the levels about the auditing room theyre quite obvious when you get up to level ii youre starting to your first levels are environment and havingness is level iii and discussions of the dangers of the environment at level 0 and thats of course where level 0 lives the dangers of the environment so if pcs nervous about the auditing room why the dangers of the environment you find mostly it solves on that one spot well its all right but the room were in somebody might bust in any minute and im in the middle of comm lag and startle out of my wits well all right dangers of the environment and number one why dangerous environments that as subject is perfectly all right the trouble hes trouble hes had in auditing rooms and in practitioners rooms and all of that sort of thing and let him get some of his solutions off on the subject of how he has gone about solving it as i said level iii level iii youre level ii iii youre in clover youre getting up into your havingness levels and at level iv well you the roofs the limit youve got discussions of associative restimulators you will see in there eventually finding things that are not restimulative things that are safe of course that is quite runnable quite runnable down at level ii its perfectly allowable process so that one deadeasy what im trying to give you an idea of here im not trying to give you all the textual material because the textual material of this for heaven sakes is staggering i mean the amount of crossreference and coding which you get into for all of these levels for all auditing bad indicators is quite interesting and whats horrifying to is just the amount of work i have to do on it and the amount of accuracy it has to have and what should be horrifying to you is if i didnt do that very neatly because youre going to have to know them all i should have it written up very neatly indeed it ought to be put together very well the point im trying to make with you is the organization of this sort of thing the handling of this kind of thing now if you if you want mental exercise and you know you know actually id far better that you sat down and extrapolated it for the good of your own hey what do you know for the good of your own immortal soul thats pretty good heh by the way where are you keeping it these days the id much rather you sort of dreamed it up and worked over these things and if i had enough time and you had enough time in the matter i probably wouldnt train you any other way on any other level im trying to give you the woof and the warp the put together of this kind of action and the handling of it and id like to give you now an exercise like to give you an exercise now i dont want your papers on this or anything of this sort but i think it might be good for your immortal soul i think thats probably an item that one of the earlier saints had or something he probably had an item called immortal soul that burned holes in the back of his neck or something like this i think you should write down list of the bad indicators which would be present at your own level auditing or any lower level dont bother too much about the level organization of it but just go ahead on basis of dreaming up all the bad indicators that could be present if homo sapiens were shoved into and now get that advisedly homo sapiens were shoved into your auditing room i said shoved in and all the bad indicators that would be present and what you might be able to do about these things because one of your troubles as an auditor is the trouble any auditor gets into he hasnt every time measured up to the bad indicator hes seen the bad indicator he didnt hes too busy coping with something or other to do something effective about it and so he slipped his gears with regard to it he hasnt paid much attention to it hes lost his temper instead or hes done something or other that was totally ineffective and youve seen situations like arc breaks and that sort of thing that you couldnt handle and eventually you get less brave in the subject of these but do you know that it is well well within your control i mean that well within your control to be able to take somebody who was dragged into your room at the other end of chain and eventually have him decide with the greatest cheeriness in the world that was just exactly where he wanted to be not because you overwhelmed him but by picking up his various considerations oh it might take you might take you months of momentary meetings with this character and so forth but its well within your power to turn him into highflying pc i dont care how he was dragged in thats interesting its an interesting challenge and its all on the basis of seeing that good indicator is missing and then looking for the bad indicator and i dont care how many dozens of bad indicators were present then selecting and heres the key of it see heres whats going to give you wins then selecting the one which is most in the road of auditing and using that as criteria selecting it one by one eradicating those bad indicators each time using as your criteria the bad indicator that you choose it because it is most in the road of your auditing always choose that that way you can make out list on this one pc let us say of sixty bad indicators oh its horrendous and overpowering list see long now remember the key is handle those bad indicators thats auditing the pc in front of you handle those bad indicators one at time and how do you find which one to handle first its the one which is most in the road of your auditing and now how do you choose the second one youre going to handle it is the one which is now most in the road of the auditing and what happens if some other one suddenly moves in during session and gets in the road of your auditing so that you have to handle that too well thats your problem ill not give you any fixed formula for that but it will only occur because youve done lousy job of basic auditing i dont think i ought to give you solution to it you just go on plugging with good job of basic auditing using technology adapted to the remedy of that bad indicator and converting it into good indicator that youre working on its just its like this well mr smith i saw mary sue handle mad woman one time it was just fantastic woman was throttling her and howling and so forth and actually i dont think that there was very much auditing connected with it and so on but just one bad indicator the person couldnt keep in mind who the auditor was kept losing track of the auditor and the auditor would give an auditing command about something about the environment and then the pc would lose track of who the auditor was and the auditor would say who am i and the pc would say oh youre youre uh aunt agatha or something oh of course i know who you are of course i know who you are youre mrs hubbard and so forth and it was all very fine and you know that pc came through psychosis which had prevented the pc from ever going near her husband or living in the country where he had to work and she left for the country shortly afterwards and so forth so dont think that clearing up one of these auditing points you see is light result it isnt i ought to get mary sue to tell you get mary sue to tell you that story sometime or another because she tells stories very very well and its really howl but that was just this one thing just this one thing is identification of the auditor and it straightened out psychosis so dont think that you need wild numbers of techniques at lower levels you dont all you need is to be able to recognize good indicators and when theyre not present recognize the bad indicator thats present and then go ahead and handle the bad indicator convert the bad indicator into good indicator take your next bad indicator handle that convert it into good indicator maintaining at the same time all the good indicators that were already present of course its kind of tricky it takes some experience and so forth boy youd have pcs flying if you did that youd just have them flying what ive given you here is system by which this is worked and evolved much more than tremendous quantities of data concerning it but the organizations of the system is simply that there are many bad indicators many bad indicators and bad indicators are bad indicators until you get up to levels v and vi they are merely handled differently the indicator doesnt change much the indicators are there but when you get to levels v and vi you of course get other bad indicators of lighter nature which can block off and prevent other indicators from happening which are not present at these lower levels but you can have some wonderful wonderful success with cases working on what i have been telling you and remembering as you work that matter how light it is or how modern or how much in this lifetime it is this person at sometime or another has had social idea which became thwarted and if you can trace those things back matter how you are working the case if your auditing is directed mainly in that particular direction is eradicating these wild offbeat ideas thrusts and impulses of the individual in other words the motivations back of his overts your original times when he decided this or that about something or other by george youre gonna youre gonna have pcs that really fly and then of course you get up the upper levels you can run out the gpms of course and things that made him have those impulses in the first place all right ive shorted you up little bit here tonight i overtalked it by five minutes i was five minutes late so you can be five minutes late for your sessions okay thank you very much good night
