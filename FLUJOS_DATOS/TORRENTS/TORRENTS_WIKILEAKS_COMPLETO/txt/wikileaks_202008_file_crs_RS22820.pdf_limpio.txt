sovereignty at the millennium 96 colum l rev 809 872 1996limited in view of the tribes status as domestic dependent nations3 and is subject to the near plenary power of congress4 one aspect of inherent tribal sovereignty that remains largely intact is the power to regulate the internal affairs of the tribe that occur within the boundaries of the reservation and in some limited situations ma tters that directly affect tr ibal members outside of the reservation5 tribes civil jurisdiction over its members is product of this inherent sovereignty however even though the federa l government does not delegate jurisdiction to tribes through statutes or treaties federa l judicial decisions do impose some restrictions on the scope of tribal jurisdiction in add ition because inherent tribal sovereignty is defined by federal decisional law and is not rooted in the constitution congress can also choose to expand or contract tribal jurisdiction through legislation6 in the absence of federal gislation federal court decisi ons define the parameters of tribal jurisdiction the basic framework for tribal civil jurisdiction was established in montana v united states which held that indian tribes could not regulate the activities of nonmembers who are on nonindian fee lands7 located within indian reservations8 montanas original holding only addressed tribes civil regulatory authority over nonmembers but has since been interpreted to limit tribes civil adjudicatory authority as well9 however the court in montana also carved two exceptions to this restriction tribes may assert civil juri sdiction over nonmembers on nonindi an fee lands when 1 the nonmember has entered into consensual rela tionship with the tribe or its members or 2 the nonmembers conduct threatens or has so direct effect on the political integrity the economic security or the h ealth or welfare of the tribe10 any attempt to determine valid exercise of tribal civil jurisdiction begins with an analysis under montana 11 although various factors aff ect the precise scope of the exceptions for example mere showing of consensual relationship between nonmember and either the tribe or tribal memb er is not sufficient to support tribal civilhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22820crs3 12 strate 520 us at 457 determining that even though the nonmember was engaged in subcontract work with the tribe and was thus in consensual relationship with the tribe the tribal member suing the nonmember was not part to the subcontract and thus the lawsuit did not qualify for the consensual relationship excep tion to the

the activities of the nonmember and must have some nexus to the consensual relationship13 in order for there to be possibility of tribal civil jurisdiction the lawsuit must arise fro m the consensual relationship itself14 although the reach of tribal court juri sdiction does not necessarily turn on the ownership status of the land upon which the dispute occurred in most circumstances nonmember ownership of the land is presumptiv ely conclusive of the absence of tribal civil jurisdiction15 plains commerce bank v long family land and cattle co inc facts of the case the long company was an indianowned farming and ranching business incorporated under the laws of south dakota and located within the cheyenne river sioux indian reservation the company had mortgaged its land to plains commerce bank south dakota corporation cated outside of the reservation the company and the bank later entered into loan agreement which provided that the company would deed the mortgaged land to the bank while the bank would cancel the companys prior debt and issue additional loans for use in the companys ranching operations the company was then given two year lease on the property with an option to purchase the loan agreement was negoti ated within the tribes offices under the supervision of tribal and bureau of indian ffairs bia officers but signed in the banks offices offreservation according to the long family who owned the company plains commerce bank had initially offered more favorable purchase terms during the negotiations of the lease agreement but later withdrew the offer citing possible jurisdictional problems posed by the long companys status as an indian owned entity on the reservation furthermore the longs claimed that the bank never provided th promised operating loans and as result the long company c ould not support its ranc hing operation through the winter of 199697 because of the loss of hundreds of livestock during that winter the longs lacked sufficient funds to exercise th eir option to repurchase the land when the longs did not vacate the property plai ns commerce bank initiated state eviction proceedings and asked the cheyenne river sioux tribal court to serve the longs noticehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22820crs4 16 plains commerce bank v long family land cattle co inc 440 f supp 2d 1070 dsd 2006 17 plains commerce bank v long family land cattle

complaint in tribal court alleging an array of claims including discrimination claim plains commerce bank answered that the tribal court lacked jurisdiction and stat ed counterclaim the tribal court found that it had jurisdiction denied the banks motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim and then proceeded to judgment at the conclusion of the tribal court trial the jury was instructed on four of the longs claims br each of contract bad fa ith discrimination and improper use of selfhelp unanimous jury found for the longs on all counts except the selfhelp claim and returned general ve rdict in their favor for 750000 in damages plus interest later supplemental judgment further awarded the longs an option to purchase land they still occupied which would have nullified the banks previous sale of land to nonmembers the bank appealed the judgment to the tribal court of appeals arguing that tribal courts did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate violations of federal discrimination laws the tribal appellate court held that the discrimination claim filed by the longs arose not from federal law but from tribal common law furthermore the tribal appellate court held that the tribal court could exercise jurisd iction over the discrimina tion claim because the bank had consensual relationship with tribal member that implicated the tribes economic security plains commerce bank then filed an acti on in federal district court seeking declaration that the tribal judgment was not entitled to recognition because the tribal court lacked jurisdiction over the longs discrimination claim16 the district court found that the tribal court did have ju risdiction over plains commer ce bank based on its consensual relationship with the longs and their company the clear nexus between the discrimination claim and the consensual relationship and becau tort claims in general fall under the rubric of the consensual relationship exception eighth circuit the bank then appealed the district court judgment to the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit th eighth circuit focused on whether there was sufficient consensual relationship be tween plains commerce bank and the long company and then whether the suit arose from that consensual relationship17 the eighth circuit concluded that the commercial dealings between plains commerce bank and the long company constituted consensual relationship and that the tribes common law discrimination cause of action was valid means of regulating commercial dealings18 therefore the court concluded that the tr ibe had inherent authority to regulate nonmembers conduct arising out of consen sual relationship through the adjudication of tortious discrimination claimhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22820crs5 19 128 s ct 829

us supreme court for writ of certiorari to review the eighth circuit decision19 the supreme court granted the petition on january 4 200820 on june 25 2008 the supreme court reversed the decision of the eighth circuit21 the court began by citing the proposition that tribal sovereignty lies upon tribal trus t land and on tribal members within the reservation but the court noted tribes generally do not ve such authority over nonindians who come within the tribal borders this general ru thus restricts tribal authority over non member activities taking place on the reservation and is par ticularly strong when the nonmembers activity occurs on land owne d in fee simple by nonindians22 this is true even if the land was at one time tribal once converted into fee simple the tribe loses plenary authority over it therefore the trib loses the authority not only to enjoin the lands sale but also the authority to regulate the use of fee land by way of tribal ordinance or actions in the tribal courts the only two exceptions to this rule are the ones outlined in montana 23 the court concluded however that the montana exceptions apply only to the tribal authority to re gulate activities c onducted on nonindian fee lands and that montana categorically does not permit tribes to re gulate the sale of nonindian fee lands in reciting the history of tribal civil juri sdiction the court noted that tribal civil jurisdiction was recognized in circumstances that involved taxation licensing for hunting and fishing and the sale of merchandise by nonindian to an indian on the reservation24 the court emphasized that the only time it had previously recognized tribal authority to regulate nonmember activity on nonindian f ee land was when it pe rmitted restraints on land use imposed by tribal zoning regulations even then the court noted the regulation was permitted only because of th fee land was isolated in t he heart of closed portion of the reservation25 noting this history the court concluded that because tribes held limited sovereign interests the montana exceptions were meant only to permit tribal oversight of nonmember conduct that would th reaten or intrude on the tribes internal affairs or selfrule26 the court found that this proposition precludes the tribe from regulating the sale of nonindian fee lands because the effect land ownership has on tribes internal affairs and selfrule ends when the land passes from tribal ownership to fee simple status although nonmember conduct on the land may injure the tribes internal affairs and selfru this injury may only be remedied by regulating the nonmember conduct and not by enjoining the sale of such lands to other nonmembers27 in applying this reasoning to the longs discrimination suit the court characterized the suit as means for the tribe to regulate nonindians sale of nonindian fee landhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22820crs6 28 id at 24 29 see montana 450 us at 565566 30 see hicks 533 us at 359360 atkinson trading co 532 us at 660 j souter concurringbecause the discrimination suit would have nullified such sale which montana prohibits tribe from doing the court reversed the eighth circuit decision28 concluding observations the plains commerce bank case has clarified one crucial point tribal government s may not regulate the sale of nonindian fee lands located within the reservation this appears to be per rule because the supreme court in its analysis concluded that such sales categorically do not implicate the legitimate tribal interests that montana exceptions are meant to protect on the other hand the supreme court has left open the possibility that the conduct of nonmembers on nonindian fee lands can still be regulated remaining issue is the precise scope of tribal authority over nonmembers the court may have to address in the future wh ether tribal jurisdiction over nonmember conduct is restricted to taxation or licensing or if tribes civil jurisdiction can also encompass more extensive ove rsight via common law adjudications another issue this case has helped to clarify is the effect that the ownership status of land has upon tribal jurisd iction traditionally it had been understood that ownership status of the land carried great weight29 more recently however there had been signs that the supreme court was placing less emphasis on land status in determining whether there was civil jurisdiction30 this case on the other hand has reaffirmed the important role ownership status plays in determining the br eadth and reach of tribal authority although the court appeared to leave open the possib ility for tribes to re gulate nonmember conduct on nonindian fee lands within their reservati ons it would seem the activities that tribe can regulate are limited to those that have an unusually extraordinary impact on tribal self rule
