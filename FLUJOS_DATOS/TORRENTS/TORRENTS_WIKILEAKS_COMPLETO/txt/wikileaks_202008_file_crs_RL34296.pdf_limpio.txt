promotion as key element in its foreign policy agenda and an instrument for combatting terrorism given unsettled events related to elections in pakistan and kenya and recent landslide election in taiwan for party advocating closer ties with mainland china democracy promotion objectives will continue to be of interest in the american presidential campaigns and in the second session of the 110th congress arguably the lack of clear definition of democracy and comprehensive understanding of its basic elements ma have hampered the formulation of democracy promotion policy and effectiv prioritizing of democracy promotion activities over the years also the lack of definition may have complicated coordination of democracy programs nd the assessment of us government activities and funding further without consensus on democracy definition and goals what criteria will determine when if ever country has attained an acceptable level of democratic re form and longer needs american assistance both the us executive and legisla tive branches of government support democracy promotion in other countries the bush administration has implemented both bilateral and multilateral programs to promote democracy such as the millennium challenge account mca and requested about 15 billion for democracy promotion out of total fore ign affairs budget re quest of 362 billion in fy2008 also the administration identified governing justly and democratically as key objective of its foreign aid policies congress appropriates funds authorizes programs and is responsible for oversight in 2007 congress considered among other democracy promotion bills the advance democracy act of 2007 hr 982 it contains provisions to promote democracy overseas calls for specifi c state department actions and

democracy assistance commission hdac which was established in 2005 the commissi on provides expert advice to fledgling legislatures to date 12 countries ve received assistance from the commission the issue among members of congress presidential hopefuls and in the wider policy community is not whether democracy promotion is worthwhile in general but rather when where and how it is to be applied to get the desired results and the most for the taxpayers dollar in addition co ordination of democracy promotion activities is lacking among developed countries nd within the us government the 110th congress may scrutinize us democracy prom otion in iraq and elsewhere whether or not victory in iraq includes estab lishing an independent democratic iraqi government will be important in evaluating

promotion cornerstone of us foreign policy introduction democracy promotion has been longsta nding element of us foreign policy in recent years however it has become primary component under the george w bush administration efforts to spread fr eedom to iraq and around the world have been viewed as tool to end tyranny nd fight terrorism as the way to promote stability in troubled regions and as m echanism to increase prosperity in poor countries the democracy promotion ideal tinues to be under close scrutiny particularly with recent unse ttled election events in keny and pakistan and with landslide victory in taiwan for the oppositi on party that supports closer ties with mainland china while some observers believe that spreading democracy is key foreign policy priority others argue that democracy promotion is but one of number of us strategic objectives and not nece ssarily the overriding one the issue among members of congress pres idential hopefuls and in the wider foreign policy community may not be whether democracy promotion is worthwhile but rather when where and how to apply it effectively this report provides background inform ation on democracy promotion policy and activities discu sses the difficulties i nvolved in such efforts and presents perspectives on the benefits nd costs of such efforts it also provides information on congressional efforts to assi st other parliaments in mocratizing countries this report will be update d as warranted background on the current debate since world war i when the united states fought to make the world safe for democracy administrations have been in terested to varying degrees in promoting democracy around the world recent presid ents reagan george hw bush and clinton viewed democracy promotion as an important component of their foreign policy efforts more broadly the current bush administration has viewed democracy promotion as an instrument for prom oting peace and combatting terrorism he identified it as central focus to the war on terrorism and national security in his second inauguration address on january 20 2005httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34296crs2 1 the secretary of states

nations security so it is the policy of the united states to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world also in january 2005 dr condoleezza rice before the senate foreign relations committee listed three top prior ities for her administrations diplomacy first we will unite the community of mocracies in building an international system that is based on shared values and the rule of law second we will strengthen the community of democracies to fight the threats to our common security and alleviate the hopelessness th at feeds terror and third we will spread freedom and democracy throughout the globe that is the mission that president bush has set for america in the world and is the great mission of american diplomacy today1 one of president george w bushs stat ed reasons for starting the war in iraq was to bring democracy to that country we are committed to strategic goal of free iraq that is democratic that can govern itself defend itself and sustain itself2 the bush administration continued to stress democracy promotion as key element in its foreign policy when secretary of stat rice announced her transformational diplomacy plan in ja nuary 2006 the secretarys objective of transformational diplomacy is to work w ith our many partners around the world to build and sustain democratic wellgoverned states that will respond to the needs of their people and conduct themselves res ponsibly in the international system3 this goal was restated in the state department s october 2006 briefing on the secretarys foreign assistance reform increasingly others are voicing opinions about spreading democracy as key component of us foreign policy in recent survey americans weighed in on us democracy promotion efforts in the 2007 poll american voters reacted to various strategies to fight terrorism options included make america energy independent use diplomacy

before congress that recent years of polling among arab populations indicates that even arabs who value freedom and democracy did not want our us assistance in promoting democracy in their country5 lawmakers and presidential candidates will likely address their views on democracy promotion as they debate us foreign policy issues in the coming months some candidates may feel compelled to reject democracy promotion entirely in reaction to the policy of cont roversial president who elevated it to high level of importance in his foreign policy however more important question to be answered may be how to determine whe n where and how democracy promotion should be applied to be most effective defining democracy dating back to about 500 bce democr acies existed in both greece and italy the term democracy comes from the greek words demos the people and craits to rule today democracy is an abstract term that is difficult to define and can have different meanings depending on the speak er and context in the most common understanding democracy generally refers to political system with certain minimum elements effective participation by the people either directly or through representation under constitution respect for human rights and political equality before the law for both minorities and the majority the lack of clear definition of mocracy and comprehensive understanding of its basic elements may have created multiple problems for us policy making according to some arguably the lack of clear definition has hampered the formulation of democracy promotion polic and effective prioritizing of democracy promotion activities over the years also the lack of definition can complicate coordination of democracy programs nd the assessment of us government activities and funding further without consensus on the definition of democracy what criteria will determine when count ry has attained an acceptable level of democratic reform and longer needs

philippe c schmitter and terry lynn karl in an article entitled what democracy is and is not in the global resurgence of democracy by larry diamond and marc f partner baltimore johns hopkins university press 1993 p 45 schmitter and karl add two conditions to the seven minimum conditions for democracy suggested earlier by robert dahl dilemmas of pluralist democracy new haven yale university press 1982 p 11 as cited by whitehead these nine conditions are 1 control of government decisions bout policy is constitutionally vested in public officials 2 elected official s are chosen in frequent and fairly conducted elections in which coercion is comparatively uncommon 3 practically all adults have the right to vote in the election of officials 4 practically all adults have the right to run for elective offices in the government 5 citizens have right to express themselves without the danger of severe punishment on political matters broadly define d 6 citizens have right to seek out alternative sources of information moreover alternative sources of information exist and are protected by law 7 citizens also have the right to form relatively independent associations or organizations including independent political parties and interest groups 8 popularly elected officials must be able to exercise their constitutional power without being subjected to overriding albeit inform opposition from unelected officials 9 the polity must be selfgoverning it must be able to act independently of constraints imposed by some other overarching political system ibid pp 1011 although whitehead pins his definition of democracy on these procedural conditions later in his book he indicates in his immediate discussion of them that they are at once too precise and too incomplete to constitute the entire definition ibid p 11is diffusion of power where group within society is excluded from full participation in political life democracy requires checks and balances within the government among various levels of gove rnment national state and local and between government and society elemen ts such as independent media unions political parties schools and democratic rights for women provide checks on government power over society individual rights such as freedom of speech and worship need to be protected furthermore democratic government must face the check of electable opposition and lead ers must hand over power peacefully6 one scholar laurence whitehead discusses the various academic attempts to define democracy pointing out that the definition has varied over time and among cultures with even subtle differences in british and american understandings of key elements of democracy and arguing that the outer boundaries of the concept of democracy are to significant extent malleable and negotiable7 democracy has some indispensable components wit hout which the concept would be vacuous but these indispensable elements are skeletal and can in any case be arranged in various possible configurations whitehead posits8 he argues that democracy requires the minimal procedur conditions safeguarding free and fair elections freedom of speech and association and the in tegrity of elective office as described by other scholars9 yet he cautions these minimal procedures only establish contingently and for the present period rather coherent and broadbasedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34296crs5 10 ibid p 26 11 ibid p 27 12 freedom house website methodology page at http www freedomhouseorgtemplate cfmpage351ana_page333year2007 13 freedom house website at httpwwwfreedomhouseorgtemplatecfmpage2exposition of the predominant view he notes that the meaning of democracy is likely to remain contested and even to some extent unstable as current processes of democratization unfold10 democratization he thus writes is best understood as complex longterm dynamic and open ended process it consists of progress towards more rulebased more consensual and more participatory type of politics like democracy it necessarily involves combination of fact and value and so contains internal tensions11 lack of generally accepted view of democracy is evident in multilateral organizations such as freedom hous and the community of democracies dedicated to the cause of good govern ance freedom house an independent nongovernmental organizati on ngo founded in the 1940s s upports freedom worldwide rating countries level of freedom rather than defining or measuring democracy freedom house rates countries as free partly free or not free via numerical assessments of countrys political rights and civil liberties political rights enable people to par ticipate freely in the political process including the right to vote freely for dis tinct alternatives in legitimate elections compete for public office join political parties and organizations and elect representatives who have decisive impact on public policies and are accountable to the electorate civil liberties allow for the freedoms of expression and belief associational and organizational rights rule of law and personal autonomy without interference from the state12 freedom house states that it is not nough that country has elections to be considered free it must have competitive multiparty political system universal adult suffrage for all citizens regularly c ontested elections with secret ballots and public access to major political parties according to the freedom house mission statement freedom is possible only in democratic political systems in which the governments are accountable to their own people the rule of law prevails and freedoms of expression associ ation belief and respect for the rights of minorities and women are guaranteed13 the community of democracies consists of over 100 nations that first met in 2000 to form coalition of countries that are committed to promoting and strengthening democracies worldwide this organization does not define democracy but does provide criteria for partic ipation in the community see appendix for its stated criteria congress has demonstrated its concern for the lack of consistent definition for democracy the senate foreign operations appropriation committee report for fy2006 srept 10996hr 3057 stated the committee remains concerned that the state department and

common understanding of democracy programs among united states government agencies the committee defines in the act the promotion of demo cracy to include programs that support good governance human rights independent media and the rule of law and otherwise strengthen the capacity of demo cratic political partie s ngos and citizens to support the development of democratic states institutions and practices that are responsible and account able to citizens15 democracies real or in name only further complicating defining democracy are the various designations for differing types of systems that call them selves democracies while numerous and at times overlapping labels exist typical references among the various terms for limited democracies include electoral mocracies liberal democracies pseudo democracies and semiauthorita rian governments adding confusion to the debate on democracy promotion is whether recipi ents of democracy promotion assistance attain what is judged to be complete or incomplete democratic transition electoral democracy according to larry diamond is civilian constitutional system in which the legislative and chief executive offices are filled through regular competitive multiparty elections with universal suffrage16 electoral process is minimum requirement for government to be referred to as democracy most experts agree however that elections are not enough liberal democracy has all of what an electoral democracy has plus constitution that directs government institutions rule of law and civil liberties equally to all citizens including the state and its agents it also has an independent judiciary that protects liberties freedom house uses this set of requirements to describe its category of free pseudodemocracies nondemocracies and

certain level of freedom or may even appear to hold elec tions conversely however they may be totalitarian regimes rigidly closed governments illiberal democracies have free and fair elections but do not provide civil liberties and political rights to the masses some critics and democracy experts argue that past democracy promotion efforts were focused too heavily on free elections ignoring some of the necessary underpinnings of democracy such as toleran ce for minority views rule of law and freedom of the press why promote democracy when us administrations have encouraged democratic reform they have claimed that benefits for the country its neighbors the united states and the world will result many experts believe that extending democracy can reduce terrorism while encouraging global political stab ility and economic pros perity in its 2006 national strategy for combating terrorism the george w bush administration cites democracy promotion as longter m solution for winning the war on terror18 in contrast others claim that in some instances promoting democracy can be destabilizing factor in country as we ll as its region and have documented backlash to democracy promotion incl uding restrictions on freedom in some countries where democracy promotion has taken place19 the benefits and costs of democracy promotion may vary depending on the circumstances in which the programs are carried out for example co sts could be starkly different if democracy is militarily imposed on country as opposed to the country itself taking the initiative on the other hand some scholars belie ve that democracy promotion can cceed even in seemingly inhospitable environments while whitehead points out the difficulties of achieving democracy he also notes the widespread aspirations for democracy comparative evidence he states is clear that in surprisingly wide range of countries and regions both elite and popular opinion can be energized by the democracy promotion programs of the established powers of the postwar international system the desire to participate can generate democratizing aspirations that extend beyond the boundaries of any single nation and that may drive cumulative longterm change even in the face of intervening disappointmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34296crs8 20 ibid p 267 21 ibid p 268 22 president william j clinton the national security st rategy

therefore been adapted both to the structural realities and to the social expectations of the societies in which th ey have become established21 assessment of perceived benefits common rationale offered by proponent s of democracy promotion including former secretary of state madeleine albright and current secretary of state condoleezza rice is that democracies do not go to war with one another this is sometimes referred to as the democratic peace theory experts point to european countries the united states canada and mexico as presentday examples according to president clintons national security strategy of engagement and enlargement democracies create free market s that offer economic opportunity make for more reliable trading partners and are far less likely to wage war on one another22 some have refined this democracy p eace theory by distinguishing between mature democracies and those in transiti on suggesting that mature democracies do not fight wars with each other but that c ountries transitioning toward democracy are more prone to being attacked because of weak governmental institutions or being aggressive toward others states that made transitions from an autocracy toward early stages of democracy and were i nvolved in hostilities soon after include france in the mid1800s under napoleon iii prussiagermany under bismarck 18701890 chile shortly before the war of the paci fic in 1879 serbias multiparty constitutional monarchy before the balkan wars of the late 20th century and pakistans military guided pseudodemocracy before its wars with india in 1965 and 197123 the george w bush administration sserts that democracy promotion is longterm antidote to terrorism the administrations strategy for winning the war on terror asserts that inequality in political participation and access to wealth resources in country lack of freedom of speech and poor education all breed volatility by promoting basic human righ ts freedoms of speec h religion assembly association and press and by maintaining order within their borders and providing an independent justice system effective democracies can defeat terrorism in the long run according to the bush white house24 another reason given to encourage mocracies although debated by some experts is the belief that democracies promote economic prosperity from thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34296crs9

infrastructure of american democracy promotion the princeton project on nationa l security september 2005 p 1 27 president clinton in his national security strategy for engagement and enlargement said democracy and economic prosperity can ta ke root in struggling society only through local solutions carried out by the society itself 1996 p iiperspective as the rule of law leads to more stable society and as equal economic opportunity for all helps to spur economic activity economic growth particularly of per capita income is likely to follow in addition democracy under this scenario may be more likely to be viewed by othe r countries as good trading partner and by outside investors as more stable environment for investment according to some experts moreover countries that have developed as stable democracies are viewed as being more likely to honor trea ties according to some experts25 potential downsides according to some critics pushing democracy promotion as primary objective of us national security and foreign po licy has reduced suppor t and generated skepticism around the world for democracy promotion activities according to one study the rhetorical conflation by the bush administration and its allies of the war in iraq and democracy promotion has muddied the meaning of the democracy project diminishing support for it at hom and abroad some of those opposed to the invasion of iraq americans and others appear to have been alienated from democracy promotion more generally and this is to be regretted26 while most us democracy promoti on does not involve the military the high military and opportunity cost of some activities currently associated with democracy promotion is criticized by many observers especially when democracy is imposed by outsiders rather than initiated by local citizens27 democracy promotion expenditures compete with domestic spending priorities critics note that using the various tools to promote democracy abroad foreign aid military intervention diplomacy and public diplomacy can be very expensive and may provide little assurance that real longterm gains will be made they add that it involves high probability of sustaining costly longterm nationbuilding programs down the road at some point americans could view the opportunity cost of spending these funds overseas rather than on domestic programs or other

russia against the organizations both foreign and domestic that carry them out in recent years the united states has invested effort and money in democracy promotion in russia eastern europe and the middle east the recent backlash against democratic reform in russia the elections of antiamerican governments in the palestinian territories and the rise to elected office of hezbollah in lebanon have caused some to question the value of us democracy promotion investments while recent usaidcommissioned study concluded that us democracy and governance assistance does have positive effect on

the journal of democracy vol 18 8 january 2007 the authors conclude that certain types of authoritarian regimes those with limited multiparty participation are more likely to democratize than others ie monarchies pure military regimes pure oneparty states and multiparty states with one dominant party determinants of success perfect democracy where all citizens have equal say in their government and where the government is responsive equally to each of its citizens does not exist just as democracies can evolve and grow more democratic so too can they devolve and become abusive corrupt unresponsive and unaccountable to their population moreover populations can become disint erested in working to maintain democracy at what point can country be declared successful democracy achieving success means measures and challenges small number of successful transitions to democracy that began in the 1980s and that have endured pr ovide promise and hope for the success of ongoing and future efforts for example four tran sitions chile the philippines poland and south africa are often cited as full successes33 the first two of which were transitions from authoritarian regimes the third from communist regime and the last from racial apartheid other successful cases are sometimes characterized as democracies still tainted by their state corporativist legacies for instance taiwan and south korea34 these and other perhaps ss longstanding examples for instance mozambique and mali illustrate the variety of circumstances from which democracy can emerge in addition seve ral transitions from conflict have been recently viewed by some experts as demonstrating fair degree of success ie algeria bosnia salvador liberia serbia and sierra leone although interpretations differ dependi ng on the factors emphasized despite the successes democratization has proved to be highly uncertain venture one recent study showed that only 23 of transitions from authoritarian governments over the three decades from 1972 to 2003 resulted in democratic governments while the great majority 77 resulted in another authoritarian regime35 often as in the cases listed bove as demonstrating some success transitions are incomplete and subject to backsliding under adverse political and economic strains indeed there are seve ral countries where backsliding has been notable including russia and countries in central asia december 2007 post election violence in kenya also demonstrates backsliding there is some evidence that democratization across the globe has slowed or stagnated over the past

or from conflict as in bosnia and african nations such as sierra leone and liberia37 the range of us democracy promotion activities and programs also varies greatly from assistance for elections to aid in developing institutions and to funding of civil society groups these types of assistance are discussed below thus far there is little agreement among experts and practitioners on the circumstances in which democracy promotion success may be achieved the appropriate em phasis sequencing and mix of programs to achieve it and the time fra necessary for an endurin g democracy to take

harshly competing interests bitter power struggles and fundamentally conflicting values not to mention gree d stupidity and hatred is downplayed until it asserts itself unwanted at some later stage38 generally postconflict situations are considered more difficult and the success rate is considered lower although even where transitions have been seen as relatively smooth and successful as in

free and fair elections are he ld has given way to range of other conditions that must be met for country to be considered sustainable democracy the idea that elections are sufficient measure of success was discarded as analysts realized that this measure ignores the degree to which multiparty elections even if they are competitive and uncertain in outcome may exclude significant portions of the population from contesting for power or advancing and defending their interests or may leave significant arenas of decision making beyond the control of elected officials39 subsequently two other means to establish democracy have become reco gnized as essential although opinion is divided as to which is the more important one is the promotion of strong democra tic institutions diamond argues that the political institutionalization the establishm ent of capable complex coherent and responsive formal institutions of democracy is the single most important and urgent factor in the consolidation of democracy40 if it is liberal democracy that we have in mind then the political system must also provide for rule of law and rigorously protect the right of individua ls and groups to speak publish assemble demonstrate lobby and organi ze he lists full range of institutions ie political parties legislatures judicial systems local government and the bureaucratic structures of the state more generally41 carothers points to troubled political parties as an ubiquitous institutional deficiency in the global landscape of attempted democratiz ation examines their problem s and suggests new approaches to political party assistance42 democracy assistance efforts may well face wide range of impediments to the establishment of viable institutions however according to carothers those promoting transitions may often encounter entrenched concentrations of political power deeply rooted habits of pa tronage and corruption mutually hostile socioeconomic or ethnic groups i the underlying interests and power relationships that are most often resistant to change43 he suggests that democracy assistance programs will be mo re effective by building the underlying interests and power relationships into the m but warns that effec tive programs require much deeper knowledge about the recipient societ than most aid providers have or want to take the trouble to acquire44httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34296crs14 45 karatnycky making democratization work p 54 46 diamond developing democracy p 233 47 diamond developing democracy p 260 48 diamond developing democracy p 256 49 karatnycky making democratization work p 52the other means to promoting democracy is the creation of vibrant civil society which many argue is the sine qua non for functioning democracy karatnycky views an active and dynamic civil society as the crucial agent in ensuring durable democratic outcome the evidence from dozens of post conflict and postauthoritarian transitions shows that the best way for advanced democracies to increase the chances for successful suppor t of democratic openings is by maximizing the resources devoted to the development of civic nonviolent forces45 in study published in 2002 he cited east timor as case of international intervention where it appears that things are going right with major credit because of the international communitys major investment for independent civil life which bodes well for the future reinforcing his judgment on the importance of civil society is his view that civic empowerment appears to be more significant in determining democratic outcomes than whether or not society suffered wrenching violence although so experts such as carothers and diamond believe that political institutiona lization is more cr itical diamond points to civil society as promoting not only transition to democracy but also its deepening and consolidation once democracy is established46 while in diamonds view civil society does not play the central role initially the more active pluralistic resourceful institutionalized and internally demo cratic civil society is the more likely democracy will be to emerge and endure47 lack of funding is often viewed as the most significant obstacle for the creation of civil society nongovernmental organizations in developing and even middleincome countries many of thes countries including the uppermiddle income countries such as chile and arge ntina where international donors are likely to withdraw support are weak in the social capital and publicspiritedness which enable civil society organizations to rais substantial funds from the private sectors of their own countries according to diamond48 without help from abroad the only recourse for such organizations is to turn to the state for funding which creates its own problems the importance of any one of these three means to democracy is subjective judgment as analysts opini ons can differ and may well va ry by type and even over time in comparative study karatnycky vi ews two countries torn by conflict in the 1980s ie nicaragua and salvador as two success stories which are now relatively stable democracies with competitive multiparty systems49 although he attributes success to strengthening of democratic civil society in nicaragua and to centrist and reform movements in salvador that helped build vibrant civic sectors

that were conducive to the use of elections as vehicles for eventual national reconciliation50 continuing challenges democracy promotion is highly uncertain art in an era of constrained resources the policy and budgetary implications of identifying the most appropriate modes and settings for democracy assistance and the means to success can be profound ev basic concepts are far from settled many analysts for instance view tran sitions from conflict as much greater challenge than the transition from authoritarian regimes while transitions from authoritarian and communist regimes involve creating an entirely new political order and in communist regimes in particul ar new economic or der postconflict transitions involve overcoming bitterly di vided societies and economic devastation many analysts suggest that postconflict settin gs have special needs especially because ethnic loyalties and divisions ma complicate the implementation of peace settlements for instance the danger of holding elections too early in peace process the need to blend them with broader negotiations setting the political rules and the importance of avoiding winne rtakeall scenarios are important considerations in postconflict transitions according to carothers who argues that democracy promotion should be supplemented by other efforts aid providers are also focusing on reconciliation as an essential element of democratization in such situations an element that should be supported by aid efforts that consciously combine democracy and conflic t resolution methodologies51 some analysts suggest that success and difficulties in democracy promotion in postconflict settings can vary by the nature of the conflict however success in such settings tends to be found in situations where the conflict is based on politics rather than on ethnic or religious differences according karatnyc ky who cites salvador and nicaragua as two successes of the former sort52 in addition to the widespread view of ethnic differences as an impediment to democracy building most analysts believe that democracy is more likely to succeed in areas with previous experience in and cultures adapted to democracy it is clear that countries with history of democr acy with desperate economic conditions and powerful internal divisions are having much harder time making democracy work than countries with some pluralistic traditions grow ing economy and cohesive social and cultural makeup according to ca rothers democracy promoters are just beginning to relate democracy aid to th full range of factors bearing on democracy beyond the political institutions and immedi ate problems of political life including economic conditions educationa l levels historical traditi ons and social and cultural

kosovo that led to rela tive success versus somalia haiti and afghanistan not the latters levels of western culture economic development or cultural homogeneity55 nationbuilding is time and resourceconsuming effort the authors contend the united states and its allies have put 25 times more money and 50 times more troops on per cap ita basis into postconflict kosovo than into postconflict afghanistan this higher level of input accounts in significant measure for the higher level of output m easured in the development of democratic institutions and economic growth56 the rand analysts argue that democracy promotion efforts may succeed in spite of specific difficulties the spread of democracy in latin america asia and parts of africa suggests that this form of government is not

promotion rubric encomp asses wide range of policies and activities as noted in the previous sec tion on measuring success experts have yet to carry out the type of comprehensive studies that can reliably establish causeand effect relationship between efforts and outco mes nevertheless there is general sense that some types of situations are rder to influence than others and require considerable debate over the appropriate balance of us interests and risks to the domestic populations in the high costhigh stakes cases the following provides an overview of perceptions of different types of cases and the debate about the circumstances in which assistance is appropriate at the low costlow risk end of the spectrum are programs whose distinctive feature is that assistance is targeted to countries that have already embarked on democratic transitions inde pendently and with strong domestic popular support as in central europe the baltic countries and some countries of latin america asia and africa such assistance has been requested and embraced by the receiving countries most of these countries were committed to mocratic reforms with or without foreign assistance and might have cceeded without it it is difficult to document and quantify the value added of us and other assistance programs however the general belief in donor and recipient countries alike is that democracy promotion activities largely consisting of training and technical assistance have had positive impact at relatively modest cost even where governments havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34296crs24 seemingly retreated from their democratic course as many would argue is the case in russia today such programs are seen as worth the investment and possibly having longerterm positive impact medium costmedium risk efforts include programs to help bring stability and democracy to postconflict societies in which an intrastate conflict has resulted in brokered peace agreement the challenges are often greater and the prospects more uncertain because the populations have only begun process of reconciliation often new systems are being imposed from outside as part of peace settlement without buyin necessarily from all parties these transitions frequently require international enforcement and monitoring with civilian officials and military forces on the ground making such efforts much more costly but with the potential for substantial payoff if they can bring stability to crisis region bolster potential failed states and deny terrorist sanctuaries the road to success may be significantly longer and the outcome much less certai n than where democracy was launched from within under relatively stable circumstance s such efforts have been seen as achieving positive results in countries of the former yugoslavia east timor and elsewhere the debate among policy ma kers has centered on the highcost highrisk high stakes cases ie efforts to foster domestically driven transitions from authoritarian regimes and the imposition of regime change through military intervention experts and policy makers are still wrestling with the challenges of whether and how to promote democracy in authoritarian states that are key allies and of strategic importance to the united states in these cases applying principled approach consistent with our rhetor ic by pressuring governments to ease repression and instituting real democratic reform could unleash forces far worse than what now exists in these countries some believe often authoritarian governments that the united states needs and that need the unite d states especially in the fight against terrorism are unwilling to liberalize and warn that to do so would risk bringing extremist forces to the fore on the ot her hand some argue the failure to oppose regimes viewed as corrupt and ruthless by their own people has been pointed to as one of the major factors impeding us success in the larger battle for hearts and minds especially in the islamic world from which terrorists seek to draw recruits and support the imposition of democracy through military intervention with the ultimate goal of imposing new democratic system is if possible even more problematic regime change through military force has worked in some cases such as grenada in 1983 and panama in 1989 where the go was to restore preexisting constitutional order in mo re recent military interventions in afghanistan and iraq to oust existing despotic regimes the goal of building democracy initially was secondary but later became primary the difficulties of establishing democracy in those cases is reminiscent of other cases of military intervention by the united states and other countries such as somalia banon and

were endorsed in the belief that us security and prospe rity would be furthered by the emergence of stable and prosperous democraci in western europe and japan74 during the cold war this approach was not always followed authoritarian regimes were supported by both congress and the executiv branch for example during certain periods in spain portugal greece and turkey as perceived bulwark against the expansion of communism at the same time congress took strong interest in us policies aimed at fostering liberalization and advancing i ndividual freedom and loosening moscows control in sovietdominated communist countries through the 1950s and 1960s much of this support was rhetorical as containment of soviet power within its existing sphere of influence remained the dominant us strategy75 however by the detente period of the 1970s congress saw real opportun ities for fostering liberalization in eastern europe foll owing the conclusion of the conference on security and

in its agreements with othercountries and regions thereby using its si gnificant economic leve rage to strengthen democracy and human righ ts in other countries 81 one factor widely credited for the relatively smooth and successful democratic transitions of the countries of central and eastern europe is that the associations they sought to ensure their future security and prosperity namely nato

425 congressional participation in the ipu gradually diminished in july 1997 congress through the clerk of the house and secretary of the senate notified the ipu that given the diminished congressional participation the us congress could longer justify the annual us contribution of almost 1 million or 15 of the ipu nnual budget and had decided to reduce its membership status and proposed to make an annual donation of 500000 to s upport the aims of the organizati on the ipu executive committee did not accept the offer so in 1998 congress passed legislation to end us

wall in 1989 and the mocratic transitions that began in poland and hungary many members of the house and senate traveled to central europe to see developments firsthand several members came back with sense that the us congress should do something as body to show solidarity with and to help strengthen democratic parliaments in the region83 in 1990 congress took the unprecedented step of establishing its own program to assist new democracies develop strong legislatures the first congressional initiative to help the new democratic parliaments of central and eastern europe was directed to poland by the us senate senate concurre nt resolution 74 101st congress 1989 established congressional gift of mocracy to poland the program provided computers lib rary materials and training from the us senate to the polish senate with the help of the congressional research service crs library of congress and other support ag encies the second such initiative was launched by the house of

dditional programs of cooperation with the russian and ukrainian legislatures us foreign assistance to developing legislatures at the time of these congressional initiatives there were few us foreign aid programs directed at developing legislative infrastructures congress initiated its parliamentary devel opment efforts in eastern eur ope without any preconceived notion of what was needed the intent was to offer practical assistance without trying to impose american or other models or suggesting specific solutions to given problems the objective was to provide comparative information on how the united states and other countries have approached legislative tasks nd solved particular problems it was understood that west eu ropean parliamentar models were more relevant to many of the new democracies than was the american congressional model particularly with regard to stru ctures and procedures the task force established legislaturetolegislature program on nonpartisan basis the programs provided technical assistance to strengthening parliamentary infrastructure especially the research and information services streamlining work with modern automation and office systems and providing training to members of parliament and staff the programs aimed to help improve the efficiency of the legislatures enhance the professionalism of members and staff and increase transparency and accountability these programs conceived fro m the start as shortterm jump starts for nascent democratic par liaments were completed by the end of 1996 by that time legislative strengthening programs had become major focus and priority of other usaidfunded projects building on the frost task force program the us house of representatives prog ram was judged by outside observers including aid evaluators and recipients of th aid in the assisted parliaments to have played unique and important role in helpin g to strengthen the legislatures of new democracies perhaps most importan tly the program provided the direct involvement of members of congress with mps that was seen as giving recognition and boost to the new legislatures at criti cal time in the recipient parliaments and among the public in those countries there was awareness and appreciation that the us congress was the first legislature to immediately r each out with gesture of support and practical help to the new par liaments the programs were seen as bringing considerable good w ill toward the united states the house democracy assistance commission after hiatus of many years members of the 109th congress launched

hope that this initiative will help the united states generate cons tructive dialogue where communication is needed most with this commission were sending them the expertise of the premier democratic body in the world the united states house of representatives accepting the appointment chairman dreier said that the importance of promoting democracy worldwide is at an alltime high but we know that the real work of democracy begins only after the election central to success of any democracy is functi onal strong independent legislature which can act as check on the executive branch through this commission the house will be able to advise its counterparts in subjects like committee operations oversight constituent relations parliamentary procedure and the establishment of services like the crs and the congressional budget office cbo this effort will be good for america as well spreading g oodwill in countries where it is sorely needed when the 2006 elections brought democr ats into the
