2008 military airlift c17 program background christopher bolkcom and william knight foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the c17 globemaster iii is longrange cargo aircraft operated by the us air force since 1993 to date congress has funded 190 c17s for the air force the c17 program remains key issue as congress evaluates the needs of dods strategic airlift httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22763 force this paper provides program background for the c17 for more detailed analysis of current issues regarding the c17 acquisition see crs report rl34264 strategic airlift modernization analysis of c5 modernization and c17 acquisition issues this report will be updated as events warrant background the boeing c17 globemaster iii is strategic airlift aircraft1 the c17 complements the larger lockheedmartin c5 galaxy in the intertheater airlift role and the lockheed martin c130 hercules in performing intratheater airlift for the department of defense dod c17s can carry some 169000 pounds of outsize or oversized cargo such as an abrams tank or apache helicopters to or from small austere runways the program had difficult time winning congressional support in the late 1970s and c17 development was delayed until initial funding was finally approved in fy1981 by 1982 dod was concerned its airlift shortfall was too urgent to await development of new plane and decided to purchase aircraft readily available for production thus congress approved funds in the fy1983 budget to purchase 50 additional c5b cargo planes and 44 new kc10 extender aerial refueling aircraft to quickly bridge the airlift gap2 because dod wanted to develop the c17 and buy additional c5s congress directed dod to develop comprehensive description of its future acquisition plans the result was the airlift master plan of september 1983 which compared several 1 boeing acquired original c17 manufacturer mcdonnell douglas in 1997 2 based on mcdonnell douglas dc10 airliner the kc10 is capable of carrying 356000 lbs of fuel up to 75 troops and 170000 lbs of cargo kc10s represent approximately 12 of dods organic airlift capability for more information see crs report rl34398 air force air refueling the kcx aircraft acquisition program by christopher bolkcom and william knight crs2 alternatives for modernizing the airlift fleet and concluded that the c17 was the most costeffective performance considerations the air force states that performance characteristics of the c17 are significantly better than those of other cargotransport aircraft the c17 can land on shorter more narrow runways and is more maneuverable on the groundcompared to larger c5s or commercial transport planes such as the boeing 747 these characteristics expand the number of bases that c17s can use and the number of aircraft that can use an airfield simultaneously3 in explaining the november 1995 decision to buy another 80 c17s dod officials cited as critical feature their calculations that eight c17s could land and offload 3852 tons per day in space where only three modified 747s could operate delivering 1754 tons per day dod also expected the c17 to be more costeffective than its competitors based on projected lifecycle costs the c17s performance in the reliability maintainability and availability evaluation exercises of julyaugust 1995 confirmed its supporters expectations about operational capabilities with favorable cost implications in part httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22763 because fewer people are needed to operate and maintain the aircraft as part of the 1993 omnibus agreement between the air force and mcdonnell douglas dod agreed to change certain contract specifications that were causing design and cost problems the most noteworthy of these changes included reducing cruise speed from mach 077 to mach 074 maximum payload from 172200 to 169000 pounds and ferry range from 4600 to 4300 nautical miles ronald fogleman commanding general us transportation command said these changes did not affect critical operational requirements explaining that 3200mile mission with 110000lb payload had been established as goal and that the c17 would meet or exceed this requirement production and schedule the c17 program has experienced noteworthy turbulence as acquisition plans have fluctuated over time the fy1985 budget included 129 million to begin fullscale development of the c17 with plan to produce 210 aircraft the airlift master plan had projected requirement for 210 c17s with 180 in the active fleet and 30 additional aircraft for backup and spares and for testing and evaluation dod was also expected to retain 114 c5s many of which would be turned over to the air force reserve and air national guard by the mid1980s the c17 program appeared on track but somewhat behind schedule production difficulties later contributed to slipped delivery schedules and increased development costs in april 1990 defense secretary dick cheney reduced the program from 210 to 120 production c17s reflecting revised estimates of airlift requirements in view of the collapsed soviet union and domestic budgetary constraints in december 1993 dod agreed to buy another 12 c17s during fy1994fy1995 but defense secretary aspin stated that the contract would end with the 40 aircraft then on order if mcdonnell douglas failed to resolve production and cost problems 3 logisticians use concept known as maximum on ground mog as planning factor to measure the potential flow of various aircraft types through mobility airfield crs3 during that twoyear period in that event dod would buy mix of c17s and modified commercial transport planes or c5 military transports by accepting the 1993 agreement mcdonnell douglas incurred loss of nearly 15 billion on the development phase of the program in addition the company agreed to spend 456 million in process improvements and testing dod agreed to provide an additional 438 million for the program 237 million to settle claims with mcdonnell douglas and 201 million for flight testing in november 1995 with the c17 program back on track dod decided to continue procurement of the c17 for total program of 120 aircraft dod argued that additional airlift capacity was critical and that if c17s were not procured other less capable cargotransport aircraft would be needed to make up the shortfall most members of congress recognized the need for additional airlift although some questioned the need to buy as many as 80 more c17s in january 1996 the defense acquisition board dab approved plans to buy 80 c17s for total of 120 aircraft over sevenyear period fy1997fy2003 in multiyear contract this plan was expected to yield 5 savings of the programs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22763 projected 18 billion cost and was viewed as less expensive in comparison to singleyear buys or multiyear procurement over longer period further dod argued buying c17s in six or seven years would provide the planes sooner and more costeffectively and would avoid expected funding competition with other programs after 2003 critics argued that the longterm contract could entail financial penalties for reducing annual buys if budgetary constraints in future years forced the dod to choose between buying c17s and other aircraft such as f22a raptor on may 31 1996 the air force and mcdonnell douglas now owned by boeing signed 162billion multiyear procurement contract for 80 aircraft to be produced over seven years the first of these 80 aircraft was delivered on august 10 1998 bringing total deliveries to 41 aircraft in late 1998 14 more aircraft were added to planned buy bringing the planned total to 134 c17s by late 2002 the air force had 100 c17s in early 2002 air force officials asked for more c17s john handy commanding general us transportation command said he needed 222 c17s to meet the nations airlift needs representing an increase of at least 42 aircraft over his predecessors estimate4 in april 2001 his predecessor general tony robertson stated that 170 to 180 c17s were needed to meet requirements outlined in dods mobility requirements study 2005 mrs055 in august 2002 boeing was awarded 97 billion contract to produce an additional 60 c17s which would bring dods inventory to 180 this contract was expected to keep the long beach california production line open until 20086 but appropriations conferees added an unrequested 2 billion in fy2007 to purchase an additional 10 c17 aircraft bringing planned production to 190 c17s and 4 harry levins transportation commands chief

c17s to qatar and nato countries the impact of these sales on extending the c17 production line is still unclear operational performance c17s first flew in major contingency in december 1995 when us and allied nations deployed peacekeeping forces to bosnia for operation joint endeavor in the first three months mobility forces flew 3827 missions carried over 18539 troops and delivered more than 45000 short tons of cargo the c17 used to satisfy the armys need for highcapacity shortdistance airlift for peacekeepers equipment and outsize cargo from central europe to bosnia flew over 26 of the missions but delivered more than 44 of the cargo7 on one mission c17 crews reportedly offloaded 165000 lbs of cargo in less than 15 minutes8 gao assessment of the c17s performance during joint endeavor gaonsiad9750 found mission capable rates to be 862 5 higher than required however the gao noted that the c17 was not required to perform many tasks it had previously struggled with during operational testing such as landing at austere airfields on short wet runways performing strategic airdrops of both httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22763 troops and equipment and providing aeromedical evacuation capability the c17s ability to operate from austere airfields in albania and macedonia was demonstrated during operation allied force in marchjune 1999 when c17s achieved 96 missioncapable rate in joint testimony before the senate armed services committee secretary of defense william cohen and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general henry shelton extolled the c17s contributions to the kosovo conflict stating the c17 was the workhouse of the airlift force providing for the rapid deployment of critical warfighting and humanitarian materiel they further testified that throughout operation allied force us forces had to overcome many limitations in transportation infrastructure poor airport surface conditions in tirana albania for example slowed aircraft turnaround times limited throughput and slowed the onward movement of forces and humanitarian supplies our transportation and other logistic assets proved to be flexible effective and efficient in responding to these limitations in particular the c17 made the concept of direct delivery the strategic air movement of cargo from an aerial port of embarkation to an airfield as close as practicable to the final destination reality9 dod stated that the c17s high payload capacity ability to land on short austere airfields and its ground maneuverability were the keys to success during this operation nearly all

was also used extensively for intratheater operations where 12 c17s flew 430 sorties11 in 1999 c17s delivered cargo to peacekeepers in darwin australia who were preparing to quell the ethnic fighting in east timor indonesia also in 1999 c17s from the 437th airlift wing delivered cargo to victims of hurricane mitch in honduras and nicaragua in 2001 they carried federal relief workers and supplies to floodsoaked houston texas12 c17 performance has drawn praise during combat operations in afghanistan for example c17s have flown lengthy missions from germany to afghanistan approximately 26 hours and 10000 miles round trip while also moving supplies from us bases directly to forward operating locations13 in addition c17s conducted humanitarian airdrops beginning on october 7 2001 the first day of the war flying two to four fooddrop flights per day from an altitude of 25000 feet each c17 unloaded about 17000 humanitarian daily rations over afghanistan14 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22763 in iraq air mobility missions accounted for 16740 or 40 of the 41404 sorties excluding sorties by special operations forces and army helicopters and coalition sovereignty flights during the iraqi invasion15
