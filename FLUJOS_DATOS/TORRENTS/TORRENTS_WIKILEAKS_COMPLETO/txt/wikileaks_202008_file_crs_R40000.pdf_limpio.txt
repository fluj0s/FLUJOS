staffed by some 100000 employees usda spending is not synonymous with farm program spending it is responsible for many activities outside of the agriculture budget function usda estimated that its outlays in fy2008 would be 99 billion food and nutrition programs comprise the largest mission area with 60 billion or 61 of the total to support the food stamp program the nutrition program for women infants and children wic and child nutrition programs figure 1

approp riations committee july 200 8 comparing usdas organization and budget data to the agriculture appropriations bill is not always easy usda defines its programs using m ission areas that do not always correspond to categories in the agriculture appropriations bill and spending may not match up between usda summaries and the appropriations bill for other reasons for example foreign agricultural assistance programs are separate title in the appropriations bill title v foreign assistance programs are joined with domestic farm support in usdas farm and foreign agriculture mission area compare figure 1 with figure 2 conversely usda has separate mission areas for agricultural research and marketing and regulatory programs but both are joined with other domestic farm support programs in title i agricultural programs of the appropriations bill conservation in the appropriations bill title ii is for discretionary programs only whereas usdas natural resources mission area includes both discretionary and mandatory conservation programs in addition to the forest service moreover outlays by an agency do not always equal the appropriation or budget authority for example the mandatory outlays of the commodity credit corporation ccc as reported by usda do not necessarily equal the appropriation to the ccc the ccc makes payments outlays to farmers using line of credit with the treasury and the appropriation to ccc replenishes the line of credit to sometimes different level

in addition to the usda agencies mentioned above the agriculture appropriations subcommittees have jurisdiction over appropriations for the food and drug administration fda of the department of health and human services hhs and in the house the commodity futures trading commission cftc an independent financial markets regulatory agency the combined share of fda and cftc funding in the overall agriculture and related agencies appropriations bill is about 2 see title vi in figure 2 jurisdiction over cftc appropriations is assigned differently in the house and senate in the house appropriations jurisdiction for cftc remains with the agriculture appropriations subcommittee in the senate jurisdiction moved to the financial services appropriations subcommittee with the fy2008 appropriations cycle despite the differences in jurisdiction the consolidated appropriations act for fy2008 still put cftc appropriations with the agriculture appropriations bill these agencies are included in the agriculture appropriations bill because of their historical connection to agricultural markets however the number and scope of nonagricultural issues has grown at these agencies in recent decades some may argue that these agencies longer belong in the agriculture appropriations bill but despite the growing importance of nonagricultural issues agriculture and food issues are still an important component of fdas and cftcs work at fda medical and drug issues have grown in relative importance but food safety responsibilities that are shared between usda and fda have been in the media during recent years and are the subject of legislation and hearings at cftc the market for financial futures contracts has grown significantly compared with agricultural futures contracts but volatility in agricultural commodity markets has been subject of recent scrutiny at cftc and in congress

differently in the budget process eligibility for mandatory programs sometimes referred to as entitlement programs is usually written into authorizing laws and any individual or entity that meets the eligibility requirements is entitled to the benefits authorized by the law congress generally controls spending on mandatory programs by setting rules for eligibility benefit formulas and other parameters not through appropriations approximately 80 of the total agriculture and related agencies spending is classified as mandatory which by definition occurs independently of annual appropriations the 2008 farm bill the food conservation and energy act of 2008 pl 110246 determines most of the parameters for mandatory spending in the agriculture appropriations bill the vast majority of usdas mandatory spending is for the food and nutrition programs eg food stamps the farm commodity price and income support programs the federal crop insurance program and various agricultural conservation and trade programs nearly all of figure 1 s largest two pie pieces some mandatory spending such as the farm commodity program is highly variable and driven by program participation rates economic and price conditions and weather patterns but in general mandatory spending has tended to rise over time particularly as food stamp participation and benefits have risen

difference between mandatory and discretionary spending three other terms are important to understanding differences in discussions about the federal spending budget authority outlays and program levels 1 budget authority is how much money congress allows federal agency to commit to spend it represents limit on funding and is generally what congress focuses on in making most budgetary decisions most of the amounts mentioned in this report are budget authority 2 outlays are how much money actually flows out of an agencys account outlays may differ from appropriations budget authority because for example payments on contract may not flow out until later year for accounts that require multiyear contracts for construction or delivery of services budget authority may be committed contracted in one fiscal year and outlays may be spread across several fiscal years but for many accounts especially those tied to salaries and normal operating expenses outlays closely track budget authority 3 program levels reflect the activities supported or undertaken by an agency an agencys program level may be much higher than its budget authority for several reasons user fees support some activities eg food or border inspection the agency makes loans for example large loan authority program level is possible with small budget authority loan subsidy because the loan is expected be repaid the appropriated loan subsidy make allowances for defaults and interest rate assistance transfers are available from other agencies or funds are carried forward from previous fiscal year g3g140g157g146g152g151g561g152g151g561g8g27g344g342g342g351g561g3g153g153g155g152g153g155g146g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 the fy2009 agriculture appropriations bill was marked up in the house

fy2009 consequently nearly 5½ month continuing resolution pl 110329 division was enacted on september 30 2008 to fund the government until march 6 2009 or until separate appropriations bill is enacted the continuing resolution covers the agriculture appropriations bill along with eight other regular appropriations bills only three of the regular 12 appropriations bills were enacted before the beginning of the fiscal year and those were enacted as mini consolidated appropriations bill together with the continuing resolution the continuing resolution generally funds agencies at their fy2008 levels exceptions for agriculture and related agencies programs in the continuing resolution include allowing higher base allocation for fda under the continuing resolution by including in fy2009 funding the 150 million of supplemental emergency funding that was provided in fy2008 in addition to the regular fy2008 appropriation allowing mandatory spending increases for programs in the food and nutrition act of 2008 to maintain program levels an unspecified increase likely in the billions of dollars increasing the discretionary funding for the women infants and children wic nutrition program to an annual rate of 6658 billion up from 602 billion in fy2008 increasing funding for the food and nutrition services commodity assistance program to 234 million up from 210 million in fy2008 and

although the continuing resolution sustains existing programs and allows new mandatory farm bill programs to begin it generally orders conservative funding approach under the cr the office of management and budget omb apport ions funds to agencies by limiting the amount available at certain times of the fiscal year1 the purpose of the sometimes conservative apportionment is to avoid tying the hands of appropriators by agencies already overobligating funds should congress return to session and pass final fy2009 appropriations bill that funds some programs at lower level than fy2008 for example some new conservation programs with mandatory funding but that appropriators or the administration have indicated should not be fully funded as discussed later in the section limits on mandatory program spending may r eceive an omb apportionment but the agency may not be able to spend the money until later quarter in the fiscal year g10g152g158g156g142g561g3g140g157g146g152g151g561

appropriations process since the authorizing committees set the eligibility rules nd payment formulas in authorizing legislation funding for mandatory programs is usually assumed to be available based on the authorization without appropriations action when the appropriators limit mandatory spending they do not change the authorizing law rather appropriators have put limits on mandatory programs by

fy2009 reductions are from new or continuing mandatory programs in the enacted 2008 farm bill pl 110246 passage of the new farm bill has made available many mandatory programs that appropriators or the administration may propose to reduce because of either policy preferences or jurisdictional issues between authorizers and appropriators the administration initially had proposed 314 million in mandatory reductions from three programs all in conservation2 but requested additional reductions in supplemental budget request after the 2008 farm bill was enacted3 limits on mandatory programs in the proposed fy2009 bill 641 million table 4 are larger than the reductions in the fy2008 appropriations act 335 million from two programs4 and those proposed for fy20075 but not as large as those during the height of the 2002 farm bill period 15 billion in fy2006 since appropriators had garnered reputation for limiting various mandatory programs in the 2002 farm bill authorizers in the agriculture committees chose to reduce or eliminate those programs when savings needed to be scored during budget reconciliation in 2005 thus as the 2002 farm bill ended relatively little authorization was left among the mandatory programs that the appropriators had limited from fy2003 to fy2006 therefore passage of the 2008 farm billwith host of new and reauthorized mandatory conservation research rural development and bioenergy programscreates new possibilities for appropriators to limit mandatory programs under the continuing resolution and because of the reductions recommended in the senate reported bill or the administrations request some of these mandatory programs may be affected 2 the administrations proposed 314 million in reductio ns in mandatory programs

supplemental budget request on august 1 2008 httpwwwwhitehousegovombbudget amendmentsamendment_8_1_08pdf released following the enactment of the 2008 farm bill included additional reductions in

for inflation remained essentially flat in the period from fy 1972 through fy1991 from fy1992 through fy2000 the mission area experienced 25 increase in deflated dollars over the previous two decades as federal budget surplus allowed greater spending for all nondefense research and development from fy2001 through fy2003 supplemental funds appropriated specifically for antiterrorism activities not basic programs accounted for most of the increases in the usda research budget funding levels since have trended downward to historic levels although the states are required to provide 100 matching funds for research and extension most states have regularly appropriated two to three times that amount fluctuations in statelevel appropriations can have significant effects on state program levels even when federal funding remains stable cuts at either the state or federal level can result in program cuts down to the county level in an effort to find new money to boost the availability of competitive grants in the ree mission area the house and senate agriculture committees have tapped sources of available funds from the mandatory side of usdas budget and elsewhere eg the us treasury

continued the same loan authority as in fy2008 3428 billion the administrations budget request had proposed reducing the amount of guaranteed loans and increasing the amount of direct loans for slight net increase in loan authority the cost of the loan program in terms of appropriated loan subsidy would have decreased in the senatereported bill by 12 million to 147 million this was about 7 million

usdas mandatory agriculture and conservation programs was authorized by the 2008 farm bill pl 110246 for more information see crs report rl34696 the 2008 farm bill major provisions and legislative action by renee johnson et the ccc is wholly owned government corporati on that has the legal authority to borrow up to 30 billion at any one time from the us treasury these borrowed funds finance spending for programs such as farm commodity subsidies and various conservation trade and rural development programs emergency supplemental spending also has been paid from the ccc over the years particularly for ad hoc farm disaster payments for direct market loss payments to growers of various commodities in response to low farm commodity prices and for animal and plant disease eradication efforts although the ccc can borrow from the treasury it eventually must repay the funds it borrows it may earn small amount of money from activities such as buying and selling commodities and receiving interest payments on loans but because the ccc never earns more than it spends its borrowing authority must be replenished periodically through congressional appropriation so that its 30 billion debt limit is not depleted congress generally provides this infusion through the annual usda appropriation law in recent year s the ccc has received current indefinite appropriation which provides such sums as are necessary during the fiscal year mandatory outlays for the commodity programs rise and fall automatically based on economic or weather conditions funding needs are difficult to estimate and more or less of the treasury line of credit may be used year to year similarly the congressional appropriation may not always restore the line of credit to the previous years level for these reasons the appropriation to the ccc may not reflect the outlays of the ccc for the agricultural programs outlays eg payments to farmers in fy2009 will be funded initially through the borrowing authority of the ccc and reimbursed to the treasury through separate and possibly future appropriation

will be 94 billion nearly the same as fy2008 and down from 10 billion in fy 2007 and 20 billion in fy2006 the lower current level of ccc outlays is due to less need for pricetriggered farm commodity subsidies since market prices are higher than government support levels for fy2009 to replenish cccs borrowing authority with the treasury the senatereported bill concurred with the administration request for an indefinite appropriation such sums as necessary for ccc estimated to be 111 billion down 14 from 13 billion in fy2008 with these amounts of outlays and appropriations th ccc would have

additional insurance coverage at subsidized rate policies are sold and completely serviced through approved private insurance companies that have their program losses reinsured by usda and are reimbursed by the government for their administrative and operating expenses the annual agriculture appropriations bill traditionally makes two separate appropriations for the federal crop insurance program it provides discretionary funding for the salaries and expenses of the rma it also provides such sums as are necessary for the federal crop insurance fund which finances all other expenses of the program including premium subsidies indemnity payments and reimbursements to the private insurance companies for the salaries and expenses of the rma the senatereported bill concurred with the administration request for 7718 million which re presented 15 increase over the fy2008 appropriated level of 7605 million as permitted in the fy2008 appropriations act the senate bill also allowed rma to tap up to 11166 million in fy2009 mandatory funds available for crop insurance research and development in orde r to strengthen rmas ability to reduce waste fraud and abuse within the crop insurance program this was in addition to the authority given to rma by the 2008 farm bill pl 110246 to allocate up to 4 million in general crop insurance mandatory funds for combating waste fraud and abuse most of this funding would be used for rmas ongoing data mining activities whereby rma compiles and monitors an annual list of producers who either exhibit high frequency and severity of losses or are suspected of poor farming practices that might contribute to production losses usda estimates that the use of the spotcheck list has prevented between 70 million and 110 million each year in improper payments senate appropriators also concurred with the administration estimate of the need for an fy2009 appropriation of 6583 billion for the federal crop insurance fund although the amount actually required to cover program losses and other subsidies is subject to change based on actual crop losses and farmer participation rates in the program the administrations fy2009 estimate for the fund is significantly higher than the estimated 41 billion in fy2008 much of the difference is explained by an expectation that crop losses will be greater this year than last years record low loss experience and the difference is also partially due to the higher value of crops given higher market prices
