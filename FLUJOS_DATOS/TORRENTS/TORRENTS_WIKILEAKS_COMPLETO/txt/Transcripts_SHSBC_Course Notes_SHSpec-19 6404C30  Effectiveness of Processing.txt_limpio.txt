6404c30 shspec19 effectiveness of processing the australian flap was caused by one pc wern who had psychiatric history and couldnt have passed sec check he got run on level vi material flipped out and went to court the legislature has been investigating upperlevel materials have been appearing in court document has turned up showing collusion and plans for how witnesses should testify the org is ignoring instructions to use the document because of their lawyers advice the lawyer is protecting the government of victoria and cables keep coming through begging for money this has interrupted research it shows what happens when an org goes offpolicy and you cant get orders executed policy has been developed out of past errors when it is ignored errors appear and trouble follows jane kember took two years to put johannesburg back together after they went offpolicy the effectiveness of processing and effective processing is you the auditor bringing about desired effect on the pc that is your one activity this applies also to your activities as an instructor lecturer or just to the way in which you produce an effect on someone you are talking to one can produce an effect through threat of destruction and by destruction that is fifty percent of existence fifty percent of all effects in this universe are produced by force if we study that fifty percent we will find that nearly all mental healing activities drift into it this includes electric shock etc it is the solid form of effect psychiatrists do not realize that they are trying to influence thought they have definition of thought they dont even think that anything is there thinking they are trying to influence matter man to them is matter and they are using matter to influence matter they are actually in the field of physics so an auditor runs danger in operating in the remaining fifty percent producing beneficial effects the danger is that the auditor will leave the other fifty percent on automatic and occasionally drift over into it thus everything may be fine for awhile then the auditor suddenly explodes this may be the mechanism of failed help destroy an auditor in blowing up at pc never has and never will have good effect on the pc who provoked it what cures you of doing that is finding on level vi that you did have it all upside down and backwards and that you did actually skip whole code on the pc ultimately you keep to the auditors code for your own good as an auditor since violating it makes auditing much harder taken at random fifty percent of effects would be destructive fortunately by the laws of life it is the other fifty percent that has lasting benefits eradication has to be 100 percent to be effective purity of destruction would be notthereness but destruction doesnt go in that direction it leaves pile of rubble an asising of situation is not looked on as destruction it is seen as constructive beneficial action actually it is an ultimate in the fifty percentdestruction bracket if you want to free someone you dont just blow up the jail he is in and create shambles so the effect that you are trying to produce on the pc is simply to set him free by asising that which is keeping him caged without knocking him around or leaving rubble around it is actually pretty easy to do the way you would leave rubble around would be by giving advice but not asising anything you have launched an otherdetermined action you have set up conflict between two or more other terminals life could be handled by setting it into more violent countermotions as in war this leaves lots of debris those are the mechanics by which life handles its problems ie countermotions terminals vs terminals etc as an auditor you are being asked to decry and put aside the standard dramatizing actions that life is prone to you are asked to assume better more workable discipline you are asked to find out what the problem is what considerations they have had about the problem and what they have done to solve it we find that these are the building blocks of the prison 1 the problem itself 2 what they have said the problem was or what has caused it 3 solutions they have had that is all the cage is built of 1 conceive the problem was there 2 alteris it 3 keep on solving it there doesnt have to have been problem before someone conceived of it since thetan is always capable of postulating then he justifies it assigns it to someone other than himself and makes that person cause and then starts solving the wrong problem he will submerge the problem the solution now becomes problem to him so he solves that one etc etc eventually all he knows about it is that he is unhappy abstracted and cant concentrate that is the prison that he has built as an auditor your art is in asising these bits and pieces rather than adding to them by giving him new solutions if you give the pc command that would asis some problems and you fail to discover that the pc is doing something other than the command you gave him he wont improve you may then change processes still get improvement and end up mad at the pc you would thereby have slipped over into the other fifty percent of effectproduction the only reason why an auditor would start this cycle would be from failing to understand that he is supposed to be knocking out aberration not letting the pc add to it another deficiency in delivering processing to the pc is where the auditor fails to realize that problem has gone green auditor may not know that things blow by asising just by the pcs inspecting things and communicating them to the auditor there could be too little horsepower in the problem for the pc even to cognite it is so insubstantial there is nothing more to it than its isness be on the lookout for the problems having blown on the comm cycle alone before you have chance to handle it the new auditor may never realize that this asising is what his training in trs comm cycle etc are for ideally you want the pc to blow by inspection remember on the other hand the auditor can get so used to things blowing fast that he gets shock when something doesnt he has run into one of lifes little problems that instead of floating free has roots problems come in two kinds 1 loose problems 2 problems that have roots some things that worry people dont have deep roots then there are fee subjects and items that are just little flags which turn out to be very deeply anchored indeed and which dont blow dont mistake the one for the other if you do you will get overrun or unflat processes r1cm is r1c with the meter follow the bd after you have completed your cycle of action it is mistake to take up something that has flag that goes all the way to china but gets needle reaction or ta bd only clean rise when it is mentioned although it is something that does bother the pc it may be an obvious condition like the pcs wife leaving him or his lumbosis but the more you talk about it the more trouble you have because as you force the pc into recognition of the reality of that condition you pin him to his most fundamental bank the condition will be something the auditor brought up it is an unreal subject to the pc the only cage that the pc can asis is the one that he is aware of you can force the pc into oddball modifications this is where testing deadends because you can read deeper into the psyche than the pc can asis lrh recounts papiermache incident the pcs head may be made of papiermache and this may be very obvious to the auditor but the auditor must not evaluate for the pc the pc cant asis anything that he isnt aware of and if he is not aware that his head is made out of papiermache and if it doesnt read on the meter dont try to handle it if you do you can restimulate the pc without any hope of destimulating him if it reads on the meter it has potential of being real to the pc the meter has the value of only reading on things that are real to the pc if it doesnt read it is unreal or it is well suppressed you can asis in pc what he has reality on this takes bit of cage away so he can see more and asis more you could do almost anything on pc if you audited him on what he could recognize things he had reality on that is the magical trick everybody has some level of reality on r and c so they can get something out of processes involving arc matter what level the pc is at stick to what is real to the pc look around here and find something thats really real is probably one of the most nebulous commands ever given but the pc walks over and picks up that wire over there and he says that is very very very real i dont know what he means but it means he can recognize wire i dont know what he means i dont even know what he means when he says he can recognize it but it means to for the benefit of just the process itself that he can see it recognize it and direct his attention to it great thats all im asking i dont care what else he means what goes on in the pcs head when he answers that question wow who knows who cares the only time you would care is if the guy was being glib beware of the pc who runs glibly rattling off answers etc it is an automaticity of circuit answering for the person the pc may come up to awareness of somatics that he has had all along learn to look at pc from the viewpoint of what the pc can see the auditors ability to estimate what he has asised is part of his effectiveness in auditing youve got to know what youve already just taken care of and therefore you have to know how it is taken care of it is taken care of by being perceived and asised and thats the only way it is taken care of you ask the pc to look at something you know he can look at he looks at it and he asises it and thats the end product of all auditing it is all very well to have theories about what is wrong with the pc as long as you dont try to get the pc to asis your concept of what is wrong actually the division of the world into the destructive and the constructive is an artificial one at the top of the scale there is only the free since asisness is destruction paradoxically what at lower level is viewed as constructive asising is actually destructive and what at lower level is viewed as destructive force suppression is actually constructive in that notisness causes persistence auditing is simple because it evades the complexities of life by undermining them if auditing were solution to life it would have to be as complicated as life fortunately it isnt it is an asising of life
