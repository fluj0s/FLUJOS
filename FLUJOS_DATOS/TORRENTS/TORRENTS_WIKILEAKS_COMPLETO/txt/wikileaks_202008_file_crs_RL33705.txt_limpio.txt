jonathan l ramseur analyst in environmental policy resources science and industry division oil spills in us coastal waters background governance and issues for congress summary during the past two decades while us oil imports and consumption have steadily risen oil spill incidents and the volume of oil spilled have not followed similar course in general the annual number and volume of oil spills have shown declines in some cases dramatic declines the 1989 exxon valdez spill in alaskan waters played large role in stimulating actions that contributed to this trend particularly the decrease in the annual spill volumes the exxon valdez spill highlighted the need for stronger legislation inflamed public sentiment and spurred congress to enact comprehensive oil spill legislation resulting in the oil pollution act of 1990 pl 101380 this law expanded and clarified the authority of the federal government and created new oil spill prevention and preparedness requirements moreover the 1990 legislation strengthened existing liability provisions providing greater deterrent against spills after 1990 spill volume from oil tankers the vessels that carry and have spilled the most oil decreased significantly considering that us oil consumption and oil imports have steadily increased the trend of declining spill incidents and volume in past years is noteworthy yet recent annual data indicate that the overall decline of annual spill events may have stopped although energy information administration projections indicate that oil imports are expected to decline in coming years the united states is projected to continue importing more than 50 of the oil it consumes the threat of oil spills raises the question of whether us officials have the necessary resources at hand to respond to major spill there is some concern that the favorable us spill record has resulted in loss of experienced personnel capable of responding quickly and effectively to major oil spill moreover the level of funding required to respond to such spill particularly its aftermath may be currently inadequate according to us coast guard reports recent oil spills into san francisco bay november 2007 and the mississippi river july 2008 have generated further interest and debate concerning oil spill policy issues such as oil spill response and prevention oil spill is entirely benign even relatively minor spill depending on the timing and location can cause significant harm to individual organisms and entire populations marine mammals birds bottomdwelling and intertidal species and organisms in early developmental stages eggs or larvae are especially vulnerable to nearby spill however the effects of oil spills can vary greatly oil spills can cause impacts over range of time scales from only few days to several years or even decades in some cases this report reviews the history and trends of oil spills in the united states identifies the legal authorities governing oil spill prevention

governance and issues for congress introduction oil is the dominant source of energy in the united states supplying the nation with approximately 40 of its energy needs its use is widespread providing fuel for the transportation industrial and residential sectors vast quantities of oil continuously enter the country via vessel or pipeline and are then transported to destinations throughout the nation with such widespread use and nonstop movement it is inevitable that some number of spills will occur one continuing policy issue is whether the nation has the necessary resources and personnel in place to respond to major spill several major us oil spills have had lasting repercussions that transcended the local environmental and economic effects the most notable example is the 1989 exxon valdez spill which released approximately 11 million gallons of crude oil into prince william sound alaska the exxon valdez spill the largest and most expensive oil spill in us waters to date1 produced extensive consequences beyond alaska according to the national academies of science the exxon valdez disaster caused fundamental changes in the way the us public thought about oil the oil industry and the transport of petroleum products by tankers big oil was suddenly seen as necessary evil something to be feared and mistrusted2 this report focuses on oil spills3 in us coastal waters4 the first section highlights background issues including oil spill statistics and potential environmental impacts the second section discusses the legal framework that governs oil spill prevention and response the third section examines the threat of 1 note that the exxon valdez spill ranks only 35th for spill volume on the list of international tanker spills since 1967 see international tanker

us coastal waters is defined broadly to encompass all waters between the shore and the boundary of the us exclusive economic zone 200 nautical miles from shore note that in other documents coastal may refer only to state waters but in this report the term coastal waters includes state and federally regulated waters crs2 future oil spills in coastal waters and whether response personnel are prepared to respond to major spill the final section highlights recent legislative activity background oil spills in us coastal waters while us oil imports and consumption have steadily risen oil spill incidents and volume spilled have not followed similar course see figure 1 in general oil spill events and the volume of oil released have declined over the past two decades in some years the declines have been dramatic note that this figure does not include data from 2005 described in the text box below spills associated with hurricanes katrina and rita 2005 as of the date of this report the coast guard database did not include 2005 spill data however there was substantial increase in spill volume in 2005 due to spills associated with hurricanes katrina and rita the minerals management service mms summary of hurricane incidents includes the following more than 8 million gallons of oil from aboveground oil storage facilities however 50 was reported recovered and it is unknown has much of the remaining volume impacted coastal waters over 600000 gallons including an estimated 84000 gallons from one platform incident were spilled from federal offshore oil platforms and associated pipelines approximately 33 million gallons were spilled from tank barge when it struck submerged oil platform that had been damaged during the storms mms petroleum spills of one barrel and greater from federal

uscg oil spill compendium available at httpwwwuscgmilhqgcpcomrelfactfileindexhtm the decline of spill incidents is likely related at least in part to international oil pollution standards that went into effect in 1983 these new standards were implemented in the united states by the act to prevent pollution from ships5 the substantial drop in the annual spill volume is most attributable to the decline in volume spilled by oil tankers and barges the vessels that transport oil and have historically spilled the most oil as shown in figure 2 the volume of oil spilled from vessels in us waters in the 1990s differed dramatically from the volume spilled in the 1980s the exxon valdez spill of 1989 and the resulting oil pollution act of 1990 opa played key roles in the subsequent spill volume reduction the 1990 act discussed below made comprehensive changes to us oil pollution law by expanding federal response authority and increasing spill liability the high costs associated with the exxon valdez spill6 and the threat of broad liability imposed by opa in some scenarios unlimited liability have likely been the central drivers for the spill volume decline seen in the 1990s 5 pl 96478 33 usc 1901 et seq these standards and the us law are discussed later in this report 6 exxon has so far paid approximately 3 billion for the spill 2 billion for cleanup activities and 900 million in civil settlement for natural resource damages in june 2006 parties filed for an additional 92 million for damages per reopener provision in the civil settlement on june 25 2008 the supreme court ruled on punitive damages an issue that had been in the court system for more than decade the court awarded damages of 507 million 2006 ruling from the us court of appeals for the 9th circuit had set the damages at 25 billion 50 reduction from the original 1994 ruling the case is still in the system because plaintiffs are seeking interest on the awarded damages which could amount to an additional 488 million crs4 in addition to international and federal governance 28 states had oil spill liability laws 19 of which imposed unlimited liability before the exxon valdez spill occurred in 19897 after the 1989 spill some states enacted additional legislation8 which may have contributed to the declines figure 2 volume of oil spilled from vessels into us coastal waters 19802004 14000000

data and analysis specific to onshore facilities and pipelines as well as offshore oil extraction operations impacts of oil spills in aquatic environments oil spill is entirely benign depending on timing and location even relatively minor spill can cause significant harm to individual organisms and entire populations9 oil spills can cause impacts over range of time scales from days to years or even decades for certain spills impacts are typically divided into acute shortterm and chronic longterm effects both types are part of complicated and often controversial equation that is addressed after an oil spill ecosystem recovery 7 crs report outofprint available from crs by request liability provisions in state oil spill laws brief summary october 1 1990 8 for example california passed the lempertkeeneseastrand oil spill prevention and response act in 1990 more information is available at httpwwwdfgcagovosprabout historyhtml 9 nrc report p 4 crs5 acute impacts depending on the toxicity and concentration of the spill acute exposure to oil spills can kill various organisms and cause the following debilitating but not necessarily lethal effects10 reduced reproduction altered development impaired feeding mechanisms and decreased defense from disease birds marine mammals bottomdwelling and intertidal species and organisms in their developmental stages eg fish eggs and larvae are particularly vulnerable to oil spills11 in addition to the impacts to individual organisms oil spills can lead to disruption of the structure and function of the ecosystem certain habitats such as coral reefs mangrove swamps and salt marshes are especially vulnerable because the physical structure of the habitats depends upon living organisms these potential acute effects to individual organisms and marine ecosystems have been unambiguously established by laboratory studies and wellstudied spills such as the exxon valdez12 chronic impacts longterm chronic exposure typically occurs from continuous oil releases leaking pipelines offshore production discharges and non point sources eg urban runoff although spills are normally associated with acute impacts some oil spills have also demonstrated chronic exposure and effects13 there is increasing evidence that chronic lowlevel exposures to oil contaminants can significantly affect the survival and reproductive success of marine birds and mammals14 however because of the complexity of factors including longer time period and presence of other pollutants determining the precise effects on species and ecosystems due to chronic oil exposure in particular locale is difficult for scientists as result studies involving chronic effects are often met with debate and some controversy ecosystem recovery interested parties may have differing opinions at to what constitutes ecosystem recovery at one end of the spectrum local groups may demand that an ecosystem be returned to prespill conditions noaa regulations 15 cfr section 99030 state that recovery means the return of injured natural resources and services to baseline in other words return to conditions as they would have been had the spill not occurred baseline conditions may not equate with 10 these sublethal effects can occur at concentrations that are several orders of magnitude lower than concentrations that cause death nrc report p 127 11 nrc report chapter 5 also multiple conversations with national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa personnel 2008 12 nrc report p 120 13 nrc report p 121 14 nrc report p 134 crs6 prespill conditions multiple variables affect local species and ecosystem services for example one species at spill site could have been on the decline at the time of an incident because of changing water temperatures for example these types of trends are considered when trustees evaluate restoration efforts restoration leaves room for sitespecific interpretation which in the case of the exxon valdez spill and cleanup continues to generate considerable argument economic costs of oil spills the economic costs that can result from an oil spill can be broken into three categories cleanup expenses natural resource damages and the various economic losses incurred by the affected community or individuals cleanup costs the cleanup costs of an oil spill can vary greatly and are influenced by mix of factors location characteristics oil type and oil volume location is generally considered the most important factor because it involves multiple variables areas with less water movement such as marshlands will generally cost more to clean up than open water tourist destinations or sensitive habitats such as coral reefs will likely require more stringent cleanup standards thus increasing the costs the political and social culture at the spill site plays part as well spill in highprofile area eg the november 7 2007 spill 53000 gallons from container ship into the san francisco bay will likely receive special attention major oil spills especially ones that affect shoreline ecosystems are often met with extensive media coverage placing pressure on parties to take action coupled with this pressure authorities federal or state at these locations may require extensive oil spill response requirements which can influence cleanup cost the united states likely meets this description because its average cleanup cost per barrel of oil spilled is considerably higher than in other parts of the world15 the more persistent and viscous oil types such as heavy crude oil and intermediates known as bunker fuels are more expensive to clean up gasoline and other lighter refined products may require only minimal cleanup action these materials will evaporate or disperse relatively quickly leaving only small volume of petroleum product available for recovery compared with other factors spill volume is less important major spill away from shore will likely cost considerably less than minor spill in sensitive location certainly the amount of oil spilled affects cleanup costs because all things being equal larger spill will require larger and more expensive cleanup effort however the relationship between cleanup costs and spill volume is not linear 15 the average cleanup cost is three times higher in the united states than in europe based on 1997 data and excluding the exxon valdez costs see etkin dagmar estimating cleanup costs for oil spills paper presented at the 1999 international oil spill conference 1999 citing data from the oil spill intelligence report international oil spill database crs7 cleaning up smaller spill is likely to cost more than larger spill on pergallon basis16 natural resources damages this category of costs relates to the environmental impacts caused by an oil spill pursuant to opa the party responsible for an oil spill is liable for any loss of natural resources eg fish animals plants and their habitats and the services provided by the resource eg drinking water recreation when spill occurs natural resource trustees conduct natural resource damage assessment to determine the extent of the harm trustees may include representatives from tribal governments as well as officials from state agencies designated by the relevant governor and federal agencies designated by the president such as noaa17 the oil pollution act opa of 1990 states that the measure of natural resource damages includes the cost of restoring rehabilitating replacing or acquiring the equivalent of the damaged natural resources the diminution in value of those natural resources pending restoration and the reasonable cost of assessing those damages18 pursuant to opa noaa developed regulations pertaining to natural resource damage assessments in 199619 natural resource damages may include both losses of direct use and passive uses direct use value may derive from recreational eg boating commercial eg fishing or cultural or historical uses of the resource in contrast passiveuse value may derive from preserving the resource for its own sake or for enjoyment by future generations20 the damages are compensatory not punitive collected damages cannot be placed into the general treasury revenues of the federal or state government but must be used to restore or replace lost resources21 indeed noaas regulations focus on 16 this is primarily due to the fact that spill of any size eg in sensitive area will require that equipment and response experts be sent to the scene see etkin dagmar estimating cleanup costs for oil spills paper presented at the 1999 international oil spill conference 1999 p 5 17 for more information see noaas damage assessment remediation and restoration program at

restoration returning the resource to its baseline condition and compensatory restoration addressing interim losses of resources and their services22 other economic costs oil spills can generate costs other than response expenses or damages to natural resources an oil spill can disrupt business activity near the spill particularly businesses that count on the reputation of the local environment for example the local tourist industry may be affected in some cases wellpublicized oil spill can weaken the tourist industry near the spill site regardless of the actual threat to human health created by the spill local infrastructure and services can be disrupted by an oil spill port and harbor operations may be interrupted altering the flow of trade goods power plants that use cooling water systems may need to temporarily cease operations for example the salem nuclear plant the second largest nuclear plant in the united states was forced to halt activity due to substantial oil spill more than 250000 gallons in the delaware river in november 2004 unlike natural resource damage claims which are brought by the appropriate natural resource trustees the costs described in this section would be submitted as claims by the thirdparties suffering the specific loss oil spill governance when the exxon valdez ran aground in march 1989 there were multiple federal statutes state statutes and international conventions that dealt with oil discharges the governing framework for oil spills in the united states remains combination of federal state and international authorities within this framework several federal agencies have the authority to implement oil spill regulations the framework and primary federal funding process the oil spill liability trust fund used to respond to oil spills are described below federal authorities before and after the exxon valdez spill the following list highlights the primary federal authorities that were in effect when the exxon valdez spill occurred in 1989 21 continued comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act 2006 us department of justice environment and natural resources division 22 william d brighton natural resource damages under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act 2006 us department of justice environment and natural resources division crs9 clean water act 197223 the clean water act cwa represented the broadest authority for addressing oil spills at the time of the exxon valdez spill section 311 of the cwa established requirements for oil spill reporting response and liability the act also created fund 311 fund maintained by federal appropriations that could be used for cleanup and natural resource restoration deepwater port act 197424 this statute addressed oil spills and liability issues at deepwater oil ports the act also set up the deepwater port fund to provide for prompt cleanup and compensate damages above liability limits the fund was financed by per gallon tax on oil transferred at deepwater port transalaska pipeline authorization act 197325 this act covered oil spills and liability relating to the transalaska pipeline system taps although the pipeline is constructed over land spills from it could reach coastal waters via inland rivers the act created trust fund financed through lessee fee that could be used to respond to spills and damages from the pipeline outer continental shelf lands act amendments 197826 this act established an oil spill liability structure and rules for oil extraction facilities in federal offshore waters with this legislation congress created the offshore pollution fund financed by pergallon fee on produced oil that could be used for oil spill cleanup and damages national oil and hazardous substances pollution contingency plan ncp the ncp was first established in 1968 after us policymakers observed the response to 37milliongallon oil tanker spill torrey canyon off the coast of england27 the ncp contains the federal governments procedures for responding to oil spills and hazardous substance releases28 subsequent laws have amended the ncp including the cwa in 1972 and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund in 1980 23 the official statutory name is the federal water pollution control act pl 92500 as amended codified at 33 usc 1251

httpwwwepagovemergencies contentlawsregsncpoverhtm 28 the ncp is codified at 40 cfr part 300 crs10 after the exxon valdez spill many observers29 described the above legal collection as an ineffective patchwork arguably each law had perceived shortcomings discussed below in the context of postexxon valdez legislation and none provided comprehensive oil spill coverage for more than 15 years prior to the exxon valdez incident congress made attempts to enact unified oil pollution law several contentious issues produced deadlocks hindering the passage of legislation one of the central points of debate state preemption dealt with whether federal oil spill law should limit states ability to impose stricter requirements particularly unlimited liability other liability questions also generated debate for example if an oil spill occurred should the owner of the cargo ie oil be held liable as was the ship owneroperator another point of contention was whether oilcarrying vessels should be required to have double hulls although proponents argued that second hull would help prevent oil spills the shipping industry raised concern that implementing such mandate would disrupt oil transportation and potentially affect the national economy final issue involved the interaction between domestic legislation federal and state and international measures some were concerned that if the united states became party to certain international agreements under consideration in the 1980s30 the international standards would preempt federal and state laws especially those establishing liability limits proponents argued that these concerns were overstated and stressed that joining the international agreements was especially important for the united states because of the international nature of oil transportation and associated pollution following the 1989 exxon valdez spill members faced great pressure to overcome the disputes discussed above31 the spill highlighted the inadequacies of the existing coverage and generated public outrage the end result was the oil pollution act of 1990 opa32 the first comprehensive law to specifically address oil pollution to waterways and coastlines of the united states oil pollution act of 1990 with the enactment of opa on august 18 1990 congress consolidated the existing federal oil spill laws under one program the 1990 law expanded the existing liability provisions within the cwa and created new freestanding requirements regarding oil spill prevention and response key opa provisions are discussed below 29 see for example us congress house committee on merchant marine and fisheries report accompanying hr 1465 oil pollution prevention removal liability and compensation act of 1989 1989 hrept 101242 part 2 101st cong 1st sess p 32 30 the two agreements under consideration were the 1984 protocols to the international convention on civil liability for oil pollution damage and the protocols to the international fund for compensation for oil pollution damages 31 handful of other oil spills followed the exxon valdez in 1989 and 1990 egthe mega borg spilled 5 million gallons of oil in the gulf of mexico further spurring congressional action 32 pl 101380 primarily codified at usc 2701 et seq crs11 spill response authority when responding to spill many considered the lines of responsibility under the preopa regime to be unclear33 with too much reliance on spillers to perform proper cleanup34 opa strengthened and clarified the federal governments role in oil spill response and cleanup opa section 4201 amended section 311c of the cwa to provide the president delegated to the uscg or epa with three options perform cleanup immediately federalize the spill monitor the response efforts of the spiller or direct the spillers cleanup activities the revised response authorities addressed concerns that precious time would be lost while waiting for the spiller to marshall its cleanup forces35 the federal government determines the level of cleanup required although the federal government must consult with designated trustees of natural resources and the governor of the state affected by the spill the decision that cleanup is completed and can be ended rests with the federal government states may require further work but without the support of federal funding36 national contingency plan opa expanded the role and breadth of the ncp the 1990 law established multilayered planning and response system to improve preparedness and response to spills in marine environments37 among other things the act also required the president to establish procedures and standards as part of the ncp for responding to worstcase oil spill scenarios38 tank vessel and facility response plans as component of the enhanced ncp opa amended the cwa to require that us tank vessels offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities39 prepare and submit oil spill response plans to the relevant federal agency in general vessels and facilities are prohibited from handling storing or transporting oil if they do not have plan approved by or submitted to the appropriate agency40 table 1 33 see for example

section 4201b amending section 311d2j of the cwa 39 the response plan requirement is applicable only to an onshore facility that because of its location could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to the environment by discharging into navigable waters adjoining shorelines or the exclusive economic zone cwa section 311j5iii 40 opa section 4202 amending section 311j5e of the cwa crs12 the plans should among other things identify how the owner or operator of vessel or facility would respond to worstcase scenario spill congress did not intend for every vessel to have onboard all the personnel and equipment needed to respond to worstcase spill but vessels must have plan and procedures to call upon typically through contractual relationship the necessary equipment and personnel for responding to worstcase spill41 in 2004 congress enacted an amendment requiring nontank vessels ie ships carrying oil for their own fuel use over 400 gross tons to prepare and submit vessel response plan42 congress reasoned that many nontank vessels have as much oil onboard as small tank vessels thus presenting comparable risk from an oil spill moreover the international standards for oil spill prevention43 apply to tanker and nontanker vessels alike thus the 2004 amendment brought the us law more in line with international provisions doublehull design for vessels the issue of double hulls received considerable debate for many years prior to opa and it was one of the stumbling blocks for unified oil spill legislation proponents maintained that doublehull construction provides extra protection if vessel becomes damaged44 however opponents argued that doublehulled vessel might cause stability problems if an accident occurred thus negating the benefits45 stakeholders also highlighted the impacts that doublehull requirement would entail for the shipping industry eg cost and time of retrofitting ship availability46 the opa requirements for double hulls reflected some of these concerns the act required new vessels carrying oil and operating in us waters to have double hulls47 however opa provided certain exceptions depending on the size 41 us congress house

provisions of existing oil spill law creating freestanding liability regime section 1002 states that responsible parties are liable for any discharge of oil or threat of discharge from vessel or facility50 to navigable waters adjoining shorelines or the exclusive economic zone51 of the united states ie 200 miles beyond the shore regarding the existing oil spill law prior to opa congress recognized that there is comprehensive legislation in place that promptly and adequately compensates those who suffer other types of economic loss as result of an oil pollution incident52 opa broadened the scope of damages ie costs for which an oil spiller would be liable under opa responsible party is liable for all cleanup costs incurred not only by government entity but also by private party53 in addition to cleanup costs opa significantly increased the range of liable damages to include the following injury to natural resources loss of personal property and resultant economic losses loss of subsistence use of natural resources lost revenues resulting from destruction of property or natural resource injury lost profits resulting from property loss or natural resource injury and costs of providing extra public services during or after spill response54 48 this exception applied to many inland barges 49 lightering is the process of transferring oil from large vessel to smaller vessel this common practice occurs in designated areas that are typically many miles away from shore 50 the definition of facility is broadly worded and includes pipelines and motor vehicles

spills under the preopa framework primarily the cwa they are similar to those of the superfund statute55 established in 1980 for releases of hazardous substances except for certain behavior including acts of gross negligence or willful misconduct56 opa set liability limits or caps for cleanup costs and other damages liability limits for vessels are based on vessel carrying capacity generally 1200 per gross ton as an example the liability limit for the 2004 athos tanker spill in delaware river was approximately 45 million57 offshore facility liability is capped at 75 million onshore facilities and deepwater port liability is limited to 350 million these limits are much higher than under the preopa liability structure opa required the president to issue regulations to adjust the liability limits at least every three years to take into account changes in the consumer price index cpi despite this requirement adjustments to liability limits were not made until july 2006 the coast guard and maritime transportation act of 2006 pl 109 241 amended opa increasing limits to 1900gross ton for doublehulled vessels and 3000gross ton for singlehulled vessels the oil spill liability trust fund prior to opa federal funding for oil spill response was generally considered inadequate58 and damage recovery was difficult for private parties59 to help address these issues congress established the oil spill liability trust fund osltf pursuant to executive order eo 12777 the uscg created the national pollution funds center npfc to manage the trust fund in 1991 the fund may be used for several purposes prompt payment of costs for responding to and removing oil spills 55 section 107b of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla commonly known as superfund

expenses although congress created the osltf in 198660 congress did not authorize its use or provide its funding until after the exxon valdez incident in 1990 opa provided the statutory authorization necessary to put the fund in motion through opa congress transferred other federal liability funds61 into the osltf in complementary legislation congress imposed 5centperbarrel tax on the oil industry to support the fund62 collection of this fee ceased on december 31 1994 due to sunset provision in the law however in april 2006 the tax resumed as required by the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 the level of funding in the trust fund is discussed below financial responsibility to preserve the trust fund and ensure that responsible parties can be held accountable for oil spill cleanup and damages opa requires that vessels maintain evidence of financial responsibility eg insurance the coast guards national pollution funds center carries out this mandate by issuing certificates of financial responsibility cofrs to shipping vessel owners when owners demonstrate the ability to pay for oil spill cleanup and damages in general vessels over 300 gross tons are required to have valid

for spill prevention control and countermeasure spcc plans in 1973 some of which are scheduled to go into effect july 1 200965 spcc plans address the procedures methods and equipment and other requirements for equipment to prevent discharges66 the epas spcc plans apply only to nontransportation onshore facilities that exceed certain oil storage capacity and that in the event of spill can be reasonably expected because of their location to produce an oil discharge that would reach navigable waters or adjoining shorelines of the united states67 unlike other oil spill preparedness provisions spcc plans focus more on prevention than on response activities requiring for example secondary containment eg dikes berms for oilstorage equipment outer continental shelf lands act the

waterways safety act of 197271 amended by the port and tanker safety act of 197872 called for specific construction and equipment design requirements for oil tankers as noted opa subsequently amended this statute in 1990 by establishing phasedin schedule for doublehulled tankers congress enacted the 1970s legislation to coincide with international initiatives in fact many of the federal laws concerning vessel standards and pollution control procedures were written to implement international conventions these laws are discussed in the next section international conventions the relationship between international and domestic law can be complex in general international conventions ie treaties when signed by the united states and if necessary ratified by the senate are on equal footing with federal law parties to such conventions must often implement domestic legislation to carry out the provisions outlined in the convention several of the federal laws governing oil spills were

oilcarrying vessels from different nations primary player in this regard is the international maritime organization imo body of the united nations which sets international maritime vessel safety and marine pollution standards the coast guard represents the united states at imo meetings multiple international conventions concern vessels and their impact on the marine environment the two conventions described below are the most relevant to oil pollution in coastal waters marpol 7378 the imo implements the 1973 international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships as modified by the protocol of 1978 marpol 737874 vessels whose nations are signatories to marpol are subject to its requirements regardless of where they sail and member nations are responsible for the vessels registered under their flag marpol 7378 includes six annexes each covering different pollution type annex i prevention of pollution by oil entered into force in 198375 and established requirements for controlling oil discharges to sea annex i requires vessels to have equipment that minimizes oil discharge such as oilwater separators and shipboard oil pollution emergency plans sopeps although the sopep applicability is similar to that of the vessel response plan vrp required by opa76 the purpose of the sopep is somewhat different sopep is intended to provide guidance to the vessels officers regarding proper onboard emergency procedures when an oil spill occurs77 whereas the vrp is more focused on responding to the spill itself the united states implements annex i through the act to prevent pollution from ships apps78 apps applies to all usflagged ships irrespective of location and to all foreignflagged vessels in us waters or at ports under us jurisdiction the uscg

of the first major spills to receive worldwide attention79 the incident raised many questions regarding oil spill response particularly when dealing with vessels from other nations for example the incident prompted debate over actions allowable if nations waters and environment are threatened by spill from another nations vessel the 1969 international convention relating to intervention on the high seas in cases of oil pollution casualties the intervention convention sought to address these issues to implement this convention in the united states congress passed the intervention on the high seas act of 197480 under this act if the uscg determines there to be grave and imminent danger to the coastline or related interests of the united states from pollution or threat of pollution of the sea by convention oil ie as defined in the convention the uscg can take action to prevent mitigate or eliminate that danger federal agencies responsibilities unlike most countries the united states shares jurisdiction over its territorial seas 012 nautical miles from shore with its coastal states the 1953 submerged lands act sla gave coastal states jurisdiction over the submerged lands waters and natural resources eg oil deposits located in most cases within three nautical miles off the coastline81 the waters seabed and natural resources beyond the states waters are exclusively federal and extend to the edge of the exclusive economic zone 200 nautical miles from shore however the federal government maintains the authority to regulate commerce navigation national defense power production and international affairs within state waters the oil spill legal framework involves implementation by multiple federal agencies agency responsibilities can be divided into two categories 1 oil spill response and cleanup and 2 oil spill preventionpreparedness response oil spill response authority is determined by the location of the spill the uscg has response authority in coastal waters and the epa covers inland oil spills82 79 the torrey canyon liberianflagged tanker spilled approximately 35 million gallons of crude oil 80 pl 93248 33 usc 1471 et seq 81 most state waters extend 3 nautical

leagues equating to 9 nautical miles see the mms ocs website definitions and jurisdictions at httpwwwmmsgovincidentspollutionhtm 82 the terms inland and coastal are defined in the national contingency plan 40 cfr section 3005 the coastal zone covers all waters subject to the tide the great lakes and all seaward waters extending 200 nautical miles beyond shore the inland zone covers all other us waters spills in inland waters can potentially affect coastal waters and ecosystems particularly if the spill occurs in water systems near the coast in fact fine continued crs20 as the primary response authority in coastal waters the uscg has the ultimate authority to ensure that an oil spill is effectively removed and actions are taken to prevent further discharge from the source during response operations the uscg coordinates the efforts of federal state and private parties coast guard response efforts are supported by noaas office of response and restoration noaa provides scientific analysis and consultation during oil spill response activities83 assistance can include oil spill tracking cleanup alternatives and knowledge of atrisk natural resources moreover noaa

prevention responsibilities include among other things assessing whether facilities or vessels have the necessary equipment in place as discussed above vessels may be required to have double hulls facilities may need secondary containment preparedness duties involve oversight tasks such as evaluating facility and vessel response plans preparedness responsibilities also include developing and maintaining contingency plans at various levels area regional and national personnel training is vital component of sustaining readiness noaa oil spill experts help train responders in government service and private business in addition opa requires agencies to conduct internal examinations to test preparedness85 as part of this requirement the uscg conducts spills of national significance sons exercises to analyze the coast guards ability to respond to major oil spill federal funding for the oil spill liability trust fund in recent years the level of funding for the trust fund has created some concern highlighting central policy debate how should policymakers allocate the costs associated with major accidental oil spill what share of costs should be borne by the responsible party eg oil vessel owneroperators the oil industry and the general treasury background prior to two separate actions by the 109th congress the trust fund was particularly vulnerable in 2005 congress reinstated the 5centperbarrel tax on oil thus providing dedicated source of revenue for the trust fund86 in 2006 congress raised the vessel liability limits thus requiring the responsible party to pay greater proportion of the oil spill costs87 before these changes fund managers projected the fund would be completely depleted by fy200988 with the 2005 legislation in effect the most recent projection june 2007 indicates that the fund will reach 1 billion by fy2008 figure 3 however this projection does not account for possible claims arising from recent spills including the 2007 spill into san francisco bay the 2008 spill into the mississippi river or oil spills associated with hurricane katrina although the katrinarelated federal response costs were covered under the disaster relief fund89 private parties can seek reimbursement 85 as required by opa section 4202a which amended cwa section 311j7 codified in 33 usc 1321j7 86 energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 congress also raised the ceiling from 1 billion to 27 billion for when the tax would temporarily expire under the original tax legislation omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1989 pl 101239 the perbarrel tax would be suspended in any calendar quarter if the fund balance reached 1 billion restarting again if it dipped below that number the 2005 act increased this threshold to 27 billion 87 coast guard and maritime transportation act of 2006 pl 109241 88 uscg report on the oil spill liability trust fund may 2005 p 11 89 the president may issue major disaster declaration under the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act the stafford act and invoke federal authorities and continued crs22 from the trust fund for cleanup or other costs eg damage to property that exceed their liability limits the possible number and value of these potential claims remain uncertain90 figure 3 projected annual balances for the oil spill liability trust fund fy2007 fy2014 2500 2000 millions

2006 at httpwwwuscgmilnpfcdocspdfs osltf_report_fy02fy06pdf note the projections assume there will not be any claims associated with spills caused by hurricane katrina the 2007 spill in san francisco bay or the 2008 spill into the mississippi river regardless of the possible katrinarelated claims and even considering the substantial enhancements made by the 109th congress the trust fund remains vulnerable to major spill after conducting two recent spills of national significance sons exercises in 2002 and 2004 the coast guard observed that major spill can exceed the available resources in the trust fund91 as reference point the exxon valdez spill tallied approximately 2 billion in cleanup costs and 1 billion in natural resource damages not including thirdparty 89 continued resources as occurred in response to hurricane katrina for more on this issue see crs report rl33053 federal stafford act disaster assistance presidential declarations eligible activities and funding by keith bea 90 the most recent publications from the npfc which manages the osltf do not provide an estimate because of this uncertainty however background document that was offered at an april 27 2006 hearing stated the coast guard had estimated these costs could exceed 800 million house subcommittee on coast guard and maritime transportation hearing on the implementation of the oil pollution act an npfc official suggests this estimate is possibly overstated per telephone conversation on september 22 2006 91 see us department of homeland security us coast guard california sons 2004 after action report pp 46 and a7 crs23 claims if an accidental oil spill from vessel matching the size of the exxon valdez 95000 gross tons92 were to occur the vessel liability under the new limits would be capped at either 285 million singlehull or 181 million double hull cleanup costs and damages in excess of the liability limits could be covered by the trust fund93 opa section 900194 established perincident expenditure caps more than 1 billion or the maximum amount available in the fund for all eligible costs and more than 500 million for natural resource damages thus major spill particularly one in sensitive environment could threaten the viability of the fund possibly depleting it entirely in addition the above scenario assumes that the owneroperator can take advantage of the liability limits provided by opa eg obeyed relevant regulations and did not act with gross negligence or willful misconduct if liability is not capped the owneroperator could be liable for all costs however in the case of significant spill akin to the exxon valdez some owneroperator companies may go bankrupt before paying for the entire cost of the spill such scenario may also threaten the trust fund potential options the following options are among several that congress might consider to address these concerns first congress could maintain the status quo in which the costs are shared between responsible parties the oil industry and general taxpayers responsible parties ie ownersoperators of vessels and facilities are liable up to their liability caps if applicable the trust fund which is funded through the tax on the oil industry covers costs above liability limits general treasury funds would cover costs if the trust fund is depleted second congress could further increase the liability limits for vessels so that the responsible party would be required to pay greater portion of the total spill cost before accessing trust fund dollars third congress could increase the 5centperbarrel oil tax to more quickly raise the funds balance closer to its ceiling of 27 billion fully funded osltf would be more capable of absorbing the costs in excess of spillers liability limit 92 the exxon valdez has been renamed the sea river mediterranean and its specifications can be found at the uscg port state information exchange database at httpcgmixuscg milpsix 93 except for emergency funds available to federal officials the trust fund distributes monies through claims process persons who have incurred cleanup costs or suffered damages from an oil spill may submit claim for reimbursement from the trust fund this includes responsible parties who have reached their respective liability limits for more details on this process see the national pollution fund centers website at httpwwwuscgmil npfc 94 codified in 26 usc 9509 crs24 fourth policymakers may consider expanding liable parties to include the owner of the oil being transported this option was considered during the development of opa95 the coast guard authorization act for fiscal year 2008 s 1892 would among other things alter the liability structure of opa to make owners of oil liable for spills under certain conditions considerations for policymakers the above options spotlight central policy debate how should policymakers allocate the costs associated with major accidental oil spill the first option would maintain the status quo which represents costsharing structure currently responsible parties and the oil industry bear the costs for all but the most significant spills general treasury funds are needed if the fund is depleted some groups may contend this conflicts with the polluter pays principle arguing that general treasury funds should never have to pay for oil spill cleanup or damages some combination of options two three and four could reduce the possibility of this occurrence the second option would help preserve the trust fund by increasing the liability limit of the spiller setting liability limits is challenge because lawmakers must apportion the risk of costly accidental spill fairly between the responsible party and the trust fund the shipping industry would likely argue that further increase would be disruptive due to the cost of maintaining additional financial assurance considering that the limits were increased substantially in july 2006 this option might be the least feasible the third option would increase the cost share borne by the oil industry overall some would argue that this follows the polluter pays principle one view holds that the relevant industry oil transportation and the oil industry in general should bear the environmental costs that may develop during the course of business different interpretation of the polluter pays principle finds that only the responsible party not industry overall should pay one with such view might conclude that the third option increasing the per barrel tax is overreaching and unfair because it increases the costs borne by the entire industry instead of on the actual responsible party96 there are likely many economic policy arguments both for and against an additional perbarrel tax on oil for instance some groups may claim that an additional oil barrel tax will be reflected in higher energy costs gasoline home heating oil for consumers which could disproportionately affect lowerincome households in general these types of tax policy debates are beyond the scope of 95 the house version of the bill 101st congress hr 1465 would have held under certain conditions oil owners liable for 50 of the costs and damages 96 the bush administration maintained an analogous view of the polluter pays principle in the context of whether or not to reinstate the superfund tax on the chemical and oil industry see crs report rl31410 superfund taxes or general revenues future funding issues for the superfund program by jonathan l ramseur mark reisch and james mccarthy crs25 this report however policymakers might consider whether any negative consequences from an additional tax on industry would outweigh the potential benefits of allocating the costs to the oil industry the fourth option if implemented would potentially subject oil companies to liability from spills of their own oil in line with one view of the polluter pays principle some may argue that oil owners should be at least partially responsible for the various costs associated with spills of their own oil97 oil industry stakeholders would likely argue that this option is unfair because for example they would have limited control besides selecting carrier over the transportation of their cargo moreover the oil industry would likely point out that they are already supporting oil spill cleanup generally through the 5centperbarrel tax thus they would likely argue that attaching direct liability to cargo owners would be an inequitable distribution of costs policymakers may find the fourth option attractive because of the financial strength or perceived financial strength of the oil companies98 if the united states faces multibillion dollar oil spill and the vessel owneroperators are unable to pay some may argue that the oil owners should absorb the costs above the limit of the trust fund rather than funds from the general treasury however this particular liability issue is complicated further legal andor policy issues associated with this liability change are beyond the scope of this report state laws as mentioned above multiple states had oil spill liability laws before the passage of opa in 1990 during the 15 years prior to opas passage the issue of whether or not to preempt state liability laws was perhaps the primary obstacle to enacting unified oil spill legislation proponents of preemption argued that differing state laws particularly the various levels of liability frustrate the shipping industry and are contrary to the goal of comprehensive federal legislation preemption opponents maintained that states should be allowed as with most other federal environmental statutes to set stiffer standards regarding liability compensation and cleanup99 in the aftermath of the exxon valdez spill the scales tipped to the side of antipreemption according to opa section 1018 referred to as savings clause the act will not preempt any state from imposing additional liability or requirements with respect to the discharge of oil or related response 97 in addition this change would arguably make opa liability more in line with the liability structure of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund pl 96510 which governs releases of hazardous substances 98 although record profits for certain oil companies have been highlighted in recent years it is beyond the scope of this report to assess the extent of profits and financial worth of the oil industry overall or the percentage of firms that achieved record profits 99 in fact one argument against preemption was that existing requirements under particular state laws would be diminished or negated entirely see benjamin grumbles and joan manley the oil pollution act of 1990 legislation in the wake of crisis natural resources and environment 102 1995 p 38 crs26 activity eg cleanup standards 2003 study identified 16 states that impose unlimited liability for oil spills100 there was some concern that the language of opas savings clause would allow states to regulate matters typically reserved for the federal government such as oil tanker construction to address this issue the conference report stated that the savings clause would not disturb 1978 supreme court decision that dealt with the intersection of federal and state authority to regulate the shipping industry101 in that case the court invalidated washington state law that had attempted to govern oil tanker design size and movement in puget sound102 regardless of the clarification in the conference report the line between federal and state jurisdiction continues to be tested in 2000 the supreme court struck down washington state rule calling for various personnel requirements such as training on oil tankers103 similarly in july 2006 federal district court in massachusetts ruled against state law that would govern logistics such as tanker design personnel qualifications and navigation104 threat of future oil spills in us coastal waters this section examines the threat of future oil spills in coastal waters by assessing the possibilities for such spills

transportation june 2006 available at httpwwwaoplorg in recent years total domestic transportation has shown modest increase figure 8 although the total increase is relatively small120 transportation for the continental united states is likely increasing more substantially considering the context of continuous decline from alaskan oil production121 as mentioned previously an increase in oil transportation will not necessarily yield more oil spills but it may increase the possibilities for spills to occur level of preparedness although many consider the united states spill record over the last 15 years particularly for major spills to have been favorable the absence of major spill raises at least one issue because the nation has not been forced to respond to major oil spill for such long period some have voiced concern that the nation might have lost the expertise and institutional knowledge necessary for quick and effective response action the uscg found evidence to support this concern after the 2004 120 the total value increased from 873 billion ton miles in 2000 to 903 billion ton miles in 2004 121 the degree of increase for oil transportation within the continental united states is uncertain because the segregated data are not readily available crs32 spill of national significance sons exercise122 the after action report concluded oil spill response personnel did not appear to have even basic knowledge of the equipment required to support salvage or spill cleanup operations there was shortage of personnel with experience to fill key positions many middlelevel spill management staff had never worked large spill and some had never been involved in an exercise as result some issues and complex processes unique to spill response were not effectively addressed123 congress might consider oversight to monitor this situation as the uscg conducts periodic sons exercises the most recent national exercise occurred in june 2007 the after action report was scheduled for release in october 2007 but at the date of this report the after action report had not been published124 recent oil spill incidents november 2007 oil spill in san francisco bay on

considerable attention in the national media and interested parties have criticized the coast guards response to the incident the spill led to multiple hearings in the senate127 and house128 addressing either specifics of the spill or federal law and policies relating to oil spill response prevention and preparedness 122 the california sons 2004 was conducted in april 2004 and was the

of the united states from wide variety of sources these sources comprise four major categories natural seeps oil consumption oil transportation and oil extraction134 the majority of oil inputs are from natural seeps geologic openings on the ocean floor see figure a1 wellknown natural seeps are found in the gulf of mexico and off the coast of southern california regions with extensive oil exploration and production although the seeps release large volumes of oil each year135 the surrounding ecosystem can adapt and even thrive because the rate of release is relatively slow136 figure a1

oil extraction 1 source prepared by the congressional research service crs with data from the national research council nrc of the national academies of science 2003 oil in the sea iii inputs fates and effects p 69 releases associated with petroleum consumption activities account for the vast majority of oil introduced to the coastal environment through human behavior rivers and manmade conveyances such as stormwater drains receive oil from numerous nonpoint sources eg urban runoff and carry the oil to coastal waters these sources are frequent and widespread but their rates of release are relatively 134 nrc report pp 6788 135 the nrc report p 69 estimates that natural seeps off north america release 47 million gallons of oil each year converted from tonnes 136 nrc report p 2 crs37 slow and occur over long period of time moreover both the quantitative value and the environmental fate of these sources are poorly understood137 oil transportation and oil extraction represent on an annual average basis minor input to coastal waters see figure a1 unlike the other categories which generally release oil at slow rate over wider geographic area transportation and extraction releases can occur as major spills statistics for oil vessel transportation are provided in figure 2 at the beginning of this report spills from oil extraction operations are discussed later in this appendix spills from facilities and pipelines the volume of oil spills from facilities and pipelines has declined since the 1980s see figure a2 over the most recent fiveyear span of data 20002004 pipeline spill volume was especially low compared with previous years averaging only about 12000 gallons of spilled oil per year during the first fiveyear span 19801984 the average annual pipeline spill volume was 25 million gallons figure a2 volume of oil spills into us coastal waters from facilities and pipelines 19802004 4500000 4000000 3500000 3000000 gallons 2500000 2000000

uscg data includes incidents from landbased facilities and pipelines as well as oil industry facilities and pipelines in state nearshore and federal offshore waters the number of spills from pipelines in us waters began to decline in the mid 1980s figure a3 according to the coast guard data there were only two spills between 2002 and 2004 each spill releasing approximately 15000 gallons of oil this low number of pipeline spills may be misleading because some incidents might not be captured by the coast guards database in disclaimer on it website the 137 the range of uncertainty of landbased runoff is substantial from minimum estimate of 56 million gallons to 588 million gallons based on average annual releases from 1990 1999 nrc report pp 69 87 crs38 coast guard points out that its oil spill compendium includes spills investigated by the coast guard138 some spills in coastal waters may be under another agencys jurisdiction such as the office of pipeline safety or minerals management service although the coast guard still includes some of these spills in the database others are not included spills from facilities have not followed pattern of steady decline since 1980 but have fluctuated over the last two decades however in recent years the number of annual spills has been relatively stable figure a3 annual number of spills to us waters from facilities and pipelines

compendium spills from oil exploration and production operations as depicted in figure a1 oil extraction activities contribute approximately 1 of the total oil input to north american waters the vast majority 95 of this 1 oil extraction input comes from operational discharges which are regulated by clean water act permit system thus oil extraction spills represent on an annual basis only relatively minor only 005 component of the total input to north american waters however oil well blowouts from offshore oil extraction operations have historically been source of major oil spills the largest accidental oil spill in world history the ixtoc i estimated at 140 million gallons was due to an oil well blowout in mexican gulf coast waters in 1979139 1969 well blowout off the coast of santa barbara released approximately 4 million gallons into the environment and 138 see oil spill compendium at httpwwwuscgmilhqgcpcomrelfactfileindexhtm 139 nrc report p 33 crs39 has been credited with catalyzing some of the landmark environmental legislation of the 1970s the spill record for offshore platforms in federal waters140 was noteworthy during the 1980s and 1990s according to the minerals management service mms141 oil spill database there were oil spills over 1000 barrels142 from federally regulated offshore facilities between 1981 and 2001 figure a4 this effort was achieved in the context of increasing oil production on the outer continental shelf ocs143 since 2002 there have been six offshore facility spills in federal waters over 1000 barrels the largest estimated at 2000 barrels 84000 gallons annual spill volumes from offshore facilities in federal waters have increased in recent years figure a4 part of the recent increase in facility spill volume is attributable to more comprehensive reporting regime for example tanks or machines with oil that are lost at sea during hurricanes are now counted as spills144 as figure a4 indicates there were several years in which offshore pipelines contributed relatively minor or zero spill volume however periodic large spills generated the vast majority of the spill volume from offshore operations between 1985 and 2000 for example in 1988 there was only one pipeline spill over 1000 barrels but that one incident released 15576 barrels into the environment 654192 gallons the vast majority of the offshore spills in federal waters have taken place in the gulf of mexico in fact there have been only four spills greater than 50 barrels 2100 gallons in the pacific region since 1985 none occurring after 1996145 140 federal waters extend 200 nautical miles from shore but do not include the waters adjacent to shore that are under state control as discussed earlier in this report 141 the mms in the us department of

although figure a4 and the above discussion pertain only to federal waters there are numerous platforms and pipelines in state waters as well the majority of the oil extraction operations are located in state waters off the coast of louisiana and texas the precise volume and incident frequency in state waters are difficult to determine the nrc report describes the data as generally lacking146 but the report estimates that oil spills from operations in state waters account for twice the oil discharges of activities in federal waters147 this estimate is noteworthy considering that spills in state waters present potentially greater threat to the more sensitive shoreline environments 146 nrc report p 193 147 nrc report p 38 for other versions of this document see
