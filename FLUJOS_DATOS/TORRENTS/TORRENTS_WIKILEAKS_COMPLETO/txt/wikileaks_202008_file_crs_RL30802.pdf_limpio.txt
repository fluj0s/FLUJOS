more units and persons are needed than are in the regular components during the cold war era the reserve components were manpower pool that was rarely tapped for example from 1945 to 1989 reservists were involuntarily activated by the federal government only four times an average of less than once per decade since the end of the cold war however the nation has relied more heavily on the reserve components since 1990 reservists have been involuntarily activated by the federal government six times an average of once every three years including two largescale mobilizations for the persian gulf war 1990 91 and in the aftermath of the september 11 terrorist attacks 2001present this increasing use of the reserves has led to greater congressional interest in the various issues such as funding equipment and personnel policy that bear on the vitality of the reserve components this report is designed to provide an overview of key reserve component personnel issues this report provides insight

all reservists whether they are in the reserves or the national guard3 are assigned to one of three major reserve categories the ready reserve the standby reserve or the retired reserve reservists who are assigned to the ready reserve are further assigned to one of its three sub components the selected reserve the individual ready reserve irr or the inactive national guard ing the differences between each of these categories is explained below g22g145g142g561g20g142g138g141g162g561g20g142g156g142g155g159g142g561 the ready reserve is the primary manpower pool of the reserve components members of the ready reserve will usually be called to active duty before members of the standby reserve 4 or the retired reserve the ready reserve is made up of the selected reserve the individual ready reserve and the inactive national guard each of which is described below 1 the national defense authorization act for fy2006 pl 109163 section 515 changed the name of the naval reserve to the navy reserve 2 10 usc 10102 the language was recently changed by pl 108375 the ronald w reagan national defense authorization act for fy2005 prior to this change the language was as follows the purpose of each reserve component is to provide trained units and qualified persons available for active duty in the armed forces in time of war or national emergency and at such other times as the national security may require to fill the needs of the armed forces whenever during and after the period needed to procure and train additional units and qualified persons to achieve the planned mobilization more units and persons are needed than are in the regular components the change in statutory language as explained in house armed services committee report would clarify that the purpose of the reserve components is to provide trained units and qualified personnel not just as the result of involuntary mobilizations but whenever more units and persons are needed than are in the active component the revision recommended by this section more accurately reflects recent and future employments of the reserve com ponents hrept 108491 p 316 3 for discussion of the distinction between the reserves and the national guard see questions 5 and 11 4 units and members of the standby reserve may be involuntarily ordered to active duty under the provisions of 10 usc 12301a see question 9 full

section 12301a of this title unless the secretary concerned with the approval of the secretary of defense in the case of secretary of military department determines that there are not enough of the required kinds of units in the ready reserve that are readily available similar provision applies to members of the standby reserve not assigned to unit

to initial wartime missions that they have priority over all other reserves5 members of the selected reserve are generally required to perform one weekend of training each month inactive duty for training or idt also known colloquially as weekend drill and two weeks of training each year annual training or at sometimes known colloquially as summer camp for which they receive pay and benefits some members of the selected reserve perform considerably more military duty than this while others may only be required to perform the two weeks of annual training each year or other combinations of

individuals who have already received military training either in the active component or in the selected reserve7 members of the irr may be required to perform regular training although dod has not implemented such requirement since the 1950s members of the irr can volunteer for training or active duty assignments and they can also be involuntarily ordered to active duty under partial mobilization or full mobilization there is also category of the irr that can be activated during presidential reserve callup but at present there is one assigned to this category see question 9 for more information on mobilization authorities there is irr in the army national guard or the air national guard although there is an analogous category known as the inactive national guard see

national guard who are in an inactive status currently there is ing for the air national guard they are not required to participate in training as are members of the selected reserve however they are assigned to specific national guard unit and are required to meet with the unit once year8 members of the ing can be involuntarily ordered to active duty if the unit they are attached to is ordered to active duty as all national guard units are considered to be part of the selected reserve this means that members of the ing can be involuntarily ordered to active duty under presidential reserve call

september 30 2007 the total personnel strength of the ready reserve reported by dod was 1088587 this figure is broken down by service and category of reservist in table 1 in addition there were another 21218 members of the standby reserve and 656114 members of the retired reserve although these categories of reservists are much less likely to be mobilized than ready reservists additionally substantial percentage of the retired reserve would likely be unable to mobilize due to age and fitness it is worth noting that the fy2007 personnel strength of the selected reserve for the army national guard continued to grow completing eras ing the drop in strength that occurred in fy2004 and 2005 from the end of fy2003 to th end of fy2005 the army national guards selected reserve strength dropped from 351089 to 333177 by the end of fy2007 this had increased to 352707 almost 1 above the authorized endstrength of 350000 additionally for the second year the army reserve has halted the decline in strength which occurred in fy2004 and fy2005 although it has not been able to rebuild its strength to its authorized level from the end of fy2003 to the end of fy2005 the army reserves selected reserve strength dropped from 211890 to 189005 by the end of fy2006 it had inched up to 189975 at the end of fy2007 it stood at 189882 this is still 5 less than its fy2007 authorized

is an im portant distinction between the five reserve components which are purely federal entities the army reserve navy reserve marine corps reserve air force reserve and coast guard reserve and the two reserve components which are both federal and state entities the army national guard and the air national guard in this context the purely federal reserve components are sometimes referred to collectively as the reserves while the dual federalstate reserve components are referred to collectively as the national guard the reserves are of comparatively recent origin having all been established in the 20 th century they were organized under congress constitutional authority to raise and support armies and to provide and maintain navy19 the national guard has much longer historical pedigree it is descended from the colonial era militia20 which existed prior to the adoption of the constitution the constitution does however contain provisions that recognize the existence of the militia and that give the federal government certain amount of control over it21 unlike the reserves which are exclusively federal organizations the national guard is usually both state and federal organization the national guard of the united states is made up of 54 17 dodi 120518 8 18 dodi 120518 8 19 us constitution article 1 section 8 clauses 12 and 13 20 the colonial militia concept which was derived from l ongstanding english tradition and which required every able bodied white male to participate in the common defense of his town or locality was the backbone of colonial military power gradually as the colonial population grew and military threats waned distinction arose between the unorganized militia those members of the militia who were potentially liable for military service but who did not actively participate in military training and the organized militia those members of the militia who regularly trained for war and who responded first to military threats today the us code still recognizes the militia as consisting of all ablebodied males at least 17 years of age andunder 45 years of age who are or who have made declaration of intention to become citizens of the united states and of female citizens of the united states who are members of the national guard 10 usc 311 this provision of the law fu rther divides the militia into the organized militia and the unorganized militia and declares the national guard and the naval militia to be the organized militia at present the naval militia exists only in new rk new jersey ohio and

following words the role of our reserve forces is changing in the united states we have seen their traditional role which was to serve as manpower replacements in the event of some cataclysmic crisis utterly transformed they are longer serving as the force of last resort but as vital contributors on daytoday basis around the world22 his comments well supported by historical data at the time he made them became even more apt given the large reserve mobilization that has occurred since the september 11th terrorist attack on the united states during the cold war era the reserve components were manpower pool that was rarely tapped for example from 1945 to 1989 reservists were involuntarily activated for federal service23 only four times an average of less than once per decade these activations occurred only during wartime and national emergencies the korean war 19501953 857877 reservists involuntarily activated the berlin crisis 196162 148034 reservists involuntarily activated the cuban missile crisis 1962 14200 reservists involuntarily activated and the vietnam waruss pueblo crisis 196869 37643 reservists involuntarily activated since the end of the cold war however the nation has relied more heavily on the reserve components since 1990 reservists have been involuntarily activated for federal service six times an average of once every three years some of these activations have been directly related to war or armed conflict for example the persian gulf war 199091 238729 reservists involuntarily activated the lowintensity conflict with iraq 24 19982003 6108 reservists involuntarily 22 charles l cragin assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs remarks printed in the officer september 2000 34 23 this category excludes those who served on active duty under voluntary orders or annual training order and excludes members of the national guard serving in state status see question 11 additionally with the exception of those mobilized in response to the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 it excludes involuntary activations of reservists for domestic reasons such as responding to civic disorders 24 in the aftermath of the 1991 persian gulf war the unite d states maintained substantial military presence in the region in order to enforce the terms of the ceasefire agreem ents the united states used this military force to compel iraqi compliance with the terms of the cease fire agreements on number of occasions one of the most significant us confrontations with iraq began in late 1997 in response to iraqi interference in the conduct of weapons inspections as tensions with iraq mounted the united states began to build up its forces in the gulf region subsequently nearly constant lowintensity air war took place in and over iraq iraqi antiaircraft wea pons fired on us and allied aircraft the allies responded by bombarding these and other military targets on february 24 1998 president clinton ordered presidential reserve

with other related laws and administrative provisions prohibits the use of the military to execute civilian laws unless expressly authorized by the constitution or an act of congress as part of the military the reserve components are generally covered under these provisions and thus are restricted in the same way that active component forces are however there are important exceptions to this general rule first congress has made number of exceptions to the posse comitatus act which permit military involvement in law enforcement for example congress has enacted number of statutes which authorize the president to use military forces to suppress insurrections and domestic violence 30 if these statutes were to be invoked the president could use the reserve components in the same way as active component forces to put down rebellion or to control domestic violence another important exception relates to the coast guard which congress has vested with broad law enforcement authority under these statutory provisions the coast guard reserve can participate like its active component counterpart in the enforcement of maritime customs and certain other federal laws second when acting in its capacity as the organized militia of state the national guard is not part of the federal military and thus is not covered by the posse comitatus act only when it is called into federal service does the national guard become subject to the act as such the national guard can be used by state authorities to enforce the law for example while acting in state capacity the national guard has been used for riot control and counterdrug activities more recently it was used to provide increased security at airports throughout the country in the aftermath of the september 11 th terrorist attacks

g6g158g157g162g501g561 this section focuses primarily on the pay and benefits provided to participating members of the selected reserve when they are not serving on active duty in general when reservists are ordered to federal active duty for more than 30 days they receive pay and benefits virtually identical to those of active duty personnel although there are some exceptions31 when ordered to active duty for period of 30 days or less they receive most but not all of the pay and benefits that active duty personnel receive32 additionally reservists who are not on active duty receive different set of pay and benefits when they are serving in reserve component category other than the selected reserve33 and members of the national guard receive different set of pay and benefits when they are serving fulltime in state status34 g4g138g156g146g140g561g18g138g162g561 members of the selected reserve are generally required to work one weekend month called inactive duty for training or idt also known colloquially as weekend drill and two weeks per year called annual training or t also known colloquially as summer camp they are paid for this work according to the same basic pay table used for their active duty counterparts this table is based on both rank and years of service thus reservists and active duty personnel of the same rank and the same longevity fall into the same category for basic pay however reservists and active duty personnel do not always accrue credit for day of pay in the same manner during at reservists receive one day of basic pay for each day of duty just as active duty personnel receive one day of basic pay for each day of duty thus for typical two week long at reservist receives 14 days of pay however during idt reservists receive one day of pay for each unit training assembly uta they attend uta is generally fourhour period of instruction and there are usually four utas per drill weekend thus for each twoday long drill weekend reservists receive the equivalent of four days of basic pay during typical year then reservist might work 38 days 14 days of annual training plus 24 days of idt but receive the 31 for example one area in which benefits are not identical is reenlistment bonuses reservists serving on active duty who are eligible for reenlistment bonus may receive maximum bonus of 15000 37 usc 308b as opposed to maximum bonus of 90000 for active duty reenlistment bonuses 37 usc 308 however the reserve bonus is provided to the individual in exchange for continued reserve service while the active duty bonus is provided in exchange for continued active duty service another example which is beneficial to reservists concerns certain types of compensation for health care officers specifically the special pay provided by 37 usc 302 302a 302b 302c 302e and 303 while active component personnel must sign written agreement to serve for at least one year in order to receive certain types of special compensation 37 usc 302f waives this requirement for reserve officers on active duty under call or order to active duty of more than 30 days but less than one year and in certain other circumstances 32 for example they do not receive medical coverage for their families unless they have enrolled in the new premium based tricare insurance program see question 13 additionally those serving 30 days or less typically receive housing allowance known as bahii which is generally lower than the normal basic allowance for housing bah however these individuals receive the normal bah if they are serving in support of contingency operation such as operation enduring freedom or iraqi freedom see 37 usc 403g 33 members of the selected reserve receive the most generous package of pay and benefits alt hough retired reservistswhose retirement pay and benefits are deferred compensation for at least twenty years of active andor reserve servicereceive superior benefits in some respects members of the individual ready reserve and the standby reserve are generally not paid and are eligible for only few benefits 34 see questions 1012 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30802g20g142g156g142g155g159g142g561g5g152

generally not been entitled to military medical care during either idt or t but become eligible if the reservist was ordered to active duty for more than 30 days all of these provisions are still in

service is defined as year in which reservist has earned at least 50 retirement points reservists earn 15 retirement points per year simply for being member of the selected reserve one point for each unit training assembly uta one point for each day of annual training t and one point for each day of active duty points can also be earned for completing certain military correspondence courses earning 50 points in given year is usually not difficult for members of the selected reserv as attending all weekend drills and two weeks of annual training will generate 77 retirement points 37 point totals are also important because they are used to calculate retired pay see below excluding points earned while in an active duty status which includes annual training reservists may not earn more than 130 points per year 38 36 unlimited access to the commissary for members of the selected reserve and their family members was included in the fy2004 national defense authorization act pl 108136

pay eligibility age reservist is entitled to limited number of benefits including unlimited use of the military exchange commissary system and other military facilities and space available travel on military aircraft within the united states and its territories upon reaching the retired pay eligibility agewhich can range between 50 and 60 depending on how many days of certain types of duty the reservist performed during his career 39the retired reservist is eligible to receive retired pay at age 60 the retired reservist is entitled to benefits identical to those of active duty retirees including spaceavailable travel on military aircraft throughout the world and access to military medical care retired pay is calculated by totaling all the points earned during all the years of service and then dividing this sum by 360 this calculation produces the number of equivalent years of active duty service the reservist has performed the number of equivalent years is then multiplied by 25 to determine the retirement benefit multiplier this multiplier is then applied to an amount based on the monthly base pay earned by an active duty service member with similar rank and years of service40 for example reservist who accrues 2500 points over the course of 20 qualifying years would be deemed to have completed the equivalent of 694 years of active service 2500 divided by 360 this figure when multiplied by 25 produces multiplier of 173 assuming that the basic pay for an active duty servicemember with similar rank and longevity was 3000 per month the reservist would be entitled to retired pay in the amount of 519 per month 173 of 3000

additional ways in which members of the national guard can be called up in non federal status see question 11 these provisions differ from each other in terms of the statutory requirements for utilization the number and type of reservists called up and the duration of the call up depending on which of these provisions is utilized reserve activation is commonly referred to as either presidential reserve callup prc partial mobilization or full 39 this is recent change in the law based on section 647 of the national defense authorization act for fy2008 previously reservists became eligible for retired pay at age 60 see question 13 for more information 40 for reservists who entered the military before september 8 1980 the amount is the same as the base pay rate of an active duty service member with the same rank and years of service for reservists who entered military service on or after that date the amount is the average of the highest 36 months of basic pay he or she would

involuntarily ordered to active duty in the case of full mobilization see previous paragraph under this authority there is limit on the number of retired reservists who can be called to active duty and they may be kept on active duty for the duration of the war or emergency plus six months additionally the secretary of each military department has the authority to involuntarily order certain members of the retired reserve to 47 until recently dods general policy had been to mobilize rese rvists for more than one year while allowing the service secretaries to keep reservists on active duty for up to 24 cumulative months if they were needed to meet operational or other requirements reservist was allowed to serve beyond 24 cumulative months under the partial mobilization authority army reserve and national guard units deploying to iraq and afghanistan were typically mobilized for 18 months to provide for predeployment training oneyear tour in theater demobilization and the utilization of accrued leave prior to release from active duty on january 19 2007 secretary of defense robert gates established new policy with respect to the exercise of partial mobilization in support of these operations the new policy specified that from this point forward involuntary mobilization for members of the reserve forces shall be for maximum of one year at time at service discretion this period may exclude individual skill training required for deployment and postmobilization leavet he planning objective for involuntary mobilization of guardreserve units will remain one year mobilized to five year demobilized ratio however todays global demands will require number of selected guardreserve units to be remobilized sooner than this standard in practice this new policy limits reserve mobilizations to about 13 or 14 months at time for the vast majority of reservists the exception would be those reservist who need lengthy individual skill training to become qualified in their occupational specialty prior to deployment note however there is longer prohibition on serving more than 24 cumulative months under the partial mobilization authority this is c onsistent with the statutory language of 10 usc 12302 which only specifies 24 consecutiv month cap 48 section 12301a of title 10 usc states in time of war or of national emergency declared by the congress or when otherwise authorized by law an authority designated by the secretary concerned may without the consent of the persons affected order any unit and any member not assigned to unit organized to serve as unit of reserve component under the jurisdiction of that secretary to active duty for the duration of the war or emergency and for six months thereafter however member on an inactive status list or in retired status may not be ordered to active duty under this subsection unless the secretary concerned with the approval of the secretary of defense in the case of secretary of military department determines that there are not enough qualified reserves in an active status or in the inactive national guard in the required category who are readily available see footnote 42

mobilization of reservists in the aftermath of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks has been the largest since the korean war and one of the longest ongoing mobilizations ever some of these reservists have experienced financial losses when moving from their civilian jobs to full time military status these losses occur due to differences between the reservists military and civilian pay expenses incurred by reservists because of mobilization and the decline in business experienced by selfemployed reservists during and after release from active duty this has generated numerous complaints from mobilized reservists and helped generate congressional interest in the subject the 109 th congress enacted provision that provides special payment of up to 3000 to certain reservists who experience income loss while mobilized73 reservists who have experienced income loss become eligible for these payments in any full month of active duty following the month in which they complete 18 consecutive months of active duty under an involuntary mobilization order b complete 24 months of active duty under an involuntary mobilization order out of the previous 60 months or c are in
