appeals decision in rumsfeld v forum for academic and institutional rights fair5 by an 8 to 0 vote the high court unanimously rej ected arguments by the forum for academic and individual rights an association of law schools and prof essors that it was unconstitutional for the federal government to condition university funding on compliance with the solomon amendment th universities objected that because of the militarys don t ask dont tell policy per mitting recruiters on campus would undermine their policies against discrimination and that the federal law therefore violated their free speech rights divided third circuit panel agreed that the solomon amendment had compelled the law schools to convey messages of suppor t for the militarys policy of discriminatory exclusion in addition the appellate pane l relied on 2000 supreme court decision dale v boy scouts of america6 which held that the boy scouts have an expressive right to exclude gay scoutmast ers for the converse proposition that the nations universities have right to ex pressive associati on in opposing military recruiters where there is conflict betw een the dod stance on sexual orientation and academic nondiscrimin ation policies dod appealed the third circuits decisi on to the supreme court fairs core argument was that the solomon amendmen t amounts to an unconstitutional condition because it exacts penalty for the law schools engaging in first amendment expressive conduct wh ile the government may impose reasonable conditions on the receipt of federal largesse res pondents contended it cannot attach strings to benefit to produce result which it coul d not command directly7 when law school violates the equal access rule the government threatens loss of f unding not only to the law school but to the entire university thus they claimed requi ring equal access forces laws schools to propagate accommodate or subsidize an unwanted message8 the government countered by pointing to the plenary powers of congress to rai and support armies and to provide for the common defence9 the third circuit decision could undermine military recruitment in time of war it argued while neither the law schools right to free speech nor to expressi ve association were infringed by allowinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22405crs3 10 brief for the petitioners at 2 rumsfeld v fair 041152 filed july 2005 11

campus interviews10 in particular the solicitor general distinguished the boy scouts case in that recruiters are not part of the institution itself and do not become members through their recruiting activities11 recruiters speak for their employers the brief claims not the sc hools unlike the scoutmaster who represented the boy scouts in the earlier case moreover the government emphasized that the law schools remain free to protest th militarys message as long as they give recruiters equal access if the schools choose not to allow qual access it was argued they simply forego funding supreme court ruling in rumsfeld v fair chief justice roberts wrote the high c ourt opinion joined by all other members except justice alito who did not participate in the proceedings the court was generally receptive to each of the arguments proffered by the governments briefs and oral arguments in fair first the chief justice was unmoved by fairs theory of unconstitutional conditions largely because of fatal flaws he found in the law schools first amendment analysis this unsettled area of the law however may be further obscured by his observation that indirect compulsion by congress via funding condition cannot be unconstituti onal if it could be constitu tionally imposed directly whether this implies that congress may even legislate access for military recruiters to college campuses and elsewhere regardless of federal funding or federal policy with respect to all other recruiters may be fertile subject for future legal debates in addition broader questions could concei vably arise as to the legislative authority of congress to enact within constitutional bounds rules re garding military personnel and support that may incidentally impinge upon civilian affair s and the rights of private citizens in variety of other ways on the question of whether the solomon amendment impairs the first amendment rights of the objecting institutions the courts opinion rejected all three arguments put forward by the fair respondents first the chief justice observed while expressive conduct may be subject to first amendment scrutiny there is nothing in this case approaching governmentmandated pledge or motto that the school must endorse and it has never been deemed an abridgement of speech or press to make course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct was in part initiated evidenced or carried out by means of language12 otherwise practices having nothing to do with government dictating the content of speech expressing disapproval of the internal revenue service by refusing to pay taxes for example would enjoy first amendm ent protection requiring law schools to facilitate recruiters access by sending out emails and schedulin g military visits

the militarys message does not affect the law schools sp eech b ecause the schools are not speaking when they host interviews and recruiting receptions13 nor the opinion finds would they be endorsing or be s een as endorsing the military policies to which they object law schools decision to llow recruiters on campus is not inherently expressive14 secondly the court distinguished the doctrin of expressive association as applied in dale v boy scouts of america 15 if the government were free to restrict individuals ability to join together and speak it could essentially silence views that the first amendment is intended to protect16 such was not the situation here however according to the chief justice merely allowing recruiters on campus and providing them with the same services as other recru iters did not require the schools to associate with them nor did it prevent their expressing opposition to military policies in othe r ways they could put up signs they could picket they could make speeches and they could hold forums of protest moreover unlike the boy scouts case group membership practices or affiliations were implicated by the solomon amendment recruiters do not become components of the law schools like the scout leaders there but are by definition outsiders who come onto campus for limited purpose and not to become members of the schools expre ssive association finally the court recognized as beyond dispute that congress has broad and sweeping powers over military manpower and personnel matters including the authority to require campus access for military recruiters the exercise of which is generally entitled to judicial deference accordingly in rejecting fairs position the court concluded the issue is not whether other means of raising an army and providing for navy might be adequate regulations are not invalid simply because there is some other imaginable alternative that might be less burdensome on speech that is judgment for congress not the courts it suffice s that the means chosen by congress add to the effectiveness of military recruitment17 conclusion the fair decision may be less important for its first amendment teachings than for what the chief justices opinion implies regarding the scope of congress authority to prescribe rules in support of the armed fo rces and national defense concededly such suggestions are plainly dicta to its holding on fairs free speech claims which ultimately foundered on th shoals of the first amendment nonetheless they do evidence an emerging judicial consensus favoring deference to the congress where military manpower needs and possibly other na tional defense matters are concernedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22405crs5 even if alternatives with lesser impact on civilian popula tions and individual freedoms may be available nor arguably would it be necessary to couch c overage as condition to receipt of federal subsidies as does the solomon amendment since the chief justices opinion seems to conflate direct and indirect regulation in this context and to treat them as constitutionally equivalent suffice it to say that any fuller appraisal of the potential implications of the courts opinion in fair for questions of c ongressional power may have to await the outcome of litigation of any future issues that may arise
