6202c21 shspec114 use of prepchecking in prepchecking you are trying to find underlying overts that is what the when all who refers to you are not just getting withholds you are interested in chains of overts the anatomy of the mind is that the basic incident holds she chain of incidents in place you are not looking for the hidden part of single incident you are looking for the hidden earliest incident the pc sees only the most recent incident until you get him to asis by telling you the when all and who we arent looking for basicbasic on it because that is anchored in valence which you will only find in 3dxx prepchecking is limited to this lifetime the chain will blow if this lifetimes basic is found so what questions never apply to only one incident neither do the when all and who you have great fluidity in what questions you ask the what question however should be specific enough to find chain different dates come up on question two you try to clear the what youve got if you cant find the subsidiary chain and clear it if you cant clear that clear the subsidiary chain it depends on etc etc stay on the same subject the zero question is just rudiments question that gives starting point you can go with these by dynamics get kind of one question then follow that down to withhold and get real one question lrh has used eg for the initial one question what about your physical difficulties the question what physical difficulty would it be unsafe to reveal got list got an item reading well which now gives proper one question what about rectum trouble and one can go back to work the only riskiness in this case was that it led to an identity the pcs little brother we try not to use identities in prepchecking but if that is all you can get well the inevitable question if some subject doesnt clear up is what have you done to _______ there must be something there just from the basics of the overtmotivator sequence you dont treat every withhold as new what question when the pc gives one ask what about this chain of withholds that is you should phrase it as more general action but not so general as to take in the whole reactive bank you work your way down to something that clears then work on back you may get hung up along the way back requiring some new chain the pc could jump chains follow along as necessary but be sure to retrace your steps it all depends on the fact that hidden information exists on the chain someplace when you get that the whole chain will unravel the overt may be quite mild you are looking for needle in haystack so dont look just run the system and it will show up the best way to establish the question is by the approach described here it is called prepchecking because it is preparatory to clearing prepchecking gets the pcs rudiments sufficiently cleaned up so 3dxx can be done with more ease that is why the basic prepcheck questions are ruds questions for the withhold rud use form 3 see p 186 and form 6a see hcopl 3feb62 auditor processing check this is shortened form of form 6 and is intended for students who have done fair amount of auditing for problems you have the problems intensive you prepcheck the withholds the pc comes up with in prior confusion areas you can do the same with end ruds halftruths untruths etc for the question about influencing the emeter you can handle it more broadly with meters electronic gear mind reading etc so the pc can be at ease with the meter get his ruds in with thud and they wont get in the way during 3dxx when you change valences because of 3dxx new areas will come to view but finding new valence because of 3dxx doesnt mean the pc moves out of and abandons all his old valences the 3d problems mass pulls apart bit it has less influence on him than before but just before you find this the pc will dramatize the new valence coming up that dramatization influences the case and tends to throw ruds out put if the pc is already capable of being kept in session the influence of it is minimal you dont have to pay lot of attention to it the pc will have cognitions come up with withholds not as part of ruds but as part of 3dxx you could omit the prepcheck in fact but then the 3dxx would take about four times as long to do because of the upsets that 3dxx tends to produce anyway prepchecking tends to improve stability on case by handling ows so the pc is not in for big shock when running 3dxx uncovers new material well done prepcheck is like complete psychoanalysis every three or four hours person can become very morose upset and low doing 3dxx if you will ever have trouble with his ruds it is now so it is nice to be able to get ruds in prepchecking is also valuable just in itself after you have all the pcs terminals and oppterms all laid out on their line plot dont be sure that you have seen the last of prepchecking probably similar technique will be used to take these items to pieces therefore you are not concerned before you have the gpm isolated with any pastlife activity those are the withholds of whole life which you find with 3dxx since the basic holds the chain down you dont struggle too hard with some sticky withhold if it keeps reading and doesnt clean up with your 2 3 and 4 there is something else to look for
