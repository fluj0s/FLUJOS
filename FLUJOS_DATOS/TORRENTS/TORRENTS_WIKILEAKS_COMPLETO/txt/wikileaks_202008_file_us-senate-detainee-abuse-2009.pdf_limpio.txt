standards and values that dictate that we treat noncombatants and detainees with dignity and respect while we are warriors we are also all human beings general david petraeus may 102007 u the collection oftimelyandaccurateintelligence iscritical tothesafety ofus personnel deployed abroad and to the security ofthe american people here at home the methods by which we elicit intelligence information from detainees in our custody affect not only the reliability ofthat information but our broader efforts to win hearts and minds and attract allies to our side u ai qaeda and taliban terrorists are taught to expect americans to abuse them they are recruited based on false propaganda that says the united states is out to destroy islam treating detainees harshly only reinforces that distorted view increases resistance to cooperation and creates new enemies in fact the april 2006 national intelligence estimate trends in global terrorism implications for the united states cited pervasive anti us sentiment among most muslims as an underlying factor fueling the spread ofthe global jihadist movement former navy general counsel alberto mora testified to the senate armed services committee in june 2008 that there are serving us flagrank officers who maintain that the fitst and second identifiable causes of u s combat deaths in iraq as judged by their effectiveness in recruiting insurgent fighters into combat are respectively the symbols of abu ghraib and guantanamo u the abuse ofdetainees in us custody cannot simply be attributed to the actions of few bad apples acting on their own the fact is that senior officials in the united states government solicited information on how to use aggressive techniques redefined the law to create the appearance oftheir legality and authorized their use against detainees those efforts damaged our ability to collect accurate intelligence that could save lives strengthened the hand ofour enemies and compromised our moral authority this report is product ofthe committees inquiry into how those unfortunate results came about unclassified xii unclassified presidential order opens the door to considering aggressive techniques u u on february 72002 president bush signed memorandum stating that the third geneva convention did not apply to the conflict with qaeda and concluding that taliban detainees were not entitled to prisoner of war status or the legal protections afforded by the third geneva convention thepresidents order closed offapplication ofcommon article 3 ofthe geneva conventions which would have afforded minimum standards for humane treatment to qaeda or taliban detainees while the presidents order stated that as matter ofpolicy the united states armed forces shall continue to treat detainees humanely and to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity in manner consistent with the principles of the geneva conventions the decision to replace well established military doctrine ie legal compliance with the geneva conventions with policy subject to interpretation impacted the treatment ofdetainees in us custody u in december 2001 more than month before the president signed his memorandum the department of defense dod general counsels office had already solicited information on detainee exploitation from the joint personnel recovery agency jpra an agency whose expertise was in training american personnel to withstand interrogation techniques considered illegal under the geneva conventions u jpra is the dod agency that oversees military survival evasion resistance and escape sere training during the resistance phase of sere training us military personnel are exposed to physical and psychological pressures sere techniques designed to simulate conditions towhich they might besubject iftaken prisoner byenemies that didnot abide bythe geneva conventions as one jpra instructor explained sere training is based on illegal exploitation under the rules listed in the 1949 geneva convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war ofprisoners over the last 50 years the techniques used in sere school based in part on chinese communist techniques used during the korean war to elicit false confessions include stripping students oftheir clothing placing them in stress positions putting hoods over their heads disrupting their sleep treating them like animals subjecting them to loud music and flashing lights and exposing them to extreme temperatures it can also include face and body slaps and until recently for some who attended the navys sere school it included waterboarding u typically those who play the part ofinterrogators in sere school neither are trained interrogators nor are they qualified to be these role players are not trained to obtain reliable intelligence information from detainees their job is to train our personnel to resist providing reliable infonnation to our enemies as the deputy commander for the joint forces command jfcom jpras higher headquarters put it the expertise ofjpra lies in training personnel how to respond and resist interrogations not in how to conduct interrogations given jpras role and expertise the request from the dod general counsels office was unusual in fact the committee is not aware ofany similar request prior to december 2001 but while it may have been the fast that was not the last time that senior government official contacted jpra for unclassified xiii unclassified advice on using sere methods offensively in fact the call from the dod general counsels office marked just the beginning of jpras support ofus government interrogation efforts senior officials seek sere techniques and discuss detainee interrogations u u beginning in the spring of 2002 and extending for the next two years jpra supported us government efforts to interrogate detainees duringthat same period senior government officials solicited jpras knowledge and its direct support for interrogations while much oftheinformation relating to jpras offensive activities andthe influence ofsere techniques on interrogation policies remains classified unclassified information provides window into the extent ofthose activities u jpras chief of staff lieutenant colonel daniel baumgartner testified that in late 2001 or early 2002 jpra conducted briefings of defense intelligence agency dia personnel on detainee resistance techniques and information on detainee exploitation u on april 16 2002 dr bruce jessen the senior sere psychologist at jpra circulated draft exploitation plan to jpra commander colonel randy mouhon and other senior officials at the agency the contents ofthat plan remain classified but dr jessens initiative isindicative oftheinterest ofjpras senior leadership inexpanding the agencys role u one opportunity came in july 2002 that month dod deputy general counsel for intelligence richard shiffrin contacted jpra seeking information on sere physical pressures and interrogation techniques that had been used against americans mr shiffiin called jpra after discussions with william jim haynes ii the dod general counsel u in late july jpra provided the general counsels office with several documents including excerpts from sere instructor lesson plans list ofphysical and psychological pressures used in sere resistance training and memo from sere psychologist assessing the longterm psychological effects of sere resistance training on students and the effects of waterboarding the list of sere techniques included such methods as sensory deprivation sleep disruption stress positions waterboarding and slapping it also made reference to section ofthe jpra instructor manual that discusses coercive pressures such as keeping the lights on at all times and treating person like an animal jpras chief of staff lieutenant colonel daniel baumgartner who spoke with mr shiffiin at the time thought the general counsels office was asking for the information on exploitation and physical pressures to use them in interrogations and he said that jfcom gave approval to provide the agency the information mr shiffiin the dod deputy general counsel for intelligence confmned that purpose ofthe request was to reverse engineer the techniques mr haynes could not recall what he did with the information provided by jpra u memos from lieutenant colonel baumgartner to the office of secretary ofdefense general counsel stated that jpra would continue to offer exploitation assistance to those government organizations charged with the mission of gleaning intelligence from enemy unclassified unclassified detainees lieutenant colonel baumgartner testified that he provided another government agency the same information he sent to the dod general counsels office u mr haynes was not the only senior official considering new interrogation techniques for use against detainees members ofthe presidents cabinet and other senior officials attended meetings in the white house where specific interrogation techniques were discussed secretary of state condoleezza rice who was then the national security advisor said that in the spring of2002 cia sought policy approval from the national security council nsc to begin an interrogation progtam for highlevel alqaida terrorists secretary rice said that she asked director of central intelligence george tenet to briefnsc principals on the program and asked the attorney general john ashcroft personally to review and confrrm the legal advice prepared by the office of legal counsel she also said that secretary ofdefense donald rumsfeld participated inthe nsc review ofthe cias program u asked whether she attended meetings where sere training was discussed secretary rice stated that she recalled being told that us military personnel were subjected in training to certain physical and psychological interrogation techniques national security council nsc legal advisor john bellinger said that he was present in meetings at which sere training was discussed department of justice redermes torture d u on august 1 2002 just week after jpra provided the dod general counsels office the list of sere techniques and the memo on the psychological effects of sere training the department of justices office of legal counsel olc issued two legal opinions the opinions were issued after consultation with senior administration attorneys including then white house counsel alberto gonzales and thencounsel to the vice president david addington both memos were signed by thenassistant attorney general for the office oflegal counsel jay bybee one opinion commonly known as the first bybee memo was addressed to judge gonzales and provided oles opinion on standards of conduct in interrogation required under the federal torture statute that memo concluded for an act to constitute torture as defmed in the federal torture statute it must inflict pain that is difficult to endure physical pain amounting to torture must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury such as organ failure impairment of bodily function or even death for purely mental pain or suffering to amount to torture under the federal torture statute it must result in significant psychological harm of significant duration eg lasting for months or even years u in his book the terror presidency jack goldsmith the former assistant attorney general ofthe olc who succeeded mr bybee in that job described the memos conclusions unclassified xv unclassified violent acts arent necessarily torture if you do torture you probably have defense and even if you dont have defense the torture law doesnt apply ifyou act under the color of presidential authority u the other olc opinion issued on august 12002 is known commonly as the second bybee memo that opinion which responded to request from the ci addressed the legality ofspecificinterrogation tactics whilethefulllist oftechniques remainsclassified apublicly released cia document indicates that waterboarding was among those analyzed and approved cia director general michael hayden stated in public testimony before the senate intelligence committee on february 5 2008 that waterboarding was used by the cia and steven bradbury the current assistant attorney general ofthe olc testified before the house judiciary committee on february 142008 that the cias use of waterboarding was adapted from the sere training program u before drafting the opinions mr y00 the deputy assistant attorney general for the olc had met with alberto gonzales counsel to the president and david addington counsel to the vice president to discuss the subjects he intended to address in the opinions in testimony before the house judiciary committee mr y00 refused to say whether or not he ever discussed or received information about sere techniques as the memos were being drafted when asked whether he had discussed sere techniques with judge gonzales mr addington mr yoo mr rizzo or other senior administration lawyers dod general counsel jim haynes testified that he did discuss sere techniques with other people in the administration nsc legal advisor john bellinger said that some ofthe legal analyses ofproposed interrogation techniques that wereprepared bythe department ofjustice didrefer tothepsychological effects ofresistance training u in fact jay bybee the assistant attorney general who signed the two olc legal opinions said that he saw an assessment ofthe psychological effects ofmilitary resistance training in july 2002 in meetings in his office with john yoo and two other olc attorneys judge bybee said that he used that assessment to inform the august 1 2002 olc legal opinion that has yet to be publicly released judge bybee also recalled discussing detainee interrogations in meeting with attorney general john ashcroft and john y00 in late july 2002 prior to signing the olc opinions mr bellinger the nsc legal advisor said that the nscs principals reviewed cias proposed program on several occasions in 2002 and 2003 and that he expressed concern that the proposed cia interrogation techniques comply with applicable u s law including our international obligations jpra and cia influence department of defense interrogation policies u u as senior government lawyers were preparing to redefine torture jpra responding to request from us southern commands joint task force 170 jtf170 at guantanamo bay gtmo was finalizing plans to train jtf170 personnel during the week ofseptember 16 2002 group ofinterrogators and behavioral scientists from gtmo travelled to fort bragg north carolina and attended training conducted by instructors from jpras sere school on september 25 2002 just days after gtmo staffreturned from that training delegation of unclassified xvi unclassified senior administration lawyers including mr haynes mr rizzo and mr addington visited gtmo u week after the visit from those senior lawyers two gtmo behavioral scientists who had attended the jpraied training at fort bragg drafted memo proposing new interrogation techniques for use at gtmo according to one ofthose two behavioral scientists by early october 2002 there was increasing pressure to get tougher with detainee interrogations he added that ifthe interrogation policy memo did not contain coercive techniques then it wasnt going to go very far u jpra was not the only outside organization that provided advice to gtmo on aggressive techniques on october 2 2002 jonathan fredman who was chief counsel to the cias counterterrorist center attended meeting ofgtmo staff minutes ofthat meeting indicate that it was dominated by discussion ofaggressive interrogation techniques including sleep deprivation death threats and waterboarding which was discussed in relation to its use in sere training mr fredmans advice to gtmo on applicable legal obligations was similar to the analysis ofthose obligations in olcs first bybee memo according to the meeting minutes mr fredman said that the language ofthe statutes is written vaguely severe physical pain described as anything causing permanent damage to major organs or body parts mental torture is described as anything leading to permanent profound damage to the senses or personality mr fredman said simply it is basically subject to perception ifthe detainee dies youre doing it wrong uonoctober 112002 major general michael dunlavey thecommander ofjtf170 at guantanamo bay sent memo to general james hill the commander of us southern command soufhcom requesting authority to use aggressive interrogation techniques several ofthe techniques requested were similar to techniques used by lpra and the military services in sere training including stress positions exploitation ofdetainee fears such as fear ofdogs removal ofclothing hooding deprivation of light and sound and the socalled wet towel treatment or the waterboard some ofthe techniques were even referred to as those used in us military interrogation resistance training lieutenant colonel diane beaver gtmos staff judge advocate wrote an analysis justifying the legality ofthe techniques though she expected that broader legal review conducted at more senior levels would follow her own on october 25 2002 general hill forwarded the gtmo request from major general dunlavey to general richard myers thechairman ofthejoint chiefs ofstaff days later thejoint staff solicited the views ofthe military services on the request u plans to use aggressive interrogation techniques generated concerns by some at gtmo thedeputy commander ofthedepartment ofdefenses criminal investigative task force citf at gtmo told the committee that sere techniques were developed to better prepare us military personnel to resist interrogations and not as means ofobtaining reliable information and that citf was troubled with the rationale that techniques used to harden resistance to interrogations would be the basis for the utilization oftechniques to obtain information concerns were not limited to the effectiveness ofthe techniques in obtaining reliable information gtmos request gave rise to significant legal concerns as well unclassified xvii unclassified military lawyers raise red flags and joint staff review quashed d u in early november 2002 in series of memos responding to the joint staffs call for comments on gtmos request the military services identified serious legal concerns about the techniques and called for additional analysis u the air force cited serious concerns regarding the legality of many ofthe proposed techniques and stated that techniques described may be subject to challenge as failing to meet therequirements outlined inthemilitary order totreat detainees humanely the air force also called for an in depth legal review ofthe request u citfs chief legal advisor wrote that certain techniques in gtmos october 11 2002 request may subject service members topunitive articles ofthe uniform code ofmilitary justice called the utility and legality ofapplying certain techniques in the request questionable and stated that he could not advocate any action interrogation or otherwise that ispredicated upon theprinciple that alliswell ifthe ends justify themeans andothers arenot aware ofhow we conduct our business u the chief ofthe armys international and operational law division wrote that techniques like stress positions deprivation of light and auditory stimuli and use of phobias to induce stress crosses the line of humane treatment would likely be considered maltreatment under the ucmj and may violate the torture statute the army labeled gtmos request legally insufficient and called for additional review u the navy recommended more detailed interagency legal and policy review ofthe request and the marine corps expressed strong reservations stating that several techniques in the request arguably violate federal law and would expose our service members to possible prosecution the marine corps also said the request was not legally sufficient and like the other services called for more thorough legal and policy review u thencaptain now rear admiral jane dalton legal counsel to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said that her staff discussed the military services concerns with the dod general counsels office at the time and that the dod general counsel jim haynes was aware ofthe services concerns mr haynes on the other hand testified that he did not know that the memos from the military services existed statement he later qualified by stating that he was not sure he knew they existed eliana davidson the dod associate deputy general counsel for international affairs said that she told the general counsel that the gtmo request needed further assessment mr haynes did not recall ms davidson telling him that u captain dalton who was the chairmans legal counsel said that she had her own concerns with the gtmo request and directed her staff to initiate thorough legal and policy review ofthetechniques that review however was cutshort captain dalton saidthat general myers returned from meeting and advised her that mr haynes wanted her to stop her review unclassified xviii unclassified in part because of concerns that people were going to see the gtmo request and the military services analysis ofit neither general myers nor mr haynes recalled cutting short the dalton review though neither has challenged captain daltons recollection captain dalton testified that this occasion marked the only time she had ever been told to stop analyzing request that came to her for review secretary ofdefense rumsfeld approves aggressive techniques u u with respect to gtmos october 11 2002 request to use aggressive interrogation techniques mr haynes said that there was sense by the dod leadership that this decision was taking too long and that secretary rumsfeld told his senior advisors i need recommendation on november 27 2002 the secretary got one notwithstanding the serious legal concerns raised by the military services mr haynes sent one page memo to the secretary recommending that he approve all but three ofthe eighteen techniques in the gtmo request techniques such as stress positions removal of clothing use ofphobias such as fear of dogs and deprivation oflight and auditory stimuli were all recommended for approval u mr hayness memo indicated that he had discussed the issue with deputy secretary ofdefense paul wolfowitz under secretary ofdefense for policy doug feith and general myers and that he believed they concurred in his recommendation when asked what he relied on to make his recommendation that the aggressive techniques be approved the only written legal opinion mr haynes cited was lieutenant colonel beavers legal analysis which senior military lawyers had considered legally insufficient and woefully inadequate and which ltc beaver herself had expected would be supplemented with review by persons with greater experience than her own u on december 22002 secretary rumsfeld signed mr hayness recommendation adding handwritten note that referred to limits proposed in the memo on the use ofstress positions i stand for 810 hours day why is standing limited to 4 hours u sere school techniques are designed to simulate abusive tactics used by our enemies there are fundamental differences between sere school exercise and real world interrogation at sere school students are subject to an extensive medical and psychological prescreening prior to being subjected to physical and psychological pressures the schools impose strict limits on the frequency duration andor intensity of certain techniques psychologists are present throughout sere training to intervene should the need arise and to help students cope with associated stress and sere school is voluntary students are even given special phrase they can use to immediately stop the techniques from being used against them u neither those differences nor the serious legal concerns that had been registered stopped the secretary ofdefense from approving the use ofthe aggressive techniques against detainees moreover secretary rumsfeld authorized the techniques without apparently providing any written guidance as to how they should be administered unclassified xix unclassified sere techniques at gtmo u u following the secretarys december 2 2002 authorization senior staff at gtmo began drafting standard operating procedure sop specifically for the use ofsere techniques in interrogations the draft sop itself stated that the premise behind this is that the interrogation tactics used at us military sere schools are appropriate for use in realworld interrogations these tactics and techniques are used at sere school to break sere detainees the same tactics and techniques can be used to break real detainees during interrogation the draft gtmo sere sop described how to slap strip and place detainees in stress positions it also described other sere techniques such as hooding manhandling and walling detainees u on december 302002 two instructors from the navy sere school arrived at gtmo the next day in session with approximately 24 interrogation personnel the two sere instructors demonstrated how to administer stress positions and various slapping techniques according to two interrogators those who attended the training even broke off into pairs to practice the techniques u exemplifying the disturbing nature and substance ofthe training the sere instructors explained bidermans principles which were based on coercive methods used by the chinese communist dictatorship to elicit false confessions from us pows during the korean war and left with gtmo personnel chart ofthose coercive techniques three days after they conducted the training the sere instructors met with gtmos commander major general geoffrey miller according to some who attended that meeting major general miller stated that he did not want his interrogators using the techniques that the navy sere instructors had demonstrated that conversation however took place after the training had already occurred and not all ofthe interrogators who attended the training got the message u at about the same time dispute over the use ofaggressive techniques was raging at gtmo over theinterrogation ofmohammed alkhatani ahigh value detainee personnel from citf and the federal bureau ofinvestigations fbi had registered strong opposition to interrogation techniques proposed for use on khatani and made those concerns known to the dod general counsels office despite those objections an interrogation plan that included aggressive techniques was approved the interrogation itself which actually began on november 232002 week before the secretarys december 22002 grant ofblanket authority for the use ofaggressive techniques continued through december and into midjanuary 2003 u nsc legal advisor john bellinger said that on several occasions deputy assistant attorney general bruce swartz raised concerns with him about allegations of detainee abuse at gtmo mr bellinger said that in tum he raised these concerns on several occasions with dod officials and was told that the allegations were being investigated by the naval criminal investigative service thennational security advisor condoleezza rice said that mr bellinger also advised her on regular basis regarding concerns and issues relating to dod detention policies and practices at guantanamo she said that as result she convened series unclassified 11 unclassified ofmeetings ofnsc principals in 2002 and 2003 to discuss various issues and concerns relating to detainees in the custody ofthe department of defense u between middecember 2002 and midjanuary 2003 navy general counsel alberto mora spoke with the dod general counsel three times to express his concerns about interrogation techniques at gtmo at one point telling mr haynes that he thought techniques that had been authorized by the secretary ofdefense could rise to the level oftorture on january 152003 having received word that the secretarys authority would be withdrawn mr mora went so far as to deliver draft memo to mr hayness office memorializing his legal concerns about the techniques in subsequent phone call mr mora told mr haynes he would sign his memo later that day unless he heard defmitively that the use ofthe techniques was suspended in meeting that same day mr haynes told mr mora that the secretary would rescind the techniques secretary rumsfeld signed memo rescinding authority for the techniques on january 152003 u that same day gtmo suspended its use ofaggressive techniques on khatani while key documents relating to the interrogation remain classified published accounts indicate that military working dogs had been used against khatani he had also been deprived of adequate sleep for weeks on end stripped naked subjected to loud music and made to wear leash and perform dog tricks in june 3 2004 press briefing southcom commander general james hill traced the source oftechniques used on khatani back to sere stating the staff at guantanamo working with behavioral scientists having gone up to our sere school and developed list oftechniques which our lawyers decided and looked at said were ok general hill said we began to use few ofthose techniques on this individual u on may 13 2008 the pentagon announced in written statement that the convening authority for military commissions dismissed without prejudice the sworn charges against mohamed khatani the statement does not indicate the role his treatment may have played in that decision dod working group ignores military lawyers and relies on olc d u on january 15 2003 the same day he rescinded authority for gtmo to use aggressive techniques secretary rumsfeld directed the establishment ofa working group to review interrogation techniques for the next few months senior military and civilian lawyers tried without success to have their concerns about the legality ofaggressive techniques reflected in the working groups report their arguments were rejected in favor ofa legal opinion from the department of justices office oflegal counsels olc john yoo mr yoos opinion the final version of which was dated march 142003 had been requested by mr haynes at the initiation ofthe working group process and repeated much of what the first bybee memo had said six months earlier u the first bybee memo dated august 1 2002 had concluded that to violate the federal torture statute physical pain that resulted from an act would have to be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury such as organ failure impairment of unclassified xxi unclassified bodily function or even death mr yoos march 14 2003 memo stated that criminal laws such as the federal torture statute would not apply to certain military interrogations and that interrogators could not be prosecuted by the justice department for using interrogation methods that would otherwise violate the law u though the final working group report does not specifically mention sere the list ofinterrogation techniques it evaluated and recommended for approval suggest the influence of sere removal ofclothing prolonged standing sleep deprivation dietary manipulation hooding increasing anxiety through the use ofa detainees aversions like dogs and face and stomach slaps were all recommended for approval u on april 16 2003 less than two weeks after the working group completed its report the secretary authorized the use of24 specific interrogation techniques for use at gtmo while the authorization included such techniques as dietary manipulation environmental manipulation and sleep adjustment it was silent on many ofthe techniques in the working group report secretary rumsfelds memo said however that if in your view you require additional interrogation techniques for particular detainee you should provide via the chairman ofthe joint chiefs of staff written request describing the proposed technique recommended safeguards and the rationale for applying it with an identified detainee u just few months later one such request for additional interrogation techniques arrived on secretary rumsfelds desk the detainee was mohamedou quid slahi while documents relating to the interrogation plan for slahi remain classified may 2008 report from the department ofjustice inspector general includes declassified information suggesting the plan included hooding slahi and subjecting him to sensory deprivation and sleep adjustment the inspector generals report says that an fbi agent who saw draft ofthe interrogation plan said it was similar to khatanis interrogation plan secretary rumsfeld approved the slahi plan on august 13 2003 aggressive techniques authorized in afghanistan and iraq u u shortly after secretary rumsfelds december 22002 approval ofhis general counsels recommendation to authorize aggressive interrogation techniques the techniques and the fact the secretary had authorized them became known to interrogators in mghanistan copy ofthe secretarys memo was sent from gtmo to mghanistan captain carolyn wood the officer in charge ofthe intelligence section at bagram airfield in mghanistan said that in january 2003 she saw power point presentation listing the aggressive techniques that had been authorized by the secretary u despite the secretarys january 152003 rescission ofauthority for gtmo to use aggressive techniques his initial approval six weeks earlier continued to influence interrogation policies u on january 24 2003 nine days after secretary rumsfe1d rescinded authority for the techniques at gtmo the staff judge advocate for combined joint task force 180 cjtf180 unclassified xxii unclassified us central commands centcom conventional forces in afghanistan

made their way to iraq according to the department ofdefensedodinspector general lg atthebeginning oftheiraqwar special mission unit forces in iraq used january 2003 standard operating procedure sop which had been developed for operations in afghanistan according to the dod ig the afghanistan sop had been influenced by the counterresistance memorandum that the secretary of defense approved on december 2 2002 and incorporated techniques designed for detainees who were identified as unlawful combatants subsequent battlefield interrogation sops included techniques such as yelling loud music and light control environmental manipulation sleep deprivationadjustment stress positions 20hour interrogations and controlled fear muzzled dogs u techniques approved by the secretary ofdefense in december 2002 reflect the influence ofsere and not only did those techniques make their way into official interrogation policies in iraq but instructors from the jpra sere school followed the dod ig reported that in september 2003 at the request ofthe commander ofthe special mission unit task force jpra deployed team to iraq to assist interrogation operations during that trip which was explicitly approved by us joint forces command jpras higher headquarters sere instructors were authorized to participate in the interrogation ofdetainees in us military custody using sere techniques u in september 2008 testimony before the senate armed services committee colonel steven kleinman an air force reservist who was member ofthe interrogation support team sent by jpra to the special mission unit task force in iraq described abusive interrogations he witnessed and intervened to stop during that trip colonel kleinman said that one ofthose interrogations which took place in room painted all in black with spotlight on the detainee the interrogator repeatedly slapped detainee who was kneeling on the floor in front ofthe interrogator in another interrogation colonel kleinman said the two other members ofthe jpra team took hooded detainee to bunker at the task force facility forcibly stripped him naked and left him shackled by the wrist and ankles to stand for 12 hours u interrogation techniques used by the special mission unit task force eventually made their way into standard operating procedures sops issued for all us forces in iraq in the summer of2003 captain wood who by that time was the interrogation officer in charge at abu ghraib obtained copy ofthe special mission unit interrogation policy and submitted it virtually unchanged to her chain ofcommand as proposed policy unclassified xxiii unclassified u captain wood submitted her proposed policy around the same time that message was being conveyed that interrogators should be more aggressive with detainees in midaugust 2003 an email from staffat combined joint task force 7 cjtf7 headquarters in iraq requested that subordinate units provide input for wish list of interrogation techniques stated that the gloves are coming off and said we want these detainees broken at the end of august 2003 major general geoffrey miller the gtmo commander led team to iraq to assess interrogation and detention operations colonel thomas pappas the commander ofthe 20sth military intelligence brigade who met with major general miller during that visit said that the tenor ofthe discussion was that we had to get tougher with the detainees chief warrant officer with the iraq survey group isg said that during major general millers tour ofthe isgs facility major general miller said the isg was running country club for detainees u on september 142003 the commander ofcjtf7 lieutenant general ricardo sanchez issued the first cjtf7 interrogation sop that sop authorized interrogators in iraq to use stress positions environmental manipulation sleep management and military working dogs in interrogations lieutenant general sanchez issued the september 14 2003 policy with the knowledge thatthere wereongoing discussions about thelegalityofsomeoftheapproved techniques responding to legal concerns from centcom lawyers about those techniques lieutenant general sanchez issued new policy on october 122003 eliminating many ofthe previously authorized aggressive techniques the new policy however contained ambiguities with respect to certain techniques such as the use ofdogs in interrogations and led to confusion about which techniques were permitted u in his report ofhis investigation into abu ghraib major general george fay said that interrogation techniques developed for gtmo became confused and were implemented at abu ghraib for example major general fay said that removal ofclothing while not included in cjtfts sop was imported to abu ghraib could be traced through mghanistan and gtmo and contributed to an environment at abu ghraib that appeared to condone depravity and degradation rather than humane treatment ofdetainees major general fay said that the policy approved by the secretary ofdefense on december 22002 contributed to the use of aggressive interrogation techniques at abu ghraib in late 2003 olc withdraws legal opinion jfcom issues guidance on jpra offensive support u u as the events at abu ghraib were unfolding jack goldsmith the new assistant attorney general for theofficeoflegal counsel waspresented witha shortstackof0leopinions that were described to him as problematic included in that short stack were the bybee memos of august 12002 and mr yoos memo ofmarch 2003 after reviewing the memos mr goldsmith decided to rescind both the socalled first bybee memo and mr yoos memo in late december 2003 mr goldsmith notified mr haynes that dod could longer rely on mr yoos memo in determining the lawfulness ofinterrogation techniques the change in ole guidance however did not keep jpra from making plans to continue their support to interrogation operations in fact it is not clear that the agency was even aware ofthe change unclassified xxiv unclassified u in 2004 jpra and centcom took steps to send jpra training team to afghanistan to assist in detainee interrogations there in the wake ofthe public disclosure of detainee abuse at abu ghraib however that trip was cancelled and jfcom subsequently issued policy guidance limiting jpras support to interrogations u on september 29 2004 major general james soligan jfcoms chief of stati issued memorandum referencing jpras support to interrogation operations major general soligan wrote recent requests from the office of the secretary of defense and the combatant commands have solicited jpra support based on knowledge and information gained through the debriefing of former us pows and detainees and their application to us strategic debriefmg and interrogation techniques these requests which can be characterized as offensive support go beyond the chartered responsibilities of jpra the use of resistance to interrogation knowledge for offensive purposes lies outside the roles and responsibilities of jpra u lieutenant general robert wagner the deputy commander ofjfcom later called requests for jpra interrogation support inconsistent with the units charter and said that such requests might create conditions which tasked jpra to engage in offensive operational activities outside ofjpras defensive mission u interrogation policies endorsed by senior military and civilian officials authorizing theuse ofharshinterrogation techniques werea majorcause oftheabuse ofdetainees in us custody the impact ofthose abuses has been significant in 2007 international bbc poll only 29 percent of people around the world said the united states is generally positive influence in the world abu ghraib and guantanamo have lot to do with that perception the fact that america is seen in negative light by so many complicates our ability to attract allies to our side strengthens the hand of our enemies and reduces our ability to collect intelligence that can save lives u it is particularly troubling that senior officials approved the use ofinterrogation techniques that were originally designed to simulate abusive tactics used by our enemies against our own soldiers and that were modeled in part on tactics used by the communist chinese to elicit false confessions from us military personnel while some argue that the brutality and disregard for human life shown by qaeda and taliban terrorists justifies us treating them harshly general david petraeus explained why that view is misguided in may 2007 letter to his troops general petraeus said our values and thelaws governing warfare teach us to respect human dignity maintain our integrity and do what is right adherence to our values distinguishes us from our enemy this fight depends on securing the population which must understand that we not our enemies occupy the moral high ground unclassified xxv unclassified senate aimed services committee conclusions conclusion 1 on february 72002 president george w bush made written determination that common article 3 ofthe geneva conventions which would have afforded minimum standards for humane treatment did not apply to qaeda or taliban detainees following the presidents determination techniques such as waterboarding nudity and stress positions used in sere training to simulate tactics used by enemies that refuse to follow the geneva conventions were authorized for use in interrogations of detainees in us custody conclusion 2 members of the presidents cabinet and other senior officials participated in meetings inside the white house in 2002 and 2003 where specific interrogation techniques were dscussed national security council principals reviewed the cias interrogation program during that period conclusions on sere training techniques and interrogations conclusion 3 theuse oftechniques similar tothose used insere resistance training such as stripping students oftheir clothing placing them instress positions putting hoods over their heads and treating them like animals was at odds with the commitment to humane treatment of detainees in us custody using those techniques for interrogating detainees was also inconsistent with the goal of collecting accurate intelligence information as the purpose of sere resistance training is to increase the ability of u s personnel to resist abusive interrogations and the techniques used were based in part on chinese communist techniques used during the korean war to elicit false confessions conclusion 4 the use oftechniques in interrogations derived from sere resistance training created serious risk of physical and psychological harm to detainees the sere schools employ strict controls to reduce the risk of physical and psychological harm to students during training those controls include medical and psychological screening for students interventions by trained psychologists during training and code words to ensure that students can stop the application ofatechnique atanytime should theneed arise those same controls arenotpresent in real world interrogations conclusions on senior official consideration of sere techniques for interrogations conclusion 5 injuly 2002 theoffice ofthesecretary ofdefense general counsel solicited information from the joint personnel recovery agency jpra on sere techniques for use during interrogations that solicitation prompted by requests from department ofdefense general counsel william j haynes ii reflected the view that abusive tactics similar to those used by our enemies should be considered for use against detainees in us custody conclusion 6 the central intelligence agencys cia interrogation program included at least one sere training technique waterboarding senior administration lawyers including alberto unclassified xxvi unclassified gonzales counsel to the president and david addington counsel to the vice president were consulted on the development oflegal analysis ofcia interrogation techniques legal opinions subsequently issued bythedepartment ofjustices office oflegal counsel olc interpreted legal obligations under us antitorture laws and determined the legality ofcia interrogation techniques those olc opinions distorted the meaning and intent ofantitorture laws rationalized the abuse ofdetainees in us custody and influenced department ofdefense determinations as to what interrogation techniques were legal for use during interrogations conducted by us military personnel conclusions on jpra offensive activities conclusion 7 joint personnel recovery agency jpra efforts in support ofoffensive interrogation operations went beyond the agencys knowledge and expertise jpras support to us government interrogation efforts contributed to detainee abuse jpras offensive support also influenced the development ofpolicies that authorized abusive interrogation techniques for use against detainees in us custody conclusion 8 detainee abuse occurred during jpras support to special mission unit smu task force tf interrogation operations in iraq in september 2003 jpra commander colonel randy moultons authorization ofsere instructors who had experience in detainee interrogations to actively participate in task force interrogations using sere resistance training techniques was serious failure in judgment the special mission unit task force commanders failure to order that sere resistance training techniques not be used in detainee interrogations was serious failure in leadership that led to the abuse ofdetainees in task force custody iraq is geneva convention theater and techniques used in sere school are inconsistent with the obligations of us personnel under the geneva conventions conclusion 9 combatant command requests for jpra offensive interrogation support and us joint forces command jfcom authorization ofthat support led to jpra operating outside the agencys charter and beyond its expertise only when jfcoms staff judge advocate became aware ofand raised concerns about jpras support to offensive interrogation operations in late september 2003 did jfcom leadership begin to take steps to curtail jpras offensive activities it was not until september 2004 however that jfcom issued formal policy stating that support to offensive interrogation operations was outside jpras charter conclusions on gtmos request for ageressive techniques conclusion 10 interrogation techniques in guantanamo bays gtmo october 11 2002 request for authority submitted by major general michael dunlavey were influenced by jpra training for gtmo interrogation personnel and included techniques similar to those used in sere training to teach us personnel to resist abusive enemy interrogations gtmo staff judge advocate lieutenant colonel diane beavers legal review justifying the october 11 2002 gtmo request was profoundly in error and legally insufficient leaders at gtmo including major general dunlaveys successor major general geoffrey miller ignored warnings from unclassified xxvii unclassified dods criminal investigative task force and the federal bureau ofinvestigation that the techniques were potentially unlawful and that their use would strengthen detainee resistance conclusion 11 chairman ofthejoint chiefs ofstaff general richard myerss decision tocut short the legal and policy review ofthe october 112002 gtmo request initiated by his legal counsel thencaptain jane dalton undermined the militarys review process subsequent conclusions reached by chairman myers and captain dalton regarding the legality of interrogation techniques in the request followed grossly deficient review and were at odds with conclusions previously reached by the anny air force marine corps and criminal investigative task force conclusion 12 department of defense general counsel william 1 haynes iis effort to cut short the legal and policy review ofthe october 112002 gtmo request initiated bythen captain jane dahon legal counsel tothe chairman ofthe joint chiefs ofstaff was inappropriate and undermined the militarys review process the general counsels subsequent review was grossly deficient mr hayness one page recommendation to secretary ofdefense donald rumsfeld failed to address the serious legal concerns that had been previously raised by the military services about techniques in the gtmo request further mr hayness reliance on legal memo produced by gtmos staff judge advocate that senior military lawyers called legally insufficient and woefully inadequate is deeply troubling conclusion 13 secretary ofdefense donald rumsfelds authorization ofaggressive interrogation techniques for use at guantanamo bay was direct cause ofdetainee abuse there secretary rumsfelds december 22002 approval ofmr hayness recommendation that most of the techniques contained in gtmos october 11 2002 request be authorized influenced and contributed totheuse ofabusive techniques including military working dogs forced nudity and stress positions in afghanistan and iraq conclusion 14 department ofdefense general counsel william 1 haynes iis direction to the department ofdefenses detainee working group in early 2003 to consider legal memo from john yoo ofthedepartment ofjustices olc asauthoritative blocked the working group from conducting fair and complete legal analysis and resulted in report that in the words ofthen department ofthe navy general counsel alberto mora contained profound mistakes in its legal analysis reliance on the olc memo resulted in final working group report that recommended approval ofseveral aggressive techniques including removal ofclothing sleep deprivation and slapping similar to those used in sere training to teach u s personnel to resist abusive interrogations conclusions on interrogations in iraq and afghanistan conclusion 15 special mission unit smu task force tf interrogation policies were influenced by the secretary ofdefenses december 22002 approval ofaggressive interrogation teclmiques for use at gtmo smu tf interrogation policies in iraq included the use of aggressive interrogation techniques such as military working dogs and stress positions

to iraq in august and september 2003 gtmo commander major general geoffrey miller encouraged view that interrogators should be more aggressive during detainee interrogations conclusion 17 interrogation policies approved by lieutenant general ricardo sanchez which included theuse ofmilitary working dogs andstress positions were adirect cause ofdetainee abuse in iraq lieutenant general sanchezs decision to issue his september 142003 policy with the knowledge that there were ongoing discussions as to the legality of some techniques in it was serious error in judgment the september policy was superseded on october 122003 as result oflegal concerns raised by us central command that superseding policy however contained ambiguities and contributed to confusion about whether aggressive techniques such as military working dogs were authorized for use during interrogations conclusion 18 us central command centcom failed to conduct proper oversight of special mission unit task force interrogation policies though aggressive interrogation techniques were removed from combined joint task force 7 interrogation policies after centcom raised legal concerns about their inclusion in the september 14 2003 policy issued by lieutenant general sanchez smu tf interrogation policies authorized some ofthose same techniques including stress positions and military working dogs conclusion 19 the abuse of detainees at abu ghraib in late 2003 was not simply the result of fewsoldiers acting ontheir own interrogation techniques such asstripping detainees oftheir clothes placing them in stress positions and using military working dogs to intimidate them appeared in iraq only after they had been approved for use in afghanistan and at gtmo secretary ofdefense donald rumsfelds december 22002 authorization ofaggressive interrogation techniques and subsequent interrogation policies and plans approved by senior military and civilian officials conveyed the message that physical pressures and degradation were appropriate treatment for detainees in us military custody what followed was an erosion in standards dictating that detainees be treated humanely unclassified xxix i early influences on interrogation policy u redefujing the legal framework for the treatment ofdetainees u u from the time oftheir ratification until the invasion of mghanistan in

as to the command at southcom and the army deputy chief ofstafffor intelligence82 u at the time ofcol herringtons visit the mission at guantanamo was under the control oftwo different task forces each

its interagency collaborators need to be in full control ofthe detainees environment treatment rewards punishment and anything else associated with detainee should be centrally orchestrated by the debriefing team responsible for obtaining information from that detainee 84 u col herrington also expressed concern that actions positive or negative which guards might take as routine such as singling detainee out for shakedown or providing an extra chaplains visit might impact the ability ofinterrogators and debriefers from setting the tone ofthe questioning sessions 85 u col herrington found that facilities and procedures at gtmo for handling detainees posed serious problems he said that design flaws at gtmos current and planned detention sites hampered intelligence collection noting that the open facilities for example facilitated communications among the detainees and discouraged detainee cooperation by permitting detainees to support each others resistance efforts 86 81

negative impact on intelligence collection stating the austere nature ofthe facilities and the rigorous security movement procedures shackles two mps with hands on the detainee etc reinforces to detainees that they are in prison and detracts from the flexibility that debriefers require to accomplish their mission these views have nothing to do with being soft on the detainees nor do they challenge the pure security gains from such tight control the principal at work is that optimal exploitation ofa detainee cannot be done from cell 87 u specifically col herrington recommended that mps not be in the room during interrogations and warned that while shackling detainee might make sense from security standpoint it could be counterproductive to intelligence collection shackling one ofthe detainees feet to the floor during interrogation might make sense from security perspective although with one or two mps present it is arguable overkill however such shackling is either humiliating or b sends message to the detainee that the debriefer is afraid of him or c reminds him of his plight as prisoner 88 u col herrington observed that most ofthe interrogators at gtmo lacked the requisite training in strategic elicitation or the experience required to be effective with the detainees89 he said that ofthe 26 interrogators present at the time only one had enough arabic language experience to interrogate without an interpreter9o iia memo written by colonel mike fox southcoms director ofintelligence operations just month after col herrin ons r ort also discussed how conditions at gtmo

translate and review relevant documents onsite and monitor interrogations using video technology ibid 89 ibid at 6 90 col herringtons report also criticized the screening criteria in place which may

through the doj161 _ in his after action memo from_ training jpra instructor joseph witsch stated that the training seemed well received and beneficial for the majority ofthe personnel present162 he observed that some ofthe class participants had little to experience in interrogation and others had recently returned from conducting actual interrogations in mghanistan 163 iii in his memo mr witsch also commented on jpras future support to interrogations writing i believe our niche lies in the fact that we can provide the ability to exploit personnel based on how our enemies have done this type of thing over the last five decades our enemies have had limited success with this methodology due to the extreme dedication of american personnel and their harsh and mismanaged application oftechnique the potential exists that we could refine the process to achieve effective manipulationexploitation we must have process that goes beyond the old paradigm of military interrogation for tactical information or criminal investigation for legal proceedings these methods are far too limited in scope to deal with thenew waronglobal terrorism 164 _ mr witsch recommended that jpra develop two courses for future jpra customers basic course and an advanced course to deal with senior hardcore and resistance trained detainees 165 the courses he said will need immediate attention and will require total role reversal from current methodology and our standard approaches to training it will take cross section of sere experienced personnelsere instructors psychologists mds and intelligence personnel to effectively develop this new approach to captive handling and manipulation 166 c senior sere psychologist detailed from department ofdefense to other government agency u iiin july 2002

retired from the department ofdefense and began working as an independent contractor t 168 u dr jessen did tell the committee that in some circumstances physically coercive techniques are appropriate for use in detainee interrogations he said that the use ofphysically coercive techniques may be appropriate when 1 there is good reason to believe that the individual has perishable intelligence 2 the techniques are lawful and authorized 3 they are carefully controlled with medical and psychological oversight 4 someone who is not otherwise involved in the interrogation can stop the use ofthe techniques and 5 the techniques do not cause longterm physical or psychological harm 170 dr jessen acknowledged that empirically it is not possible to know the effect ofa technique used on detainee in the long term unless you study the effects in the longterm however he said that his conclusion about the longterm effects ofphysically coercive techniques was based on forty years oftheir use at sere school 171 u subsequent to his retirement from dod dr jessen joined dr mitchell and other former jpra officials to form company called mitchell jessen associates mitchell jessen associates is coowned by seven individuals six ofwhom either worked for jpra or one of the service sere schools as employees andor contractors i72 as of july 2007 the company had between 55 and 60 employees several ofwhom

asked for from jpra was to respond to requests from mr haynes 176 mr haynes testified to the committee that he could not remember specifically asking mr shiffiin for infonnation on sere techniques but that he asked generally about that subject sometime in the summer of2002 he also said that he remembered being interested in that infonnation and that ifhe had requested it he would have requested it through mr shiffrin 177 although mr haynes did not say why he was interested in this infonnation when asked whether he had discussed sere techniques with messrs gonzales addington rizzo y00 or any ofthe other senior lawyers he met with regularly mr haynes testified to the committee that he did discuss sere techniques with other people in the administration 178 u jpra chief of staff lt col daniel baumgartner said that when the request from the general counsels office came in he called col moulton and brig gen thomas moore the jfcom director for operations 13 and received pennission to

gleaning intelligence from enemy detainees 183 u the memorandum and its attachments were delivered to the deputy general counsel richard shiffrin by jpra employee and were emailed to relevant personnel at both jpra and brig gen moores office at jfcom i84 dod general counsel jim haynes did not recall whether or not he saw the memo at the time but said that in all likelihood he would have

and physical pressures to use them in interrogations mr shiffrin confirmed that one ofthe urposes for seeking information from jpra was to reverse engineer the techniques 1 7 lt col baumgartner said that he wanted to be helpful but that he told mr shiffrin that jpras techniques were designed to show americans the worst possible treatment that they may face and that any recommendation for the use oftechniques on detainees would require administration approval 188 u on july 26 2002 jpra completed second memorandum with three attachments to respond to the additional questions from the general

the memo jpra informed the general counsels office that it had already assisted in the training of interrogatorexploiters from other governmental agencies charged with oef exploitation of enemy detainees190 the memo also stated within jpras evolving curriculum to train interrogatorsexploiters many interrogation approaches are taught along with corresponding options for physical pressures to enhance the psychological setting for detainee interrogation several ofthe techniques highlighted atch 1 as training tools in jpra courses used by other sere schools and used historically may be very effective in inducing learned helplessness and breaking the oef detainees will to resist191 the ftrst attachment to the july 262002 memo wasphysical pressures used in resistance training and against american prisoners and detainees 192 that attachment included list oftechniques used to train students at sere school to resist interrogation the list included techniques such as the facial slap walling the abdomen slap use ofwater the attention grasp and stress positions 193 the ftrst attachment also listed techniques used by some ofthe service sere schools such as use of smoke shaking and manhandling cramped conftnement immersion in water or wetting down and waterboarding jprasdescription ofthewaterboarding technique provided inthatftrst attachment was inconsistent in key respects from the us navy sere schools description of waterboarding according to the navy sere schools operating instructions for example while administering the technique the navy limited the amount of water poured on students face to two pints however the jpra attachment said that up to 15 gallons ofwater may be poured onto subjects face while the navys operating instructions dictated that effort will be made to direct the stream ofwater into the students nostrils or mouth the description provided by jpra contained such limitation for subjects ofthe technique while the navy limited the use ofthe cloth on students face to twenty seconds the jpras description said only that the cloth should remain in place for short period oftime and while the navy restricted anyone from placing pressure on the chest or stomach during the administration ofthis technique jpras description included such limitation for sqbjects ofthe technique 194 attachment one also listed tactics derived from jpra sere school lesson plans that were designed to induce control dependency compliance and cooperation including isolation or solitary conftnement induced physical weakness and exhaustion degradation 190 ibid 191

information be given to the justice department for something they were working on which he said related to program he was not free to discuss with the committee even in classified setting197 u second attachment to the july 26 2002 jpra memo to the general counsels office was entitled operational issues pertaining to the use ofphysicalpsychological coercion in interrogation198 in attachment two jpra stated that the memo did not purport to address the myriad legal ethical or moral implications oftorture rather the memo focused onj the key operational considerations relative to the use ofphysical and psychological pressures19 u attachment two described operational risks associated with using physical andor psychological duress phrase that jpra used interchangeably with torture throughout most ofattachment two in interrogations20o the attachment said that one risk was that the use of these methods would increase the prisoners level ofresolve to resist cooperating201 jpra explained that 0nce any means ofduress has been purposefully applied to the prisoner the formerly cooperative relationship cannot be reestablished in addition the prisoners level of resolve to resist cooperating with the interrogator will likely be increased as result ofharsh or brutal treatment 202 u according to attachment two another risk to using techniques that increase physical and psychological duress was that it created doubts about the reliability and accuracy of information obtained203 jpra explained in attachment two that ifan interrogator produces information that resulted from the application ofphysical and psychological duress the reliability and accuracy ofthis information is in doubt in other words subject in extreme pain may provide an answer any answer or many answers in order to get the pain to stop 204 195physicalpressures usedinresistance training andagainstamerican prisoners anddetainees 196 committee staff interview ofwilliam 1 haynes ii april 25 2008

duresscouldhaveontreatment ofuspersonnel205 jpraexplained inattachment twothat another important aspect ofthe debate over the use oftorture is the consideration of its potential impact on the safety of us personnel captured by current and future adversaries the unintended consequence ofa us policy that provides for the torture of prisoners is that it could be used by our adversaries as justification for the torture of captured us personnel while this would have little impact on those regimes or organizations that already employ torture as standard means of operating it could serve as the critical impetus for those that are currently weighing the potential gains and risks associated with the torture of us persons to accept torture as an acceptable option206 u the third attachment to jpras july 26 2002 memo was memo from the chiefof psychology services at the air force sere school jerald ogrisseg on the psychological effectsofresistance training 207 thatmemorandum whichwasgenerated inresponse toa specific request from the general counsels office described available evidence on the long term psychological effects ofair force sere training on us personnel and commented from psychological perspective on the effects ofusing the waterboard u jpra chief of staffdaniel baumgartner said that when the general counsels office requested memo on the psychological effects ofresistance training he called dr ogrisseg at the department ofthe air forces air education and training command208 dr ogrisseg said that lt col baumgartner asked his opinion during the phone call about his thoughts on waterboarding the enemy209 dr ogrisseg recalled asking wouldnt that be illegal210 according to dr ogrisseg lt col baumgartner replied that people were asking from above about using waterboarding in real world interrogations211 dr ogrisseg recalled telling lt col baumgartner aside from being illegal it was completely different arena that we in the survival school didnt know anything about 212 u subsequent to that call dr ogrisseg reviewed the data on the effects of air force sere resistance training on students and produced his memo concluding that ifthere are any longterm psychological effects of us air force resistance training they are certainly 20 ibid 206 ibid liy1 dr jerald ogrisseg psychological effects ofresistance training july 24 2002 attached to

committee staff interview of jerald ogrisseg june 26 2007 209 sasc hearing june 17208 210 ibid 2ll ibid 212 ibid 29 minimal 213 the memo attributed this conclusion to efforts the air force sere program undertook to minimize the risk oftemporary psychological effects ofresistance training becoming longterm effects214 the air force minimized the risk by among other things performing three extensive debriefings during training dr ogrisseg said that affording students these opportunities to discuss their training experiences in open group environments mitigates the risk ofturning dramatic experience into traumatic experience 215 he told the committee that there are numerous controls in place at sere school to ensure that the training does not become traumatic for its students 216 u dr ogrisseg said that lt col baumgartner also asked him to comment on both the physical and psychological effects ofthe waterboard which he described in his memo as an intense physical and psychological stressor used at the us navy sere school 217 although dr ogrisseg had not used the waterboard himself he had observed its use in visit to the navy sere school he stated that based on that visit he did not believe that the waterij board posed real and serious physical danger to the students who experienced it at the sere school stating that the navy had highly qualified medical personnel immediately available to intervene and their students had all been medically screened prior to training psychologically however the water board broke the students will to resist providing information and induced helplessness 218 u dr ogrisseg said that he was surprised when he found out later that lt col baumgartner had forwarded his memo to the general counsels office along with list ofthe physical and psychological techniques used in sere school 219 dr ogrisseg said that his analysis was produced with students in mind not detainees he stated that the conclusions in his memo were not applicable to the offensive use of sere techniques against real world detainees andhewouldnot stand bythe conclusions inhis memo iftheywereappliedtotheuse ofsere resistance training techniques on detainees u in written response to question posed by senator carl levin after the committees june 172008 hearing dr ogrisseg elaborated on that point noting several important differences between sere

26 2007 30 conclusions in his memo to the sere school training population 220 among those differences dr ogrisseg identified were 1 the extensive physical and psychological prescreening processes for sere school students that are not feasible for detainees 2 the variance in injuries between sere school student who enters training and detainee who arrives at an interrogation facility after capture 3 the limited risk ofsere instructors mistreating their own personnel especially with extensive oversight mechanisms in place compared to the risk of interrogators mistreating noncountry personnel 4 the voluntary nature ofsere training which can be terminated by student at any time compared to the involuntary nature ofbeing detainee 6 the limited duration ofsere training which has known starting and ending point compared to the often lengthy and unknown period ofdetention for detainee and 7 the underlying goals ofsere school to help students learn from and benefit from their training and the mechanisms in place to ensure that students reach those goals compared to the goal of interrogation to elicit information u in addition dr ogrisseg also stated that since writing his memo in july 2002 he had reviewed studies about the effects ofnear death experiences and that he had become concerned about the use ofwater boarding even as training tool221 the us navy sere school abandoned its use ofthe waterboard in november 2007 u lt col baumgartner testified to the committee that subsequent to sending his two memos and their attachments including the list ofsere techniques to the general counsels office another government agency asked for the same information lt col baumgartner said that he provided that information to the oga 222 ii in his interview with the committee lt col baumgartner said that personnel had contacted him requesting copy ofthe same information that had been sent to the dod general counsel lt col baumgartner recalled speaking to d psychologist at_ about

assistant attorney general for the olc john y00 had met with counsel to the president alberto gonzales and counsel to the vicepresident david addington to discuss the subjects that he intended to

advice to the cia was being coordinated by counsel to the president alberto gonzales 225 u the first ofthe two august 12002 olc memoranda known to many as the first bybee memo presented olcs narrow interpretation ofwhat constituted torture under us law the memo stated that the federal antitorture statute of 1994 prohibited only extreme acts and that in order to constitute torture physical pain would have to be equivalent in intensity to that accompanying serious physical injury such as organ failure impairment ofbodily functions or even death226 for mental pain to rise to the level oftorture according to the memo it would have to result in siflcant psychological harm of significant duration eg lasting for months or even years22 the first bybee memo also found that the federal anti torture statute may not be applicable to interrogations ordered by the president ifhe acted pursuant to his constitutional commanderinchief powers further the memo argued that even ifthe federal antitorture statute could be construed to apply to such interrogations the defenses ofnecessity and selfdefense could potentially eliminate criminal liability under the statute228 u the first bybee memo also effectively dispensed with the specific intent requirement ofthe federal antitorture statute by narrowly defining that requirement the federal antitorture statute states that in order to constitute torture an act must be specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering229 the first bybee memo stated that in order for defendant to have acted with specific intent he must expressly intend to achieve the forbidden act230 under that interpretation to violate the law person must expressly intend to commit torture and the memo stated that knowledge alone that particular result is certain to occur does not constitute specific intent regularly which mr addington said was referred to as the war cowlcil by mr haynes also included olc lawyers john yoo and tim flanigan according to mr addington the group of lawyers met about range of issues including interrogation of enemy combatants in the war on terror when mr haynes was asked whether he had discussed

exploitation draft plan circulated by dr jessen in april which described jpradirected exploitation process 322 _ though gtmo was facility that dealt with detainees after they had been removed from the battlefield the presentation also included information on tactical estionin statin that tactical interro ators should 323 mr witsch the jpra instructor who acted as team chief for the training testified to the committee rough handling is you would pull the person up to their feet you would move them rapidly in the direction that you were going to take them basically they have control they would feel like the person that has them is in total control ofthem thats what we mean by rough handling324 _ presentation slides used for the trainin also listed number of other recommendations for handling detainees including 325 mr witsch testified to the committee that he did not know what was meant by those statements and he could not recall any discussion about what punishments might be culturally undesirable for arab or islamic detainees 326 _ the presentation stated that all daily activities should be on random schedules and should among other things disrupt prisoner sleep cycles 327 mr witsch said that denying detainees the ability to predict and determine their schedules keeps them somewhat offguard and guessing 328 _ second jpra presentation delivered at fort bragg described methods to deal with detainees who were trained to resist interrogation329 the presentation entitled counter measures to defeat qaeda resistance contingency training based on recently obtained alqaida documents listed several countermeasures to deal with resistant detainees including invasion of personal space by female33o mr witsch explained that in lot of cases its uncomfortable for male to have female in their space it could also be looked at as uncomfortable having female in front of an arab what this is is form ofpressure in 32l compare jpra exploitation ofcaptive with

detainee uncomfortable while conducting h 332 j researc h m preparation lor t trammg _ the presentation on countenneasures to defeat qaeda resistance also explained that ifthe prisoner believes that americans are immoral barbarians and what he sees counters those beliefs then his core beliefs have been shaken and he is more likely to cooperate if his core beliefs are reinforced by his treatment he is more likely to stick to his resistance333 mr witsch told the committee that it was hard to say what the effect 0 would have on detainees resistance whether it would make the detainee more or less likely to cooperate 334 u in his testimony to the army ig mal burney the gtmo bsct psychiatrist who attended the training stated that jpra personnel at fort bragg described some ofthe stuff that they would do in sere school as far as keeping people in some sort ofsolitary confinement for period oftime or finding out what their fears were before they came so that they would try and usethose against them whether itwas fear ofspiders ofthedark orwhatever 335 an interrogator from gtmo who attended the training also recalled discussion about the use of phobias 336 ii members ofthe gtmo bsct who attended the fort bragg training recalled discussions with the jpra instructors about how they administered physical 337 pressures mal burney told the committee that instructors talked about techniques the sere schools used to teach resistance to interrogation such as walling and exposing students to cold until they shiver338 _told the committee that hooding and hitting in way that was not injurious were both mentioned at fort bragg339 an interrogator from jtf170 who attended the training also recalled discussion about the use ofphysical pressures 340 u that same interrogator said that the instructors spoke about using existing procedures at gtmo to enhance interrogations341 for example the interrogator told the committee that there was discussion with lpra personnel that military working dogs already present at 331 testimony of joseph witsch september 6 207 at 26 332 ibid at 27 333 jpra cowjter measures to defeat alqa ida resistance 334 testimony of joseph witsch

for security could enhance detainee exploitation similarly the interrogator said that the instructors pointed out that hoods goggles and ear muffs were already in use with detainees at gtmo for security purposes and that existing processes utilizing those techniques could also be used to enhance interrogations the interrogator also recalled requesting additional jpra training for gtmo personnel on the use ofphysical pressures u neither ltc banks nor any ofthe jpra instructors from the fort bragg training could recall ifthere were discussions ofphysical pressures 342 ltc banks told the committee that using physical pressures desifed for students at sere school in actual interrogations would almost always be unproductive 34 for example he told the committee that slapping person would harden their resistance u despite the apparent instruction on physical pressures maj burney told the army ig that instructors at fort bragg believed that the techniques used in sere training should not be brought back for use at gtmo and that interrogation tactics that rely on physical pressures or torture while they do get you information do not tend to get you accurate information or reliable information 344 in written statement provided to the committee maj burney reiterated that point stating that it was stressed time and time again that psychological investigations have proven that harsh interrogations do not work at best it will get you information that prisoner thinks you want to hear to make the interrogation stop but that information is strongly likely to be false34s ii during the fort bragg training the gtmo personnel also discussed conditions at gtmo that they felt were hampering intelligence collection efforts in his after action report summarizing the training jpra instructor and trainin team chiefjos h witsch described some ofthose conditions statin for exa ie that 346 mr witsch also stated in his after action report that lot of interrogation techniques used in the past are longer effective against the individual detainees because they have developed an awareness and countermeasures to deal with them347 mr witsch added that some ofthe interrogators had become frustrated over the controls placed on their ability to extract actionable information such as restrictions on bringing detainees together in room to confront inconsistencies or on interrogating detainees for 121520 hours at time348 while mr witsch noted that rapport building had proved to be the most effective interrogation technique in eliciting information and that the positive treatment ofdetainees at gtmo was 342 ltc banks added that he was not present for all of the training sessions committee staff interview of ltc morgan banks june 152007 testimony of terrence

report mr witsch expressed concerns about jpra involvement in gtmo operations writing i highly recommend we continue to remain in an advisory role and not get directly involved in the actual operations gitmo in particular we have actual experience in real world prisoner handling the concepts we are most familiar with relate to our past enemies and we have developed our code of conduct procedures based on those experiences without actual experience with current designated unlawful combatants we are making the assumption that procedures we use to exploit our personnel will be effective against the current detainees 350 week later mr witsch prepared follow up memo for mr wirts jpras oso chief expressing concern about lpras involvement with detainee exploitation stating what do we bring to the table we are code of conduct instructors with vast amount of experience training highly intelligent disciplined and motivated dod personnel to resist captivity we base our roleplay laboratories on what we know our fonner enemies have done to our personnel in captivity it is based on illegal exploitation under the rules listed in the 1949 geneva convention relative to the treatment of prisoners of war of prisoners over the last 50 years _ mr witsch continued i believe the techniques and tactics that we use in training have applicability what i am wrestling with is the implications of using these tactics as it relates to current legal constraints the totally different motivations ofthe detainees and the lack of direction of senior leadership within the us government on how to unifonnly treat detainees i think we are well within our sphere of influence if we stick to providing methods to counter resistance trained designated unlawful combatants we are out of our sphere when we begin to profess the proper ways to exploit these detainees we are now attempting to educate lower level personnel in dod and ogas with concepts and principles that are somewhat foreign to them and while it all sounds good they are not in position nor do they have the depth of knowledge in these matters to effect change and do it in reasonable safety the handling of designated unlawful combatants is screwed up mess and everyone isscrambling tounscrewthemess ifwe wantamoreprofound role in this effort we need to sell our capabilities to the top level people in the usg and 349 ibid 30 ibid not spend our time trying to motivate the operators at the lower levels to sway their bosses this is running the train backwards and that is slow method to get somewhere there are lot of people in the usg intelligence community that still believe in the old paradigm and wonder just what were doing in their business 351 _the memo concluded with the warning we dont have an established track record in this type ofactivity and we would present an easy target for someone to point at as the problem the stakes are much higher for this than what you and i have done in any activity before

according to trip report prepared by deputy staff judge advocate at soouthcom mg dunlavey held private conversations with mr haynes and few others and briefed the entire group on number ofissues including policy constraints affecting interrogations at the jtf 354 for example mg dunlavey told the group that jtf170 would like to take koran away from some detainees hold it as incentive but that the issue was undergoing policy determination by southcom355 the trip report noted that mr haynes opined that jtf170 should have the authority in place to make those calls per potus order adding that he thought jtf170 would have more freedom to command356 mg dunlavey told the committee that he may have told the group during their visit that jtf170 was working on request for authority to use additional interrogation techniques357 mr haynes said he did not recall discussing specific interrogation techniques or gtmos work on request for authority to use additional interrogation techniques

according to the staff judge advocate sja at gtmo ltc diane beaver there was discussion among senior staff at gtmo as to whether or not the jtf required explicit authorization to use interrogation approaches that had not been taught to interrogators at the us army intelligence center at fort huachuca arizona while some felt that jtf170 already had the authority to use additional interrogation techniques mg dunlavey directed his staff to draft request for new authorities to submit to southcom for approval 359 u the jtf170 director for intelligence ltc jerald phifer told the committee that mg dunlavey wanted to get new techniques on the table and that mg dunlavey pressured him to draft memo requesting additional techniques 36o ltc phifer asked the bsct to draft an interrogation policy that could be formally submitted up the chain of command for review 361 according to maj burney the bsct psychiatrist by early october there was increasing pressure to get tougher with detainee interrogations but nobody was quite willing to define what tougher meant362 maj burney added that there was lot ofpressure to use more coercive techniques and that ifthe interrogation policy memo that ltc phifer had asked him to write did not contain coercive techniques then it wasnt going to go very far363 u according to maj burney he and wrote memo ofsuggested detention and interrogation policies in the course of an evening maj burney told the committee that some ofthe interrogation approaches identified in the memo came from their jpra training in fort bragg and other approaches were simply made up by the bsct 365 _ the bsct psychologist also told the committee that the bsct used information from the jpra training at fort bragg to draft the memo366 _ the bsct memo dated october 2 2002

ofconditions at gtmo that the bsct judged to be hindering intelligence collection and stated _ the october 2 2002 memo proposed three categories of interrogation techniques for use in the interrogation booth to develop rapport promote cooperation and counter resistance369 category i techniques included incentives and mildly adverse approaches such as telling detainee that he was going to be at gtmo forever unless he cooperated370 the memorandum stated that an interrogator should be able to ascertain whether detainee is being cooperative by the end ofthe initial interrogation and said that ifcategory i approaches failed to induce cooperation the interrogator could request approval for category ii approaches 371 _ category ii techniques were designed for lligh priority detainees defined in the memo as any detainee suspected ofhaving significant information relative to the security ofthe united states372 category ii techniques included stress positions the use ofisolation for up to 30 days with the possibility ofadditional 30 day periods ifauthorized by the chief interrogator depriving detainee offood for up to 12 hours or as long as the interrogator goes without food during an interrogation the use ofbacktoback 20 hour interrogations once per week removal ofall comfort items including religious items forced groominfi handcuffmg detainee and placing

interrogations at gtmo email from lt col ron buikema to victoria gnibus july 212004 51 _ the memo reserved category iii techniques only for detainees that have evidenced advanced resistance and are suspected ofhaving significant infonnation pertinent to national security374 category iii techniques included the daily use of20 hour interrogations the use of strict isolation without the right ofvisitation by treating medical professionals or the international committee ofthe red cross icrc the use offood restriction for 24 hours once week the use of scenarios designed to convince the detainee he might experience painful or fatal outcome noninjurious physical consequences removal of clothing and exposure to cold weather or water until such time as the detainee began to shiver375 _ in addition to suggesting interrogation techniques the bsct memo made recommendations for the treatment of detainees in the cell blocks specifically it proposed that resistant detainees might be limited to four hours ofsleep day that they be deprived ofcomfort items such as sheets blankets mattresses washcloths and that interrogators control access to all detainees korans376 the bsct memo described using fans and generators to create white noiseas fonnofpsychological pressureandadvocated thatallaspects ofthe detention environment should enhance capture shock dislocate expectations foster dependence and support exploitation to the fullest extent possible377 ii mal burney and_told the committee that they were not comfortable with the memo they were asked to produce and therefore included statement in the memo reflecting their concerns about the techniques including concerns about the long term physical andor mental impact ofthe techniques378 they wrote experts in the field of interrogation indicate the most effective interrogation strategy is rapportbuilding approach interrogation techniques that rely on physical or adverse consequences are likely to garner inaccurate information and create an increased level ofresistancethere is evidence that the level offear or discomfort evoked by given technique has any consistent correlation to the volume or quality of information obtainedthe interrogation tools outlined could affect the short term andor long term physical andor mental health of the detainee physical andor emotional hann from the above techniques may emerge months or even years after their use it is impossible to determine if particular strategy will cause irreversible hann if employed individuals employing category ii or category iii interrogation techniques must be thoroughly trained carefully selected to include mental health screening such screenings are sop for sere and other special operations personnel 379 374 bsct

379 bsct counterresistance strategies at 6 52 u the bsct provided copy oftheir memo to ltc banks at us anny special operations command usasoc who had helped organize their jpra training upon reviewing the memo ltc banks praised the bsct for their great job on the memo but also raised concerns about the suggested use of physical pressures in interrogation noting that physical pressures are used with students in sere school to increase their resistance to interrogation not break it down 380 u ltc banks wrote ii the use of physical pressures brings with it large number of potential negative side effects when individuals are gradually exposed to increasing levels ofdiscomfort it is more common for them to resist harder that is one of the reasons we use it in sere school to increase the resistance posture of our soldiers if individuals are put under enough discomfort ie pain they will eventually do whatever it takes to stop the pain this will increase the amount of information they tell the interrogator but it does not mean the information is accurate in fact it usually decreases the reliability of the infonnation because the person will say whatever he believes will stop the pain now there are certain exceptions like with all generalizations but they are not common bottom line the likelihood that the use of physical pressures will increase the delivery of accurate information from detainee is very low the likelihood thattheuse ofphysical pressures will increase thelevel ofresistance in detainee is very high ii it is important to remember that sere instructors use these techniques physical pressures because they are effective at increasing resistance because of the danger involved very few sere instructors are allowed to actually use physical pressures everything that is occurring in sere school is very carefully monitored and paced even with all these safeguards injuries and accidents do happen the risk with real detainees is increased exponentially u my strong recommendation is that you do not use physical pressures if gtmo does decide to use them you are taking substantial risk with very limited potential benefit 381 g cia lawyeradvises gtmo on interrogations u u on october 2 2002 the gtmo staff judge advocate ltc diane beaver convened meeting to discuss the bsct memo minutes from that meeting reflect the attendance of itf 170 personnel and the thenchief counsel to the cias counterterrorist center jonathan fredman 382 380 email from ltc morgan banks to mal paul burney anoctober 2 2002 381 ibid 382 counter resistance strategy meeting minutes at 2 the meeting minutes stated that questions and comments from the meeting were paraphrased 53 u mr fredmans visit took place just week after the acting cia general counsel john rizzo and dod general counsel jim hayness september 252002 visit to gtmo mr haynes did not recall discussing with mr rizzo during their visit the possibility ofhaving cia lawyer travel to gtmo to talk to dod personnel there 383 mr haynes said he later found out in discussion with mr rizzo that cia lawyer had gone to gtmo and discussed legal authorities applicable to interrogations but said he could not recall when he ftrst learned ofthat cia lawyers visit u while ltc beaver could not recall what she or others said the minutes ofthe october 2 2002 meeting indicate that it began with brieftng by the bsct on the jpra training at fort bragg384 the bsct briefer told the group that rapport building and the friendly approach were proven methods to overcome resistance while fear based approaches were unreliable and ineffective in ahnost all cases385 according to the meeting minutes however the bsct did report that psychological stressors such as sleep deprivation withholding food isolation and loss oftime were extremely effective 386 the bsct also identified camp wide environmental strategies designed to disrupt cohesion and communication among detainees as potentially helpful to improve the effectiveness of interroations and explained that the detention environment should foster dependence and compliance 87 u despite the bsct comment on the effectiveness ofrapport building the meeting minutes reflect little discussion ofthat approach in fact according to the meeting minutes the gtmo director for intelligence ltc jerald phifer questioned the bsct assessment stating that harsh tecd on our service members have worked and will work on some what about those388 __ responded thatforce wasrisky andmay be ineffective389 nevertheless the remainder ofthe meeting appears to have revolved around discussion of aggressive interrogation techniques and how to obtain the approval to use them u interrogation control element ice chief david becker noted at the meeting that there were many reports about sleep deprivation used at bagram in afghanistan 390 according to the meeting minutes ltc beaver agreed but stated that officially it is not happening391 nevertheless ltc beaver suggested that sleep deprivation could be used on gtmo detainees with approval392 the group also discussed ways to manage the detainees sleep cycles ie by 383 committee staff interview of william j

at 2 390 ibid 391 ibid at 3 it is unclear how and when jtf170 personnel became aware of the use of sleep deprivation at bagram though lic beaver told the committee that she had seen version of standard operating procedure for interrogations in use at bagram on classified dod internet system 392 ibid 54 letting the detainee rest just long enough to fall asleep and wake him up about every thirty minutes and tell him its time to pray again393 u according to the meeting minutes ltc beaver suggested that the iff might need to curb the harsher operations while the international committee ofthe red cross icrc is around and that it would be better not to expose them to any controversial techniques ltc beaver explained that the icrc is serious concern they will be in and out scrutinizing our operations unless they are displeased and decide to protest and leave this would draw lot ofnegative attention395 the minutes reflect that the cia lawyer added his view in the past when the icrc has made big deal about certain detainees the dod has moved them away from the attention of the icrc upon questioning from the icrc about their whereabouts the dods response has repeatedly been that the detainee merited status under the geneva convention 396 u at the meeting the minutes reflect that cia lawyer jonathan fredman also discussed whether or not the techniques in the bsct memo complied with applicable legal standards mr fredman explained under the torture convention torture has been prohibited by intemationallaw but the language of the statutes is written vaguely severe mental and physical pain is prohibited the mental part is explained as poorly as the physical severe physical pain is described as anything causing permanent damage to major organs or body parts mental torture is described as anything leading to permanent profound damage to the senses or personality it is basically subject to perception if the detainee dies youre doing it wrong so far the techniques we have addressed have not proven to produce these types of results which in way challenges what the bsct paper says about not being able to prove whether these techniques will lead to permanent damage everything in the bsct memo is legal from civilian standpoint397 u according to the minutes when the participants ofthe meeting discussed whether or not to videotape the aggressive sessions or interroations mr fredman said that videotaping ofeventotallylegaltechniques willlookugly3 8 mrbeckerwhoagreedwiththe cia lawyers assessment added that videotapes are subject to too much scrutiny in court 399 393 ibid at 5 394 ibid at 3 395 ibid 396 ibid 397 according to the meeting minutes the cia lawyer added the torture convention prohibits torture and cruel inhumane and degrading treatment the us did not sign up to the second part because ofthe 8th amendment that gives us more license to use more controversial techniques ibid 398 ibid at 5 399 ibid at 3 55 u when an attendee at the meeting mentioned that law enforcement agents presumably referring tocitfandfbihadconcerns about theuseofaggressive tactics theminutesreflect that mr fredman responded that when cia has wanted to use more aggressive techniques in the past the fbi has pulled their personnel from theatre in those rare instances aggressive techniques have proven very helpful4o ltc beaver added that there was legal reason why law enforcement personnel could not participate in those operations 401 u while ltc beaver testified in 2008 that she was aware that sere training was not designed for offensive use with detainees the minutes ofthe october 22002 meeting reflect that shenevertheless askedaboutuse ofthewettoweltechnique insereschool402 thecia lawyer replied ifa welltrained individual is used to perfonn this technique it can feel like youre drowning the lymphatic system will react as if youre suffocating but your body will not cease to function it is very effective to identify phobias and use them ie insects snakes claustrophobia the level of resistance is directly related to persons experience403 u according to the meeting minutes ice chiefdavid becker asked whether gtmo could get blanket approval for the use oftechniques or whether techniques would be approved on casebycase basis404 mr fredman responded that the cia makes the call internally on most ofthe techniques found in the bsct memo and referenced in their meeting but that significantly harsh techniques are approved through the dol405 as to whether geneva conventions would apply mr fredman noted that the cia rallied for it not to406 u the meeting minutes also reflect mr fredman thoughts on other interrogation techniques such as threats ofdeath mr fredman noted that such threats should be handled on case by case basis

deployed to gtmo and who had previously worked at the navy sere school at the naval air station in brunswick maine the lieutenant commander told the committee that he discussed with itfgtmo

must be performed by highly trained individual medical personnel should be present to treat any possible accidents seem to stretch beyond the bounds of legal propriety talk of wet towel treatment which results in the lymphatic gland reacting as ifyou are suffocating would in my opinion shock the conscience of any legal body looking at using the results of the interrogations or possibly even the interrogators someone needs to be considering how history will look back at this408 ii the october 2 2002 meeting minutes indicated that the group discussed mohammed khatani high value detainee suspected ofbeing connected to the september 11 2001 attacks week before the meeting jtf170 had assumed the lead on khatanis interrogation409 by the october 2 2002 meeting jtf170 had already developed an aggressive interrogation plan for khatani iitwo days after the meeting bsct psychiatrist mal paul burney sent an email to ltc banks stating that persons here at this operation are still interested in pursuing the potential use of more aversive interrogation teclmiques were more aversive teclmiques approved for use in the future by appropriate people the operation would like to have few task force personnel specifically trained in various techniques410 mal burney asked whether ltc banks knew where task force personnel could go to receive such training and whether he knew ofany consultants who could assist ifany ofthese measures are eventually approved411 _ ltc banks replied i do not envy you i suspect i know where this is coming from theanswer is idonotknow ofanyone who could provide thattraining thetraining that sere instructors receive is designed to simulate that of foreign power and to do so in manner that encourages resistance among the students i do not believe that traininf interrogators to use what sere instructors use would be particularly productive41 h dod takes lead on the interrogation ofmohammed khatani u _ according to the department ofdefense pakistani

that she had not been consulted on the interrogation plan and did not recall reviewing the memo or providing the commander with guidance regarding the legal sufficiency ofthe request42s major general dunlavey said that he did not recall whether or not he personally consulted with ltc beaver that the letter would likely have been drafted by his director for intelligence ltc jerald phifer and that it was possible that the statement in the letter that ltc beaver had been consulted was based on representation by his staff426 419 the memo was provided to the committee as an appendix to the ar156

that these types oftechniques arebeingutilized andthatthepersonnel on the ground are properly trained to conduct these techniques 426 committee staff interview ofmg michael dunlavey november 302007 59 iifrom october 2 until october 102002 itf170 personnel interrogated khatani according to multiple witness accounts on or about october 52002 military working dogs were brought into the room where khatani was being interrogated427 summarized statement oftestimony provided by one ofthe fbi agents present at the time indicated that the fbi objected to the use ofdogs and raised those objections to mr becker the itf170 ice chief428 in testimony to the army ig mr becker acknowledged that he permitted the military working dog to enter the interrogation in order to raise the detainees stress level429 iimr becker told the committee that he had authorized dogs entering the interrogation room on two occasions and that the dog barked but was not pennitted to place its paws on khatani 430 lr becker also told the committee that ltc phifer provided verbal authority for the dogs to be used in this manner ltc phifer recalled discussing dogs with mr becker as teclmique because arabs saw dogs as dirty animal and they didnt like them not because they should be used as fear factor431 ltc phifer told the army ig however that mr becker never told him that he had approved the use ofa dog during the khatani interrogation however in written answers to questions posed by vice admiral church ltc phifer stated that dogs were used in the khatani interrogation and that we would bring the dog around to within 10 feet ofkhatani and he would be somewhat ulmerved by it we did it to keep him off balance as well as to enhance security432 major general dunlavey said that he did not recall being aware that dog was used in the interrogation of khatani 433 ii in an october 82002 email to his colleague an fbi agent described itf 170s interrogation ofkhatani stating that dod had tried sleep deprivation loud music bright lights and body placement discomfort all with negative results and that dod interrogators planned to stop the interrogation434 mr becker told the committee that the interrogation

email ofoctober 8 2002 observing that i think we should consider leaving him alone let him get healthy again and do something different 436 iv gtmo seeks authority to use aggressive interrogation techniques u gtmo requests counterresistance techniques influenced by sere u u on october 11 2002 just days after the jtf170 moved khatani back to the navy brig and shortly after meeting with the chief counsel ofthe cias counterterrorist center jonathan fredman ltc phifer submitted memorandum to jtf170 commander mg dunlavey requesting approval to use counterresistance interrogation techniques 437 ltc phifers memo was largely drawn from the october 2 2002 memorandum that the gtmo behavioral science consultation team bsct had written upon their return from the jpra training at fort bragg438 the memo requested approval for three categories ofprogressively more aggressive interrogation techniques many ofwhich were similar to techniques used at sere schools to increase us soldiers resistance to illegal enemy interrogation439 uofthethree categories ofproposed techniques those incategory iwere the least aggressive category i proposed yelling at the detainee and using certain techniques of deception such as using multiple interrogators or having an interrogator identify himself as citizen ofa foreign nation or as an interrogator from country with reputation for harsh treatment of detainees 4040 u the proposed category ii techniques were more aggressive and included several techniques similar to those used in sere schools such as stress positions isolation deprivation oflight and auditory stimuli using hood during transport and questioning removal of clothing and using detainees individual phobias to induce stress 441 ii an august 192002 email from ltc beaver reflected discussions among jtf170 staff about stress positions which she said resulted in an agreed upon policy ofno stress 436 email from fbi special agent to fbi special agent october 8 202 437 memo from ltc jerald phifer to mg michael dunlavey requestfor approval ofcounterresistance strategies october ii 202 hereinafter ltc phifer to mg michael dunlavey requestfor approval ofcounterresistance strategies 438 mal burney told the army ig that the october ii 2002 memo wasnt the exact same document that we had written but the general structure and overall organizationa lot ofthe things did remain intact from our original brainstorm to what was eventually requested army ig interview ofmal paul burney august 21 207 at 11 439 the october 11 memo also stated that current guidelines for interrogation procedures at gtmo limit the ability ofinterrogators to counter advanced resistance ltc phifer to mg michael dunlavey requestfor approval of counterresistance strategies 440 ibid 441 additional category ii techniques included use of falsified documents or reports interrogating the detainee in an environment other than the standard interrogation booth use of 20 hour interrogations removal of all comfort items including religious items switching the detainee from hot rations to mres and forced grooming ibid 61 positions at gtmo442 when asked how stress positions came to be included in ltc phifers memo given the agreement referenced in her earlier email ltc beaver said that she did not know but added that ltc phifer later advocated for their use443 ltc beaver said that she relied on mr becker and ltc phifer to decide which techniques to put in the memo and that she never commented or changed their drafts 444 u the proposed category iii techniques in the october 11 2002 request were the most aggressive and included the use ofscenarios designed to convince the detainee that death or severely painful consequences were imminent for him andor his family exposure to cold weather or water the use ofa wet towel and dripping water to induce the misperception of suffocation and the use of mild noninjurious physical contact such as grabbing poking in the chest with the fmger and light pushing44s according to the october 112002 memo category iii techniques and other aversive techniques such as those used in us military resistance training or by other us government agencies would be utilized to interrogate exceptionally resistant detainees which ltc phifer estimated as less than 3 ofthe detainees held at gtmo446 utwoofthecategory iiitechniques inltcphifersmemotheuse ofphobiasand the use ofthe wet towel and dripping water to induce the misperception of suffocation were not derived from the october 22002 bsct memo447 cia lawyer jonathan fredman however had reportedly discussed both ofthese techniques during his october 2 2002 meeting with gtmo personnel noting that the use ofphobias was very effective and that the use ofthe wet towel technique makesabodyreactasis ifitssuffocating448 mrbeckertoldthecommittee thathe the ice chief may have recommended adding those two techniques to the request for authority 449 u ltc phifer said that he drafted his memo with mr becker4so mr becker however told the committee that he was provided draft only after it was nearly complete he said that 442 vice admiral albert t church review ofdepartment ofdefense detention operations and detainee inteogation techniques march 72005 hereinafter church reporfj at 109 citing email from ltc beaver august 19 2002 443 ltc beaver told the committee that ltc phifer advocated the use of stress positions in the interrogation of mohammed khatani discussed below committee staff interview of ltc diane beaver november 92007 444 ibid 44 ltc phifer to mg michael dunlavey requestfor approval ofcounterresistance strategies 446 ibid 447 the use of wet towel and dripping water to induce the misperception of drowning appears to describe waterboarding the navy is the only service that used waterboarding in sere training which it ceased in november 2007 448 counter resistance strategy meeting minutes at 5 the ctc chief counsel explained that if welltrained individual is used to perform the wettowel technique it can feel like youre drowning the lymphatic system will react as if youre suffocating but your body will not cease to function 449 committee staff interview of david becker september 17 2007 40 committee staff interview of ltc jerald phifer june 27 2007 62 he thought the techniques memo was stupid though he did not share his view with ltc phifer atthetime451 ltc phifer told thecommittee that hewas uncomfortable with theidea ofusing some ofthe techniques in his memo but that mg dunlavey pressured him to fmish the request452 b gtmo staff judge advocate conducts legal review ofaggressive interrogation techniques u u the october 11 2002 techniques memo was accompanied by cover memo and legal briefwritten by gtmos staff judge advocate sja ltc diane beaver the cover memo stated simply that the proposed strategies do not violate applicable federal law 453 u ltc beaver told the committee that she drafted the legal brief with her staff over the course ofthe2002 columbus day weekend454 shetold thecommittee that shehadnotseen either ofthe legal memoranda produced bythedepartment ofjustice office oflegal counsel on august 1 2002 and that she did not receive input on the legal brief from anyone outside of gtmo the minutes ofthe october 2 2002 meeting with cia lawyer jonathan fredman however reflect that ltc beaver was present when he discussed the torture convention and the federal law implementing the treaty in that discussion mr fredman described severe physical pain as anything causing permanent damage to major organs or body parts455 the idea that severe physical pain constituting torture had to rise to the level oforgan failure irnpainnent ofbodily functions or even death had been discussed in the olc legal memo of august 1 2002 known as the first bybee memo456 u ltc beaver began heranalysis oftheaggressive techniques bystating that the detainees currently held at guantanamo bay are not protected by the geneva conventions457 ltc beaver stated that the office ofthe secretary ofdefense had not adopted specific guidelines regarding interrogation techniques for detainee operations at gtmo and she dismissed the longstanding guidance on interrogation ofdetainees contained in the army field manual fm 3452 as not binding458 m committee staff interview ofdavid becker september 17 2007 m committee staff interview ofltc jerald phifer june 27 2007 453 memo from ltc diane beaver for commander joint task force 170 legal review ofaggressive interrogation techniques

resistance strategies october ii 2002 hereinafter ltc beaver legal brief on proposed counterresistance strategies 458 the sja concluded that because the techniques in the army fm 3452 are constrained by and conform to the geneva conventions and applicable intemationallaw and that the geneva conventions do not apply as matter of law the field manual was not binding see ltc beaver legal brief on proposed counterresistance strategies at 1 63 u in her memo ltc beaver stated that u s obligations under the convention against torture restricted only those cruel inhuman or degrading acts that were also prohibited by the current standard articulated in the eighth amendment against cruel and unusual punishment 459 the memo concluded that the proposed interrogation techniques would be consistent with the eighth amendment standard so long as any force used could plausibly have been thought necessary to achieve legitimate governmental objective and it was applied in goodfaith effortandnotmaliciously orsadistically fortheverypurpose ofcausingharm460 u ltc beaver also concluded that the proposed interrogation techniques would not violate the federal antitorture statute so long as they were not specifically intended to cause severe physical pain or suffering or prolonged mental harm ltc beaver conducted her analysis with the assumption that severe physical pain would not be inflicted and absent any evidence that any ofthese strategies would in fact cause prolonged and long lasting mental harm461 ltc beaver told the committee that she did not conduct any research to determine whether the use ofthe techniques described in the accompanying request for authority would in fact result in longterm mental harm462 ii the october 2 2002 bsct memo however had specifically cautioned that the techniques could affect the short term andor long term physical andor mental health ofthe detainee and that physical andor emotional harm from the techniques may emerge months or even years after their use463 u ltc beaver also found that some ofthe proposed tactics would constitute per violation ofthe uniform code ofmilitary justice ucmj article that prohibits military personnel from committing assault and could violate the article that prohibits military personnel from communicating threat464 as result ltc beaver said it would be advisable to have permission or immunity in advance from the convening authority for military members utilizing these methods465 in anovember 42002 lettertothejoint staffj5the marinecorps commented on the sjas recommendation to convey permission or immunity in advance noting that we are unaware ofany authority that would allow convening authority to give permission or immunity in advance to commit criminal violation466 likewise military lawyers from the judge advocate generals legal center and school later said that ltc beavers proposal to immunize interrogators given that number ofthe proposed techniques in 459 ltc beaver legal briefon proposed counterresistance strategies at 2 460 ibid at 5 461 ibid 462 committee staffinterview ofltc diane beavernovember 92007 463 bsct counterresistance

techniques november 4 2002 see also section iv d infra 64 issue constituted violations ofthe ucmj was not only unprecedented but lacked any basis in law467 u based on her legal review ltc beaver recommended that the proposed methods of interrogation be approved but that interrogators be trained to use the methods and that interrogations involving category ii and iii methods undergo legal medical behavioral science and intelligence review prior to commencement 468 u ltc beaver told the committee that she called the southcom staff judge advocate col manny supervielle like on sunday october 10 2002 and sent southcom draft ofthe legal memo that same day46 she said that she told col supervielle that she really needed some help but that she received comments from southcom prior to submitting the final memo the next day470 ltc beaver said that she also talked to the legal counsel to the chainnan ofthejointchiefs ofstaffcaptjane daltonandaskedforherhelp butwastoldthat she should talk to col supervielle471 capt dalton said that she did not recall that conversation with ltc beaver472 ltc beaver also told the committee that mg dunlavey did not comment on drafts ofthe memo and that she did not discuss it with him after it was completed473 c chain ocommand considers the requestor interrogation techniques as citf and fbi raise objections u u on october 11 2002 mg dunlavey submitted ltc phifers memo and ltc beavers legal analysis to general james hill the commander ofthe united states southern command soufhcom he also sent his own memo requesting approval to use the interrogation techniques474 mg dunlavey wrote i am fully aware of the techniques currently employed to gain valuable intelligence in support of the global war on terrorism although these techniques have resulted in significant exploitable intelligence the same methods have become less effective over time i believe the methods and techniques delineated in the accompanying j2 memorandum will

that these techniques do not violate us or international 475laws u on october 252002 gen hill forwarded the jtf170 request to chairman ofthe joint chiefs ofstaff gen richard myers with memorandum stating that despite our best efforts some detainees have tenaciously resisted our current interrogation methods476 he continued 0urrespective staffs theofficeofthe secretary ofdefense and joint taskforce 170 have been trying to identify counterresistant techniques that we can lawfully employ477 when later asked gen hill could not recall whether southcom roduced written opinion analyzing thegtmorequest separate from ltc beavers opinion48 u as to techniques in the gtmo request for interrogation techniques gen hill said that he did discuss the topic ofsere training in general manner with mg dunlavey479 years later in june 3 2004 press briefing gen hill noted the influence ofthe fort braggtrip and sere school techniques on the request stating the staff at guantanamo working with behavioral scientists having gone up to our sere school and developed list of techniques which our lawyers decided and looked at said were ok i sent that list oftechniques up to the secretary and said in order for us to get at some ofthese very highprofile highvalue targets who are resistant to techniques i may need greater flexibility but i want legal review of it and you to tell that policywise its the right way to do business 480 u in his october 25 2002 memo gen hill stated that although he believed categories i and ii techniques were legal and humane he was uncertain about techniques in category iii and was particularly troubled by the use ofimplied or expressed threats ofdeath ofthe detainee or his family481 nevertheless gen hill said that he desired to have as many options as possible at his disposal and asked that departments ofdefense and justice attorneys review the category iii techniques482 m mg dunlavey to gen hill counterresistance strategies 476 memo from gen james

important enough to where there ought to be high level look at it there ought to be major policy discussion of this and everybody ought to be involved army ig interview of gen james t hill october 7 2005 at 7 66 u one southcom assistant staff judge advocate ltc mark gingras testified to the army ig that lawyers for south com had concerns about category ii and category iii techniques483 regarding the gtmo request for techniques ltc gingras told the anny ig as lawyers were talking about adherence to the rule of law being important and thats what were trying to tell everybody as we travel around the world to these other countries thats paramount to democracy and so suddenly we look like were brushing this aside or were twisting the law the feeling was that decision makers within the pentagon didnt much care about that they cared about winning the war on terrorism and ifthat meant you had to pull out fmgernails youd pull out fmgernails figuratively speaking 484 d military services react to gtmo requestor interrogation techniques u u on october 302002 after receiving gen hills memo and the gtmo request the joint staff j5 requested thatthe military services comment ontherequest485 u on november 12002 the air force responded expressing serious concerns regarding thelegality ofmany ofthe proposed techniques and stating thatsome ofthese techniques could be construed as torture as that crime is defmed by 18 usc 2340486 the air force memorandum added that with respect to potential prosecutions the use ofcatego iii techniques would almost certainly result in any statements obtained being inadmissible 87 the memorandum stated that admissibility ofevidence obtained using categories i and ii techniques thelatter ofwhich included stress positions the useofdogs removal ofclothing and deprivation oflight and auditory stimuli among other techniques would be fact specific but the same concerns remain 488 the air force memo continued additionally the techniques described may be subject to challenge as failing to meet the requirements outlined in the military order to treat detainees humanely implementation ofthe proposed techniques would require change in presidential policy489 the memo stated that the air force concurs in the need to conduct an indepth legal and policy assessment as recommended by the southcom commander prior to implementation ofthe proposed counterresistance interrogation techniques 490 u on november 4 2002 the navy responded to the joint staffs request for comment stating that it concur red with developing range ofadvanced

more detailed interagency legal and policy review be conducted on the proposed techniques 491 u that same day the marine corps submitted its written comments which concluded that several ofthe category ii and iii techniques arguably violate federal law and would expose our service members to possible prosecution492 the marine corps memo stated that the use ofthe techniques would also create exposure to criminal prosecution under the ucmj493 again category iii techniques included the use ofscenarios designed to convince the detainee that death or severely painful consequences were imminent for him or his family exposure to cold weather or water use ofa wet towel and dripping water to induce the misperception of suffocation and noninjurious physical contact such as grabbing poking and light pushing494 category ii included such techniques as stress positions deprivation oflight and auditory stimuli the use ofa hood during questioning 20 hour interrogations removal ofclothing and the use of detainee phobias such as dogs to induce stress the memo also stated the marine corps disagree d with the position that the proposed plan is legally sufficient495 u few days later the army submitted comments from both the office ofthe judge advocate general otjag and the citf496 the armys cover memo stated that army interposes significant legal policy and practical concerns regarding most ofthe category ii and all ofthe category iii techniques proposed and that the army concurs in the recommendation for comprehensive legal review ofthis proposal in its entirety by the department ofdefense and the department ofjustice491 the otjags memorandum which was attached stated that category iii techniques violate the presidents order on humane treatment and various ucmj articles and that the use ofscenarios designed to convince the detainee that death or severely painful consequences are imminent for him andor his family and the use ofa wet towel and dripping water to induce themisperception ofsuffocation appear tobeclear violations ofthe federal torture statute498 the otjag memorandum also stated that category ii techniques of stress positions deprivation oflight and auditory stimuli and using individual phobias to induce stress crosses the line ofhumane treatment would likely be considered maltreatment under 491 department ofthe navy memo for the

forced grooming may be considered inhumane if done only for interrogation puoses and stated ifwe mistreat detainees we will quickly lose the moral high ground 0 the army concurred with gen hills request for legal review before techniques were adopted 501 u military lawyers were not the only personnel to object to gtmos request for aggressive techniques citf deputy commander mark fallon told the committee that it was citfs view that the techniques proposed by jtf170 would actually strengthen rather than weaken detainee resistance he explained our view was that employing techniques that validated the detainees prior training and adverse views would serve to harden resistance and reinforce what they had been told to expect we pointed out that sere school tactics were developed to better prepare us military personnel to resist interrogations and not as means of obtaining reliable information citf was troubled with the rationale that techniques used to harden resistance to interrogations would be the basis for the utilization oftechniques to obtain information 502 u citfs legal view was reflected in november 42002 memo from citf chief legal advisor maj sam mccahon which was also attached to the armys response to the joint staff maj mccahon wrote category iii and certain category ii techniques may subject service members to punitive articles of the ucmj citf personnel who are aware of the use or abuse of certain techniques may be exposed to liability under the ucmj for failing to intercede or report incidents if an inquiry later determines the conduct to be in violation of either the eighth amendment to the u s constitution the uniform code of military justice or 18 usc 2340503 u maj mccahon also raised concerns about the impact ofthe techniques on evidentiary proceedings one detainee subjected to these techniques could taint the voluntary nature of all other confessions and information derived from detainees not subjected to the aggressive techniques 504 499 ibid 500 ibid 501 ibid 502 responses ofmr mark fallon to questionnaire of senator carl levin september 15 2006 at 7 503 memo from citf chief legal advisor mal sam mccahon to citf

that is predicated upon the principle that all is well ifthe ends justify the means and others are not aware ofhow we conduct our business 506 u mal mccahon told the committee that his memorandum

he met with southcom commander gen hill and his staff 541 during those meetings mg miller got the impression that mg dunlavey the previous commander had bypassed the chain of command by raising issues

only briefed him quarterly in person on gtmo operations 546 u shortly after mg miller arrived at gtmo the director for intelligence j2 ltc phifer informed him oftheoctober 112002 request 547 although helater approved an interrogation plan that included reference to category iii techniques mg miller told the army ig that he believed that the techniques in category iii and some techniques in category ii were overly aggressive and that he had not intended to use them548 mg miller said he had concerns with stress positions removal ofclothing and use of dogs among other techniques nevertheless there is evidence that those techniques were used at gtmo while he was in command mg miller told the committee that he thought he discussed his concerns about the techniques with ltc beaver in early november before the secretary approved their use but that he did not raise it with soufhcom because he wanted to see which techniques would be approved 549 u mg miller told the army ig that when he arrived at gtmo there was significant tension between jtfgtmo citf and fbi and that he sought to get all three organizations to work in concert 550 despite mg millers stated intent his

first special interrogation plan at gtmo and it would encounter strong resistance from both citf and the fbi one fbi special agent told the committee that he thought khatanis interrogation would defme the conduct offuture interrogations at gtmo and therefore they had to get it right551 iiseveral drafts ofjtfgtmos interrogation plan for khatani were circulated at gtmo in november 2002 the discussion

techniques575 he stated i strongly disagree with the use of many ofthe proposed category 3 and some category 2 techniques i feel they will be largely ineffective and that they will have serious negative material and legal effects on our investigations i also am extremely concerned that the use of many of these techniques will open any military members up for potential criminal charges and that my agents as well as other military personnel will face both legal and ethical problems ifthey become aware oftheir use 576 u col mallow told the committee that in addition to his email he raised concerns about the khatani interrogation in conversations with mg miller and in several meetings with the dod general counse1577 col mallow said that mg miller told him in meeting that if citf did not

called for the interrogators to induce and exploit stockholm syndrome by establishing an isolated austere environment where the detainee becomes completely dependent on the interrogators

resistance training submitted by itfgtmo once the approvals are in place those interrogation techniques will be implemented to encourage 063 to cooperate the intent ofraising the stakes to this level is to convince 063 that it is futile to resist success of phase iii is when his sense of futility is raised to high enough level that source gives in and provides the necessary information phase iii ends with success or standstill after the exhaustion ofalltools itf gtmo has to offer 618 iidespite having approved the plan mg miller testified to the army ig that he knew little about sere and wasnt comfortable with sere techniques619 however mg miller acknowledged to the committee that these techniques were included in the approved plan and that ifthe first three phases ofthe khatani plan were unsuccessful that he was willing to consider the use of sere techniques620 lithe plans final phase phase v maintained the same title coalition exploitation as phase iv ofthe earlier plan but did not explicitly state an intention to render khatani to third country as did the earlier plan621 instead under coalition exploitation the november 22 2002 plan stated that the fifth phase of the plan to

interrogation techniques the fbi also requested meeting with the commander628 the memo stated many of itfgtmos methods are considered coercive by federal law enforcement and ucmj standards not only this but reports from those knowledgeable about the use of these coercive techniques are highly skeptical as to their effectiveness and reliability 629 u the memo stated further that the fbicitf strongly believes that the continued use of diametrically opposed interrogation strategies in gtmo will only weaken our efforts to obtain valuable infonnation 630 u in late november fbi agents at gtmo asked that their concerns about itfgtmo interrogation techniques be relayed to marion spike bowman senior attorney in the fbis office ofgeneral counsel631 mr bowman said that as soon as i heard from

fbi special agent referred to several techniques such as all the category iii techniques and several category ii techniques including stress positions hooding removal of clothing 20 hour interrogations and use ofindividual phobias such as fear ofdogs to induce stress as coercive interrogation techniques which are not permitted by the us constitution635 the special agents analysis also identified several techniques including all category iii techniques and two category ii techniques hooding and use ofphobias as examples ofcoercive interrogation techniques which may violate 18 usc 2340 torture statute and warned that it is possible that those who employ these techniques may be indicted prosecuted and possibly convicted ifthe trier offact determines that the user had the

acceptable technique and that dogs were not to be used during active interrogation 687 in written answers to questions posed by vice admiral church however the director for intelligence ltc phifer stated that dogs were used in the khatani interrogation and that we would bring the dog around to within 10 feet of khatani and he would be somewhat unnerved by it we did it to keep him off balance as well as to enhance security688 despite the testimony ofthe bsct psychiatrist and ltc phifer mr becker stated that the commander refused to allow dogs in interrogations while he was in command

that while all category iii techniques may be legally available we believe that blanket approval ofcategory iii techniques is not warranted at this time720 while the cjcs general myers said that he did not recall seeing the november 27 2002 memo before it was presented to the secretary his legal counsel capt dalton said that she and the chairman were satisfied with the techniques that were recommended to the secretary for approval 721 capt dalton also said however that she did not think the statement in the dod general counsels memo that all category iii techniques may be legally available was an appropriate legal analysis722 she did not raise that concern with the chairman 723 u mr haynes stated that he probably read ltc beavers legal analysis ofthe request prior to making his recommendation but that he could not recall his opinion ofit 724 he could not recall whether he asked anyone on his staffto review or comment on the analysis or whether his office conducted its own legal review 725 u as discussed above general hili the southcom commander had requested in his october 252002 memorandum that department ofjustice and department ofdefense lawyers review category iii techniques included in the october 11 2002 gtmo request 726 while the department of justices office of legal counsel ole had issued an opinion on august 12002 evaluating standards ofconduct for interrogations required under the antitorture statute mr haynes testified in july 2006 that he did not have copy ofthat opinion and that the olc had not expressed view to him at that time727 in april 2008 however mr haynes stated that it was very very likely that he had read the olc opinion prior to making his recommendation to the secretary and recalled it being very permissive728 two months later in june 2008 mr haynes testified that he did not remember when he ftrst read the olc memo729 the general counsel said that he did not know whether anyone in his office consulted the department ofjustice about the october 11 2002 gtmo request and he did not believe ooj reviewed the techniques in the context ofthe gtmo request 730 u other than his november 27 2002 memo to secretary rumsfeld

policy experts at the highest levels before decision was reached and was shocked that her opinion became the opinion upon which the department of defense relied732 ltc beaver stated that she did not expect that her opinion would become the final word on interrogation policies and practices within the department ofdefense and that for her such result was simply not foreseeable 733 she stated that she did not expect to be the only lawyer issuing written opinion on this monumentally important issue and that in hindsight could not help but conclude that others chose not to write on this issue to avoid being linked to it734 u despite the fact that his memo recommended the secretary of defense authorize the use ofaggressive interrogation techniques including stress positions deprivation of light and auditory stimuli hooding removal ofclothing the use ofdogs to induce stress and pushing and poking detainees mr haynes stated that he was not recommending blanket approval of other aggressive techniques in the gtmo request like the use of wet towel and dripping water to induce the misperception ofdrowning because our anned forces are trained to standard of interrogation that reflects tradition ofrestraint 735 u while several techniques included in the request were similar to techniques used in sere training and provided by jpra to the general counsels office in the july 262002 memo mr haynes said that he did not specifically recall making connection between the request and sere 736 in comments submitted to the dod igs august 252006 report the dod general counsels

undergo strict psychiatric screening and be strictly supervised while doing their jobs at the sere school 769 maj burney said that there are still times when instructors go bit too far and have to be redirected by other instructors the sere school takes this training very seriously it clearly is not see one do one teach one kind of situation 770 the psychiatrist warned the environment down here is much different than at sere school there is not cadre of experienced sere instructors the interrogators have not gone through sere school or been subjected to this treatment themselves there is not psychiatric screening process in place the interrogators are away from home family friends and are under lot more stress than sere instructors at the sere school the detainees being questioned are the enemy and are not us personnel posing as the enemy all these factors make using this kind of pressure much more dangerous in this environment compared to at the sere school 771 _as to the utility ofthe sere resistance techniques maj burney also stated that it is quite possible that employing these techniques exactly as employed in sere school may actuallystrengthen adetainees ability

stated that the category iii techniques from the october 112002 gtmo request were the most aggressive and controversial techniques 873 mr becker stated that the techniques were currently used against us soldiers in sere schools with their consent but that they would not comport with the geneva conventions if appliedtoprisoners ofwarpows874 hismemorecommended thattheworking group conduct policy

waterboard is one ofthe techniques used with effect b 880mterrogators _ as to the three less common techniques in his memo use ofdrugs use of female interrogators and sleep deprivation mr becker stated that interrogation approaches are limited only by the imagination of interrogators and that it would be impossible to list every possible interrogation approach 881 his memo stated that drugs such as sodium pentothal and demerol may be used with some effectiveness that female interrogators could be used to make the detainee feel unclean and that sleep deprivation can be effective882 mr

that he is unclean and he cannot pray until he cleans himself which he is unable to do until he returns to his cell the use of female interrogators to put oil on detainee does not exceed limits already established by dod policy or the geneva conventions 3 sleep deprivation this can be effective however there are obvious policy considerations guidelines as to the use of sleep deprivation

nine included use ofan isolation facility interrogating the detainee in an environment other than the standard interrogation room at camp delta such as camp xray varying levels of deprivation of light and auditory stimuli to include the use ofa whiteroomfor uptothree days theuse ofupto 20hourinterrogations the use ofahoodduring transportation and movement removal of all comfort items including religious items serving ofmealsreadyto eatmres instead ofhotrations forced grooming to include shaving of facial hair and head and the use offalse documents and reports 886 _ mg millers january 21 2003 memo stated that he believed that those nine techniques were lawful and stated these techniques are not intended to cause gratuitous severe physical pain or suffering or prolonged mental harm but are instead intended to induce cooperation over period of time by weakening the detainees mental and physical ability to resist887_mg miller attached another memo to his january 212003 memo for general hill that attached memo also dated january 21 2003 and entitled methods employed xray interrogation ofisn 63 bore the same title as memo dated january 172003 the earlier memo is described in detail above despite describing the same events and being written just days apart the january 21 2003 and the january 172003 memos contain substantive differences _ several interrogation techniques that the january 172003 memo identified as techniques used in the khatani interrogation were omitted from the january 21 2003 version among the techniques left out ofthe latter memo were fhysical posturing searchstrip search and the presence ofk9 military police dogs 88 in addition the description ofcertain techniques differed in the two versions ofthe memo for example in the latter version

that prior to their rescission cjtf180 used selected techniques contained in solithcoms category ii and iii techniques 892 he identified interrogation techniques used by cjtf180 including up to 96 hours of isolation the use offemale interrogators to create discomfort and gain more information sleep adjustment defined as four hours of sleep every 24 hours not necessarily consecutive use ofindividual fears removal ofcomfort items use ofsafety positions isolation deprivation of lit and sound in living areas the use of hood during interrogation and mild physical contact 3 several

techniques from the sere community on january 30 2003 maj nick lovelace an action officer at the joint staff directorate for intelligence j2 contacted jpra on behalfofthe working group897 _ maj lovelace called mr joseph witsch the jpra instructor who had previously conducted training for and had served as team chiefat the september 2002 training for gtmo interrogators and behavioral science personnel at fort bragg898 _ maj lovelace requested material from jpra identifying interrogation techniques and methodologies used by the sere community899 according to mr witsch maj lovelace had already received information from the army sere school but he described the information provided as insufficient for his tasking900 _mr witsch advised maj lovelace that information on interrogation techniques had already been provided to the department ofdefense general counsel and to the dia and he suggested that thejointstaffactionofficercoordinate withthem901 majlovelace indicated however that he was familiar with those materials but that he was looking for more detail on exact procedures techniques and constraints than had already been provided 902 _ maj lovelaces request on behalfofthe working group prompted discussion atjpraabout theadvisability ofproviding sereschool methodology insupport ofthe gwot totheworking groupandotherorganizations903 inanemailtojpra chiefofstaff daniel baumartner mr witsch expressed four serious concerns about sharing the requested information 904 _ first among his concerns was the potential effect that sharing sere school techniques could have on the training of american personnel mr witsch wrote open source intel and media is flooded with what the usgogas and dod are currently doing with designated unlawful combatants ducs how long will it take before we see some discussion on sere school methods and techniques being used to interrogate ducs ill take bets that it will occur in days and weeks 897 email from joseph witsch to lt col dan baumgartner january 30 2003 898 ibid 899 the joint staff action officer stated that they needed the infonnation immediately since the blue ribbon panel organized by the af general counsel intended to work through the weekend to meet this immediate requirement email from joseph witsch to dan baumgartner january 30 2003 900 ibid 901 ibid 902 ibid 90j ibid 904 email from joseph witsch to lt col daniel baumgartner january 312003 versus months it aint healthy for our operators to expose how we prepare them to deal with interrogation and captivity in open source media 905 _ second mr witsch stated that the sere techniques violated national and international laws he wrote our training is based on simulating our captors passed sic performance while tapering the physicalpsychological severity and harm to our students the physical and psychological pressures we apply in training violate national and international laws we are only allowed to do these things based on permission from dod management and intense oversight by numerous organizations within dod i hope someone is explaining this to all these folks asking for our techniques and methodology 906 _ his third concern was that lack of proper oversight could give rise to significant drift which in tum could pose risk ofinvestigation and exposure ofthe organization mr witsch asked what do you think is more than likely to happen when one ofthese organizations gets exposed and because of significant drift and lack of oversight they go beyond what we do in the sere schools the first question will be where did you get your guidance then we get investigated and exposed 907 _ mr witschs fourth concern was that jpra would have control over how the information would be used he asked whats been handed out in hard copy and electronically from us and the sere community to meet numerous requests from everybody we use sic to have some general idea when we were dealing with primarily the sere community now its anybodys ess where the jttp has gone and how its being incoqorated and used 9 8 _ mr witsch added i know this is cool stuff and may provide some utility when dealing with ducs im not saying that we should totally remove ourselves from this endeavor we must get handle on all these people seeking information on our stuff within the usg and dod and control the amount of exposure our sere communityprograms are getting this is getting out of control 909 905 ibid 906 ibid 907 ibid 908 ibid 909 ibid 117 _ lt col baumgartner recalled that he managed to delay providing information to the working group but that jpra later briefed the judge advocate general ofthe air force whowasa member ofthe working group onseretechniques including physical pressures910 b department ofjustice office oflegal counsels analysis is presentedas controlling authority u u at the initial meeting ofthe working group in addition to briefing from the dia participants also received briefing from the department ofjustices office of legal counsel olc911 despite the secretarys guidance that the working group assess the legal issues relating to the interrogations ofdetainees dod general counsel jim haynes who knew that the olc had already done some work on the issues reuested that the olc produce legal opinion to guide the working groups deliberations9 2 u in the early stages ofthe working groups deliberations working group members had set out to develop their own legal analysis and utilize that analysis in the evaluation of interrogation techniques 913 draft ofthat analysis dated january 25 2003 was shared with the dod general counsels office and the olc 914 _ the draft reviewed us obligations under international law and concluded that obligations under the torture convention apply to the interrogation ofoperation enduring freedom detainees 915 thedraftanalysisalsoincluded areview ofarticlesoftheucmjand other us legal standards that were potentially applicable to us interrogators for example the analysis found that unlawful force used against detainee could constitute an offense under article 128 assault ofthe ucmj and stated that assault may be interpreted to include unreasonably offensive poking slapping hitting prodding or pushing hooding not likely included if used for security reasons offensive touching would also include more severe techniques eg wet towels handcuffing ifnotinherentandnecessary to custodial conduct 916 _the draft analysis also assessed the legality ofthe techniques that had been requested for approval by gtmo in october 2002 including some ofthose that the secretary of defense had approved for use at gtmo in december 2002 in its draft the working group 910 committee staff interview oflt col dan baumgartner august 82007

interrogations survey oflegal and policy considerations at 18 916 ibid at 10 118 adopted the conclusion that navy jag corps cdr stephen gallotta had reached in his january 9 2003 memo writing that category iii techniques that threaten death to the detainee or his family 1 or which create the misapprehension of suffocation 3 would likely be judged to constitute torture under the statute and customary international law they reflect conduct specifically defmed as torture in 18 usc 2340 and recognized as torture in international law category iii technique 4 mild noninjurious grabbing and poking is an assault under the ucmj absent lawful purpose these techniques may be per unlawful category ii techniques could also depending in their implementation ie frequency ofuse degree ofpain inflicted or combinations oftechniques rise to level where they could be determined to be torture thus additional analysis with specific guidance for implementation is recommended 917_the draft working group analysis recommended additional factual information and legal analysis to establish both the legality ofthe proposed techniques and any limits to be applied to their use918 the draft also expressed significant concerns with some of the substantive measures in the october 11 2002 gtmo proposal as submitted particularly in category ii and almost all ofcategory 111919 the working groups legal analysis was however soon superseded by that ofthe ole920 u within the first two weeks ofthe working groups deliberations the ole delivered draft legal memo to air force general counsel mary walker921 the oles memo which would be fmalized on march 14 2003 was presented to the working group as the controlling authority for all questions ofdomestic and internationallaw922 among the working group members there was great deal ofdisagreement with the olc analsis and serious concerns and objections over some ofthe legal conclusions reached by ole9 3 917 ibid at 20 918 ibid 919 ibid 920 in comments to the air force general cowlsel mary walker about march 62003 draft of the working group report the navy tjag radm michael lohr encouraged the working group to incorporate reference to the olc opinion into its report noting that the draft report contained large segments of doj work product rather than being informed by dol memo from radm michael lohr to mary walker comments on the 6 march 2003 detainee interrogation working group report march 13 202 at 1 921 mora statementfor the record at 16 hearing on the nomination of william haynes ii to be us circuit judge for the fourth circuit us senate committee on the judiciary july 11 206 at 14 922 church report at 124 923 ibid 119 _nevertheless at mr hayness direction ms walker instructed the working group to consider the olc memorandum as authoritative and directed that it supplant the legal analysis being prepared by the working group action officers924 ucaptdaltonthe legalcounseltothechairman ofthe jointchiefs ofstaffsaid she was very angry when told that the working group would be governed by the olcs legal analysis925 she told the committee there was point during the working group process where we were told that we could not argue against the olc opinion that any other legal ideas that we had would not be accepted particularly when we commented on the draft report926 likewise alberto mora the navy general counsel and participant in the working group said that soon upon receipt ofthe ole memo the working group leadership began to apply its guidance to shape the content of its report927 mr mora stated that contributions from the members ofthe working group including contributions from his office began to be rejected ifthey did not conform to the ole guidance928 u the final ole memo signed by john yoo on march 14 2003 and known commonly as the yoo memo adopted many ofthe same conclusions as those ofthe first bybee memo dated august 1 2002 in which the olc had significantly narrowed the scope of what constituted torture under federal law for example mr yoos memo repeated olcs previous analysis ofthe federal antitorture statute 18 usc 2340 finding that the statute prohibited only extreme acts and that in order to constitute torture physical pain would have to be equivalent in intensity to that accompanying serious physical injury such as organ failure impairment of bodily functions or even death929 u the final march 142003 olc memo however added that general criminal statutes such as the federal antitorture statute were inapplicable to the military during the conduct of war930 the olc concluded that the assault maiming interstate stalking and antitorture statutes do not apply to the properlyauthorized interrogation of enemy combatants by the united states armed forces during an armed conflict931 924 church report at 126 citing february 2 2003 working group draft 925 committee staff interview of jane dalton april 102008 at 167 926 ibid at 165 921 mora

yoo memo march 14 2003 at 1119 despite concluding that such statutes are inapplicable to the military during the conduct ofa war the olc memo nonetheless considered whether use of certain speciftc techniques by an 120 u the olcs conclusion was based in part on its analysis ofthe presidents commander in chiefauthority in the first bybee memo the ole had asserted that any effort by congress to regulate the interrogation ofbattlefield detainees would violate the constitutions sole vesting ofthe commanderinchief authority in the president 932 in keeping with that finding the march 14 2003 fmal olc memo held that the power to detain and interrogate enemy combatants arose out ofthe presidents constitutional authority as commander in chief 933 in wartime according to the memo it is for the president alone to decide what methods to use to best prevail against the enemy934 u in the march 14 2003 final opinion the olc used its broad reading ofthe commanderinchief authority to conclude that even if federal criminal statutes were misconstrued to apply to interrogations the department ofjustice could not enforce this law or any ofthe other applicable criminal statutes935 according to the olc even ifan interrogation method arguably were to violate criminal statute the justice department could not bring alrosecution because the statute would be unconstitutional as applied in this context93 u the first bybee memo and the march 142003 final ole memo were withdrawn in june 2004 and december 2003 respectively937 according to assistant attorney general for ole jack goldsmith the memos were legally flawed tendentious in substance and tone and 938overbroad u the navy general counsel alberto mora called the olc memo relied on by the working group in 2003 profoundly in error and travesty ofthe applicable law939 interrogator would constitute an offense under those laws for example the olc memo considered whether slapping or attempting to slap detainee would constitute assault

first bybee memo and the march 142003 final olc memo this extreme conclusion has foundation in prior olc opinions or injudicial decisions or in any other source of law goldsmith continued and the conclusions significance sweeps far beyond the interrogation opinion or the torture statute it implies that many other federal laws that limit interrogationantiassault laws the 1996 war crimes act and the uniform code of militajy justiceare also unconstitutional conclusion that would have surprised the many prior presidents who signed or ratified those laws or complied with them during wartime the conclusion was even more inappropriate according to goldsmith because it rested on cursory and onesided legal arguments that failed to consider congresss competing wartime constitutional authorities

mr mora the olc memo proved vastly more sophisticated version ofthe beaver legal brief but it was much more dangerous document because ofthe statutory requirement that olc opinions are binding provided much more weight to its virtually equivalent conclusions 940 he stated that it became evident to those on the working group that the report being assembled would contain profound mistakes in its legal analysis in large measure because of its reliance on the flawed olc memo 941 capt dalton likewise said that to the extent that the working group report relied on the olc memo it did not include what i considered to be fair and complete legal analysis ofthe issues involved942 she added that being told what their leal opinion had to be severely constrained the working groups ability to do an adequate job 3 the report she said had been geared toward ewarticular conclusion and the legal analysis was written to support that conclusion c working group drafts report recommending interrogation techniques ll u when the secretary ofdefense directed the dod general counsel to set up the working group the secretary instructed him to complete the work within 15 days945 although that goal was not met the working group produced several drafts during that time frame and circulated draft final report on february 4 2003946 _ according to vadm churchs report the general counsel

dated january 27 2003 the report identified two categories ofinterrogation techniques proven to be effective 1 those techniques that were currently used by trained interrogators in accordance with us

dietarymanipulation use ofphobiasto increase levels of stress deprivation oflight and auditory stimuli environmental manipulation sleep adjustment prolonged standing and deception949 in describing one ofthese techniques deprivation oflight and auditory stimuli the draft report noted in an apparent reference to sere resistance training that it was an effective technique used in military training95o

used in us military survival evasion resistance and escape sere schools the face slapstomach slap is used in sere training water immersion is effectively used in sere courses use ofa wet towel on face or the waterboard is the most severe technique used at us military sere schools use ofsmoke pipe is also used at the sere school9s4 according to jpras operating instructions the purpose ofsubjecting students to physical pressures in sere school is not to obtain information but to project the students focus into the resistance scenario and realistically simulate conditions associated with

category of techniques previously identified as techniques in use with ancillary military training processes such as sere schools were instead described in the february 22003 draft as techniques considered effective by interrogators and for which ussouthcom and uscentcom have requested approval 959 by the time the working group issued its draft final report on february 4 2003 made reference to sere schools or techniques used in military training96o despite the fact that most ofthe sere techniques remained in the report 961 _ the february 4 2003 draft final report recommended approval of36 interrogation techniques for use with unlawful combatants outside the united states 962 u the report also listed but did not recommend approval of three additional techniques that the working group said it lacked sufficient information to evaluate fully use of stress positions deprivation of light and auditory stimuli and water immersionwetting down 963 two ofthe three techniques that the working group lacked enough information to make judgment on ie stress positions and deprivation of light and auditory stimuli were among those recommended for approval by mr haynes and approved by the secretary ofdefense two months earlier on december 2 2002 _of the 36 recommended interrogation techniques in the february 42003 draft 26 techniques were recommended for general use and 10 techniques were recommended for use with certain limitations964 the 26 techniques recommended in the february 42003 report for general use included 19 techniques from army field manual 3452 or its predecessor and seven techniques that did not comport with the field manual ie hooding mild physical contact dietary manipulation environmental manipulation sleep adjustment false flag and threat of transfer 965 the report also recommended approval of 10 additional exceptional techniques for m the one exception was that the deception technique in the january 272003 draft was replaced with the false flag

as either having originated in sere school or among those previously approved for use at gtmo and identified by mr becker the former gtmo ice chief in his list for the working group u each ofthe 36 recommended techniques was included in colorcoded matrix or stoplight chart and designated as either green yellow or red to signify the working groups assessment oflegal and policy considerations968 aterboarding was the only technique evaluated as red in any area of consideration in the february 42003 report but the working group report continued to recommend at that time that it be approved for use969 that red designation meant that the working group determined that there was major issue in law or policy with respect to waterboarding that cannot be eliminated 970 the working group rated the waterboard as red under us domestic law and the prohibition against cruel inhuman and degrading treatment in the torture convention971 the working group also indicated that the waterboard was not consistent with historical us forces interrogation role prior us public statements or major team consisting of friendly and harsh interrogator that was in the 1987 version offm 3452 but was not found in the then current version and the draft also listed change of scenery up and change of scenery down as separate techniques rather than using the more general change of scene technique listed in fm 3452 church report at 127966 the report stated that use oftechniques listed in the report would be subject to conditions ie limited to specified interrogation centers there is good basis to believe that the detainee possesses critical intelligence the detainee is medically and operationally evaluated as suitable considering all techniques in combination interrogators are specifically trained for the techniques subject to special interrogation plan including reasonable safeguards limits on duration intervals between applications tennination criteria and the presence or availability of

have an effect on the treatment of captured us forces could potentially affect detainee prosecutions was inconsistent with modern us military perceptions in decency in dealing with prisoners and was significant departure from contemporary american military approach to the laws of war972 the february 4 2003 working group report gave the waterboard its only overall red rating and recommended that the approval authority for the technique be lower than the j 973secretary ofdelense u the working groups assessment ofthe techniques on the stoplight chart was governed by the office of legal counsel olc memo the result according to thencapt now radm dalton was that drafts ofthe stoplight chart were absolutely wrong legally974 according to radm dalton there was column originally in the stoplight chart that was labeled customary international law so one ofthe things we were supposed to assess was whether or not the techniques were consistent with customary international law the stoplight chart had all 36 techniques green under customary international law because the olc opinion and thus the working group report maintained that customary international law did not impose any constraints on the actions that green column was absolutely wrong legally it was embarrassing to have it in there and one of my comments to the report was you need to delete that column entire because its embarrassing to have it in there and its not reflective ofthe law 97 d in addition to concerns raised by thencapt dalton almost immediately the february 4 2003 draft final report and its recommended techniques generated objections from top military lawyers within days ofreceiving the report and continuing over the next month the deputy judge advocate general jag ofthe air force jack rives the navy jag michael lohr the army jag thomas romig and the staff judge advocate to the commandant ofthe marine corps kevin sandkuwer submitted memoranda expressing serious concerns about the report and

military lawyers all 36 techniques from the february 42003 draft report remained part ofthe working groups recommendations and were included in the march 6 2003 report 986 the three techniques that the working group could not evaluate fully also remained in the march 6 2003 report but were not recommended for approval 987 by march 6 2003 the working group still had not received adequate information regarding these three techniques including two that had been approved by the secretary in december 2002 to conduct legal or policyanalysis988 u upon receiving the march 6 2003 version senior military lawyers continued to raise concerns that the recommendations were based on flawed olc legal analysis one jag noted that the draft reports introduction which said it was informed by the olc opinion created an incorrect impression since most if not all working group members and tjags disagreedwithsignificant portions oftheoleopinionbutwereforced toacceptit989 the military lawyers also continued to express the view that the recommended techniques would expose american soldiers to potential prosecution would invite reciprocal treatment of captured us personnel could affect the admissibility of detainee statements in criminal prosecutions including military commissions and were not proven to result in obtaining reliable information from those being interrogated 990 d

khatani interrogation for example the memo stated that interrogations would be conducted for up to 20 hours per day on slahi just as they had been for khatani 1040 the memo said that interrogators could pour water on slahis head to enforce control and keep him awake1041 interrogators had also poured water over khatanis head as method of asserting control1042 the january 162003 memo stated that

slahis head and beard making him wear burka and subjecting him to strip search to reduce his ego by assaulting his modesty1049 likewise itfgtmo interrogators had shaved khatanis head and beard and he had also been strip searched 1050 the memo stated that slahi would be denied the opportunity to pray and described techniques to exploit religious taboos such as using female interrogator in close physical contactiosl the memo also stated that interrogators would play music to stress slahi because he believes music is forbidden and that light in slahis interrogation booth would be filtered with

drive him around to make him think he had been taken offofthe island in reality slahi would be taken to camp echo where the interrogation was to continue amemo describing that part oftheplan said thatmilitary police working dogs would be used during his movement to assist developing the atmosphere that something major is happening and add to the tension level ofthe detainee1059 _ interrogating slahi at camp echo was intended to emotionalland psychologically weaken him through drastic changes in his environment1 mirroring the khatani interrogation plan the slahi plan included efforts to relicate and exploit the stockholm syndrome between detainee and his interrogators 061 in his evaluation ofthe khatani plan more than seven months earlier the ncis psychologist assigned to the citf dr michael gelles had saidthat theidea ofinducing the stockholm syndrome implied thatthe subject feels that he is to be killed and the information provided may in fact be distorted 1062_the gtmo plan stated that while in the interrogation room at camp echo slahi would sit in basic chair and be shackled to the floor and left in the room for up to four hours while sound is playing continually1063 his time in the room was intended to disorient him and establish fear ofthe unknown and emphasize to slahi that the rules have changed and nobody knows he is therei064 the practice ofshackling him to the floor and subjecting him to loud music was to be repeated over several days interrupted by actual interrogations slahi was to be permitted four hours ofsleep every sixteen hours 1065 _ the plan stated that an interrogation room would be modified in such way as to reduce as much outside stimuli as possible the doors will be sealed to point that allows light to enter the room the walls may be

interrogator even implied to slahi that he could be tortured or killed iiithe memoranda indicate that on several occasions from july 8 through july 17 slahi was interrogated by masked interrogator called mr x on july 8 2003 slahi was interrogated by mr x and was exposed to variable lighting patterns and rock music to the tune ofdrowning pools let the bodies hit the floor1076 on july 10 2003

conventional ground units in the iraqi theater the cjtf 7 commander ltg sanchez stated that during summer 2003 the general belief was that the number offorces in iraq had to shrink as quickly as possible and that accordingly centcom and cflcc reduced troop levels very very rapidly1266 ltg sanchez said that the draw down left insufficient personnel behind for citf 7 to fulfill its mission as well as inadequate command structures planning capacities and intelligence capabilities he said that during the handover there were intelligence structures that were transferred to cjtf7 from cflcc and as result the remaining intelligence structure did not enable citf7 to address the requirements ofa combined joint task force operating at strategic operational and tacticallevel1267 u lto sanchez stated that by july 2003 it was evident that cjtf 7 was engaged in counterinsurgency operation that would be difficult ifnot impossible to win without significant 1264 email from to isg personnel jwle

experience ofour interrogators 1269 u ltg sanchez said he posed challenge to his staff how do we ensure that we have the right mechanisms in place that allow our interrogators to push the limit ofour authorities yet prevent violation ofthe geneva convention and our duty to treat detainees humanely127o he said that references to the field manuals and doctrine were common responses but the issues being faced were beyond the scope ofthe armys limited doctrine1271 ltg sanchez added that there was frustration about the ability to get handle on the insurgency and that he put tremendous amount ofpressure on his intelligence officers 1272 u the commander ofthe 205th military intelligence brigade col pappas said that soon after arriving in theater in july 2003 cjtf7s chief ofstaffbg daniel hahn directed him to attend meeting to briefltg sanchez on interrogation operations1273 col pappas told the committee that he learned at that meeting that ltg sanchez was concerned that interrogations had not generated the expected intelligence infonnation1274 col pappas said that ltg sanchez believed that ifthe brigade improved its interrogation tactics techniques and procedures that we would get the information necessary to stop the insurgency127s col pappas agreed and told ltg sanchez that his interrogators would need the authority to use additional interrogation techniques to accomplish that goal 1276 2 interrogation operations begin at abu ghraib u u in midsummer 2003 the 205th bde began preparing for operation victory bounty an undertaking designed to track down remaining elements ofthe fedayeen saddam paramilitary organization loyal to saddam hussein1277 in late july 2003 ten to twelve members ofthe 519t1i battalion went to abu ghraib to establish interrogation operations in

within the field manual 3452 only with the possible addition ofstress positions12 0 cpt wood stated that interrogators had used sleep deprivation and stress positions in mghanistan and that she perceived the iraq experience to be evolving into the same operational environment as mghanistan 1281 she said that she used her best judgment and concluded the techniques would be effective tools for interrogations at abu ghraib1282 she also said that she later put together request for additional interrogation options because the winds ofwar were changing and there was mounting pressure from higher for actionable intelligence from interrogation operations1283 cpt wood said that she did not want to repeat her experience in mghanistan where interrogators lacked written guidance 1284 3 51vi battalion at abu ghraib seeks additional guidance u u cpt wood said that guidance for interrogators about the rules for interrogations was important because the interrogators in the 519th battalion had come to abu ghraib with range ofdifferent experiences lot of the interrogators and analysts also served in guantanamo bay and mghanistan where some other techniques were approved for use i understood the mghanistan rules were little different because the detainees were not classified as epws it was use techniques in the spirit of the geneva convention not you will apply the geneva convention in order to use those similar techniques from gtmo and mghanistan in iraq we sought approval from the higher command 1285 u col pappas cpt woods superior officer said he knew that cpt wood

interrogation policy in use at the smu tf facility in iraq 1287 cpt wood said that she and her staff simply cleaned up some ofthe grammar changed the headin and signature block and sent it up to cjtf7 as proposed policy for the 519th bde1 88 ii mirroring the smu tf policies cpt woods proposed policy included sleep management vary comfort positions sitting standing kneeling prone presence ofmilitary working dogs 20hour interrogations isolation and yelling loud music and light control1289 the proposed policy stated that epws that refuse to answer may not be threatened insulted or exposed to unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment ofany kind1290 the prohibition against threats insults and exposure to unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment however was limited to epws and cpt wcod stated that to her knowledge there were epws held at abu ghraib1291 u cpt wood stated that submitting the proposed interrogation policy seemed natural progression to her as she understood the teclmiques were already approved for use at the smu tf in iraq and the policy was similar to that ofa document that was drafted in afghanistan for the bagram collection point as well as gtmo1292 cpt wood did not hear back from cjtf7 at that time 1293 just few weeks later cjtf7 itself solicited wish list of interrogation techniques 5 cjtf7 solicits wish list ofinterrogation techniques u u on august 14 2003 cpt

1297 he called the battle captains use ofthehrase the gloves are coming off dumb thing to say and poor choice of words1 8 ltg sanchez told the committee that he expected his intelligence staffto send out the request for interrogation techniques but stated that the use ofthe phrase the gloves are coming off was not good1299 ltg sanchez believed that the email reflected frustration on the part of intelligence personnel at not being able to meet his intelligence requirements u chief warrant officer cwo lewis welshofer who was with the 3rd annored cavalry regiment responded to cpt ponces email

and remember who we are those gloves are most defmitely not based on cold war or wwii enemiesthey are based on clearly established standards of international law to which we are signatories and in part the originators those in tum derive from practices commonly accepted as morally correct the socalled usages of war it comes down to standards of right and wrong something we cannot just put aside when we find it inconvenient any more than we can declare that we will take prisoners and therefore shoot those who surrender to us simply because we find prisoners inconvenient the casualties are mounting we have taken casualties in every war we have ever foughtthat is part of the very nature of war we also inflict casualties generally more than we take that in way justifies letting go of our standards we have never considered our enemies justified in doing such things to us casualties are part of warif you cannot take casualties then you cannot engage in war period bottom line we are

psychology and maintenance resides almost solely within jpra defensive 1322 u in response the jfcom deputy commander ltg robert wagner questioned whether jpra was operating within its charter he wrote im not sure i see the connection between your assigned responsibilities and this task what charter places jpra in the business of intelligence collection1323 col moulton responded there is nothing in our charter or elsewhere that points us towards the offensive side of captivity conduct nor are we requesting to take this on as new responsibility 1324 he added however that jpra had role to play in helping to educate and assist offensive operations stating those conducting interrogations have already demonstrated the need for our understanding and knowledge of captivity environment and psychology we are also well aware of the problems associated with crossing the rubicon into intel collection or anything close there may be compromise position my gut choice whereby we could

told that interrogators were having trouble gaining actionable intelligence information from detainees in tf custody1332 lt col kleinman felt that the smu tfs lack ofsuccess was resuh ofapoor

mr russell said that expected the jpra team to become fully engaged in interrogation operations and encouraged the team to receive modified rules of engagement roes from jpra since their roes at that time permitted the team to advise and assist but not to engage in direct interrogations133s 1327 ibid emphasis in original 1328 sasc hearing september 25 2008 1329 ibid 1330 to the extent possible the

ofsere school physical pressures in those interrogations col moulton confirmed that the teams understanding ofhis guidance was correct 1336 4 jpra team authorized to participate in interrogations u _ according to mr russell lt col kleinman called col moulton on september 5 2003 to discuss the teams roes and the following day col moulton gave the team permission to become fully engaged in all bif operations 1337 that account is consistent with col moultons recollection which was that lt col kleinman called him after arriving in iraq to discuss request from the smu tf that team members actually participate in interrogations 1338 _____ col moulton said that after getting the call from lt col kleinman he called confirm and inquire about the new request1339 in ss and communications col moulton has consistently stated that he relayedllllllllllllllrequest to jfcom and got jfcoms authorization to permit the jpra team to participate in interrogations col moultons recollection of who at jfcom provided that authority however has varied u according to memorandum ofa september 2005 interview with the jpra commander col moulton relayed the request to the jfcom j3 and got the verbal ok to allow active participation but only for one or two demonstrations and then the team was to go back to its role as observers1340 u in 2006 email to the dod ig however col moulton could not recall exactly whom at jfcom he had spoken with stating during the deployment i received call from the task force commander requesting that our personnel participate in the debriefing i notified jfcom leadership ofthe request either bg moore or ltg wagner i cant remember but think it was ltg wagner since this was late on weekend night and was told that they could support but that any activities had to be

would have received the call on the weekend as it would have had to have occurred over secure line and he did not have that capability at home ltg wagner told the committee that he could not recall if he received call from col moulton 1346 _ according to terrence russell one ofthe jpra team in iraq the jpra team received permission from col moulton to become fully engaged in all bif operations1347 the next day team members met with the smu tf staff and outlined the exploitation cycle and how the staff could incorporate sere training tactics and procedures to support their current interrogation operations 1348 while it is not known when it occurred the chief ofhuman intelligence and counterintelligence j2x for the smu stated that members ofthe jpra team demonstrated interrogation techniques including the attention slap which he said was described as an open handed slap to focus the detainee on the interrogation and walling which was described as push up against the wall 1349 the j2x

which at the time was 1352 5 jpra present as interrogator uses stress positions and slaps u _ on september 6 2003 jpra team members were present in the interrofiation booth when smu tf interrogator used selected physical pressures on detainee 13 according to terrence russell the smu tf interrogator put the detainee on his knees and later began to use insult slaps every 34 seconds for an extended period oftime 1354 u lt col now colonel kleinman described that same interrogation in testimony before the senate armed services committee lt col kleinman said i walked into the interrogation room all painted in black with spotlight on the detainee behind the detainee was military guard with an iron bar slapping it in his hand the interrogator was sitting in chair the interpreter waswastohisleftandthedetainee wasonhisknees aquestion was asked by the interrogator interpreted the response came back and upon interpretation the detainee would be slapped across the face and that continued with every question and every response i asked my colleagues how long this had been going on specifically the slapping they said approximately 30 minutes 1355 u lt col kleinman said that his two jpra colleagues who were present during the interrogation didnt seem to think there was problem because in sere training theres facial slap but its conducted in very specific ways this was not conducted in that fashion1356 in fact lt col kleinman described the environment at the task force facility as uncontrolled1357 _ members ofthe jpra team had differing views on the appropriate response to the interrogators use ofthose techniques mr russell stated that he and mr miller saw nothing wrong with the interrogator forcing the detainee to kneel or his slapping the detainee during the interrogation 1358 lt col kleinman had different reaction _ lt col kleinman considered forcing the detainee to kneel and repeatedly slapping him to be direct violations ofthe geneva conventions and actions that could constitute war crime 1359 upon witnessing the abusive conduct lt col kleinman sought out the smu tf j mz committee staff interview of smu tf j2x february 5 2008 1353 testimony of

right1362 _ following his conversation with the j2x lt col kleinman asked the two members ofhisteamtostepout oftheinterrogation booth according tomrrussell in the hallway lt col kleinman asked us our impression of the use of the kneeling and slaps we both indicated that we saw nothing wrong with what was going on he asked us our opinion of the slapping and we said they were only insult slaps and were not inflicting any pain to the detainee lt col kleinman indicated his disagreement and that both the slaps and kneeling were direct violations of the geneva conventions and could constitute war crime he further indicated that he wanted to intervene and stop the interrogation at that point1363 _ overtheobjections oftheothertwomembers ofjprateamltcolkleinman then asked the smu tf interrogator to step out ofthe booth he explained to the interrogator how and why the interrogators methods were violation ofthe geneva convention and tf policy1364 according to lt col kleinman the interrogator accepted my direction without reservation 1365 with respect to lt col kleinmans actions mr russell stated i think the clear violation of the tf policy was of minor nature that being 10minute extension of the kneeling policy the use of insult slaps was in the opinion of lt col kleinman serious enough to stop the interrogation an action i did not then or now feel warranted his direct intervention 1366 iiinsubsequent testimony to thecommittee mr russellclaimed thatthe use ofthe insult slap was consistent with the facilitys operating instructions under their operating instructions at that bif at that time and place we did not see anything wrong with the use of physical pressures it may not have been 13cio kleinman trip report at 23 1361 ibid 1362 ibid 1363 russell trip report at 5 mr russell also felt that lt col kleinman should have used the interrogators chain of command at the task force to stop the interrogation testimony of terrence russell august 32007 at 105 1364 kleinman trip report at 3 136 ibid 13 kleinman trip report at 3 in his own trip report mr russell also noted that the use ofkneeling was an authorized smu if technique see russell trip report at 34 177 applied the way we would have done it but we didnt see anythinywrong with it we advised lt col kleinman ofthe same he disagreed with us 367 _ smu tf sops reviewed by the committee do not include slapping as an authorized technique and the smu tf j2x told the committee that he was unaware ofany operating instructions that would have permitted an interrogator to repeatedly slap detainee1368 iii despite mr russells previous statement that he saw nothing wrong with what was going on he testified to the committee that he found the smu tf interrogators repeated use of the insult slap to be odd and in excess ofwhat would be used in resistance training at jpra 1369 mr russell also testified that the technique as applied by the tf interrogator was ineffective the insult slap is just that its an insult after you do it two or three times it loses its effectiveness because the sic in our world the student is anticipating the slap it loses its effectiveness if you do it more than two or three or four times 1370 _ while he did not raise any objection to their use in the interrogation mr russell stated that the techniques used at the sere school such as the insult slap were not designed to elicit information from individuals but rather to guide the student to an appropriate resistance posture 1371 according to his testimony history has shown us that physical pressures are not effective for compelling an individual to give information or to do something and are not useful in gaining accurate actionable intelligence1372 there is indication in mr russells trip report however that he told anyone on the j2x staffthat the smu tfs use of repeated slaps would be ineffective or that use of other sere physical pressures such as walling which were reportedly described for the j2x staff would be ineffective mr russell stated that when physical pressures are applied in the resistance phase of sere training medical and psychological personnel are present to observe interrogations and protect sere school students1373 mr russell testified that there were medical or psychological personnel present during the interrogations he witnessed while at the smu tf co lty 1374lacll 1367

in interrogations was unlawful and violation ofthe geneva convention1378 he said that the smu tf commander agreed with him but there were orders ever issued by the commander not to use the techniques 1379 _ according to lt col kleinmans trip report afterl moulton col moulton subsequently spoke to the smu tf commander and then called him back to tell him that the jpra team was cleared hot to use

conventions 1385 u lt col kleinman also testified to the committee that he relayed his conversation with col moulton to his two lpra colleagues informing them that he told col moulton that the authority to use sere techniques was an unlawful order and that he wasnt going to have any involvement with it and he didnt think that they should either1386 _ both mr russell and mr miller the jpra contractor disagreed with lt col kleinmans assessment1387 according to mr russell the two indicated that the use ofthese moderate physical pressures when used appropriately were consistent with proper handling and interrogation 1388 intestimony tothecommittee mr russell added that he understood that the individuals held by the task force were considered detained unlawful combatants and not automatically provided the protections ofthe geneva conventions though he could not recall who told him this 1389 _ shortly after col moulton told lt col kleinman that the team was cleared hot to employ the full range ofjpra methods lt col kleinman recommended that the tf legal advisor arrange formal briefing with the smu tf interrogation staff and the lpra team 1390 in that meeting lt col kleinman reported that the tf legal advisor set forth legal limitations that essentially excluded most ofthe jpra methods with the use ofcertain stress positions such as kneeling on hard floor for up to 30 minutes cited as an acceptable method 1391 u lt col kleinman testified to the committee that although the smu tf lawyer agreed with him that it was unlawful to use sere techniques in

team to iraq shortly after the original team left for iraq col moulton began discussions about sending jpra team to assist centcom on september 32003 col moulton contacted the jprarepresentative at centcom and explained the genesis oftheir smu tf mission and how he thought such support might be expanded to other missions and organizations throughout the centcom aor col moulton wrote ive been in contact with in baghdad he was the one who requested the jpra team to assist in interrogation training he also mentioned that there are several entities doing interrogations and there is standardizationmethodology on how to conduct coordinate the process he asked to bring team over to observe what they are doing and what others are doing i think it would be good idea to bring team

capt donovan the jfcom sja 1443 capt donovan commented on the conop in september 26 2003 email to col moulton jpra deputy commander john atkins oso chief christopher wirts and others and circulated version of the conop with his edits and comments u in his email capt donovan stated that jpra should not rely on the march 6 2003 working group report as authoritative dod guidance he wrote that although the secretary had approved certain counterresistance techniques during interrogations ofunlawful combatants at gtmo not all ofthe techniques listed in the working group report had been approved for use l444 capt donovan also raised serious concerns about the legality ofthe interrogation techniques in the conop emphasizing that unlike in mghanistan and at gtmo the geneva conventions applied in iraq he wrote unlike oefmghanistan in which the taliban and alqaida enemy forces were all deemed to be unlawful combatants not legally entitled to the full protections of the geneva conventions operation iraqi freedom oif was executed as conventional armed conflict in which the vast majority of enemy forces were lawful combatants therefore almost all captured personnel within iraq are legally entitled to either prisoner of war pow or civilian internee ci status which means they get the full protections of the geneva conventions many of the counterresistance techniques approved by secdef for use on unlawful combatants detained at gtmo would notnot be legal under the geneva conventions if applied to pows or cis in iraq 1445 _in editing the conop capt donovan not only struck references to several interrogation techniques that had been included in the march 6 2003 draft working group col moulton also stated that he had pitched the idea to jfcom having said that i think the request needs to come from centcom not just _ i can support and have already presented the concept to jfcom we just need the invite longterm is to identify the need for an osd opr office of primary responsibility for strategic debrieftnginterrogation to put it into football terms we jpra are the quarterback for defensive resistance operations there is quarteive resistance opemtions where that responsibility would ultimately fall jp is not the issue but mther that someone has to take the lead email from col moulton to jpra centcom lno september 3 203 1442 russell trip report at 6 see

that even those techniques approved by the secretary ofdefense for use at gtmo might not be lawful for use on detainees in iraq 1446 _ capt donovan also substantially revised jpras critical operational exploitation principles by for example adding that detainee treatment must be in accordance with the approved rules of engagement and clarifying that rules ofengagement must be within us law and policy including but not simply limited to the torture convention 1447 capt donovan struck jpras reference to constant sensory deprivation completely noting that the technique was neither approved by the march 6 2003 working group report nor by the secretary ofdefense in his april 16 2003 guidance for solithcom1448 _ days later capt donovan raised his concerns about the conop to ltg wagner jfcoms deputy commander and maj gen james soligan jfcoms chief ofstaff in anticipation ofa scheduled visit by the two to jpra 1449 capt donovan stated that while it made certain amount ofsense to seek jpras advice regarding interrogation techniques that had been successfully used against us by our enemies he was concerned that the smu tf may have gone bit further by asking jpra to develop conop for more effective interrogations by the smu ofhvts captured in iraq14s0 he expressed particular concerns with the interrogation techniques included in the conop number of the interrogation techniques suggested by jpra in their draft conop are highly aggressive such as the water board and it probably goes without saying that if jpra is to include such techniques in conop they prepare for an operational unit in another area ofresponsibilityl they need to be damn sure theyre appropriate in both legal and policy sense1 s1 13 jfcomverifiesteam chiefsaccountofeventsiniraq u u in may 2004

secretary wolfowitz and under secretary cambone immediately following his briefing mg miller said that the reason for the smaller meeting was so that he could give the unvarnished truth about his

universe ofapproaches to the imagination of the interrogator and demanded additional structure1545 u according to ltg sanchez the september 142003 policy drew heavily on the secretary ofdefenses april 16 2003 guidance for gtmo i546 indeed the september 142003 policy included all 24 interrogation techniques that were in that guidance as well as techniques that cpt wood had copied from the smu tf in iraqs interrogation policy and submitted for approval the latter included the presence of military working dogs stress positions sleep management loud music and light control 1547 the techniques cpt wood had copied from the smu tf policy had in tum been based on techniques included in the interrogation policy used by the smu tf in afghanistan that policy was influenced in turn by the secretary of defenses december 22002 approval of aggressive interrogation techniques for use at gtmo1548 u although some ofthe techniques authorized by the september 14 2003 citf7 policy required the citf7 commanders approval before they could be used on enemy prisoners of war epws ltg sanchez stated that with few exceptions persons captured after may 1 2003 were not entitled to epw status as matter oflaw1549 cpt wood said that to her knowledge there were epws held at abu ghraib 1550 u ltg sanchez stated that citf7 forwarded the september 14 2003 policy to centcom with cover memorandum stating that the policy was based on that used at guantanamo bay but modified for applicability to theater of war in which the geneva conventions apply1551 ltg sanchez stated that his intent unless otherwise

wood also developed memorandum for record on citf7 interrogation rules of engagement iroe to be signed by all personnel at abu ghraib in contact with detainees1554 the iroe stated that the

sensory deprivation and the technique had been included in september 10 2003 draft policy it was not among those listed in the september 142003 policy approved by cjtf7 cpt wood acknowledged that she may have used the wrong policy as basis for her iroe1558 3 centcom raises concerns about cjtf7 policy u u ltg sanchez said that when he issued the september 14 2003 policy there was agreement in the citf71egal community that the techniques in the policy were lawful he said that that consensus was developed in the absence ofguidance from centcom who he said believed the issue was too contentious and would not give citf7 legal guidance1559 ltg sanchez said that time was ofthe essence so he decided to publish the september memorandum knowing that discussions were ongoing as to the legality ofsome ofthe approaches included in the memorandum 1560 m3 statement of cpt carolyn wood december 17 2004 at 4 1554 memorandum for record cjif7 interrogation rules ojengagement october 9 2003

fred pribble the centcom sja had concerns1561 ltg sanchez said that centcom lawyers thought some techniques in the september 14 policy came too close to the boundary1562 col marc warren the cjtf7 sja stated that the centcom sja raised concerns to us that the policy was objectionable in that aspects ofthe approved approaches were impermissibly coercive1563 iion september 152003 the day after the policy was issued col warren sent copy to col pribble and william barry hammill centcoms deputy sja stating this is pretty tame stuff largely direct lift from the army interrogation fm the genesis ofthis product was the visit by mg millers gitmo team1564 the next day mr hammill asked major carrie ricci the chief of international law at centcom to review the policy 1565 that same day maj ricci responded in an email stating that many ofthe techniques appear to violate geneva convention iii and iv and should not be used on enemy prisoners of war or civilian internees the geneva conventions prohibits all coercive interrogation techniques1566 on september 172003 col pribble sent copy ofmaj riccis email to col warren who responded that almost all ofthese techniques are right out ofthe field manual and are in use now1567 that same day maj ricci responded gentlemen its the techniques that are not in the field manual that concern techniques such as dietary manipulation environmental manipulation sleep adjustment sleep management yelling loud music light control stress positions etc many of these techniques appear to violate geneva convention iii article 17 physical or mental torture nor any other form of coercion may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened insulted or exposed to unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment ofany kind my recommendation is that the interrogation policy be kept in conformity with the field manual i would hesitate to put in writing how we are directing interrogations beyond what is in the field manual if cjtf7 wants to take advantage of the additional measures used at guantanamo this should be limited to detainees who are not entitled to geneva convention protections or else i 161 statement of ltg ricardo sanchez november 23 2004 at 4 1 committee staff interview of ltg ricardo sanchez december 20 2007 i63 col mark warren judge

regrettable task oftellin the commanding general the policy has problems but thats what we get paid forl 70 in september 222003 email to mal ricci centcom sja col fred pribble said during my sitdown with col warren in baghdad he was pretty quick to admit that we read you had made the right call and that they would scrub the policyl571 _ltg sanchez said that after cjtf7 and centcom lawyers began to debate the policy that he and col warren again reviewed the memo ltg sanchez stated that col warren told him yes they are legal there is some dissent and different opinions within the legal community some of these may be harsher than others and in order for us to eliminate debate and get consensus we probably ought to put some ofthese aside and oh by the way they probably wouldnt get us too much anyway if we implemented them i said okay fine lets get consensus go ahead and constrain it the september policy 1572 4 cjtf7issues new interrogation policy u u on october 122003 nearly month after mal riccis concerns were brought to col warrens attention ltg sanchez issued revised interrogation policy eliminating all techniques not listed in either the 1987 or 1992 versions ofthe army field manual techniques removed from the list ofauthorized techniques included dietary manipulation environmental manipulation sleep adjustment false flag presence ofmilitary working dogs sleep

references to dogs in both the september 142003 interrogation policy and the october 122003 interrogation policy ltg sanchez said that the intent for the use ofdogs was always focused on the security contributions they make in detention facility and that there was explicit direction guidance or condoning ofthe use ofunmuzzled dogs in the conduct of interrogations1576 ltgsanchezacknowledged thatplacement ofpresence ofmilitary working dogs in the interrogation techniques section ofthe september 14 policy was confusing1577 he said that he removed the presence ofmilitary working dogs from the list ofinterrogation techniques in the october policy and put it in the general safeguards section to make it clearthat using dogs for the deliberate purpose offrightening detainee was not pennitted 1578 u ltg sanchez stated that it is certainly clear under the october 2003 policy that the use ofmilitary working dogs in interrogations would require an exception to policy granted by me1579 col pappas stated however that he believed that the october 122003 interrogation policy delegated to the authority to approve the use ofmuzzled dogs1580 u the october 122003 policy also stated that requests to use interrogation approaches not listed in the policy will be submitted to the citf7 commander through citf7 director for intelligence and will include description ofthe proposed

the technique came from weeks prior to his october 2003 arrival however jpra instructors had striefed detainee during their assistance visit to the smu tf facility as part ofan interrogation1 9 terrence russell the jpra training manager wh jpra team ofinstructors at the smu tf said that the detainee was stripped _ 1514 mr russell stated that weve done this 100 times 1000 times with our sere

photographs taken by the soldiers themselves and in april 2004 some ofthose photographs appeared in the media u two army investigations one conducted by mg taguba and the other conducted by major general george fay would later find that abuses at abu ghraib were perpetrated directly by both military police mp and military intelligence personnel 1598 in addition to the direct participation ofmi personnel inincidents ofdetainee abuse mg fays investigation also identified situations where peonnel solicited mps to engage in detainee abuse using such 1_ questionnaire june 29 2004 at 4 h91 church

contributing factor to abu ghraib and stated that interrogation techniques developed and approved for use at gtmo and in mghanistan became confused at abu ghraib and were implemented without proper authorities or safeguards1600 as discussed above some ofthe techniques mg fay found to be abusive were also authorized for use by military interrogators conducting interrogations at the smu tf facility in iraq u interviews conducted by investigators for both mg fay and mg taguba contain evidence that the use ofaggressive interrogation techniques like use ofmilitary working dogs stress positions and removal ofclothing was not limited to the specific incidents described in those reports in fact those interviews appear to indicate that the use ofsome ofthese techniques was widespread at abu ghraib use ofmilitary working dogs u u the use ofmilitary working dogs to exploit detainee fears was authorized on december 22002 by the secretary ofdefense for use at guantanamo bay 1601 weeks

ltg sanchez the citf7 commander signed by col pappas indicated that col pappas approved the presence of military working dogs for three detainees captured in conjunction with saddam hussein i609 col pappas stated that he couldnt say for sure whether he actually sent the memo to ltg sanchez but that he signed it with the intent ofit going to him1610 ltg sanchez said that request for the use ofdogs in interrogations was ever received or approved by me1611 u one intelligence analyst stated that it was common knowledge that one soldier used dogs while he was on his special projects working directly for col pappas after the capture of saddam hussein1612 and an mp said that dogs could be used in interrogations with the proper authorization and that dogs were used to scare the detainee into confessing or producing intelligence 1613 u an army dog handler said that would ask to use my dog as psychological and physical deterrent it would consist ofa dog walking up to prisoner and the dog barking at prisoner1614 the same dog handler said that someone from gave list of cells for to go see and pretty much have my dog bark at them having the dogs bark at detainees was psychologically breaking them down for interrogation purposes 1615 u on february 192004 after mg taguba had begun his investigation into the abuses at abu ghraib the commander ofthe s04th brigade issued memorandum

described jpras intended support for centcom in afghanistan1752 among jpras key tasks for the planned afghanistan trip was to observe exploitation procedures used by centcom personnel and to identify areas for improvement and assist and advise on alternate approaches1753 the briefing materials stated that jpra intended to provide on the spot recommendations to the centcom staffifappropriate onthesealternate approaches 17s4 the briefing materias also included proposed concept ofoperations conop for the afghanistan trip1755 the proposed conop was similar in scope and structure to the conop jpra had circulated in september 2003 near the end ofthe iraq trip unlike the iraq conop however the afghanistan conop included many ofthe edits that had been suggested by capt daniel donovan the jfcom sja eg clarifying that rules of engagement must be within us law and policy including but not simply limited to the torture convention removing reference to constant sensory deprivation etc

those drafts were produced and how the conop evolved 225 capt donovan had recommended removing these techniques from the iraq lithe reference to jpras prior interrogation support in the briefing materials prompted discussion among adm giambastiani ltg wagner maj gen soligan and capt donovan about the september 2003 trip to iraq and the conop that was created during that trip _ col moulton the jpra commander had earlier defended the inclusion ofthe full range of sere techniques in the iraq conop by saying that all the techniques discussed in the conop are ones that jpra or other services employ in our training with considerable oversight only the navy uses the waterboard he continued in discussions with the office of secretary of defense general counsel last year they specifically requested what type oftechniques we found most effective against our personnel our intent is to provide prioritized list ofwhat works on our folks and let the lawyers and combatant commanders decide to what degree and which target audience they apply these if any techniques 1758 during consideration ofthe afghanistan trip capt donovan forwarded col moultons email to adm giambastiani ltg wagner and maj gen soligan and wrote when col mouhon says that the navy uses waterboarding he means that they use it against our own people during survival evasion resistance and escape sere training in other words qualified navy sere instructors use this to demonstrate to our own people what the enemy is likely to do to them in the even they are captured and hopefully to train our people how to resist or cope with such techniques jpra and sere folks will swear that the water board does not actually physically harm subjects if it is administered by properly trained sere instructors under close supervision etc for that reason some argue that the 176 ibid 1757shortly after the briefing jfcom action officer sent jpra leadership list of action items for ltg ii wer and mg soligan among those were jpra 1 locating the after action report from jpras support to and 2 preparing message to the chainnan of the joint chiefs of staff to provide policyguidance on possibility of extending jpra rolesresponsibilities to the offensive vice defensive preparationspractices in response col moulton told the jfcom action officer that there was after action report for the support and instead directed him to the executive summary of the trip provided in the briefing materials col moulton also stated that it was jpras understanding that admiral giambastiani would approve our participation in the afghanistan trip with voice command from the joint staff regardless of the status of the policy guidance he has previously approved and we are currently supporting other offensive efforts email

et september 30 2003 226 water board does not technically constitute torture under domestic or international law 1 can only say that in my opinion that argument does not pass the washington post test 1 fail to see how anyone can reasonably say that employing such techniques against those in our custody is worthy of the united states matter how much we may need the information in my view for the us to do this lowers the bar and ensures if there is any doubt that similar techniques will be employed against any us personnel captured by our enemies for this reason there is risk involved in having jpra advise interrogators in centcom jpras expertise concerns the effective techniques used by the bad guys against us and 1 frankly dont believe thats the kind of advice we should be giving to the us side 1 see great potential for theater personnel to do it wrong and to then say well jpra said this was what we should do1759 ii on may 132004 the day after col moulton briefed the jfcom leadership he circulated revised conop for the mghanistan trip the revised conop stated that ipra would not recommend or train physical pressures however it also stated that key task of the mission was to observe exploitation procedures at the site to assist in identifyin improvements and develop alternate approaches to meet exploitation objectives1 60 capt donovan immediately expressed his concern with that key task in an email to adm giambastiani and ltg wagner stating 1 am concerned about jpra identifying alternate approaches to meet exploitation objectives read more effective interrogation methods since jpras expertise is all the unlawful interrogation techniques the enemy uses against captured us forces 1 recommend you consider not having jpra get involved in this aspect ofcent coms request 1761 capt donovan also expressed his concerns about the intended mission to col moulton writing in may 13 2004 email it is not advisable to have jpra assist in improving exploitation ie suggesting more effective interrogation techniques jpras core expertise is in training dod personnel to resist cope with techniques many of them illegal that may be employed by our enemies if dod personnel are captured it just doesnt make sense to to have experts in what the bad guys do to us advising our us interrogators there is real risk iftheater interrogators then do it wrong for them to claim jpras experts recommended this 175mail from capt dan donovan to adm edmund giambastiani ltg robert wagner and maj gen james soligan may 13 2004 emphasis in original 1760 draft concept of operations in

afghanistan was subsequently called off1 64 b centcom makes another request for jpra interrogation assistance in afghanistan u on june 20 2004 about month after their initial request centcom made another request to the joint stafffor jpra assistance at interrogation facilities in bagram and kandahar in afghanistan1765 the request sought team from jpra to conduct onsite assessments in july and to assist the commands in developing and implementing an indoctrinationjrogram and other interrogation exploitation options required as result ofthe assessments17 specifically centcom requested that the jpra team observe exploitation procedures at the site and identifl improvements or develop alternate approaches to meet exploitation objectives 176 _ when the request arrived at jfcom capt donovan again raised concerns with maj gen soligan about the scope ofthe request in june 21 2004 email he asked whether jpra is really the appropriate choice for the mission described in the centcom request ie to observe exploitation procedures at the site and identify improvements or develop alternate approaches to meet exploitation objectives1768 maj gen soligan subsequently raised the issue with maj gen john sattler the centcom director ofoperations 13 who maj gen soligan said told him that centcom had made conscious decision on what capability they want1769 _capt donovan also raised his concerns directly with lawyers at centcom and the joint staff in an email to the lawyers he wrote 1762 email from capt dan donovan to col randy moulton and col fred milburn may 13 2004 1763 email from capt dan

resist interrogations by our enemies eg sere training are the wrong guys to be advising us interrogators how to more effectively exploit pucs jpra considers themselves to be the exploitation experts but in many ways my view is that their expertise is in training us personnel how to best resist illeoal techniques this kind of advice may be the last thing you all wantneed in afghanistan right now 1770 _ over the next month jfcom senior leadership discussed the proposed trip with jpra and the joint staff at jfcoms request jpra developed and provided jfcom with training plan for the mission 1771 on june 30 2004 maj oen soligan told jpra in an email to prepare for the trip but directed them not to deploy until the trip was approved by jfcoms commander adm edmund oiambastiani1772 jfcom also discussed working with joint staff to fmd capability outside jpra to send to centcom to assist with their detainee operations but expected nonconcur with any recommendation to use other resources1773 iias discussions about the centcom request continued within jfcom col kenneth rollins sere psychologist added his perspective on the advisability of sending jpra personnel to assist with interrogations the psychologist said we need to really stress the difference between what instructors do at sere school done to increase resistance capability in students versus what is taught at interrogator school done to gather information what is done by sere instructors is by definition ineffective interrogator conduct and interrogator school not sere school is the appropriate focus and model for investigating interrogators simply stated sere school does not train you on how to interrogate and things you learn there by osmosis about interrogation are probably wrong ifcopied by interrogators 1774 iias col rollinss comments were circulated at jfcom ltcol richard posey one of the jfcom jaos added that it would be difficult to come up with stronger argument against concurring in this request1775 ltcol posey added centcom needs interrogation experts jpra is telling us that their instructors are ineffective interrogators and probably do it wrong because their focus is on increasing resistance not decreasing it for the same reasons this does 1770 email from dan donovan to joint staff and centcom lawyers june 21 2004 emphasis in original 1771_ the training plan was

operations was not finalized until september 29 2004 after the inspector general ofthe department of defense began looking into the issue in the september 2004 memo maj gen soligan wrote recent requests from osd and the combatant commands have solicited jpra support based on knowledge and their application to us strategic debriefing and interrogation techniques these requests which can be characterized as offensive techniques include but are not limited to activities designed not to increase ones resistance capabilities to interrogation techniques but rather intended to instruct personnel for the purpose of gathering of information on how to break down anothers ability to withstand interrogation the use of resistance to interrogation knowlede for offensive purposes lies outside the roles and responsibilities ofjpra 17 u the policy did not however explicitly prohibit jpra from conducting such activities in all instances instead it stated that all requests for offensive support should continue to be directed through jfcom but instructed that any deviation in roles and responsibilities must be carefully scrutinized and vetted through proper legal and policy channels jpra personnel will not conduct any activities without specific approval from the usjfcom commander deputy commander or the chief of staff deviations from the jpra chartered mission of this
