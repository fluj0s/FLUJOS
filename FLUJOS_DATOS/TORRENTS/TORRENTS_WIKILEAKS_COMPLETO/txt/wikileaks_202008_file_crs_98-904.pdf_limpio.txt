term of 75 ears from publication or for the life of the author plus 50 years after the authors death specifically for post1977 works ie works that secured copyright on or after january 1 1978 the term for personal works ie works created by known aut hors who are not employees of another person or entity was the life of the author plus 50 years after death for impersonal works copyrighted on or after january 1 1978 the term was the shorter of 75 years from publication or 100 years from creation for pre1978 copyrighted works the term was fixed period of 75 years com puted from the date copyright was secured either by publication with notice of copy right or by registration as an unpublished work with the copyright office if personal work is created jointly by two or more authors the post1977 term is measured by the life of the last surviving author these former terms of copyright had b een established by the last general revision of the copyright law the copyright act of 1976 which was effective january 1 1978 before that date the copyright term under the copyright act of 1909 was fixed period of years consisting of 28 year original term which could be renewed for an additional 28 years for various reasons including fairness and the wish to avoid possible impairment of contracts congress changed the basis for computing the copyright term under the 1976 act only for post1977 works congress adopted the lifepl us50 basis for works copy righted on or after january 1 1978 and retained the fixed period of c opyright for pre1978 works however to balance the two methods of computing c opyright terms congress added 19year period to the maximum 56year period that otherwise would have applied to pre1978 works the resulting term was total of 75 years proponents of extending the copyright term an additional 20 years by legislation in the 105th congress made two prin cipal arguments 1 they argued that economic fairness to the heirs of authors justified the 20 year increase because longevity has increased since the lifeplus50 standard was first adopted by the berne copyright convention2 in 1908 and 2 they argued that the united states must match the recent

copyrights in unpublis hed works congress granted these works minimum federal term of 25 years which could be increased to 50 years under the 1976 act by publication on or before december 31 2002 that maximum term is now increased to 70 years if the work is published before 2003 the purpose of this provision has been to provide minimum federal protection for pre1978 common law works in order to assure the constitutionality of federal preemption and to encourage early publication of unpublished works 10 sound recordings were granted 75year delay in federal preemption under the 1976 copyright act because unlike other categories of copyright subject matter sound recordings did not enjoy dual common law and federal protection before february 15 1972 the date federal copyright protection was first extended to sound recordings also state common law and statutory pr otection for sound recordings was of recent vintage whereas unpublished books and music for example migh t have been protected for decades or 200 years by state law prior to federal preemption under the 1976 actfor pre1978 works 95 years from the da copyright was secured either by publication with notice of copyright or in the case of unpublished works by registration all of the extended terms apply retroactively to any work in which copyright now exists and to the works that have b een retrieved from the public domain

of the rights granted to aut hors under the copyright act they are means for regulating who benefits from statutory increase in the length of the copyright term the exercise of termination rights essentially effects reversion of the copyright or other partial rights back to the original authorowner or the heirs of the author notwithstanding contractua l assignment of the property to another the 1976 copyright act created two ter mination provisions one termination clause applies to old law works ie works copyrighted before 1978 which is found at section 304c of the act this provision applies to grants ie licensing agreements executed before january 1 1978 by the author or any statutory renewal claimant the holder of the termination right can ter minate the pre1978 grant withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98904crs5 11 in order for an author to be able to ex ercise the new termination right in the 20year added period the author must live more than 75 years after the copyright was secured in the work songwriter irving berlin lived more than 75 years after some of his copyrights were secured but these instances are exceedingly rare as rule the authors heirs will exercise the new 304d right 12 new law grants cannot be terminated until 35 years after their execution the notice of termination which also specifies the exact rmination date must be served earlier than 10 years before the termination date 13 works made for hire are defined in 17 usc 101 as works created by employees within the scope of their duties and subject to written agreement certain specially ordered or commissioned worksrespect to the 19year period added to the copyright term for old law works by the 1976 act the second termination clause of the 1976 act applies to new law works ie works copyrighted on or after january 1 1978 under section 203 of the 1976 act grants of rights by the author relating to new law works can be terminated 35 years after their execution the sonny bono act creates third ter mination right relating to the 20year added period for pre1978 works and modifies who is eligible to terminate rights in both old law and new law works under th original termination provisions of the 1976 act with respect to the new termination ri ght in the 20year added period the sonny bono act amends 17 usc 304 by adding new paragraph d the new 304d termination right applies to the author in theory11 or other owner of termination right in pre1978 grant w hose right to terminate under section 304c has already expired without being exercised the basic structure of the original 304c termination right is retained but the time limit for exercising the right is changed and the new 304d termination ri ght applies to the 20year period added by the sonny bono act to the term of copyri ght termination can be effected at any time during 5 year period beginning at the end of the 75 year copyright term the new 304d termination right pplies only to grants executed before january 1 1978 it was not necessary to legi slate comparable right with respect to grants executed on or after january 1 1978 si nce new law grants are first eligible for notices of termination in 200312 holders of new law termination rights will receive the 20year added period when they exercise their right of termination as is true of the original termination rights of th 1976 act the section 304d termination right does not appl to works made for hire13 if the section 304c termination ri ght of the 1976 act has already been exercised the holder of the exercised termin ation right owns the copyright in the 20 year added period unless the copyright has already been reassigned post termination such reassignme nts are not terminable in that case the assignee ownshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98904crs6 the copyright during the 20year period dded to the copyright terms by the sonny bono act the second change made by the sonny bono act in the termination provisions applies both to old and new law works sections 203a2 nd 304c2 of title 17 usc are amended to change the persons eligible to exercise termination rights under the original termina tion provisions of the 1976 act the authors executor under will administrator pe rsonal representative or trustee had termination right the next of kin had terminati on right in transfers which they may have granted with respect to old law works the next of kin d termination rights in new law works the sonny bono act grants terminati on right to the authors executor to terminate the authors interest if the au thor spouse children and grandchildren are deceased also in the absence of will if there is surviving author spouse child or grandchild the administrator personal re presentative or trustee of the authors estate owns the authors termination inte rest in the case of both old and new law transfers by the author reproduction by libraries and archives libraries archives and educational groups expressed concerns about diminuti on of the public domain as consequence of adding 20 years to the copyright terms in partial response to these concerns the sonny bono act amends 17 usc 108 to limit the rights of copyright owners against libraries archives and nonprofit educational institutions during the 20year added period these entities will be allo wed to reproduce distribute display or perform in facsimile or digital form copies of works during the 20year period for preservation scholarship or research purposes if the works are not being commercially exploited nd copies or phonorecords cannot be obtained at reasonable price this exemption does not apply after notice by the copyright owner in accordance with copyright office regulati ons that the conditions for use are not satisfied or to subsequent users other than the exempt entities division of motion picture royalties most theatrical motion pictures produced in the united states are works made for hi re the contributors to motion pictures such as the screenwriters directors and performers ordinarily do not own the copyright nor do they have any termination rights with respect to the term of copyright by industry custom and practice the rights of motion picture contributors in the united states are usually acquired through collective bargaining agreements between the production companies and th guilds or unions representing the contributing artists during the consideration of the copyright term extension bills motion picture contributors expressed concer ns about their right to receive royalties

march 1998 contained an additional motion picture ri ghts clause sec 106 of hr 2589 would have amended title 28 usc by adding new chapter 180 dealing with the assumption of contractual obligations eg residual rights when transferring motion picture rights this provision was later added to another bill hr 2281 the digital millennium copyright act and was enacted as part of that legislationdivision of motion picture royalties14 but sec 105 of the act does contain sense of congress statement on this point the statement is intended to encourage voluntary agreements between motion pi cture producers and the various motion picture contributors leading to the establishment of an audiovisual fund or other mechanism for the division of royalties accrued during the 20year added period agreement on the division of motion picture royalties becomes especially important with respect to the royalties that accrue from exploitation of american motion pictures in europe article 22 of the european union di rective on copyright duration sets the term for cinematographic or audiovisual works at the lif of the authors plus 70 years after the death of the last of four contributors to survive the principal director the author of the screenplay th author of the dialogue and the composer of any music specifically cr eated for the motion picture another provision article 21 mandates that at least the principal director shall be considered the author of the motion picture article 33 of the eu directive provides that the related rights of the motion picture producer expire 50 years after fixation or publication if published whichever is earlier since most theatrical motion pictures produced in the us are works made for hire and the director is not considered an author it is not entirely clear what european union term applies to us motion pictures or who is entitled to collect licensing fees in europe during the 20 year added period united states motion picture producers and the united states trade representative take the position that contracts assigning rights to the pr oducers including collective bargaining agreements should be recognized in europe the sense of congress provision in the sonny bono act is intended to facilitate private negotiations concerning division of motion picture royalties between producers and artistic contri butors to motion pictures

the copyright act of 1976 the owne r of copyright in musical work is granted the exclusive right to perform th work publicly 17 usc 1064 subject to specified limitations or exemptions musical work is publicly performed if it is rendered or played directly or by means of any device or process either i at place open to the public or any place where substantial number of persons outside of the normal circle of family and social acquaintances is gathered or ii by transmission to place open to the public or to the unassembled public which is capable of receiving the performance for example by radio televi sion cable or satellite performances at semipublic pl aces are generally considered public performances these places include clubs lodges factories summer camps and schools daycare seniors and other r ecreational centers and possibly the common areas of hospitals nursing homes and other care facilities performances of music at public places such as restaurants bars taverns nightclubs conventions and stores are public performances whether the music is performed live or by recordings or tran smissions and whether the music is used as background incidental or theme music of course performances of music in concert halls opera houses theaters stadiums out door arenas and similar places open to the public are public performances although the above exam ples constitute public performances the need to obtain music performing license and pay copyri ght fees hinges upon the availability or absence of an exemption limitation or excepti on to the music copyright owners public performance right if the performance is neither exempt nor subject to compulsory licensing the music user must obtain permission or license to perform the music by negotiating the terms and c onditions with the music copyright owner or an authorized agent with few exceptions music performing licenses for performance of nondramatic mu sic are obtained from the pe rforming rights societies prs who act as agents fo r the music copyright owners by custom and practice music publishers and composerslyricists generally share the royalties obtained under the music performing right equally that is 50 50 after the prs deducts its administrative costs currently there are two major prs who control virtually all licensing of the performing right in nondramatic music these are the american society of composers authors and publishers ascap and broadcast music inc bmi both prs operate under antitr ust consent decrees that establish restrictions and conditions on their music licensing activities httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98904crs9 15 the copyright act had 5 active compulsory licenses as of october 15 1998 section 111 cable retransmissions of broadcasts section 114f subscription digital audio transmissions of sound recordings section 115 mechanical reproduction of music section 118 public broadcasting license and section 119 satellite television license all of these compulsory licenses affect public perform ance of music except the section 114f subscription transmssion license which applie s to sound recordings and the section 115 recording license which aff ects only the reproduction right the principal exemptions or limitations to the music performing right are set forth in section 110 of the copyright act or in the compulsory licensing sections15 the existing music performing right was enacted as part of the 1976 general revision of the copyright law the 1976 copy right act under its predecessor the 1909 copyright act nonprofit performances of nondramatic music were exempt from copyright liability the statute di d not define nonprofit performances however the term was given meaning by the courts although the line drawn between forprofit and nonforprofit performances was never clear in general the nonprofit exemption was applied fairly broadly for example musical performances by public broadcasting and by religious broadcasters were arguably exempt in the 1976 copyright act congress dr opped the broad exemption for nonprofit musical performances and replaced it with broad performance right to which congress applied specific more narrowl ydrawn exemptions the 1976 act also legislated broad definition of the term public which resulted in application of the music licensing rights in semipublic contexts that formerly were arguably private performances the general effect of these changes from the 1909 act was to create need to obtain music performing right license on broader basis than under the law in effect before 1978 expanded enforcement efforts by the prs have generated opposition and counterlegislative proposals from groups impacted by the broader music performing right in the 105th congress music licensing refo rm proposals were introduced under the title of fairness in music licensing act essentially identical bills hr 789 and s 28 were introduced in the hous and senate the b ills proposed several reforms including 1 expansion of certa in exemptions to the public performance right for businesses that perform music by turning on radios or televisions within their business establishments 2 new st atutory requirement of arbitration of the fees charged by the prs 3 statutory c onditions for radio per program licenses 4 elimination of the vicarious and contributory infringement liability of landlords of the premises where music is performed and 5 mandated access to prs repertories and licensing information the supporters of music licensing reform s linked their legislative efforts with proposals to extend the copyright term an additional 20 years music licensing reform supporters argued that the additional 20 year period should be balanced by some concessions to music users they point ed out that music copyright owners are among the principal benefici aries of copyright term ex tension music and otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98904crs10 16 the three provisions were expansion of the business exemptions binding arbitration of the rates charged by the prs and elimination of the vicarious and contributory infringement liability of landlords 17 the final bill dropped the proposed limination of vicarious and contributory infringement liability of landlords therefore change has been made in these judicially created doctrines with respect to music licensi ng with respect to the liability of internet service providers however legislation was passed in the form of hr 2281 the digital millennium copyright act which impacts the vicarious and contributory infringement doctrines
