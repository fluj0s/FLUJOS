such cadre would be similar in spirit to the joint experience envisioned by the 1986 goldwaternichols act attention should be given to their education development and career development certain number of interagency slots should be identified within the nationa l security community including domestic agencies that have foreign affairs responsibilities eg justice commerce energy and staffed by the interagency cadre the panel further recommended that to support the new cadre national security curriculum should be established combining course work at the national defense university and national foreign affairs training center with mix of civilian military and foreign students to recei ve training and edu cation in strategic affairs8 in february 2001 as part of larger package of proposed national security reforms the united states commission on national security21st century the hartrudman commission proposed the cr eation of an interagency cadre called the national security service corps nssc and spelled out its recommendations in detail the goal would be developing leaders skilled at producing integrative solutions to us national security po licy problems the program would include fullspectrum career development including rotational assignme nts and professional education and these experiences would be required in order to hold certain positions or to be promoted to certain vels the scope of national security would be broadly defined participating department s would include defense state treasury commerce justice energy and the new national homeland security agency the proposals focuse d only on civil servants the military the intelligence community and the foreign service would be excluded to help integrate the efforts by multiple agencies the commission recommended the creation of an interag ency advisory group the group would ensure that promotion rates for the nssc were at least comparable to those elsewhere in the civil service and help establish guidelines for rotational assignments and for meetin g professional education re quirements departments would retain control over their own personnel and would continue to make promotion decisions the commission believed that specific legislative authority for such an initiative was not necessary9 more recently the beyond goldwaternichols project at the center for strategic and international

some form of interagency cadre of specialis ts would help improve coordi nation in the future this convergence of thinking gave additional weight to the recommendations but also introduced fundamental

operational experiences in iraq and afghanistan led many participants and observers to conclude that interagency coordination in the execution of national security activities left much to be desired many particularly senior military officers suggested that the militarys experiences integrating the services under the umbrella of jointness might be germane in 2004 thenvice chairman of the joint

goldwaternichols is touchstone for the uniformed military both watershed event for todays senior leaders and fundamental way of doing business for junior officers so it is surprise that it provides

established links between jointness and career progression in the first place the legislation took steps to ensure that pursuing jointness would have negative repercussions on individual career advancement by supporting parity in promotion decisions concerning joint officers and their peers17 in addition in order to create strong incentive for individual participation the goldwaternichols act established joint service as requirement for promotion to the rank of general or flag officer18 the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2002 strengthened the requirements fo r

putting forward this proposal the qdr report also specifically invoked the joint duty assignment provisions of goldwa ternichols noting much as the goldwaternichols requirement that senior officers complete joint duty assignment has contributed to integrating the different cultures of the military departments into more effective joint force the qdr recommends creating incentives for senior department and nonde partment personnel to develop skills suited to the integrated interagency environment21 the national security professional development program in may 2007 as direct outgrowth of the convergence of national and homeland security lessons learned the bush ad ministration launched an interagency cadre initiative the national security professional development nspd program22

role in executing aspects of various national strategies nsps according to the action list have significant interaction with other departments agencies or government entities and may be called upon in us governme nt operations or crises31 in practice nspd officials estimate that nsps will include approximately 20000 federal government employees of which about 1500 will be senior executive service ses positions and the re st gs13s through gs15s and their rank equivalents32 to some officials familiar with the program these numbers seem low and they have wondered which positions at the department of defense for example would not logically fall under the rubric of nationa l security others suggest that the relatively low numbers may have practical explanation the nspd program tasks individua l departments and agencies to produce lists of their respective nsp positions but provides additional resources to support nsp education training or other programs so agencies may have an incentive to lowball the total numbers reported from the outset the nspd program has specifically excluded three major categories of federal profe ssionals department of fense military personnel the foreign service and the intelligence community33 according to nspd officialshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34565crs12 33 continued envisaged 34 for example the representative for the offi ce of the secretary of defense comes from osd personnel and readiness the joint staff which has separate seat at the table is represented by the j7 which is responsible for joint force developmentthese exclusions were based in part on the fact that each of these communities maintains its own career deve lopment program which in some fashion incorporate elements of interagency coordination some officials from those communities reportedly feared that full participation in the nspd program might impinge on time and resources available to meet their existing career development requirements in theory with agreement from the esc any of those communities could seek to make the nsp designation availabl to its members in practice although the practical implications for their career paths have not yet been clarified some members of these communities have already taken part in some nspd programs including pilot educational program see below organization and structure in general governance of the nspd program is characterized by weak central administration and largely decentralized execu tion specific leadership roles and the relationships among key nspd bodies have shifted since the programs inception executive steering committee the may 2007 executive order created an executive steering committee esc to provide seniorlevel oversight of the nspd program the executive order specified that the esc would be chaired by the director of the office of personnel mana gement opm the escs relatively extensive membership reaching beyond th bounds of those agencies traditionally concerned with national security includes the principals or their designees from the departments of state treasury defense justice agriculture labor health and human services housing and urban velopment transportation energy education and homeland security and th office of the director of national intelligence and the office of management and budget omb in practice according to participants agency designees tend to be senior human resources professionals34 the executive order provides that the esc reports jointly to the assistant to the president for homeland security and count erterrorism and the assistant to the president for national security affairs that dual reporting chain and the dual emphasis in general may be considered both an innovative strength of the nspd program and also according to some offici als the source of ongoing tensions about the programs focus as established by the executive order the escs broad mandate to facilitate the implementation of the national strategy is relatively weak and individual agencies are the primary engines of the effort agencies craft career development initiatives and it is the function of the esc to coordinate to the maximum extent practicable national

differed from those of the normal ndu programs this observation might be considered vote of confidence in the adaptability of ndu programs in general which have been revised and updated in recent years to reflect greater concern with interagency issues at the nwc for example after the 20042005 academic year the core curriculum was revised to include full core course on nonmilitary elements of strategy47 some pilot program participants advocated greater flexibility in selecting their elective courses suggesting that the concept of what is relevant to national security professionals might usefully be expanded others repor tedly suggested that the nspd program should be more robust and intensive for example it might include additional seminars or discussions outside the us ual

information see the dod civilian personnel management service website at http wwwcpmsosdm iljlddeldp_indexaspxnspd education next steps the nspd leadership is reportedly considering several basic aspects of the education pillar way forward one question is whether the ndu pilot proj ect will continue during academic year 20082009 which begins in early august 2008 and if so whether it might be expanded to include more participants some ndu officials suggest there is reason not to make the nspd education track available to all us students in masters degreegranting programs at ndu49 second question is whether to ex pand nspd educati onal opportunities to other institutions other institutions might include those that directly support other us government agencies such as the foreign service institute but could also include focused programs at public or private universities some observers report disagreements within the community of g overnment institution educators about what constitutes education vers us training and which institutions provide each of them50 some from the dod community note for example that the state departments foreign service institute is based at the george p shultz national foreign affairs training center emphasis dded and suggest that its programs more closely resemble skillstrain ing than knowledgefostering51 an additional question is whether to expand nspd edu cational opportunities to other formats such formats might in clude distance learning or programs that convene periodically such as dods execu tive leadership development program eldp52 to illustrate eldp establishe d in 1985 provides dod civilians gs12 to gs14 with deep exposure to dod join t roles and missions over the course of 10 months students who remain in thei r

descriptions of training in the national strategy reflect the difficulty of expressing succinctly the full range of all forms of interagency training required by all nsps for example the strategy states p 8 successful traini ng program must ensure that federal state local and tribal government leaders are cognizant of their preparedness roles and responsib ilities trained in carrying out their assigned functions and prepared to be immediately effective in interagency inte rgovernmental and international emergency operations to some observers that emphasis on other levels of government preparedness and emergency operations sounds like an only slightly modified description of homeland security training cerns that excludes such interagency national security activities as steadystate diplomacy and security cooperationtraining pillar for the second nspd pillar the national strategy calls for ample training opportunities to refine skills through instruction drills and exercises53 according to the strategy the first step as in the education pillar is identifying existing training programs facilities and institutions applicable to the nspd program the survey should consider federal programs first but also stat local territorial tribal academic nongovernmental and private s ector programs the newly constituted national security education and traini ng consortium nsetc see above board of directors has the responsibility to reco mmend training as we ll as educational courses for inclusion in the nspd program the national strategy also tasks the esc to promote existing federal governme nt training consor tia concerned with aspects of national security in order to promote sharing of best practices54 as whole the nspd program acknowle dges great variation among the roles and responsibilities of nsps the national strategy for example recognizes the reality that the core comp etencies needed for each ssion area and institution will vary and therefore professional experience education and training programs must be customized in each mission area and institution55 what the nspd programs strategic documents do not di rectly address is that the variation in requirements might be substantially greater for training than for education education in strategic planning problemsolving and leadership for example mig ht be appropriate for all nsps training requirements however are typically much more specific focused on mastering tasks to be executed during contingencies including any specific requirements for coordination with colleague s in other agencies and thus might vary significantly among nsps56 the most concrete effort so far unde r the nspd training pillar is the establishment required by the march 2008 action list of federal training

the nspd federal training orientation will at least initially have two parts the fema course to c over homeland security and national securityfocused course curre ntly under development some officials note that this dualtrack approach to or ientation misses key opport unity to underscore and elaborate on fundamental premise of the nspd program that as the national strategy states the nation cannot view th missions of national security and homeland security as parate and distinct59 experience pillar the may 2007 executive order establishe d the professional experience pillar of the nspd program the national strategy spelled out tasks to be undertaken to support that pillar including designatin g certain activities as interagency duty assignments developing formal mechanism for rotational and temporary detail assignments and linking career advancemen t to participation in such assignments60 the strategy explicitly assigned these responsibilities to the relevant departments and agencies the role of the esc would be simply to coordinate the completion of the tasks61 this highly decentra lized division of labor was reinforced by the march 2008 action list which tasked individual agencies to develop the criteria for acceptable missionrelated experiences that are appropriate for their nsp positions to identify positi ons available for rotational opportunities and to the extent permitted

including education and joint experience criteria63 to determine the number of officers who are joint qualified64 and to establish career guidelines for officers to achieve joint qualification and for officers who have been so designated including guidelines for selection education training and types of duty assignments65 further the requirement of joint duty service and jo int qualification as prerequisites for promotion to general or flag officer are sti pulated by law not left to the discretion of service rules or regulations66 issues for congress members of congress weighing the mer its of various proposals for national security reform for the interagency incl uding possible options for an interagency cadre professional developmen t program may wish to consider the following points possible roles for congress congress could help direct or shap future interagency cadre career development program ither through legisla tion oversight or both legislation the current nspd program which has legislative mandate would continue under new administration only at the discretion of that new leadership team many current officials nd observers contend th at legislation would be necessary to ensure the success of an interagency career development program particularly because by definition car eer development requires longterm administrationspanning perspective w ithout the assurance that program would continue into the future individuals might be less likely to risk the investment of their time and agencies might be less likely to risk the investment of their resources67 numerous senior military officers and defense observers including general pace have asserted that the go ldwaternichols reforms would not have been possible without legislationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34565crs21 68 see crs report rl34455 organizing the us government for national security overview of the interagency reform debates by catherine dale nina serafino and pat towellsome observers and practitioners suggest that the most important factor in ensuring full agency participation and commitment to interagency career development is presidential support incl uding regularly emphasizing the program as priority and providing ongoing oversight from the white house in theory legislation and presidential emphasis are not mutually exclusive little empirical evidence is available concerning their relative importance because the single empirical test case to date the nspd pr ogram is not supported by legislation oversight whether or not legislation is enacted congress has the option of exercising oversight over any future executive branch interagency career development program for national security professionals so observers have wondered how congress might best exercise such oversight given that such program would be likely to involve mu ltiple agencies including some without traditional national security responsibilities such as the partments of justice and commerce one option would be oversight of pr ogram implementati on in individual agencies by their respective committees of jurisdiction this approach might help ensure such agencies individual complian ce but it would not provide an assessment of the programs overall impact or th consistency of its application another option might be oversight by the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs and the house committee on government oversight and reform these committees have oversight responsibility for executive branch organization and the federal civil rvice although they neither authorize nor appropriate in the broader debates cerning national security reform for the interagency some participants have suggested yet nother option the creation of house and senate select committees on national security which would have oversight responsibility for holistic issues and in itiatives that cross agency boundaries68 such bodies might be wellplaced to provide overs ight of an interagency cadre program although such restructuring might be difficult to achieve program policy issues the experiences of the nspd program to date and some aspects of the goldwaternichols process suggest series of policy questions that could help shape any future interagency cadre program scope according to officials involved with the nspd program it has been difficult to achieve consensus on the prog rams scope while many options with various pros and cons are theoretically possible any new or adapted interagency cadre program would benefit from clearly established parametershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34565crs22 69 executive order 13434 may 17 2007 national security professional development section 3b and see above 70 katrina lessons learned pp 119120 71 interviews with nspd officials one add itional aspect germane to both the homeland and traditional national security communities is th role of contractors observers generally support integrating contractors into preparati ons for contingencies at home and abroad both training programs and exercises give n that integrated efforts by government employees and contractors are required during actual contingencies interagency cadre programs differ in their focus on longterm pr ofessional development and they require by definition that the program authorities are em powered to make career decisions concerning participants while any such program may t ability to integrate efforts with those by contractors as program goal and might in clude contractors in various program activities continuedone issue is the substantive focus and in particular the balance between homeland and traditional nationa l security concerns there is broad consensus in the washington policy community that the two categories are related as many observers have noted it is difficult to draw clear line between them because providing security for the homeland may re quire addressing challenges that arise abroad but there is also recognition in practitioner communities that not all aspects of national security broadly defined are re lated to all others too broad reach or too broad reach with toouniform implementation policies and procedures could produce in some cases unneeded professional development activities with attendant waste in time and resources second issue is the horizontal scope of agency participation at the federal level the nspd executive order mandates very broad particip ation by federal entities including many without traditional na tional security concerns such as the departments of justice agriculture bor health and human services housing and urban development tr ansportation and education69 officials involved with the nspd program note that though such ag encies extent of involvement is much less than that of dod or the state depar tment for example ensuring their full participation is actually more of challenge because as rule national security is relatively small part of their focus the benefits of casting wide net at the federal level include incorporating those entities with singular needed expertise the potential drawbacks include possible disp roportionate adminis trative burdens on nontraditional national security agen cies and providing comprehensive congressional oversight of ll participating agencies related issue is the vertical scope of agency participation that is the layers of government federal state local rritorial andor tribal to which the program applies most indications suggest that the nspd leadership has chosen to focus the program at the federal leve l although both program documents and participant accounts make cl ear that the nsps ability to work smoothly with counterparts from other layers of gove rnment is key program goal the katrina lessons learned report envisaged pr ofessional development program that would include federal state and local offi cials and other civilian first responders70 and that multilayer approach to building cadre reportedly continues to find favor within the homeland security community71httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34565crs23 71 continued the government careerdevelopment program could not at its own initiative formally include contractors as participants 72 purple is shorthand for joint colo r that might result from mixing together all the colors used by all the services or at the very least color not directly associated with any single service 73 james p dehart suited for the new diplomacy washington post june 15 2008nature of integration it is common for interagency reform proponents to call for closer integration among depa rtments and agencies but integration can mean range of different things in practi ce at one end of the spectrum members of different agencies view themselves prima rily or exclusively as representatives of their home agencies but are familiar with the work of other agencies and able to work with counterparts in them this ma facilitate an integr ated application of their respective capabilities at the other end of the spectrum members of different agencies view themselves primarily as part of common completely integrated enterprise at the systemic level though they are still able to r each back into their home agencies for resources and support neither end of the spectrum necessarily corresponds to greater effectiveness but th nature of the integration desired may shape program requirements in terms of education training and rotational opportunities for the sake of comparison some obs ervers have suggested that due to goldwaternichols designed to foster shared joint culture among the services all officers are now purple72 but that may be true only up to point in general while joint qualification has by most accounts provided valuable fa miliarity with other services it does not appear to have replaced the primary cultural association with an officers own service arguably servicemember if asked is still far more likely to identify himself or herself as soldier sailor airman or marine than as generic member of the armed forces responses to recent efforts by the department of state under the rubric of secretary rices transformational diplomacy initiative to collaborate more closely with the us military suggest additional possible constraints on complete integration in june 2008 oped piece in the washington post serving foreign service officer voiced concern about possi ble unintended consequences of state department efforts to integrate more seamlessly with the military including sidelining the departments focus on trad itional diplomacy he argued developing foreign service wise in the ways of na tionbuilding should not come at the expense of its core capabilities bove all its unrivaled nguage area and cultural expertise73 program objectives although it ma sound obvi ous new or updated interagency cadre program would benefit from clearly articulated statement of purpose including how it differs from or comp lements related efforts in particular statement of purpose might suggest the relative emphasis on longterm career development versus shorterterm preparation for participation in interagency national security activities it might describe the relative concern with cultivating field practitioners for current missions versus fostering and mentoring future senior leadershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34565crs24 74 for example both the nspd program and th consortium for complex operations cco see above and web

illustrate the goldwaternichols process explicitly focuses on longterm career development of jointqua lified officers as part of the qualification process such officers generally serve tours as joint

increase and better integrate civilian capacities for various complex contingencies the overlap is most evident in the realm of training initiatives designed to prepare current practitioners for potential nearterm execution roles74 the division of labor is arguably clearer between nspd and initiatives focused on actual planning and execution such as th work of the office for the coordinator

cadre system would need to provide incentives for individuals to participate those might include enhanced promotion potential improved prospects for choice assignments and reasonable degree of confidence that the program rules the basis for career decisionmaking will not change too dramatically over time one of the key elements of the goldwaternichols process is the linkage between jointness and promotion to flag rank79 in public address in 2004 general pace suggested that the officer corps got the message congress said if you want to get promoted youve got to be joint i was

an interagency cadre might also consider fost ering recruitment polic ies that support the programs goals82 one possible approach would be further developing programs at the collegelevel including support for nati onal security studies and opport unities for internships in national security fields another possible recruitment approach would be allowing greater flexibility for midcareer recruitment of specialists from outside the government and for transfers in and out of government jobs including incentives for valuable experience gained the national strategy tasks departments and agencies to reform employme nt practices to encourage the hiring of personnel with variety of experiences from within and outside the federal g overnment but that intent is not reflected in the march
