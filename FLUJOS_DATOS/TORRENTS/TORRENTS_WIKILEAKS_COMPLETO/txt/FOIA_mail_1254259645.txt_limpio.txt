from michael mann mannmeteopsuedu to andrew revkin anrevknytimescom subject re mcintyres latest date tue 29 sep 2009 172725 0400 cc tosbornueaacuk hi andy yep what was written below is all but it was purely on background please dont quote anything i said or attribute to wout checking specificallythanks re your point at the endyouve taken the words out of my mouth skepticism is essential for the functioning of science it yields an erratic path towards eventual truth but legitimate scientific skepticism is exercised through formal scientific circles in particular the peer review process necessary though not in general sufficient condition for taking scientific criticism seriously is that it has passed through the legitimate scientific peer review process those such as mcintyre who operate almost entirely outside of this system are not to be trusted mike on sep 29 2009 at 519 pm andrew revkin wrote thanks heaps tom crowley has sent direct challenge to mcintyre to start contributing to the reviewed lit or shut up im going to post that soon just want to be sure that what is spliced below is from you little unclear im copying this to tim in hopes that he can shed light on the specific data assertions made over at climateauditorg im going to blog on this as it relates to the value of the peer review process and not on the merits of the mcintyre et attacks peer review for all its imperfections is where the herkyjerky process of knowledge building happens would you agree ps tim osborn 1tosbornueaacuk is probably the best person to contact for further details in keiths absence mike on sep 29 2009 at 508 pm michael mann wrote hi andy im fairly certain keith is out of contact right now recovering from an operation and is not in position to respond to these attacks however the preliminary information i have from others familiar with these data is that the attacks are bogus it is unclear that this particular series was used in any of our reconstructions some of the underlying chronologies may be the same but im fairly certain the versions of these data we have used are based on different composite and standardization method let alone any of the dozen other reconstructions of northern hemisphere mean temperature shown in the most recent ipcc report which come to the conclusion that recent warming is anomalous in longterm context so even if there were problem w these data it wouldnt matter as far as the key conclusions regarding past warmth are concerned but i dont think there is any problem with these data rather it appears that mcintyre has greatly distorted the actual information content of these data it will take folks few days to get to the bottom of this in keiths absence if mcintyre had legitimate point he would submit comment to the journal in question of course the last time he tried that w our 98 article in nature his comment was rejected for all of the noise and bluster about the steig et antarctic warming its now nearing year and nothing has been submitted so more likely he wont submit for peerreviewed scrutiny or if it does get his criticism published it will be in the discredited contrarian home journal energy and environment im sure you are aware that mcintyre and his ilk realize they longer need to get their crap published in legitimate journals all they have to do is put it up on their blog and the contrarian noise machine kicks into gear pretty soon druge rush limbaugh glenn beck and their ilk in this case the telegraph were already on it this morning are parroting the claims and based on what some guy w credentials dubious connections with the energy industry and who hasnt submitted his claims to the scrutiny of peer review fortunately the prestige press doesnt fall for this sort of stuff right mike im sure youre aware that you will dozens of bogus manufactured distortions of the science in the weeks leading up to the vote on cap trade in the us senate this is on sep 29 2009 at 430 pm andrew revkin wrote needless to say seems the 2008 pnas paper showing that without tree rings still solid picture of unusual recent warmth but mcintyre is getting wide play for his statements about yamal dataset selectivity has he communicated directly to you on this andor is there any indication hes seeking journal publication for his deconstruct andrew c revkin the new york times environment
