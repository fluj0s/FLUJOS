conc lusions in the us copyright offices report on orphan works report issued in january 2006 and legislation introduced to address the problem or phan works are copyrighted works whose owners are difficult or impossible to identif andor locate the goal of the report was to elicit public comment and evaluate th extent of real or perceived problems that content users encounter in their efforts to use these works orphan works are perceived to be inaccessible b ecause of th risk of infringement liability that user might incur if and when copyright owner subsequently appears consequently ma ny works that are in fact abandoned by owners are withheld from public view and circulation because of uncertainty about the owner and the risk of liability the report defines the problems it iden tified and conclude s that the problem is indeed real and should be addressed legislatively it analyzes stakeholders views on the issue and constraints on solutions impos ed by the structure of us copyright law and international copyri ght obligations the report sets forth proposal to amend the copyright act by adding provision that would limit liability for infringing use of orphan works when prio r to use user performs reasonably diligent search for the copyright owner and provides attribution to the author and copyright owner if possible in some instances when copyright infringement is made without commercia l advantage and the user ceases infringement promptly after receiving notice thereof monetary relief would be available adopting many of the suggestions of the copyright office the orphan works act of 2006 was introduced in the 109th congress second session hr 5439 this bill was later incorporated into an omnibus copyright bill appearing as title ii of the copyright modernization act of 2006 h r 6052 however the bill was not addressed by the end of that congre sss adjournment the bill would have implemented limitation on monetary damage liability for specified infringement of orphan works but took more detailed approach than th reports original proposals in establishing requirements for such liability limitations such as articulating standards for reasonably diligent search the bill would also have directed the copyright office to study and report on th implementation of the new orphan works amendment and to study and make reco mmendations for small claims procedure to address copyright infringement legislation addressing the orphan wo rks issue was reintroduced in the 110th congress the orphan works act of 2008 hr 5889 and the shawn

copyrighted works whose owners are difficu lt or impossible to identify andor locate in january 2005 the copyright office issu ed notice of inquiry requesting public comment from interested parties on the subject2 the office accepted wr itten comments and hosted public r oundtable discussions on the topic in january 2006 it issued its report on orphan works which includes proposed legislative language to address the problem identified3 hearings were held in the 109th and 110th congresses on the orphan works problem4 this report surveys the findings of the report on orphan works report considers the copyright offices proposed amendment to the copyright act to address the issue and analyzes introduced orphan works legislation defining the problems associated with orphan works t h constitutionally authorized grant of limited monopoly to copyright holders is intended to promote the progress of sc ience and useful arts by producing incentives for creative works and their dissemination to the public5 ultimately it is the public interest that supports allowing c opyright holders to financially exploit the value of their creative efforts by contro lling access to

httpwwwcopyrightcornelledutraininghirtle_public_domainhtm provides an illustration of factors such as publication copy right notice and renewal that might apply in determining whether work has entered the public domain copyrighted work must obtain permission to do so6 the terms for usage and recompense if any are negotiated and agreed to by the rights holder and the prospective user7 when an owner cannot be identified or cated protected work is an orphan work many believe that orphan work status renders work inaccessible the inaccessibility arises from the risk of liab ility that user might incur for copyright infringement if and when copyri ght owner subsequently appears first the economic incentive to create may be undermined by the imposition of additional costs on subsequent creators wishing to use material from existing works subsequent creators may be dissuaded from creating new works incorporating existing works for which the owner cannot be found because they cannot afford the risk of potential lia bility or even of litigation second the public interest may be harmed when works cannot be made available to the public due to uncertainty over its copyright ownership and status even when there is longer any living person or legal entity claiming ownership of the copyright or the owner longer has any objection to such use8 this risk of infringement may be pa rticularly burdensome when creator incorporates protected work into new adaptation or transformative work how then is public policy best served by facilitating the publics access to and use of such work and how best to define what constitutes an orphan work for infringement purposes to facilitate access to orphan works and to promote their use without vitiating the copyright or unfairly appropr iating the work into the public domain obstacles to obtaining permission copyright law is the engine driving vast private market of righ ts holders and users the structure of the law in many ways shapes the intellectual property ip marketplace for negotiations between owners and users but it does not control ll aspects of it notifying the public of ownership is the responsibility of the rights holder determining whether work is protected and identifying the actual owner of the copyright who may or may not be the creator is the responsibility of the pr ospective user but the identification process can be extremely complicated difficult and in many cases prohibitively costly there are many components to th determination of whether something is likely to be covered by copyright9 the prospective user must first make preliminary determination as to whether work is indeed copyrighted or has passed into the public domain10 changes to the term of copyright effected by repeal of the 1909 law and

effort to encourage use of copyright notice without causing unf air and unjustifiable forfeitures on technical groundsabandonment of for malities discussed infra all work to complicate calculations of the likely subsistence of copyright particularly with respect to works created prior to 197811 universal registry of copyright owners although registration with the us copyright office is most authoritative there is universal copyright registry various registries or databases exist to allow identification of copyright holders in various industries or mediums but they are essentially voluntary so checking with database may not be dispositive regarding copyright status andor ownership12 furthermore because ip is indeed property through sale assignment or bequestover time ownership rights may be transferred older works of minimal commercial value may essentially be ne glected or abandoned finding copyright owner for them can be challenging formalities under the 1909 copyright law there were many specific actions ie formalities that needed to be taken by the creatorowner in order to create valid copyright failure to do so could void the copyright among the essential formalities were posting of notice of copyright on work and registration with the us copyright office at the expiration of the first 28year term of copyright renewal had to be file d to extend protection for another 28year term 13 observing formalities as prerequisite to creating valid copy right was abandoned under the 1976 copyright act under current law copyright is created automatically when the creative expression is fixed in tangible form copyright formalities were rejected in the 1976 law for several reasons the gislative history notes the concern that rigid formalities put an undue burden on creators who could lose copyright protection in its entirety for failure to comply with formality requirement14 primary goal however was to harmonize us copyright law with international treaties and practice where formalities are not requirement for copyright protection nevertheless changes to us law significantly complicated the process of identifying copyright holders one consequence of the formalities requirements associated with copyright creation was noti ce and registration search of copyright registration records was more though not definitively likely to help prospective user determine both copy right status and owner informationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33392crs4 15 17 usc 408 16 17 usc 411 17 17 usc 412 18 17 usc 502 19 17 usc 504 20 17 usc 505 21 report on orphan works hereina fter report at 2 these include situations where the user contacted the owner but did not receive permission to use the work either because the owner did not respond to the request refused th request or required license fee that the user felt was too highcopyright infringement litigation and damages under the current law for works created after 1978 an owner may register work at any time during the subsistence of the copyright15 work must be registered prior to the rights holder bringing suit for infringement16 registration is also necessary in order for owner to seek statutory damages for infringement17 in the event that court finds copyright infringement it may issue an injunction to prevent or stop it18 and award monetary damages damages may be the actual value of lost profits or damages set by statute know n as statutory damages19 statutory damages prescribe amounts that ma be significantly higher than actual damages for lost profits from 750 to 150000 the amount of statutory damages may be increased in cases where court finds that infringement was willful or correspondingly reduced when it finds th infringement was innocent ie the infringer was not aware and had reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement or the infringer had reas onable grounds to believe that the use was fair use under 107 court may also award court costs and attorneys fees20 in other words registration with its effect of creating searchable record and thereby providing public notice of owners hip is not legally required to create copyright but to enforce it the existence of statutory damages and the award of attorneys fees facilitates enforcement of infringement liability by rights holders when actual damages may not support the costs of litigation the report on orphan works by conducting stakeholder discussions nd reviewing extensive submissions of comments the us copyright offices study considers the landscape surrounding orphan works at the outset it sets forth what were not considered to be orphan work problems namely situations where pros pective user contacted the owner but did not receive permission to use the work21 the analysis also narrows the situations in which it views orphan works as presenting an insurmountable problem to prospective users it delineates several provisions of the copyright law that might permit use of an orphan work or any copyrighted work absent an owners permission httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33392crs5 22 specifically the ideaexpre ssion dichotomy 17 usc 102b prohibits copyright protection for any idea procedure process system method of operati on concept principle or discovery 23 report at 53 citing at note 123 eldred v ashcroft 537 us 186 21921 2003 24 id at 3640 25 in considering legislative solutions to the orphan works problem it is important to keep in mind the requirements of the international instruments to which the united states has agreed exercise and enjoyment of copyright right cannot be conditioned on formality any exceptions or limitations on copyright must conform to the threestep test under international treaty obligations and the effe ct on the owners remedies must comply with the various remedy rules id at 68the ideaexpression dichotomy rooted in the first amendment and codified at 17 usc 102b prohibits copyright protection for ideas procedures concepts etc that may otherwise be embodied in copyrightprotected work22 this jurisdictional limitation on copyright protection may be especia lly useful to prospective users of works of nonfiction and utilitarian works like computer programs textbooks manuals etc23 fair use codified at 17 u sc 107 per mits limited use of copyrightprotected work for purposes such as criticism comment news reporting teaching scholarship or research other express exemptions in th copyright act at 108 110 and 117 allow specified uses of copyrighted works associated with preservation education nd religious activities the report identifies many obstacles to identifying and locating copyright owners and assigns general cat egories of uses that appear to be most impacted by orphan works namely uses by subseque nt creators who may create derivative commercial work incorporating the orphan work large scale access uses by institutions such as libraries that make av ailable wide body of work to the public enthusiast uses by individua ls who have an interest in particular work subject or artist and private uses the most common illustration being someone who wishes to reproduce family photograph or make potentially infringing use of obsolete or orphaned computer software24 the report explains that the 1976 copyright act arguably exacerbated the orphan works problem by abandoning forma lities such as renewa l registration and why the international copyright regime to which the united states is signatory both precludes readoption of formalities and limits the scope of permissible exemptions to the copyright holders rights25 the study reviews solutions proposed by those involved in the orphan works dialogue it groups and considers them in four categories desc ribed in the report as followshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33392crs6 26 id at 69 27 id at 127 solutions that already exis t under current law and practice these were usually noted only in passing commenters ven commenters opposed to any orphan works provision did not take the position that the existing law is sufficient to solve the orphan works problem nonlegislative solutions an example of solution in this category is proposal for improved databases for loca ting owners of works these solutions were also usually noted only in passing and were not advanced as sufficient to fix the problem legislative solutions that involve lim itation on remedies when user uses an orphan work the most substantive comments fell into this category and most of the comments by professional organizations or academics fell into this category other legislative solutions examples of proposed solutions in this category are deeming all orphaned works to be in the public domain or changing the tax or bankruptcy codes to reduce the factors that cause orphan works to come into existence in the first place26 it also considers several of the soluti ons proposed for example one approach might be that utilized by the canadian copyright board which reviews applications for use of orphan works and approves them prior to use this method receives support by some for the certainty that it provides and opposition by others who view it as administratively cumbersome expensive and largely ineffective in promoting actual use of orphan works the copyright offices recommendation the report concludes that the orphan works problem though difficult to scribe and quantify is indeed real though some instances of noninfringing us of such works may be effected under other sections of the law there are still many situations in which prospective users lack guidance on whether and how they ma use orphan works and authority to do so the report recommends statutory nguage to remedy the orphan works problem27 with detailed supporting rationale the proposal takes the approach of limitin g remedies for the copyright owner if user satisfies new statutory require ments for use of an orphan work the proposed language would add new 514 under chapter 5 of the copyright act dealing with copyright infringement and remedies one who uses an orphan work would be required to have performed good faith reasonably diligent search to identify the copyright holder and provide ttribution to the author and copyright owner of the work if possibl and appropriate if th user of orphan work who has satisfied the search and attribution re quirements is subsequently sued by the rights holder for infringement the owner would be limited to reasonable compensation for the use of the infringed work when the infringement is made without commercial advantage and the us er ceases infringement promptly after receiving notice thereof monetary relief would be available injunctive relief ie prohibiting continuing use of the infringing work would not be available when the orphan work is incorporated into derivative work thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33392crs7 28 17 usc 107uses the protected work in transformativ manner provided that the infringer pays reasonable compensation to the copyright owner and provides attribution to the protected work as reasonable in all other cases the court may impose injunctive relief to prevent the continuing infringement but would be directed to consider the harm that relief would cause the infring er who has complied with orphan works requirements in making the infringing use the proposed language specifies that nothing in its provisions would affect other rights limitations or defenses to copyright infringement including fair use the provision would sunset ten years after enactment the goal of the proposal is to promote the goodfaith use of true orphan works by limiting damages available in the event that an owner appears and the user is subsequently charged with infringement the proposed solution ttempts to balance several competing interests notice some content users complain about the lack of easytouse comprehensive sources of information identifying copyright owners easier access to ownership information would minimize mistakes by users in calculating whether work is actually an orphan work but solution that imposes notice or identification requirements on rights holde rs as condition of protecting their copyright would violate both the copyrigh t act and international treaty obligations if its effect was to reinstate formality requirements while it is obviously in the interest of copyright holde rs to make the public aware of ownership the proposal would not impose additional regulatory bur dens on owners or the government by establishing new reporting mechanisms certainty versus flexibility many who promote access to orphan works seek system that best assures potential users that they will be exempt from copyright infringement liability prior to usage but any proposed orphan work exemption will potentially affect vast array of industries and media such as movies music books and photographs there are different physi cal characteristics traditions standards and business practices which affect the eas of researching ownership and obtaining permissions for any given medium likewi different users have different goals such as nonprofit versus commercial usage the approach suggested is in many wa ys comparable to copyrights wellknown fair use exemption in its breadth and flexibility28 like fair use the orphan work exemption would be defense to copyright infringement the proposal takes case bycase approach that would give court di scretion to consider behavior by both the user and claimant did the user perform reasonably diligent search with proper attribution did the claimant decline to accept reasonable compensation for the identified infringement which under the propos becomes in effect statutory cap on relief available arguably it would share many of the strengths and weaknesses of fair use among the form er is flexibility to accommodate broad range of media and situations among th latter may be

although much discussion is provi ded best practices for mediaspecific searches are likely to evolve over time through collaborative efforts and judicial interpretation likewise the notion of reasonable compensation is fluid one another factor that is viewed as adva ntageous or nonadvantageous by different parties critics among user s point to difficulties when the amount of liability exposure is uncertain critics among owners worry that courts interpreting the term may depress the value of reasonable compen sation by valuing it at what the user proposes to pay ab sent negotiations they fear that it may amount to statutory royalty rate damages because the proffered exemption is defense to copyright infringement the costs of litigation were c onsidered in the discussion indeed the report spells out at great length the cerns expressed by both content owners and users on the burdens imposed by having to litigate claim of or defense to infringement users argue that the prospect of statutory damages has chilling effect on their use of valuable historic material for example documentary film footage but many owners assert that limitation on the remedies for infringement would make enforcement impracticable they simp ly cannot enforce their copyright if the enforcement costs more than recoverable damages visual arts photography and visual arts pos special challenges for copyright ownership identification ge nerally and conse quently in connection with orphan works by their very nature they are difficult to source critics are concerned that the orphan work proposal would ffect illustrations and photographs disproportionately because images are co mmonly published by tradition or business practice without identifying informati on if visual representation contains identifying information it ma be and often is easily removed verbal registries cannot adequately describe visual representations eg nine abstract dogs in an abstract garden29 visual registries may contai n prohibitively voluminous entries and be too difficult to search they fe ar enactment of the orphan works proposal might interfere with commercial markets for visual work that it could have the effect of legalizing infringement where ever the rights holder cannot be identified or located that it will put too great burden on rights holders to exercise diligence in monitoring infringing use and that limiting recoverable damages will make enforcement actions economically unfeasible the facto result they contend would deprive visual artists of meaningful copyright protection30httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33392crs9 31 sec 2a of hr 5889 adding new 514b1alegislative proposals hr 5439 109th congress second session the orphan works act of 2006 the orphan works act of

useful article 52 sec 4a of hr 5889injunctive relief the bill provides that court may award injunctive relief to prevent or restrain any infringement h r 5889 provides an exception to this general rule however court may not enjoin the infringing use of an orphan work when it is incorporated or starting to be integrat ed into new work of authorship so long as the infringer pays reasonable compensa tion and provides attri bution to the owner of the infringed work in manner that is reasonable under th circumstances if requested by such owner47 however an infringing party that asserts that it is not subject to suit in federal court or liable for an award of damages for infringement under the copyright act may not avail itself of the limitations on injunctive relief for infringing orphan works unless it has among other things made an enforceable promise to pay reasonable compensation to the copyright owner this provision appears to be directed at any state which may assert immunity against liability for copyright infringement in accordance with the us supreme courts eleventh amendment jurisprudence48 the us supreme court in series of decisions has interpreted the eleventh amendment of the us constitution as limiting congresss authority to abrogate state sovereign immunity consequently st ate may not be sued in federal court for copyright infringement49 exclusion for useful articles hr 5889 provides that the li mitations on monetary and injunctive relief are unavailable to an infringer for infringements resulting from fixation of work in or on useful article that is offered for sale or other distribution to the public50 the copyright act defines useful article to mean an article having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information51 examples of useful articles include shower curtains textile designs wall coverings home furnishings coffee mugs and clothing with images on them ther efore infringers of such useful articles are not allowed to assert the right to claim the limitation on the remedies for infringement effective date the orphan works act of 2008

of the limitation of liability for orphan works including any recommendations for legislative change53 the register is also directed to conduct an inquiry with respect to remedies for small copyright infringement claims that is those seeking limited amounts of money damages54 this requirement appears to ddress the concerns of participants in the orphan works roundtables who expre ssed frustration at the expense of litigating claim for copyright infringement the copyright office is to invite public comment and conduct roundtables at the conclusion and not later than two years after the date of the enactment of th orphan works act of 2008 the office shall submit report on this study to congress including such recommendations that the register consid ers appropriate finally hr 5889 requires the comptro ller general of the united states to undertake study examining the functioni ng of the deposit requirement in the copyright registration system55 s 2913 110th congress second session the shawn bentley orphan works act of 2008 introduced by senator leahy on april 24 2008 the shawn bentley orphan works act of 2008 rrors many of the provisions of hr 5889 although it lacks several of the house bills features s 2913 as introduced does not require an infringer who seeks to qualify for an orphan works limitation on remedies to file notice of use with the copyright office therefore the bill also does away with the need for the copyright office to maintain an archive retaining such notices s 2913 also does not cont ain an exception for infringers of useful articles meaning that such infringers would be able to qualify for the limitations on remedies nor does it require court to give consideration to the fact that work is registered in determining reasonabl compensati on s 2913 does however explicitly extend the safe harbor exemption for paying reasonable compensation to museums in addition to those entities that the house bill had exempted nonprofit educational institutions libraries arch ives and public broadcasting entities56 s 2913 also differs from hr 5889 in terms of the effective date of the limitations on remedies for infringers of pictorial graphic and sculptural works offering date of the earlier of january 1 2011 or the date on which the copyright office certifies at least two electronic databases that meet the same criteria as the house bill

changes to hr 588957 the amendment explicitly adds museums to the list of entities that could qualify for the safe harbor of not having to pay reasonable compensation for infringing uses of orphan works eliminating one difference with the senate version of the orphan works legislation also the managers amendment instructs court before granting injunctive relief to take into account any harm that the re lief would cause the infringer due to the infringers reliance on having performed qualifying search for the copyright owner finally the amendment clarifies that the limitation on remedies for use of orphan works does not apply for an infringer who f ails to render payment in reasonably timely manner of any reasonable compen sation agreed upon by the owner of the infringed copyright and the infringer emphasis added to show the change made by the amendment according to representative howard berman who offered the amendment this additional nguage helps to ensure th at the copyright owner cannot unilaterally demand any amount of money call it reasonable and subject user to damages58 on may 15 2008 the senate judiciar committee approved by voice vote an amendment to s 2913 in the nature of s ubstitute that was offered by its sponsors senators leahy and hatch59 the amendment adds the useful articles exception that is provided in the house bill thereby disallowing infringers who use useful articles from trying to cl aim the limitation on remedies in addition like the managers amendment to the house bill th amendment to s 2913 instructs court before granting injunctive relie f to take into account any harm that the relief would cause the infringer due to the infringers reliance on having performed qualifying search for the copyright owner the amendment also changes one of the potential effective dates with respect to the limitation on remedies for infringement of pictorial graphic and sculptural works to january 1 2013 matching that of the house version the amendment also include s clarification similar to that in the house amendment disallowing the limitation on remedies for an infringer who fails to render payment of reasonable compensation in reasonably timely manner after reaching an agreement with the ow ner of the infringed copyright emphasis added to show the change made to the original text of the bill the substitute bill deletes provision in the bill as introduced that would have denied museums nonprofit educational institutions libraries arch ives and public broadcasting entities the benefit of the safe harbor exemption from paying reasonable compensation if the owner of the infringed copyright proved nd the court found that the infringer had earned proceeds directly attributable to th infringement this provision still appears however in

expressed concern that participation in the orphan works syst em would require them to waive sovereign immunity in virtually all cases the decision to waive sovereign immunity is made not by the
