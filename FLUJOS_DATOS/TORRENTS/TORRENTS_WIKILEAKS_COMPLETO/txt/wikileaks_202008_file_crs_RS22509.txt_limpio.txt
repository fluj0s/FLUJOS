interests internationally pis portrayed itself as the agent for change that would bring about new era in poland and spoke of creating fourth republic4 true to its name law and justice has placed priority on improving the judicial system and aggressively rooting out corruption although conservative in outlook on most social issues pis favors social spending and distrusts privatization and especially foreign ownership of certain strategic state assets pis was founded in 2001 by identical twin brothers jaroslaw and lech kaczynski former warsaw mayor lech became the successful pis presidential candidate defeating pos donald tusk in an october 2005 runoff vote the victory surprised many as tusk had held strong lead in the polls the two men had served together in the solidarity party in the 1990s but their brands of conservatism differed reflection of their parties orientations kaczynski for example espoused economic nationalism and active government intervention while tusk believed that further marketbased reforms would ensure prosperity analysts attribute the election results to voter approval of kaczynskis strong anticorruption policies his support came mainly from older and less affluent poles httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22509 in rural areas while tusk appealed to younger and urban voters jaroslaw initially declared that he would not serve as prime minster analysts argue that he did so before the presidential elections in the hopes of helping lech by defusing potential voter unease over having two siblings run the country the premiership went instead to kazimierz marcinkiewicz in midjuly 2006 however marcinkiewicz the countrys mosttrusted officeholder stepped down some observers believe that the kaczynskis concerned over marcinkiewicz growing popularity and independence may have engineered his departure in addition marcinkiewicz was said to be frustrated that he had not been consulted over recent cabinet changes after lech named his twin brother to replace marcinkiewicz an opinion poll showed that only 21 of the public approved the appointment of jaroslaw whom many viewed as divisive5 after the elections pis and po were expected to form coalition but talks soon collapsed pis initially decided to rule from minority position with informal support from two smaller parties the ruralbased self defense so party led by populist andrzej lepper and the league of polish families lpr an ultraconservative party aligned with the catholic church in april 2006 the three parties entered into formal coalition with majority in parliament the formation of the coalition has had both domestic and continental repercussions polands foreign minister tendered his 3 pis received 155 seats in parliament po 133 selfdefense 56 sld 55 lpr 34 and the

sacked and the kaczynskis reportedly consolidated their power by appointing loyalists to those posts7 on july 9 2007 lepper was dismissed from his cabinet posts on corruption charges but so remained in the coalition for the time being out of concern that they would either lose seats or be unable to muster enough votes to pass the 5 minimum threshold necessary to stay in parliament so and lpr merged to form the league and self defense party lis the new party then proposed conditions for remaining in the coalition on july 30 pis rejected those terms observers believe the dispute will be

level in several years to keep lid on the federal budget deficit pis has been struggling with its coalition partners who have sought additional funding for social programs in the area of monetary policy some analysts are concerned over piss apparent willingness to reduce the independence of the countrys central bank leszek balcerowicz the respected former governor of the bank criticized the desire of some in government to push for reduction in interest rates under his leadership the bank geared its policies toward meeting the criteria for joining the euro whereas pis and its allies reportedly wished to stimulate demand and growth through rate cuts unlike several new eu members the polish government has not yet set firm target date for adopting the euro prime minister kaczynski stated that it is very risky and that is why i think we can only consider it when the economy has significantly strengthened warsaw reportedly asked brussels for additional time to bring down its deficit so that it may continue to receive eu assistance and eventually be able to qualify for euro adoption in january 2007 balcerowicz term expired and parliament approved slawomir skrzypek kaczynski ally with little experience in monetary policy as the new central banker in july 2007 he announced the creation of an office to study the costs and benefits of joining the eurozone in the

january 4 2007 poland alters continued crs4 despite its centerright label pis has been characterized as having somewhat statist approach toward governance particularly in its economic policies for example it espouses that national champions in certain sectors be identified and nurtured in addition some have speculated that pis may seek to overturn earlier sldapproved reforms that sought to introduce greater flexibility in the labor code also pis reportedly would like to introduce vertical integration of the parts of the energy sector that are still owned by the state to reduce dependence upon russia which supplies large part of polands gas and oil the government has instituted talks with norway over laying pipeline and constructing lng liquefied natural gas terminals on the baltic coast in addition poland and the baltic states are exploring joint nuclear power project10 foreign and security policy over the past two years poland has contributed significant number of troops to the usled operation in iraq observers note that the deployment is providing the polish military with invaluable experience not the least of which includes commanding multinational division however polands presence in iraq remains unpopular at home the government has said that poland will maintain its 900 troops there until the end of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22509 2007 poland also has sharply stepped up the size of its contingent of soldiers in afghanistan to 1000 in addition warsaw contributed 260 troops to the peacekeeping mission in lebanon poland has been member of the european union eu since may 2004 and has already experienced economic benefits from membership particularly in the agricultural sector nevertheless the polish government was not reluctant to assert itself in number of issue areas before joining the eu and has been even less hesitant to do so now that it is member the new polish government has sometimes been skeptical of the eu it favors the eventual widening to include ukraine and belarus but not necessarily the deepening of the union at an eu meeting in berlin in early 2006 poland declined to support plan to craft an energy agreement with russia which in january 2005 had temporarily halted gas deliveries to ukraine and disrupted deliveries to europe poland proposed instead the creation of an energy security treaty among eu and nato countries which would not include russia but would acknowledge that russia would remain major supplier some european analysts argued that russia should be excluded as it supplies such large part of europes energy however citing past instances of energy cutoffs poland contended that russia is unreliable in november 2006 frustrated over russias energy policies and its yearlong russian ban on polish agricultural products warsaw vetoed talks over the renewal of an eurussia partnership agreement11 9 continued stance on euro financial times ft july 27 2007 10 poland country outlook eiu february 13

march 8 2006 twins together continued crs5 in 2007 attention focused on polands efforts to influence the eu voting system which was under revision as part of new treaty for the union warsaw maintained that the proposed formula was skewed toward the largest countries and proposed instead that voting strength be based upon the square root of each countrys population only the czech republic supported polands solution which the kaczynskis claimed was worth dying for during the negotiations prime minister kaczynski also argued that polands population would have been 66 million rather than the current 38 million had it not been for germanys world war ii invasion and occupation compromise delay of the introduction of the new formula was reached eventually warsaw later stated that it would seek to revisit the voting issue during portugals eu presidency but then backed away from that demand polands behavior during the negotiations came in for strong criticism according to the financial times jeanclaude junker prime minister of luxembourg said polands stance at last weeks summit was very near to having been unacceptable12 under the new government polands relations with germany and russia have been strained at times many polish officials were incensed over the russogerman agreement to construct natural gas pipeline through the baltic sea rather than overland through httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22509 the baltics and poland during the 2005 presidential campaign lech kaczynski said that if elected he would maintain firm but friendly relationship with russia he also reminded poles of the devastation wrought by germany during world war ii but denied that raising this issue was an attempt to influence the election outcome in june 2006 the german newspaper tageszeitung ran satire on the kaczynski brothers the polish government demanded that the german government take action against the newspaper and apologize for the article but berlin citing freedom of the press responded that intervention would be illegal and an apology inappropriate the article is believed to have prompted lech to cancel his attendance of summit meeting with france and germany13 relations with the united states poland and the united states have historically close relations since 911 warsaw has been reliable supporter and ally in the global war on terrorism and as noted earlier has contributed troops to the usled coalitions in afghanistan and in iraq poland also has cooperated with the united states on such issues as democratization nuclear proliferation human rights

jaroslaw kaczynskis september 2006 visit to washington dc secretary of state condoleezza rice described the two countries as the best of friends15 early in 2007 after years of informal discussions the bush administration began formal negotiations with poland and the czech republic over proposal to establish missile defense facilities on their territory to protect against missiles from countries such as iran and north korea the plan would entail placing tracking radar in the czech republic and interceptor launchers in poland if agreements are struck and if the polish and czech parliaments approve the projects construction on the sites would likely begin in 2008 with initial deployments expected in 2011 some poles believe their country should receive additional security guarantees in exchange for assuming larger risk of being targeted by rogue state missiles because of the presence of the us launchers on their soil in addition many poles are concerned about russias response the polish government reportedly has been requesting that the united states provide batteries of patriot missiles to shield poland against short and mediumrange missiles16 polls show the polish public is opposed to such base nevertheless during july 2007 meeting in washington dc with president bush president lech kaczynski reportedly indicated continued support for the program and also emphasized the need to bolster polands httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22509 security in september 2006 president bush publicly acknowledged the existence of secret cia program to detain international terror suspects worldwide earlier media reports alleged that poland and romania were among the countries that had hosted secret cia prisons although officials of both governments have denied these allegations european parliament probe conducted throughout 2006 cited clear proof of prison sites in europe but could not rule out the possibility that romania had hosted detention operations by us secret services however in june 2007 council of europe report claimed to have evidence that us detention facilities had been based in the two countries president kaczynski has stated that since he assumed office there has been secret prison i am 100 percent sure of it and that he had been assured there were never any in the past either17 some poles have argued that despite the human casualties and financial costs their country has borne in iraq and afghanistan their loyalty to the united states has gone largely unrewarded many have hoped that the bush administration would respond favorably by providing increased military assistance and particularly by changing its visa policy which currently requires poles to pay 100 nonrefundable fee and then submit to an interview at us embassy or consulate requirements that are waived for most western european countries 15 prime ministers visit highlights polands growing role as us ally state department press releases and documents september
