bridge enewsletter lrhs congress lectures date the willingness to control now the difference between good auditor and bad auditor is the willingness of the auditor to control that is the result that one auditor gets compared to the result some other auditor gets with the same technique it is not communication it is first and foremost control if he is able to or willing to control his preclear then the auditor plus the preclear can control the circuits and aberrations of the preclear and an auditor who is not willing to and who cannot control preclear will have any techniqueno matter how brilliant or well thought outtwist in his hands therefore he must know how to control people this excerpt was taken from the london congress on nuclear radiation control health lectures the scale of reality and making postulates stick an article by l ron hubbard excerpted from the london congress on nuclear radiation control health lectures there is the scale of reality it starts at the top with postulate goes down into continuing postulate consideration into that special continuing postulate called an agreement down into that special thing called mass down into terminal down into noline noterminal and when you walk persons reality upstairs with communication it can then and therefore follow this track and should follow this track you know you can always get somebody to redo his postulates you just change them around for him but you can always do that but he now has the power to postulate and woe betide the enemies this person has because ifif this postulatingness continued on downscale below the level where it actually lives it would just be the saddest sorriest world you ever heard of if people at 15 could postulate and make it stick and they cant or if people at boredom could make their postulates stick they cant they can make their postulates stick only above the point where they always keep bargain isnt that an interesting commentary on man but to make postulate stick it almost lays down thethis is moralizing on what is only scientific technical scale if person could make postulate stick every time or change postulate at will which we know is the best therapy there is he would also always keep all of his agreements in all directions or could undo them when they were concluded and he would also be able to conceive and behold masses of any and all kinds and he would also be totally cognizant of any and all lines at will and he would also be totally cognizant of periods of nothingness over which he still had control in other words hed have the whole of the reality scale in his grasp ill go over it again it starts at the top with postulate then continuing postulate and then below continuing postulate comes agreement and were now just now moving into the finite band the 40 on down when we say the reality of an object those people normally havefrom 40 down their greatest reality is that objects are and lines are and we move from there down to about 20 and here we fade on down with line and less and less object you see less and less objects over here and more and more line until we get into the minus tone scale and there we have lines lines lines wheres rope so i can hang myself you know and then this goes on down to just nothing and that is the reality scale and it tells us at once that someone at the level of 1 you know apathybody apathycomes around and he says you know ive just made postulate and the entire government is going to revolt tomorrow dont you believe it that persons postulates dont stick they get frantic about them and they try to tell you they do but they dont it is quite interesting quite fascinating view its as though life had its own brakes its own inhibitions and it safeguarded its abilities so that as person loses these abilities and takes on other attributes he is fortunate to have lost the abilities from the viewpoint of the rest of usin other words at 15 sure as the dickens better not have the ability to postulate cleanly and clearly or people would start dropping dead all over the place but the way its riggedand these things are just basically considerations and agreements amongst the racethe way its rigged is by the time he gets down to that point he couldnt keep contract l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture the reality scale and the effect scale this lecture is available in the london congress on nuclear radiation control health lectures success from listening to the congress lectures i am thoroughly enjoying listening to my lectures every word that i have had to look up is in the glossary of terms which is awesome i treasure these interludes of being with lrhthey are the highlights of my days one win i had which came at the perfect time was that i was experiencing body problem and lrh spoke of granting life to people and things or not granting life i started to grant life to different parts of my body and have had quite considerable change in my body as result another great win was on having an independent attitude toward life this is incredible data the fact is that the only reason one agrees with isness is because of past postulates or bank that datum alone made able to have an independent attitude of my own determination to create my own reality this is so powerful having the golden age of knowledge has put at cause on getting all of lrhs tech up until now i have been overwhelmed by the volume of books and lectures because i did not know where to start so i didnt this has given the doable gradient to get the data in an organized fashion it has put at cause in this area which is win of some magnitude mg now available in the following languages english danish dutch french german greek hebrew hungarian italian japanese norwegian portuguese
