congress legislation concerning the applicability of certain environmental regulatory requirements to recreational and other types of boats was introduced two bills are titled the clean boating act of 2008 s 2766 and hr 5949 legislation titled the recreational boating act of 2007 also was introduced s 2067 and hr 25501 two other bills were the vessel discharge evaluation and review act s 2645 and hr 55942 two measures concerned just with nonrecreational boats were s 3298 and hr 6556 as discussed in this report congress passed two of these bills s 2766 and s 3298 on july 22 2008 and president bush subsequently signed them into law these bills were intended to address an issue that has arisen in implementation of the clean water act cwa in 2006 federal court ordered the environmental protection agency epa to revise cwa regulation that currently exempts discharges from the normal operation of all vessels from the acts permit requirements 3 the bills sought to exempt an estimated 13 million recreational and other vessels from new epa rules promulgated in response to the court order federal appeals court upheld the district courts ruling the day after congress acted on s 2766 and s 32984 the federal court 2006 order reversed epa policy in effect since 1973 in rule that excluded discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels from cwa permitting requirements the district courts order revoked the regulatory exemption as of september 30 2008 the government appealed the courts order but while waiting for ruling on june 17 2008 epa proposed two draft cwa permits to respond to the courts mandate although the focus of the legal challenge was principally to epas permitting exemption for ballast water discharges from vessels5 the courts rulingand its mandate to rescind the regulatory exemptionalso applied fully to other types of vessel discharges that are covered by the exemption such as graywater and bilge water6 barring judicial or legislative relief epa would have been required to promulgate cwa permitting program to comply with the courts mandate by september 30 as discussed below enactment of s 2766 and s 3298 relieved recreational boats and many but not all other vessels from these requirements further on august 31 the federal district court approved epa s 1 s 2067 includes several stylistic and formatting differences from hr 2550 but the bills are similar enough that they are considered together in this report 2 these bills are not identical but they are substantially similar and are discussed together in this report 3 northwest

stored in tanks on large ships such as tank ers and cruise ships to provide stability it is essential to the proper functioning of ships especially cargo ships because the water that is taken in compensates for changes in the ships weight as cargo is loaded or unloaded and as fuel and supplies are consumed however ballast water discharges typically contain variety of biological materials including plants animals viruses and bacteria these materials often include nonnative nuisance exotic species that can cause extensive ecological and economic damage to aquatic ecosystems for

federal law concerned with pollutant discharges to the nations surface waters including rivers and streams lakes estuaries and coastal waters section 301a of this act provides that the discharge of any pollutant by any person shall be unlawful unless the discharge is in compliance with certain other sections of the act the cwa defines discharge of pollutant as any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source b any addition of any pollutant to the waters of the contiguous zone or the ocean from any point source other than vessel or other floating craft 33 usc 136212 various courts have held that biological organisms such as bacteria eg fecal coliform algae dead fish live fish fish remains and plant materials are considered pollutants under this definition point source is discernible confined and discrete conveyance and includes vessel or other floating craft 33 usc 136214 however discharges of sewage from vessels are expressly excluded from the definition of pollutant 33 usc 13626a and sewage discharges from vessels are regulated under separate provision of the act that concerns marine sanitation devices 33 usc 1322 the term discharge incidental to the normal operation of vessel is defined in this provision 33 usc 1322a12 one way pollutant may be lawfully discharged without violating the section 301 prohibition is to obtain national pollutant discharge elim ination system npdes permit 33 usc 1342 under section 402a epa or qualified state may issue permit for the discharge of any pollutant or combination of pollutants notwithstanding section 301a upon meeting certain conditions required by the act 33 usc 1342a discharging pollutants into waters of the united states without permit or in violation of the terms of permit can subject source to the acts enforcement provisions which include fines and penalties 33 usc 1319 in 1973 epa promulgated regulation that excluded discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels from npdes permitting requirements that rule at 40 cfr 1223a excludes from permitting any discharge of sewage from vessels effluent from properly functioning marine engines laundry shower nd galley sink wastes or any other discharge incidental to the normal operation of vessel the exemption applies to vessels of all sizes whether motorized or not at the time epa stated its belief that this type of discharge generally causes little pollution and exclusion of vessel wastes from the permit requirements will reduce administrative costs drastically 7 this longstanding epa regulation was subject to legal challenge in the us district court for the northern district of california in 2005 the court found that congress had directly expressed its intention that discharges from vessels be regulated under the cwa and that the regulation at issue contradicted that intention in september 2006 the court issued final order that vacated 7 us environmental protection agency national pollutant discharge

20088 the district court rejected epa s contention that congress had previously acquiesced in exempting the normal operation of vessels from cwa permitting and disagreed with epas argument that the courts twoyear deadline creates practical difficulties for the agency and the affected industry under the district courts ruling which was upheld on july 23 2008 after september 30 discharges of pollutants incidental to the normal operation of vessel that had formerly been exempted from npdes permitting are subject to the prohibitions in cwa section 301 against the discharge of pollutant without permit although epa appealed the courts decision to the ninth circuit court of appeals it also initiated steps seeking public comment on permitting of discharges that are incidental to the normal operation of ships on june 17 epa proposed two npdes permits in response to the courts order discussed below 9 epa estimated that the universe of vessels potentially affected by the courts order and proposed permits could include over 13 million recreational boats and 98000 commercial fishing passenger cargo and other vessels operating in us waters

bills in the 110th congress sought to statutorily exempt vessels from any cwa permitting requirement that epa might adopt in response to the federal district courts order they reflected four approaches 1 modifying cwa definition to exempt discharges from recreational vessels 2 modifying the cwa to exempt recreational vessel discharges from permitting and directing epa to issue performance standards for discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels 3 directing the coast guard to issue national performance standards for such discharges but exempting recreational and certain commercial vessels and 4 temporarily exempting fishing and some commercial vessels from cwa permitting and requiring study of impacts of vessel discharges the first approach was reflected in s 2067 and hr 2550 these bills proposed to amend the definitions provision of the cwa section 502 33 usc 1362 to define recreational vessel and to detail the types of discharges from such vessels that would not be defined as pollutants under the act and therefore would be exempt from permitting under these bills the term recreational vessel is defined to mean vessel that is manufactured for operation or operated primarily for recreational purposes or that is leased rented or chartered to an individual for recreational purposes s 2766 and hr 5949 reflecting the second approach contained generally similar provision defining discharges incidental to the normal operation of recreational vessels that would be statutorily exempt from permitting in defining recreational vessel these bills included boats manufactured or used primarily for pleasure or boats leased rented or chartered to person for the pleasure of that person these bills proposed to amend the permitting provision of the cwa section 402 33 usc 1342 not the definitions provision unlike s 2067 and hr 2550 these bills stated that the term recreational vessel does not include vessel that is subject to 8 see footnote 3 9 us

paying passengers eg ferries or cruise ships s 2766 and hr 5949 unlike s 2067 and hr 2550 would have added provisions concerning management practices for discharges from recreational vessels as result of these provisions while recreational vessels as defined in the legislation would be exempt from permitting requirements they could become subject to regulations mandating management practices to control discharges section 4 of s 2766 and hr 5949 directs epa in consultation with the coast guard the department of commerce and interested states to develop management practices for discharges other than sewage from such vessels it identifies several factors to be considered by epa such as the nature and environmental effects of the discharge the practicability of using management practice applicable federal and state laws and international standards and cost after developing management practices epa would be required to promulgate federal standards of performance for each these standards could distinguish among classes types and sizes of recreational vessels and also between new and existing vessels the standards could allow for waivers as necessary or appropriate to particular class type age or size of vessel finally the coast guard would be required to promulgate regulations incorporating the epa standards of performance after the effective date of these regulations recreational vessel could neither operate nor discharge in violation of the regulations third approach to the issue was reflected in s 2645 and hr 5594 which proposed to exempt recreational and certain other vessels from regulation unlike the previously discussed bills these measures would have given primary responsibility to address vessel discharges to the coast guard not epa the legislation did not include amendments to the cwa but it would in part have amended the nonindigenous aquatic nuis ance prevention and control act nanpca 16 usc 4701 et seq under nanpca the coast guard is responsible for developing and implementing program to prevent the unintentional introduction and dispersal of nuisance aquatic species into us waters from ship ballast water s 2645 and hr 5594 would have directed the coast guard to study and report on vessel discharges that are incidental to the normal operation of vessels other than aquatic nuisance species including types of discharges the nature and extent of potential effects on human health and the environment and an analysis of control technologies or best management practices based on the study the coast guard was to promulgate and enforce uniform national discharge standards s 2645 and hr 5594 would have suspended any permit requirement for discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels pr omulgated under any other provision of law ie the legislation would supersede any cwa permits issued by epa after promulgation of the coast guard standards states would be preempted from establishing separate laws or rules but states could prohibit such discharges in areas where needed for greater environmental protection under s 2645 and hr 5594 the following discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels would be exempt from the new coast guard rules discharges from recreational vessels 10 discharges from commercial vessels less than 79 feet in length discharges from fishing vessels 10 s 2645 would have limited the exemption to recreational vessels less than 79 feet in length hr 5594 had such limit

bills would have provided twoyear moratorium on npdes requirements for fishing vessels of all sizes 28875 vessels according to epa and vessels less than 79 feet in length rather than the full exemption proposed in s 2645 and hr 5594 and would have required epa to study and report to congress on impacts of discharges incidental to the operation of vessels other than sewage and ballast water the senate environment and public works committee approved s 2766 on may 21 2008 srept 110398 the house transportation and infrastructure committee approved hr 5949 on may 15 2008 hrept 110765 after the two committees action on these bills focusing just on recreational boats attention turned to impacts of the courts ruling on nonrecreational vessels on june 12 house transportation subcommittee held hearing on vessel discharge issues including whether commercial as well as recreational boats should be exempted from permit requirements on july 22 2008 the senate and house passed two of these bills they passed s 2766 to exempt recreational boats from cwa permit requirements and require epa to develop management practices for discharges other than sewage that are incidental to the normal operation of such vessels signed into law july 29 pl 110288 congress also passed s 3298 providing twoyear permit moratorium for fishing vessels and other vessels less than 79 feet in length and requiring epa to evaluate the impact of discharges other than sewage and ballast water that are incidental to the normal operation of vessels signed july 31 pl 110299 epa is to submit report to

court of appeals or congress to provide relief from the district courts order epa proposed two cwa permits in response to the district courts order11 general permit covers multiple facilities within specific category for specific period of time not to exceed five years after which it expires categories covered by general permits have common elements such as similar types of operations that discharge the same types of wastes because of the large number of potential sources of vessels epa believed that it made administrative sense to use general permits rather than individual permits epa proposed general permits that would apply in all states generally epa authorizes states to administer the issuance and enforcement of npdes permits in lieu of epa in this case however epa will be the permitting entity g22g145g142g561g18g155g152g153g152g156g142g141g561g9g142g151g142g155g138g149g561g18g142g155g150g146g157g156g561 as proposed one permit the recreational general permit or rgp would apply to recreational vessels less than 79 feet in length an estimated 13 million domestic boats discharges incidental to the normal operation covered by the draft permit include toxic mainly copper

antifoulant hull coatings and fuel tank overflows the permit would require recreational boat owners to use several management practices intended to minimize or reduce pollutants of concern such as use of phosphorusfree soap minimizing the discharge and transfer of visible organisms that could spread invasive species and managing onboard trash epa estimated that the maximum national compliance cost would be 88 million or 26 per boat per year enactment of s 2766 eliminated the need for this permit the second proposed permit the vessel general permit or vgp applies to commercial and large recreational vessels this is more complex permit than the rgp because it covers eight large categories of vessels epa identified 28 types of waste streams from the normal operation of these vessels some are not applicable to all vessel types the permit proposed that most would be controlled by specific best management practices many of which are already practiced some categories such as cruise ships would be subject to more detailed requirements vessels would be subject to certain monitoring and annual reporting requirements epa estimated that 98645 vessels including about 7900 foreign flagged vessels would be subject to this permit however enactment of s 3298 temporarily relieved nearly 29000 fishing and large recreational vessels of the need to comply with this permit but commerci vessels larger than 79 feet tank and freight ships and barges and cruise ships still must comply with the final permit

affected by enactment of s 2766 or s 3298 12 it applies to pollutant discharges incidental to the normal operation from nonrecreational vessels that are 79 feet or more in length and to ballast water discharges from commercial vessels of less than 79 feet and commercial fishing vessels of any length geographically it applies to discharges into waters of the united states in all states and territories extending to the reach of the three mile territorial limit the permit is effective december 19 2008 however on the same day the federal district court granted an epa motion to delay vacatur of the existing exclusion in 40 cfr 1223a until february 6 2009 thus the effective date remains december 19 but regulated sources need not comply with terms of the permit until february 6 2009 in the final permit epa identified 26 types of waste streams from the normal operation of covered vessels some are not applicable to all vessel types the types of pollutant discharges subject to the permit include aquatic nuisance species nutrients pathogens oil and grease metals and pollutants with toxic effects as in the proposed permit most discharges are to be controlled by specific best management practices many of which are already in use some categories such as cruise ships would be subject to more detailed requirements for discharges such as graywater and pool and spa water
