defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31229zimbabwe backgrounder summary in late 2001 political tensions were mounting in zimbabwe as march 2002 presidential election approached there were several incidents of political violence and president robert mugabe issued new decree to accelerate the forcible takeover of whiteowned farms the move was widely interpreted as violating september 2001 agreement signed in abuja nigeria committing the government to proceed with land redistribution only with due regard for the rule of law the government was also preparing to introduce legislation to ban foreign reporters from zimbabwe and to require zimbabwe journalists to be licensed it had earlier indicated that only zimbabwe civil servants would be permitted to act as observers during the march vote apart from its political difficulties zimbabwe faced declining gdp high rates of inflation unemployment and poverty and an hiv infection rate of 25 among adults aged 15 to 49 food shortages were feared partly because of the turmoil in the countrys agricultural sector and partly because of severe drought in southern zimbabwe officials acknowledged the need for food aid but said that they would not permit charities and international relief organizations to distribute assistance they claimed that such groups would use relief aid to interfere in the countrys politics and support the opposition on october 15 2001 president mugabe announced that zimbabwe was abandoning free market reforms and returning to socialist style economy the move was judged likely to deepen difficulties with the international financial institutions which had already halted lending and further discourage potential investors following the november 2001 assassination of ruling party activist president mugabe charged that the opposition movement for democratic change mdc was terrorist organization leading many to expect an intensification of government action against the party poll showed mdc leader morgan tsvangirai leading mugabe in the presidential contest but analysts believed that mugabe was determined to win in march at almost any cost britain the united states the european union and many african leaders including south african president thabo mbeki were pressing mugabe to permit free and fair vote many feared rising political turmoil in zimbabwe in coming months us policymakers once saw zimbabwe as source of political and economic stability in southern africa but with the failure of zimbabwes economic reform program and mounting unrest in the 1990s us assistance levels fell sharply aid came to focus on programs to strengthen democracy raise living standards among the poor and fight the aids epidemic in late 2001 the united states announced the withdrawal of peace corps volunteers from zimbabwe and strongly criticized the zimbabwe government for restrictions on the press on december 11 congress passed the zimbabwe democracy and economic

political tensions were mounting in zimbabw as march 2002 presidential election approached there were several instances of political violence including the murder of ruling party activist in the southern city of bulawayo followed by an attack on the bulawayo headquarters of the opposition movement for democratic change mdc several mdc members were arrested in this incident and president robert mugabe lashed out at mdc terrorists and at the british government which he said supports them1 meanwhile new presidential decree was issued to accelerate the forcible takeover of whiteowned farms move that was widely interpreted as violating september 2001 agreement signed in abuja nigeria committing the government to proceed with land redistribution only with due regard for the rule of law president mugabes government was drawing mounting international criticism not only on the land issue but also because of alleged interference with the freedom of the press and an apparent refusal to permit international observers to monitor the upcoming election shortages of foreign exchange and mounting arrears on foreign debt signaled the continuing deterioration of zimbabwes economy and officials acknowledged that large amounts of food aid would soon be needed to stave off potential famine in southern zimbabwe at the same time they insisted that food relief not be distributed by charities or international agencies on grounds that they might use food aid to interfere in zimbabwe politics and support the mdc zimbabwes political economic and international problems led many observers to expect serious political instability and possible humanitarian crisis in the months ahead the purpose of this report is to provide background information on the factors and events that have brought zimbabwe to its current situation the report will not be updated instead developments in zimbabwe will be monitored by new crs products as events warrant historical background the roots of zimbabwes current difficulties can be traced back to 1890 when column of 200 white settlers belonging to cecil rhodes british south africa company bsac arrived in the heart of the territory belonging to the shona people known as mashonaland by promising that white numbers would remain small and that they were interested only in mining the settlers had won passage into the region from lobengula chief of the ndebele people whose matabeleland lay between mashonaland and south africa but each white settler was immediately given 1210httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31229crs2 2for more detail see harold d nelson ed zimbabwe country study area handbook series washington us library of congress 1982zimbabwehectares of land 1 hectare247 acres in addition to 15 mining claims in 18931894 the bsac waged war against the ndebele eventually winning control of matabeleland as well2 in subsequent years african farmers were largely confined to native reserves now known as communal areas where the soils were poor and rainfall scant the land apportionment act of 1930 formally set aside over half the countrys total land area including the most fertile zones for whites and the land tenure act of 1969 allocated most remaining unreserved land to the socalled european areas while denying africans any possibility of acquiring land in those areas there had been an influx of european settlers after world war ii and by the 1960s there were more than 200000 whites while africans numbered about 7 million britain had permitted the whiteruled territory to become selfgoverning colony known as southern rhodesia in 1923 but by the 1950s as elsewhere in africa african political movements were growing stronger and pressing for majority rule and independence britain which had come to recognize that independence for all of its african colonies was inevitable insisted that the white settler regime undertake political reforms that would prepare the way for eventual majority rule in southern rhodesia in order to avoid this the white government led by ian smith of the rhodesia front party issued unilateral declaration of independence from britain in november 1965 naming the secessionist country rhodesia britain imposed stringent economic sanctions against rhodesia and united nations sanctions followed but neither britain nor other countries were prepared to intervene militarily to end the rebellion economic sanctions had limited impact since rhodesia was able to trade freely with its neighbor whiteruled south africa there were outbreaks of armed african opposition to the white regime as early as 1966 but it seemed at the time that white minority rule might last indefinitely in 1972 however full scale guerrilla war began as troops of the zimbabwe african national union zanu crossed into rhodesia from bases in parts of mozambique that mozambican revolutionaries had freed of portuguese control in 1974 african nationalist robert mugabe who had been imprisoned in rhodesia for decade was released and he slipped out of the country taking command of zanu in 1975 mozambique became fully independent of portugal in 1975 strength ening zanus position while to the west

strategic materials section 503 of the armed forces appropriation authorization of 1971 pl 92156 these included chromium used in the manufacture of highquality steels as well as titanium and nickel in 1977 however after long legislative battle the view that the byrd amendment was damaging the united states in africa and undermining efforts to promote democracy prevailed and the amendment was essentially repealed3 the carter administration which came into office just before the byrd amendment was repealed strongly supported majority rule in rhodesia and backed british diplomatic efforts to bring about this result controversy over us policy continued but on december 21 1979 at lancaster house in london rhodesian peace agreement was finally concluded the agreement provided for brief transition period under british governor elections under constitution establishing parliamentary form of government and constitutional guarantees of minority rights mugabes party renamed as the zanupatriotic front zanupf won parliamentary majority in the election and he was installed as prime minister of independent zimbabwe on april 18 1980httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31229crs4 zimbabwe in the 1980s for much of the 1980s zimbabwe was regarded as something of model to other african countries because of gains the mugabe government made in extending education and health care services to the poor and in providing extension services rural roads and clean water for impoverished farming communities moreover the country enjoyed relative racial harmony and some whites served in government although others were embittered by the course of events and thousands left in 2001 whites numbered an estimated 70000 to 80000 out of population of 114 million the difficulties zimbabwe encountered as frontline state facing whiteruled south africa brought it sympathy and support from the international donor community the united states provided more than 360 million in nonfood economic assistance in the first decade after independence even in the 1980s however there were indications that authoritarian tendencies were emerging in mugabes regime from 19831987 dissident activity in matabeleland the zapu stronghold was suppressed by the north koreat rained fifth brigade of the zimbabwe army though little information on the conflict was provided by the government reports indicated that thousands were killed and that government troops committed number of atrocities the conflict ended when nkomo agreed to merge zapu with zanupf but the merger had the effect of making zimbabwe virtually oneparty state the constitution was changed in 1987 to create new political system with strong presidency and prime minister mugabe was himself inaugurated as the first president on december 31 of that year in the later 1980s reports and allegations of corruption appeared with increasing frequency zimbabwe in the 1990s in february 1990 nelson mandela was freed from prison in south africa and zimbabwes large and powerful neighbor began 4year democratic transition peace and democracy in south african seemed to promise major improvement in zimbabwes international situation meanwhile the zimbabwe government was developing an economic structural adjustment program aimed at strengthening the domestic economy in july 1991 the finance minister announced plans to cut the budget deficit reduce the size of the civil service and end all state subsidies to state owned corporations including the national airline the steel corporation and the railways despite these promising domestic and international developments in the early 1990s the political and economic difficulties that had begun to emerge in the1980s deepened severely as the decade advanced allegations of serious corruption some involving government ministers and mugabe family members and others close to the president continued to appear in 1996 there were reports of serious improprieties in payments from the war veterans compensation fund intended to assist disabled veterans of the liberation struggle veterans mounted series of protests but these were stemmed in august 1997 when the government announced that all veterans would receive substantial lump sum payment as well as monthly pension and other benefits economists were concerned that such expenditures had been budgeted or planned and that the inflationary impact of the payouts would further weaken the currencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31229crs5 4the economist november 15 1997demonstrations by students and workers against corruption and unemployment occurred with increasing frequency in the later 1990s and these were often harshly suppressed by the police in december 1997 during one round of protests trade union leader morgan tsvangirai was attacked in his office and beaten unconscious by unknown assailants and in march 1998 the offices of his zimbabwe congress of trade unions zctu in bulawayo were pillaged and burned the latter attack came after the army had been deployed to put down urban protests over rising food prices there were other reports of political intimidation against opponents of the regime and some accounts attributed these attacks to war veterans whose loyalty to mugabe had been solidified by the costly veterans benefit program land issue through june 2000 as zimbabwes political and economic situation deteriorated in the later 1990s tensions between the mugabe government and white farmers over land intensified at the time it was estimated that about 4500 whiteowned commercial farms were occupying about 70 of the countrys most fertile land while perhaps 8 million african peasant farmers were still primarily working the poorer drier soils of the communal areas many observers argued that the whiteowned farms were critical to the nations economy not only because of their contribution to the nations food supply but also because the tobacco maize and other crops they produced for export accounted for about 40 of export earnings moreover many argued that the long term solution to unemployment among zimbabwes poor lay not in land redistribution but in business and industry including tourism even so it had long been recognized by donors and by the largely white commercial farmers union that the sharp inequity in land distribution was untenable over the long term and programs had been developed to purchase whiteowned land for resettlement by african farmers the goal of these land reform programs was not to divide up fertile land into subsistence plots but to create viable small farms that would continue to produce crops for the local market and for export some economists argued that reform of this sort could actually boost earnings in the agriculture sector since in their view land on the large whiteowned farms tended not to be fully utilized others pointed out however that there would be added costs to reform since the former whiteowned farms would be more densely populated creating added needs for roads schools clinics and other facilities from 1980 until 1992 largely britishfunded program financed the purchase of approximately 3 million hectares of land on willing sellerwilling buyer basis and some 62000 families were resettled4 us assistance funds during this time were used not to purchase land but to help strengthen the overall economy and assist smallholder farmers through agricultural credit programs extension services and training british support for land purchases came to an end in 1992 when the mugabe government enacted the land acquisition act amending the constitution to deprive landowners of the right to appeal governmentset prices in the courts the act still required fair compensation even though the right of appeal was taken awayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31229crs6 5the economist april 16 1994 african business january 1998 6henry wiseman and alastair taylor from rhodesia to zimbabwe the politics of transition new york

compulsorily take 45 farms in 1994 and according to reports the choicest were given not to the poor but to cabinet ministers generals and others wellconnected in zanupf5 lancaster house commitments the land issue continued to fester with mugabe insisting that britain was obligated to finance the purchase of land from whites for redistribution in part because british subjects had initially taken the land by force and in part because of commitments he felt were made at the lancaster house negotiations in 1979 authoritative sources on lancaster house maintain however that the promise made by britain was not specific pledge to buy land but more general offer to help fund agricultural development land resettlement and redistribution programs that might be undertaken by the new zimbabwe government6 nonetheless jeffrey davidow us diplomat who closely studied the negotiations reports that lord carrington the british mediator did indicate that britain would be prepared to shoulder some of the financial burden of compensating white farmers7 davidow also reports that the carter administration promised assistance to zimbabwe at lancaster house although the promise was convoluted and cautious and not linked to the purchase of whiteowned land the administration davidow maintains did not want to be accused of buying out white landlords on the one hand or of opening the us treasury to landhungry peasants on the other these british and us promises which davidow describes as undoubtedly sincere but still vague helped bring the talks to successful conclusion 19971998 land seizure crisis on october 13 1997 president mugabe told political rally that his government had decided to take land needed for redistribution to poor african farmers from white commercial farmers without compensation initial reaction was muted since similar threats in the past had not materialized in november however the government published list of 1503 properties totaling over 5 million hectares for takeover the government said it would pay for buildings and improvements on land taken but not for the land itself responsibility that in mugabes view lay with britain the reasons for president mugabes decision to revive the land question in 1997 were the subject of speculation among analysts zimbabwe was already experiencing economic difficulties in 1997 and these had led to several

been impatient with the british refusal to provide further funding for land reform on his terms and resentful of the insistence on the part of britain and other donors that the land reform process be orderly open fair and transparent he may have calculated that the threat of sudden largescale land seizure would persuade donors to waive their conditions and provide funding in order to avert rural upheaval mugabe himself said the demand and need for land by our people is now overwhelming adding that if the british government wants us to compensate its children it must give us the money or it does the compensation itself9 president mugabe raised the issue with british prime minister tony blair at commonwealth summit held in edinburgh in late october reportedly seeking about 250 million for land acquisition10 but was disappointed the british insisted not only that any acquisition program would have to be open and transparent but also that resettlement plans would have to be economic and benefit the poor criteria the mugabe proposal did not meet in the british view11 the british government affirmed in december 1997 that it recognized the need for land reform in zimbabwe but that president mugabes approach will damage the economy undermine investor confidence and do nothing to help the poor12 the first months of 1998 were highly confused with respect to the land issue with the government at times seeming to step back from the threat of sweeping nationalizations and at times threatening to move ahead in june and july poor farmers seeking land moved onto some whiteowned farms as squatters foreshadowing the vast squatter movement of 2000 land seizures by government did not actually occur however perhaps because president mugabe had come under strong international pressure to exercise restraint donors and international financial institutions warned that the proposed takeover program would inflict severe economic damage by deterring investors and cutting exports the international monetary fund delayed balance of payments support disbursement expected in august primarily because of concerns over mugabes land policy and its effect on investment despite international concerns land reform pledging conference met in harare in september 1998 zimbabwe was seeking pledges sufficient to fund half of 22 billion program aimed at acquiring 5 million hectares over 5 years for the resettlement of 150000 farm families13 in fact funds were actually pledged at the conference but tensions between zimbabwe and the donor community seemed to

be acquired by the government from underutilized farms that had been offered for sale by their white owners the inception phase would be followed by an expansion phase whose scale and design would depend on lessons learned during the inception phase communique issued at the end of the conference promised that the program would be implemented in transparent fair and sustainable manner with regard for the law and foreign minister stan mudenge promised that there would be confiscators and landgrabbers14 although the plan seemed to have the support of mudenge and other zimbabwe officials president mugabe threatened major new land seizures in november 1998 and march 1999 jeopardizing donor support nonetheless the zimbabwe government presented detailed plan for the inception phase in february 1999 and in may the world bank pledged 5 million to assist with the resettlement of poor farmers and several bilateral donors including the united states made small pledges as well aftermath in subsequent months it seemed that the land issue might recede as zimbabwe moved forward with the donorapproved reform program france and japan joined other donors in offering aid to resettled farmers and in august 1999 the imf lifted its suspension of balance of payments support the imf again insisted however among other conditions that land reform procedures be fully transparent and that fair compensation be paid to landowners at the end of the year mugabe signaled the onset of new land crisis when he began to demand that changes in the constitution to be voted on in 2000 include provisions for seizing land from white farmers without compensation in december 21 1999 interview mugabe said land was taken from our people during colonization without compensation but now the british say we must pay compensation for the soil stolen from us where do we get the resources to pay for the land15 land crisis resumes the land issue indeed figured heavily in the referendum on constitutional changes proposed by the government which took place on february 12 and 13 2000 the proposed changes included provision inserted at president mugabes insistence empowering the government to acquire agricultural land compulsorily for resettlement without paying compensation16 it seemed likely that the constitutional amendments would pass in view of the governments strong backing of the changes and its domination of the media but in surprise outcome 55 of those participating voted some analysts wrote that in view of the result president mugabe should have recognized that his influence was waning and accepted that the time had come to retire but instead the referendum seemed only to energize mugabe for newhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31229crs9 17robin cook press conference

which was then new opposition party within days of the referendum war veterans and other zanupf supporters began to move onto white owned farms and by may 2000 it was estimated that squatters were present at approximately 1000 farms in some instances according to reports the farm occupations were peaceful and farm work was allowed to continue in other instances however white farmers were attacked and driven off their properties the zimbabwe police took action to prevent the farm occupations claiming that they lacked the capability to repel the squatters court orders requiring the squatters to leave were ignored by early june twentyfive people had been killed during the land occupation crisis including four white farmers and several black farm workers the killers seemed to target mdc supporters both black and white highlevel zimbabwe delegation traveled to britain at the end of april 2000 and was told that london would provide an additional 57 million to help with land reform and other programs and would take the lead in mobilizing additional support from the international community but then foreign secretary robin cook insisted that action would be taken against background of occupations and violence and he reaffirmed british insistence on transparency fair compensation good economic management and clear benefit to the rural poor in any land reform program17

parliamentary election president mugabe sharply escalated the land takeover drive on june 2 2000 the government listed 804 large farms for swift takeover and rapid resettlement according to reports as many as 100000 poor africans would be quickly moved onto the farms while roads schools clinics and other facilities would be provided later owners who were granted 30 days to file legal objections would not be compensated for the land itself but would receive compensation for improvements to the land such as farm buildings how the improvements would be valued and the form and timing of this compensation were not made clear president mugabe had invoked emergency powers to enable the government to take land without compensation on may 24 on june 7 2000 president mugabe indicated that he might extend the government takeover of whiteowned farms beyond those already slated for seizure if any white farmers were permitted to remain he added it would be through the charity of the

killed in attacks on farmers and african supporters of the opposition june 2000 parliamentary election elections to the 150member parliament in zimbabwe on june 2425 2000 resulted in narrow victory for the ruling zanupf which won 62 seats the mdc took 57 seats in the highturnout vote so that for the first time in the countrys history there would be strong parliamentary opposition thirty appointive seats under the control of president robert mugabe continued to give zanupf firm control of parliament although the mdc won enough votes to block constitutional amendments tsvangirai did not himself win seat but announced that he would contest the 2002 presidential election there has been much speculation that president mugabe used the land issue to influence the outcome of the vote even though voters rejected compulsory land seizures in the february 2000 referendum mugabe accurately calculated according to this speculation that the confrontation with white landowners would solidify his support among the rural poor war veterans and others some believe that the land confrontation distracted attention from zimbabwes many other problems during the runup to the election and gave militant mugabe backers an incentive to attack white farmers and farm workers who supported the mdc foreign observers accept mdc allegation s that the government undertook systematic effort to prevent free and fair election and to assure zanupf victory observers from the european union and the commonwealth of nations refused to certify the elections as free and fair because of the violence and intimidation that preceded the voting on may 22 2000 the head of delegation from the us based national democratic institute ndi stated that because of campaign of violence intimidation and misinformation the conditio ns for credible democratic elections do not exist in zimbabwe at this time18 rallies and demonstrations by the mdc were disrupted by police and by zanupf backers including war veterans mdc supporters were detained by police and as noted above several mdc members were killed by unknown assailants just before the vote the mugabe government banned ndi the international republican institute and team of african observers sponsored by the european union from monitoring the vote nonetheless the mdc chose to remain in the race evidently calculating that it would gain substantial number of seats despite the violence and intimidation this calculation proved to be accurate as the party won overwhelmingly in harare and other urban areas while taking some rural seats

mugabe blamed on donor hostility the western media white farmers churches and others19 seemed only to goad mugabe into expanding the land takeovers by early august 2000 government officials were stating that more than 3000 farms would be seized and that the army would be mobilized to rapidly resettle hundreds of thousands of poor families they portrayed the expansion as an urgent response to pressing need for land but critics speculated that president mugabe was again escalating the land confrontation in order to better position himself for the 2002 presidential election by april 2001 it

fewer had actually been moved onto farm plots the zimbabwe supreme court ruled on november 10 2000 that the presidents land resettlement policy violated fundamental constitutional rights but the

independent press both domestic and foreign and president mugabes portrayal of the mdc as terrorist organization lead many to expect further action on the part of president mugabe to assure that he prevails in the march election the result could be rising political turmoil inside zimbabwe and mounting international isolation conceivably president mugabe will attempt to cancel or postpone the
