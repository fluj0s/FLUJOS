prime contractors who subcontracted to firms owned by socially and economically disadvantaged group members although the court refrained from deciding the co nstitutional merits of the particular program before it and remanded for further proceedings below it determined that all racial classifications by government at any level must be justified by compelling governmental interest and narrowly tailored to that end but the majority opinion by justice oconnor sought to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is strict in theory but fatal in fact by acknowledging role for congress as architect of remedies for discrimination nationwide bottom line adarand and its progeny suggest that racial preferences in federal law or policy are remedy of last resort which must be adequately justified and

and other socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses become fully competitive and viable business concerns1 the objective has largely been pursued through the federal procurement process by allocating federal assistance and contracts to foster disadvantaged business development federal assistance has taken variety of forms including targeting procurement contracts and subcontracts for disadvantaged or minority firms management and technical assistance grants educational and training support and surety bonding assistance present day setaside programs authorizing preferential treatment in the award of government contracts to socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses dbes originated in 8a of the small business act of 1958 2 initially the small business administration sba utilized its 8a authority to obtain contracts from federal agencies and subcontract them on noncompetitive basis to firms agreeing to locate in or near disadvantaged areas and provide jobs for the unemployed and underemployed the 8a contracts awarded under this program were not restricted to minorityowned firms and were offered to all small firms willing to hire and train the unemployed and underemployed in five metr opolitan areas as long as the firms met the programs other criteria 3 as the result of series of executive orders by president nixon the focus of the 8a program shifted from jobcreation in lowincome areas to minority small business development through increased federal c ontracting with firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged persons4 with these executive orders the executive branch was directed to promote minority business enterprise and many agencies looked to sbas 8a authority to accomplish this purpose the administrative decision to convert 8a into minority business development program acquired statutory basis in 1978 with the passage of pl 95507 which broadened the range of assistance that the governmentsba in particularcould provide to minority businesses section 8 or the minority small business and capital ownership development program authorizes sba to enter into all kinds of cons truction supply and service contracts with other federal departments and agencies the sba acts as prime contractor and then subcontracts the performance of these contracts to small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals indian tribes or hawaiian native organizations 5 applicants for 8a certification must demonstrate socially disadvantaged status or that they have been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identities as members of groups without regard to their individual qualities6 the small business administration presumes absent contrary evidence that small businesses owned and operated by members of certain groupsincluding blac ks hispanics native americans and asian pacific americansare socially disadvantaged 7 any individual not member of one of these 1 this report was originally written by charles v dale legislative attorney 2 15 usc 637a 3 minority contracting joint hearing before

of the evidence in order to qualify for 8a certification8 the 8a applicant must in addition show that economic disadvantage has diminished its capital and credit opportunities thereby limiting its ability to compete with other firms in the open market9 accordingly while disadvantaged status under the sba includes racial component in terms of presumptive eligibility it is not restricted to racial minorities but also includes persons subjected to ethnic prejudice or cultural bias who are able to satisfy specified regulatory criteria 10 it also excludes businesses owned or controlled by persons who regardless of race are not truly socially andor economically disadvantaged11 the minority small business subcontracting program authorized by 8d of the small business act codified the presumption of disadvantaged status for minority group members that applied by sba regulation under the 8a program12 prime contractors on major federal contracts are obliged by 8d to maximize minority participation and to negotiate subcontracting plan with the procuring agency which includes percentage goals for utilization of small socially and economically disadvantaged firms to implement this policy clause required for inclusion in each such prime contract states that the contractors shall presume that socially and economically disadv antaged individuals include black americans hispanic americans native americans asian pa cific americans and other minorities or any other individual found to be disadvantaged by the administration pursuant to 8a all federal agencies with procurement powers were required by pl 95507 to establish annual percentage goals for the award of procurement contracts and subcontracts to small disadvantaged businesses decade later congress enacted the business opportunity development reform act of 1988 13 directing the president to set annual governmentwide procurement goals of at least 20 for small businesses and 5 for disadvantaged businesses as defined by the sba simultaneously federal agencies were required to continue to adopt their own goals compatible with the governmentwide goals in an effort to create maximum practicable opportunity for small disadvantaged businesses to sell their goods and services to the government the goals may be waived where not practicable due to unavailability of dbes in the relevant area and other factors 14 federal acquisition act amendments adopted in 1994 amended the 5 minority procurement goal and the minority subcontracting requirements in 8d to specifically include 8 id at 124103c 9 the statute 15 usc 637a6a defines economic disadvantage to mean socially disadvantaged individuals whose ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to others who are not socially disadvantaged and such diminished opportunities have precluded or are likely to preclude such individuals from successfully competing in the open market 10 15 usc 637a5 d criteria set forth in the regulations requires nonminority individuals to prove by preponderance of the evidence that they have personally experienced substantial and chronic social disadvantage in american society as the result of at least one objective distinguishing feature including long term residence in an environment isolated from the mainstream of american society with negative impact on his or her entry into the business world in every case sba will consider educatio n employment and business history where applicable to see if the totality of circumstances shows disadvantage in entering into or advancing in the business world 13 cfr 124105c 11 see 49 cfr pt 23 subpt d app c 12 15 usc 637d see also 13 cfr 124106 13 pl 100656 502 102 stat

has followed convoluted course since 1995 when the supreme court settled the constitutional parameters of the issue but avoided decision of the merits in adarand constructors inc v pena adarand i 22 by the time it returned to the high court six years later as adarand constructors inc v mineta the legal and factual framework of the case was considerably altered by multiple lower court decisions and appeals and by changes in the plaintiffs legal standing the details of the challenged federal program and regulatory reforms to amend not end federal affirmative action by the former clinton administration to the chagrin of many legal observers the court in 2001 once again sidestepped the constitutional issues posed by the adarand case and after agreeing to reconsider the controversy dismissed the appeal as improvidently granted the object of the courts latest actionor inactionwas the tenth circuits twopart ruling in adarand constructors v slater adarand iii23 the federal appeals

program was found to be narrowly tailored to compelling governmental interest and passed constitutional muster prior to adarand the us supreme court had narrowly approved of congressionally mandated racial preferences to allocate the benefits of contracts on federally sponsored public works projects in fullilove v klutznick 24 while generally condemning similar actions taken by state and local entities to promote public contracting opportunities for minority entrepreneurs in city of richmond v ja croson co25 these disputes generated divergent views as to whether state affirmative action

of financial incentives for prime contractors who subcontracted to firms owned by socially and economically disadvantaged group members although the court refrained from deciding the constitutional merits of the particular program before it and remanded for further proceedings below it determined that all racial classifications by government at any level must be justified by compelling governmental interest and narrowly tailored to that end there have been three distinct phases to the adarand litigation the case originated with now discontinued raceconscious subcontracting compensation clause scc program conducted by the federal highway lands program of the fe deral highway administration the scc did not allocate or setaside specific percentage of subcontract awards for dbes or require commitment on the part of prime contractors to subcontract with minority firms rather incentive payments varying from 15 to 2 of the contract amount were paid to prime contractors whose subcontracts with one or more qualified dbes exceeded 10 of total contract value the program incorporated the racial presumption from the small business act and regulations in effect relieving minority group subcontractors of the burden of demonstrating disadvantaged status imposed upon nonminorities suit was brought by adarand constructors inc whiteowned construction firm whose low bid on subcontract for highway guard rails was rejected in favor of higher bidding dbe both the federal trial court and the tenth circuit initially upheld the program by applying lenient judicial reviewresembling intermediate scrutinyrather than strict scrutiny requiring far less remedial justification by the government because the program was not limited to racial minorities and nondisadvantaged minority group members were ineligible to participate the appeals court concluded the program was narrowly tailored in adarand i the supreme court reversed this first round of

that applied intermediate scrutiny or some other relaxed standard of re view to racial linedr awing by the congress because the racebased rebuttable presumption in the dot program was an explicit racial classification the court determined it must be analyzed by reviewing court under strict scrutiny and to survive must be narrowly tailored to serve compelling governmental interest adarand i undermined prior judicial holdings which had afforded substantially greater latitude to congress than to the states or localities when crafting affirmative action measures for racial or ethnic minorities to dispel the notion however that strict scrutiny is strict in theory but fatal in fact the court appeared to reserve role for the national legislature as architect of remedies for past societal discrimination the unhappy persistence of both the practice and lingering effects of racial discrimination against minorities in this country is an unfortunate reality and the government is not disqualified from acting in response to it 26 thus majority of the court appeared to accept some forms of racial preference by congress in at least some circumstances27 further guidance was provided however as to the scope of remedial authority remaining in congressional hands or th conditions for its exercise indeed the court refrained even from deciding the merits of the constitutional claim before it in adarand i instead remanding the case to the lower courts to determine the outcome on remand the district court in adarand ii decided that the congruence required by the court did not mean that federal affirmative action must be supported by the same particularized showing of past discrimination as state and local programs28 rather as national legislature congress was empowered to enact broad discrimination remedies based on nationwide findings derived from congressional hearings and statements of individual federal lawmakers congress in other words may recognize nationwide evil and act accordingly provided the chosen remedy is narrowly tailored so as to preclude the application of raceconscious measure where it is not warranted the dot incentive program failed the narrow tailoring test however because it linked racebased presumption to the award of financial bonuses to prime contractors whose choice of subcontractor was based only on race the racial presumption was found to be both overinclusivein that its benefits were available to all named minority group membersand underinclusivebecause it excluded members of other minority groups or caucasians who may share similar disadvantages although more flexible than rigid racial quota or mandatory setaside the scc program was tainted by the governmentwide 5 goals and transportation setasides which it implemented 29 26 515 us at 217 27 in their separate concurrences justices scalia and thomas espoused far more restrictive view that would foreclose all governmental classifications by race or ethnicity justice scalia declared that government can never have compelling interest in discriminating on the basis of race in order to make up for past racial discrimination in the opposite direction justice thomas was of the view that the racial paternalism of affirmative action was more injurious than beneficial to minorities in my mind go vernmentsponsored racial discrimination based on benign prejudice is just as noxious as discrimination inspired by malicious prejudice in each instance it is racial discrimination plain and simple 28 adarand constructors inc v pena 965 f supp 1556 dcolo 1997 29 two aspects of the district courts analysis of the n arrow tailoring requirement were especially unsettling for federal small disadvantaged business programs first the optional or voluntary nature of the scc program was not enough to save it notwithstanding the fact that prime contractors were free to accept bid proposals from any subcontractor regardless of race or ethnicity the governments failure to prevail on this issue cast long shadow over other federal minority contracting effortseg the 8a taside bid or evaluation preferences and the likewhich under the district courts reasoning may be viewed as imposing choice based only on r ace at least as mandatory and absolute as the incentive payment to prime contractors in adarand if not more so similarly the fact that the scc program did not expressly incorporate any goals quotas or setasides was not sufficient to divorce it in the continued

controversy30 the appellate panel in adarand iii reversed the district court injunction against future implementation of dots disadvantaged business enterprise dbe program in colorado in so doing the court of appeals considered the constitutionality of the program both as structured at the time of the district court decision and of later revisions to dbe regulations adopted in 1997 first it generally agreed with the district court that the scc system of financial incentives in effect at time of adarand i had not been narrowly enough tailored to satisfy the constitutional requirements of strict scrutiny but after lengthy congressional hearings the financia l incentives were eliminated and other reforms were adopted to dbe requirements imposed by dot regulation on state and local highway aid recipients as result the appeals court ultimately concluded that the dot disadvantaged business enterprise program as currently structuredthough not the former discarded program of financial incentivespassed constitutional muster initially the appellate tribunal aligned itself with the district courts finding that the federal government had compelling interest in preventing and remedying the effects of past discrimination in government contracting and the scope of congresss authority to act was not limited geographically or to specific instances of discriminationas in the case of the states and localities under croson but extended societywide and therefore nationwide the range of admissible evidence to support racial linedrawing by congress was both direct and circumstantial including postenactment eviden ce and legislative history demonstrating public and private discrimination in the construction i ndustry the court was largely dismissive of individual statements by members or from committee reports as insufficient in themselves to support finding of compelling interest congressional hearings over nearly twodecade period however depicted the social and economic obstacleseg old boy networks racism in construction trade unions and denial of access to bonding credit and capitalfaced by small and disadvantaged entrepreneurs mainly minorities in business formation and in competition for government contracts moreover disparity studies conducted after croson in most of the nations major cities compared minorityowned business utilization with availability and raised an inference that the various discriminatory factors the government cites have created that disparity this record satisfied the tenth circuit panel that congress had strong basis in evidence for concluding that passive federal complicity with private discrimination in the construction industry contributed to discriminatory barriers in federal contracting situation the government had compelling interest in remedying continued district courts view from the percentage goal requirements imposed by statutes the program was designed to implement those statutory provisionsthe 5 minimum disadvantaged small business goal in 8d of the sba and the parallel 10 requirement in sturaa and isteawere deem ed invalid for lack of narrow tailoring in effect the district court ruling questioned much of the federal governments statutory infrastructure for advancing minority small business participation in the procurement process by raceconscious means 30 adarand constructors inc v slater adarand iii 228 f3d 1147 10th cir 2000 this court of appeals decision was preceded by an intervening appellate ruling and supreme court review confined to procedural questions of standing and mootness occasioned by the plaintiffs change in circumstances after the district decision in adarand ii the state of colorado did away with the racial presumption and certified the nonminority owner of adarand constructors inc as disadvantaged as result the tenth circuit dismissed the case as moot and the vacated the judgment against the government adarand v slater

tailored requirement focusing on the dbe program both as in effect prior to1997 and later as revised to comply with adarand i basically it determined that many of the constitutional flaws that defeated the program in the district courts opinionan outcome with which the appellate panel largely agreedhad been eliminated by the governments regulatory reforms in effect the latest decision lays the old program to rest while reversing the district courts order insofar as it would bar implementation of the revised version the appeals court also clarified the scope of the dbe program under review it disagreed with and specifically reversed elements of the district court judgment raising issues beyond the specific dbe program as applied by colorado officials to federally funded highway procurements within that state because the 5 and 10 goals in the sba and underlying transportation authorization measures are merely aspirational and not mandatory they were not the reason that adarand lost or will lose contracts and any challenge to those provisions were outside the scope of the remand in adarand i thus any broader potential implications of the district court ruling for 8 setasides or government wide goals for dbe participation under the smal l business act were largely blunted by the appellate panel 31 the constitutional virtues of the revised program over the pre1996 scc program at issue in adarand i were several first raceneutral measures dating back to the 1958 enactment of the sba had preceded congressional adoption of aspirational goals and other affirmative action measures for minority groups in governmentwide contracting dot had not considered such alternatives before adopting raceconscious subsidies for prime contractors who select minority subcontractors however this defect was cured by the revised regulations which specifically directed recipients to exhaust raceneutral alternativesbonding financing and technical assistance etcbefore taking race into account 32 secondly the revised regulations incorporated the time limits and graduation requirements for participation of disadvantaged businesses in the 8a and 8d programs thereby ensuring the later programs limited duration33 the court of appeals also found that the revised dot program was more flexible than the mandatory setasides in fullilove and croson because they were voluntary on the part of the prime contractors and because the post1996 revisions adopted an express waiver34 any use of aspirational goals by recipients of federal highway funds had to make reference to the relative availability of dbes in the market and was restrained in other ways by the new regulations so that there is little danger of arbitrariness in the setting of such goals35 the burden of the revised program on third parties was mitigated by placing monetary caps on subsidies to prime contractorslimiting the incentive to hire further dbesand by adopting preponderance of the evidence for proof of 31 specifically the tenth circuit opinion states subsection 8a does not involve the use of sccs nor has adarand made any showing that it has been injured by noninclusion in the 8a this case does not involve nor has adarand ever demonstrated standing to bring generalized challenge to the policy of maximizing contracting opportunities for small disadvantaged businesses set forth in 15 usc 637 and 644g or to the various goals for fostering the participation of small minorityowned businesses promulgated pursuant to 15 usc 644g nor are we presented with any indication that adarand has standing to challenge 637d 228 f3d at 1152 32 49 cfr 2651ab2000 33 participation in the 8a program is limited by statute and regulation to ten and onehalf years and each dbe is re evaluated and may be graduated from the program based on the submission of financial and other information required annually 34 49 cfr 2615 2000allowing recipients to seek waivers and exemptions despite the already nonmandatory nature of the program 35 the court of appeals found that the scc had been based in part on an illdefined 1215 goal apparently adopted by the federal highway administration for which it could find explanation in the record this alone would have warranted summary judgment for adarand it concluded

the former clear and convincing standard finally the revised program avoided the constitutional vice of over and underinclusiveness by disaggregating the racebased presumption that encompassed both social and economic disadvantage in the former regulation thus an individualized showing of economic disadvantage is now required of all applicants to the program minority and non minority alike this change the appeal court believed effectively satisfied the croson requirement of an inquiry into whether or not the particular mbe seeking racial preference has suffered from the effects of past discrimination36 g22g145g142g561g21g158g153g155g142g150g142g561g5g152g158g155g157g561g6g142g140g149g146g151g142g156g561g157g152g561g6g142g140g146g141g142g561g157g145g142g561g5g138g156g142g561 the us supreme court granted certiorari in an appeal from the tenth circuits final decision marking the third high court appearance by the adarand case during oral arguments the justices appeared more concerned with procedural irregularities in the case as outlined by the justice department than with the substance of the constitutional claims in essence the government argued that adarands legal challenge was limited to the dot program and regulations applicable to direct procurement of highway construction on federal lands like the contract denied not to the separate regulatory scheme governing federal highway assistance to states petitioner adarand constructors inc made parallel argumentbut for different reasonthat the court of appeals misconceived the scope of the appeal in particular petitioners brief contended the tenth circuits analysis considered revisions to dot regulations applicable to federally assisted state and local highway projects which are irrelevant to the separate set of rules governing direct federal procurement th ereby undermining the courts conclusion that the sdb program was narrowly tailored because the race conscious aspects of the original financial incentive program had been suspended in colorado and several other states as the result of administration reforms to affirmative action rules after adarand i counsel for the company had difficulty arguing that its client is still unable to compete on an equal footing or had lost single contract under the provisions they are now challenging further complicating adarands position the tenth circuit had rejected its earlier attack upon the entire statutory framework for federal small disadvantaged business programs ruling not appealed to the supreme court the government therefore contended that adarands lawsuit had outlived the program that provoked it and in oral arguments to the justices the solicitor general urged the court to dismiss the petition for certiorari as improvidently granted it came as great surprise therefore that the justices complied with the governments request and dismissed the case 37 in per curiam opinion the court emphasized technical flaws with the present appeal as framed during oral argume nts first adarand was challenging by now defunct aspect of the program that the tenth circuit had not ruled upon asking whether the various racebased programs applicable to direct federal contracting could satisfy strict scrutiny nor had the company sought review of those aspects of the dot statute and regulations respecting the state and local procurement program on whose constitutionality the appeals court had spoken consequently the supreme court declined to reach the merits of controversy 36 the current regulations impose additional requirements on applicants with regard to individualized showing they must submit narrative statement describing the circumstances of that purported economic disadvantage 13 cfr

to be reading from the same page left unanswered therefore were two major questions presented by the petition for review first was whether the court of appeals misapplied th strict scrutiny standard in determining if congress had compelling interest to enact legislation designed to remedy the effects of past discrimination the tenth circuit found that congress had solid basis in evidence for concluding raceconscious action necessary based on its dissection of hearing testimony legislative reports and state and local disparity studies generally its approach conformed to earlier rulings which have stressed deference to congressional factfinding under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment as the national legislature congress may not be constrained by the same requirements of specificity in regard to regional scope and classes of individuals benefitted by race conscious programs but recent court rulings parsing the scope of congressional 5 power to override state sovereign immunity under variety of federal civil rights laws have emphasized the need for congruence and proportionality of the remedy to any problem perceived by the congress 38 the ramifications of this principle for 5 race discrimination legislation is undetermined and questions remain conversely some would argue the affirmative grant of congressional authority to legislate remedies for equal protection violations by states conferred by 5 is even broader than its power to place similar conditions on direct spending for federal procurements which is limited by 5 th amendment due process the second aspect of strict scrutiny analysis would have required the court to determine whether the means chosen by dot to promote minority group participation in the federal procurement process is narrowly tailored in this regard the tenth circuit found that after eliminating financial bonus or subsidy the adoption of aspir ational goals for utilization of disadvantaged firms based on good faith efforts as required by current regulations was more flexible and narrowly tailored alternative that conclusion however has been questioned by other courts which have found that governmentally required goalsetting coupled with enforcement sanctionsin adarands case liquidated damages under 8 dis inherently coercive and encourages racial quotas the ninth circuit for example has invalidated california affirmative action statute that required bidders on state contracts to subcontract percentage of their work to female and minorityowned firms or document good faith effort to do so 39

clinton administration sought to narrowly tailor federal minority and disadvantaged small business programs in line with adarand the justice department in 1996 proposed structure for reform of affirmative action in federal procurement setting stricter certification and eligibility requirements for minority contractors claiming socially and economically disadvantaged status under 8a and 8d of the small business act41 the plan suspended for two years setaside programs in which only minority firms could bid on contracts statistical benchmarks developed by the commerce department and adjusted every five years were made the basis for estimating expected disadvantaged business participation as federal contractors in the absence of discrimination for nearly 80 different industries where minority participation in an industry falls below the benchmark bid and evaluation credits or incentives are authorized for economically disadvantaged firms and prime contractors who commit to subcontract with such firms conversely when such participation exceeds an industry benchmark the credit would be lowered or suspended in that industry for the following year the system is monitored by the commerce department using data collected to evaluate the percentage of federal contracting dollars awarded to minorityowned businesses and relies more heavily on outreach and technical assistance to avoid potential constitutional pitfalls the justice departments response to comments on its proposal together with proposed amendments to the federal acquisition regulation far to implement it were published in 1997 42 several procurement mechanisms interact with benchmark limits pursuant to the far regulation jointly proposed for the departments of defense general services administration and national aeronautics and space administration an evaluation credit applies to bids by non minority prime contractors participating in joint ventures teaming arrangements or subcontracts with such firms and contracting officers may employ monetary incentives to increase subcontracting opportunities for disadvantaged firms in negotiated procurements benchmarking by the commerce department is the

has had on suppressing minority business development and capacity would be made and that calculation would be factored into benchmarks the purpose of co mparing utilization of minorityowned firms to the benchmark is to ascertain when the effects of discrimination have been overcome and minorityowned firms can compete equally without the use of raceconscious programs full utilization of minorityowned firms in an sic code may well depend on continued use of raceconscious programs like price or eval uation credits where utilization exceeds the benchmark the office of federal procurement policy may authorize the reduction or elimination of the level of price or evaluation credits but only after analysis has projected the effect of such action 43 final regulations implementing justice department recommendations with respect to the 8a business development and small disadvantaged business program were issued by the sba in 199844 the reforms include new process for certifying firms as small disadvantaged businesses and in place of setasides price evaluation adjustment program administratively tied to the commerce benchmarks in the past the government relied on selfcertification for purposes of disadvantaged eligibility which allowed firms to identify themselves as meeting certification requirements under the new procedure sba or where sba deems appropriate sbaapproved state agencies or private certifiers make threshold determination as to whether firm is actually owned or controlled by specified individuals claiming to be disadvantaged after ownership or control is established the application is reviewed by sba for purposes of determination of disadvantaged status the definition of social and economic disadvantage remains largely intact under the sba regulation members of designated minority groups participating in disadvantaged small business programs continue to enjoy statutory presump tion of social disadvantage they are required however to state their group identification and meet certification criteria for economic disadvantage and are subject to thirdparty challenge under current administrative mechanisms individuals who are not within the statutory presumption may qualify by proving that they are socially and economically disadvantaged under sba standards under prior sba 8a certification standards however persons not members of presumed disadvantaged groups had to prove their status by clear and convincing evidence the revised sba regulations ease this burden on nonminority applicants by adopting preponderance of evidence rule

as merely aspirational the regulations decentralize administration of the dbe program by delegating implementation to state agencies receiving federal transportation funds twostep process is established for states to determine the level of dbe participation that would be expected absent the effects of discrimination48 first the relative availability locally of ready willing and able dbes must be calculated this baseline figure is then adjusted upward or downward to reflect other capability factors and evidence of discrimination against dbes drawn from statistical disparity studies the final adjusted figure represents the portion of federal transportation funding that state must allocate to dbe for that year state must meet the maximum feasible portion of this goal through race and sex neutral means raceconscious contract goals must be applied to achieve any portion of the utilization requirement not attainable by other means49 even when raceconscious measures are necessary however the regulations do not require that dbe goals be included in every contractor that they be set at the same level in every contract where usedas long as the overall effect is to obtain the required dbe participation level prime contractors to whom state awards federally funded transportation contracts must undertake good faith efforts to satisfy any included goal by allocating the designated percentage of funds to dbe firms 50 states are prohibited from instituting rigid quotas that do not account for prime contractors good faith efforts to subcontract works to dbes51 45 1101b1

issue of congressional authority to fashion affirmative action remedies courts in these cases have generally concluded from the record of committee hearings and other docume ntary evidence before congress that the government had compelling interest for the program in question however in applying the constitutional demand for narrowly tailored reme dy there is divergence of judicial opinion as to whether states or localities must independently justify the use of racial preferences to implement federal mandates within their individual jurisdictions the supreme court in 2004 refused to revisit issues left unsettled by adarand when it denied review of the eighth circuits consolidated ruling in sherbrooke turf inc v minnesota department of transportation and gross seed company v nebraska department of roads 52 the sherbrooke court joined the tenth circuit in upholding the dbe program under current dot regulations and beyond that approved specific state plans to implement that program pursuant to tea21 and the dot revised regulations st ate highway departments in minnesota and nebraska established specific goals for the award of federallyfunded contracts to dbes in both states whiteowned contractors had submitted th low bid on dot funded subcontracts but were passed over in favor of presumptively disadvantaged minority competitor petitioners challenged dbe contract awards alleging unconstitutional race discrimination and that continued enforcement of the programs would deny them the right to compete on an equal basis for future contracts federal district courts in both states upheld the program the government conceded that the federal highway dbe program on its face and as applied is subject to strict scrutiny because it uses racebased rebuttable presumption to define its beneficiaries and employs race conscious remedial measures such governmental consideration of race is constitutional only if narrowlytailored to further compelling governmental interest neither sherbrooke nor gross seed disputed that the federal government has compelling interest in not perpetuating the effects of racial discrimination in its own distribution of federal funds and in remediating the effects of past discrimination in the government contracting markets created by its disbursements rather petitioners argued that congress and dot have hard evidence of widespread intentional discrimination in the contracting industry they relied instead on justice department summary of over 50 documents and 30 congressional hearings on minorityowned businesses prepared in response to the adarand decision 53 the eighth circuit nonetheless agreed with the tenth circuit conclusion in adarand that congress has spent decades compiling evidence of race discrimination in federal highway contracting and petitioners failed to meet the burden of showing that remedial action was necessary nor were the minnesota dot and nebraska road department required to independently satisfy the compelling government interest aspect of strict scrutiny review to be narrowly tailored however national program must be limited to those parts of the country where its racebased measures are demonstrably needed to the extent the federal government delegates this tailoring 52 345 f3d 964 8th cir 2003 cert denied 541 us 1041 us 2004 53 see appendixthe compelling interest for affirmative

reviewing courts strict scrutiny under the current dot program the opinion notes raceconscious methods cannot be used unless raceneutral means are projected to fall short of achieving the overall goal and racial preferences or setasides are limited to those instances when other method could be reasonably expected to redress egregious instances of discrimination in addition because the goals for dbe participation are tied to the relevant labor markets have built in durational limits and are subject to good faith waiver and exemptions the programs were deemed narrowly tailored on their face finally the court reviewed minnesotas and nebraskas implementation including each states reliance on findings by independent consultants in setting goals for minorityowned business participation and concluded that the dbe program was narrowly tailored as applied at the state level similarly the issue presented in western states paving co inc v washington state department of transportation 54 is whether tea21which allocates 10 of certain federal transportation funds for small disadvantaged and minority contractorsis unconstitutional on its face or as applied by the state of washington as discussed above dot regulations presume disadvantaged status for minority groups and women provided the small business owner has net worth of less than 750000 but members of other groups are eligible if they can demonstrate in fact that they are socially and economically disadvantaged threejudge panel of the ninth circuit agreed with the eighth and tenth circuits that race and sex preferences for highway contractors under tea21 are facially valid the compelling interest was in ensuring that federal funding is not distributed in manner that reinforces the effects of either public or private discrimination within the transportation construction industry the evidence relied on by congress and reviewed by the court demonstrated continuing pattern of race and sex discrimination in the industry the court further determined that the tea21 racial preferences were narrowly tailored to furthering compelling federal governmental interests in this regard the court pointed to several factors first the revised dot regulations explicitly prohibit the use of quotas and require state to meet the maximum feasible portion of its overall goal by using raceneutral means 55 where racial goals are not met the state may yet comply with federal standards by showing good faith efforts to achieve its goals moreover durational limitations imposed by the legislative reauthorization process ensure that congress regularly evaluates whether continuing need exists for the minority preference program the regulation also makes clear that the statutes 10 dbe goal is aspirational only with individual state goals determined by the realities of each states own labor market and the availability locally of qualified minority contractors but these findings did not shield the washington state program from fourteenth amendment challenge because the record was devoid of any evidence suggesting that minorities currently sufferor have ever suffereddiscrimination in the award of transportation infrastructure contracts within washington state judges oscannlain and bea found that the states implementation program is not narrowly tailored to further congress remedial objectives narrowly tailored remedy depends on the absence or presence of discrimination these judges urged and it was not enough simply that the state complied with the federal programs requirements thus each of the six principal minority groups identified in washingtons dbe program must be shown to have suffered contract award discrimination 54 407 f3d 983 9th cir 2005 cert denied 126 s ct 1332 2006 55 49 cfr 2651a

to impose heavier burden on the federal government for demonstrating strong basis in evidence to support minority contracting preferences in rothe development corporation v us department of defense 56 the trial judge appeared to defer uncritically to congressional evidence and findings to uphold 1207 of the national defense authorization act of 1987 that statute incorporates the sba definition of small disadvantaged business including the racial presumption and establishes 5 participation goal for such entities in department of defense contracts 57 the 1207 program authorizes dod to apply price evaluation adjustment of 10 in order to attain the 5 goal in effect this means that dod may raise the bids of nondbes by 10 in order to give disadvantaged entrepreneurs preference the statutory goalsetting provision in 1207 was reauthorized in 1989 and again in 1992 and 2003 because dod efforts in the initial years fell short of meeting the 5 goal nonminority bidder in rothe sued dod and the department of the air force for violating its equal protection rights in awarding contract to higher bidder international computer and telecommunications inc because of the race of its owner who was of korean descent the us court of appeals for the federal circuit rejected what it viewed as the deferential standard of review applied by the district court and vacated the judgment in so doing it advanced different conception of both the constitutional basis for congresss enactment of 1207 and the degree of scrutiny demanded as national legislature it said congress could enact racebased programs as condition to the exercise of its article i spending powers or pursuant to 5 of the fourteenth amendment as remedy for lingering discrimination by state and local governments whatever deference may be owed to congressional remedies for state equal protection violations under 5 when legislating racial preferences in federal spending programs congress is restricted by the fifth amendment which incorporates its own equal protection component strict scrutiny is single standard and it must be followed here said the appeals court the proper judicial inquiry was whether strong basis in evidence supported congresss conclusion that discrimination existed and remedial action was warranted mere listing of evidence before congress when it enacted the original statute in 1987 was insufficient the federal circuit warned rather detailed statistical information regarding the existence of discrimination in 1992 was necessary to find the reauthorized 1207 constitutional moreover the government must produce evidence of preenactment discrimination reports generated after the statute was enacted showing discrimination against specific groups cannot be used to prove the constitutionality of the program when enacted the strong basis in evidence must have existed at the time the law was enacted if it is to survive strict scrutiny in remanding for further proceedings the appeals court confirmed that when it comes to racebased federal programs there is only one kind of strict scrutiny 58 56 262 f3d 1306 fedcir 2001 57 10 usc 2323 58 the appellate opinion underscored certain additional elements for the lower courts review on remand in determining whether compelling government interest justif ied the sdb program the lower court must decide if the 1207 program is truly remedial this requires determination whether the program targets present discrimination or the lingering effects of past discrimination if the latter the opinion notes the probative currency of the evidence must be determined as must the existence of specific evidence of discrimination against asian americans in the particular industry involved in this case as to whether the 1207 program is narrowly tailored the federal circuit highlighted three areas for remand consideration first the trial court should conduct probing analysis of the efficacy of raceneutral alternatives to the 1207 program sec ond the court must review evidence demonstrating whether the 5 goal of sdb participation was relevant to the number of qualified willing and able sdbs in the industry finally the lower court had to determine whether the 1207 program was overinclusive by presuming that the five groups continued

challenge to 2323 as applied in 1998 when the case was filed and broader challenge to the statute on its face59 this required it to analyze both the circumstances known to congress when the statute was reauthorized in 1992 and later when the statute was reauthorized in 2003 the evidence purporting to justify the earlier claim was viewed to be anecdotal and did not demonstrate strong basis for congress to believe that race based remedial program was necessary because of the lack of statistical evidence of discrimination despite congressional testimony and findings of racial bias in the private and public sectors affecting the award of defense contracts this evidence lacked statistical focus on discrimination against asian americans the racial classification of the company awarded the contract instead of rothe and the particular industry involved the court therefore found that the program as reauthorized in 1992 and applied in 1998 was unconstitutional as to rothes claim that 2323 was facially unconstitutional the district court determined that congress had met its burden of demonstrating statistical evidence documenting pervasive discrimination when it reauthorized the program in 2003 specifically it found that 59 statistical studies from across the nation succinctly demons trate that congress was reacting with strong basis in evidence the court focused on evidence regarding all minority groupsrather than simply asian american as in the prior asapplied portion of its opinionbecause proof that program can be constitutionally applied in any one set of circumstances will sustain the statute from facial challenge it therefore held that 2323 as reauthorized in 2003 was constitutional and denied rothe any prospective relief likewise courts have considered challenges to sba s 8a program for socially and economically disadvantaged businesses while upholding the constitutionality of the 8a program on its face the district court in cortez iii service corporation v nasa required federal officials to decide whether there has been histor of discrimination in the particular industry at issue before applying racebased setaside 60 other courts

enterprises in the relevant geographic market there was moreover evidence of discrimination in any aspect of city contracting as to certain groupsie orientals indians eskimos and aleutswho nonetheless were granted preference under the plan with respect to narrow tailoring the 30 quota was deemed too inflexibleand had been implemented by the city without any prior consideration of race neutral alternatives finally the waiver built into the richmond plan was too rigid because it focused solely on minority contractor availability with inquiry into whether or not the particular mbe seeking racial preference has suffered from the effects of past discrimination by the city or prime contractors the heightened standards of proof articulated by croson and further developed by adarand led many states counties and municipalities to reevaluate existing minority business enterprise programs judicial challenges followed and while several raceconscious programs survived 63 many others were less successful either because they lacked compelling remedial justification or were not sufficiently narrowly tailored to withstand strict judicial scrutiny as to the former local jurisdictions primarily sought to establish strong basis in evidence with disparity studies depicting the extent of minority exclusion from public contracting activity within the jurisdiction coupled with any available anecdotal evidence after the courts 1995 adarand decision such studies were generally poorly received in the courts almost universally cited as the basis for judicial rejection of such statistical proof was overreliance by the governmental unit on general or undifferentiated population data that failed to adequately reflect minority contractor availability or to account for contractor size and other factors relevant to contractor qualifications 64 other major faults have been failure to narrowly tailor the remedywhether minority participation goal preference setaside or other sheltered bidding arrangementto any disparities revealed by statistics and anecdotal proof of discrimination 65 the failure to properly limit the program in scope and duration66 the absence of

bonding and credit assistance programs to ameliorate minority underutilization68 the courts however have yet to resolve several important issues as noted the first relates to whether different factfinding standards pertain to independent state or local minority contracting initiatives than to state plans explicitly adopted in aid of enforcing federal law notwithstanding croson decisions by three different circuit courts suggest that independent findings may be required to established compelling governmental interest where the state agency acts not on its own authority but pursuant to federal manda requiring remedial state or local action to counteract the effects of past or present discrimination on federally funded projects compelling government interest looks at statute or government program on its face when the program is federal the inquiry is at least usually national in scope if congress or the federal agency acted for proper purpose and with strong basis in the evidence the program has the requisite compelling government interest nationwide even if the evidence did not come from or apply to every state or locale in the nation 69 the principle here seems to be that the evidentiary record compiled by congress to find compelling interest for the federal program provides the factual leverage necessary to sustain supporting action at the state and local level likewise in western state paving co v washington dot the ninth circuit reviewed as applied challenges to state programs mandated by federal law70 as discussed earlier the court followed the eighth circuit in finding the 10 dbe setaside of federal transportation funds under tea21 facially constitutional71 but even if washington demonstrates compliance with tea21 and its implementing regulations it must separately meet strict scrutiny to survive an as applied challenge thus the majority found that while the state does not have to reestablish compelling state interest it still has to show that is program is narrowly tailored that in turn depends upon the presence or absence or discrimination in the states transportation contracting industry washington admitted that statistical studies were done to establish the existence of discrimination in the highway contracting industry what arguments the state did make regarding discriminationbased on estimates of minority contractor participation in state transportation contractingwere rejected the court concluded that those percentages proved little because they failed to account for factors affecting the capacity of minority contractors to undertake continued goals on contractbycontract basis and through the maintenance of waiver provision to account for those situations in which achievement of the set dbe goals is not reasonably possible 68 see eg contractors assn of eastern pennsylvania 91 f3d 586 associated gen contractors of ohio 214 f3d 730 concrete works of colorado v city and county of denver 86 f supp 2d

experienced or concentrated in particular part of the state moreover the court observed that historical minority participation on contracts with affirmative action components does not provide any evidence of discrimination against dbes in raceneutral market washington also lacked anecdotal evidence of discrimination which could not be inferred from statistics alone finally even when discrimination is present within state remedial program is narrowly tailored if its application is limited to those minority groups that have actually suffered discrimination72 in more recent ruling northern contracting inc v state of illinois 73 the seventh circuit reached result similar to the ninth circuits ruling in western states paving in affirming the district court the seventh circuit considered the question of whether the federal governments interest in remedying discrimination in highway c ontracting provided sufficient justification for the state to engage in federally mandated dbe program and concluded that it did as result the only question that remained was whether the state highway contracting program was narrowly tailored to achieve this compelling interest after reviewing the statistical evidence and evaluating the states compliance with federal regu lations the court determined that the states program was narrowly tailored and therefore passed constitutional muster by contrast more restrictive evidentiary approach is represented by different seventh circuit ruling in builders association of greater chicago v county of cook 74 case that involved locally adopted minority contracting program rather than federal program the court there held that cook county had failed to establish compel ling interest supporting its contract setaside program in defense of its program the county presented anecdotal evidence that prime contractors failed to solicit minority and womenowned subcontractors at the same rate as similarly situated firms owned by white males in addition the county put forward statistical data demonstrating that number of firms rarely or never solicit minority or womenowned firms for subcontract work this evidence however failed to persuade the court of systematic refusal to solicit such firms for subcontract work because it was based on the practice of mere thirteen general contractors in affirming the decision the appeals court also noted that the program failed to link its setaside levels 30 minorities 10 women to evidence of their availability on the relevant market western states paving and related cases may have important implications for future challenges against both state and federal affirmative action programs under the ninth circuits rationale while federal programs may be insulated by appropriate congressional factfinding state affirmative action in furtherance thereof must be supported by proof of discrimination on statebystate basis moreover even federal programs could fall under question as the statistical foundation for their enactment becomes strained by the passage of time perhaps necessitating renewed evidentiary justification meanwhile usdot has issued guidance concerning the

since croson is whether postenactment evidence of discrimination is sufficient to justify minority setasides and preferences76 in 1996 the supreme court in shaw v hunt ruled that in the context of racial gerrymandering legislature must have sufficient evidence to support racial distinction before it embarks on an affirmative action program77 shaw demanded strong basis in evidence for racebased governmental action which has been interpreted by the federal circuit to mean that the quantum of evidence that is ultimately necessary to uphold racial classifications must have actually been before the legislature at the time of enactment 78 in this view proof that the legislature had constitutionally permissible intent requires strong preenactment evidence but the tenth circuit decision in adarand iii allowed consideration of postenactment evidence in addition to congressional findings because the defendants had gathered it in response to the supreme courts application of strict scrutiny to the statutes in question 79 the supreme court recently chose not to address this and other issues when it declined an appeal from the tenth circuit ruling in concrete works of colorado inc v city and county of denver80 in concrete works the federal circuit court examined city ordinance establishing goals for participation in the construction industry by minority and femaleowned businesses in 1990 the denver city council passed ordinance 513 to pr omote participation by minorityowned business enterprises mbes and womenowned business enterprises wbes in public work projects to an extent approximating their availability and capacity the city determined availability and capacity by conducting periodic studies of minority participation in each contract area the ordinance also directed the office of ct compliance occ to establish mbe and wbe participation goals on each individual city contract the statutory goals for total annual expenditures were 16 for mbes and 12 for wb according to the ordinance if the occ established an individual project goal all bidders had to either meet the goals or demonstrate their good faith efforts to do so the city revised the program in 1996 and 1998 reducing the annual goals for mbes and wbes in construction contracts to 10 and prohibiting mwbes from counting selfperformed work towards the goals concrete works of colorado construction firm owned by white male sued the city in 1992 alleging that it had been denied three contracts for failure to meet the goals or to make good faith efforts and sought injunctive relief and money damages the city relied on three categories of evidence to demonstrate compelling remedial purpose for the ordinance first major studies in 1990 1995 and 1997revealed large disparities between mwbe availability and utilization on city projects without goals census data revealed like patterns of minority and female underutilization as contractors and subcontractors in statewide construction public and private at trial mwbes also testified to discrimination they confronted in qualifying and bidding on private sector jobs in obtaining capital and credit in dealing with suppliers and of harassment suffered at work sites including physical assaults 76 see eg rothe dev corp v united states dod 262 f3d 1306 fed cir 2001 associ ated gen contrs of ohio inc v drabik 214

the governments statistics and other evidence established remedial justification for racial and gender preferences in public contracting the circuit court adopted an expansive approach finding that irrefutable or definitive proof of the citys own guilty actions was unnecessary where the citys passive participation in marketplace discrimination by its spending practices was shown denvers only burden was to introduce evidence which raised the inference of discriminatory exclusion in the local construction industry an d link its spending to that discrimination denver was under burden to identify any specific practice or policy that resulted in discrimination neither was denver required to demonstrate that the purpose of any such practice or policy was to disadvantage women or minorities to impose such burden on municipality would be tantamount to requiring proof of discrimination and would eviscerate any reliance the municipality could place on statistical studies and anecdotal evidence 81 croson s admonition against relying on mere societal discrimination did not apply the opinion states where evidence of discrimination in the industry targeted by the program is shown whether motivated by an attitude shared by society or unique to the industry is constitutionally irrelevant the trial court was wrong to require denver to show the existence of specific discriminatory policies and that those policies were more than reflection of societal discrimination the trial court also faulted the citys disparity studies in part for failure to control for firm size area of specialization and whether the firm had actually bid on city contracts such factors were thought important because due to their generally smaller size mwbes might lack the requisite experience and qualifications diminishing their availability and capacity to perform on city construction projects the tenth circuit accepted the studies nonetheless reasoning that small firms can expand and contract to meet their bidding opportunities and because size and experience are not race or genderneutral variables mwbe construction firms are generally smaller and less experienced because of discrimination the disparities moreover were not shown to disappear when such variables were controlled for or held constant and taking the number of city bidders into account might distort the picture by including unqualified firms likewise lending discrimination and business formation studies were properly relied on by the city for the strong link they demonstrated between disbursement of public funds and the channeling of those funds due to private discrimination private barriers precluded entry of mwbes into the market at the outset and made impossible fair competition for public contracts by minority firms that did submit bids an appeal from the tenth circuit ruling filed by petitioner concrete works of colorado inc was denied by the supreme court 82 in an unusual move justice scalia was joined by chief justice rehnquist in filing written dissent from the courts refusal to grant c ertiorari the dissenters argued that denvers policy violated the standards of proof required by the courts 1989 decision in croson and invites speculation that case has effectively been overruled according to their view there must be some evidence that discrimination was so pervasive that any minority business would have suffered absent such evidence of pervasive discrimination denvers seeming limitation of the setasides to victims of racial discrimination is sham and the only function of the preferences is to channel fixed percentage of city contracting dollars to firms identified by race in declining review justice scalia opined that his fellow justices had 81 id at 973
