have been reluctant to take in addition many policymakers are concerned over possible conflicts between dci and the european union plan to field an alleuropean force background since the collapse of communism in the soviet union and eastern europe the european threat environment has changed dramatically nato longer requires static layered defense of ground forces to repel largescale soviet invasion instead the alliance must address new and different threats for which nato would have far less warning time than conventional assault these might include terrorism the use of weapons of mass destruction proliferation and in some cases ethnic strife as the conflicts from 19921999 in the balkans demonstrated the alliance must be able to prepare for security contingencies requiring the rapid deployment of lighter more mobile forces nato recognized this need for change already in its 1991 new strategic concept1 during natos air war against yugoslavia in the spring of 1999 us aircraft flew

nato and the european union by karen donfried and paul gallis april 25 2000 4 one analyst privately observed that dci appears to be an attempt to bring natos force goals process which is classified into the open in order to make it easier to generate political pressure for increased defense spending another defense expert saw several parallels between dci and the usdeveloped revolution in military affairs see dci responding to the usled revolution in military affairs by elinor sloan nato review vol 48 1 springsummer 2000 p 4 5 some analysts believe the problem is more one of force mobility rather than of munitions and trace the genesis of dci to the natoled operation in bosnia which required rapid deployment of troops to crisis region still other observers point back to the 1991 gulf war which revealed difficulties in interoperabilityparticularly of communicationsa great disparity in defense capabilities between the united states and its allies that disparity along with the transformation of the overall threat environment has prompted the development of two parallel and it is hoped complementary transatlantic security initiatives aimed at among other things bridging the technology gap between american and european forces kosovo motivated european union eu members of nato to accelerate the construction of european pillar within nato called the common european security and defense policy esdp esdp is described as an attempt to achieve greater burdensharing and influence within the alliance one aspect of esdp is the eu effort to create rapid reaction force drawn from their own militaries to undertake petersberg tasks2 in which other countries including the united states might choose not to participate to achieve this the eu member states at their december 1999 helsinki summit set forth headline goals of creating by 2003 60000strong european crisis management force that would be deployable within 2 months and sustainable for 1 year3 the other significant change occurred at the nato washington dc summit in april 1999 when the alliance launched the defense capabilities initiative dci the initiative is intended not only to improve natos ability to fulfill natos traditional article 5 collective defense commitments but also to prepare the alliance to meet emerging security challenges that may require variety of types of missions both within and beyond nato territory to accomplish these tasks the alliance must ensure that its troops have the appropriate equipment supplies transport communications and training4 accordingly dci targets improvement of nato core capabilities in five areas 1 mobility and deployability the alliance seeks to improve its ability to move troops and equipment rapidly to trouble spots including areas outside the immediate region of the alliance nato is currently studying various options for improving troop and equipment transport which involve both multinational cooperation as well as the possible use of commercial means of transportation5 2 sustainability and logistics once nato forces have been dispatched particularly if to location distant from alliance territory they must have

httpwww basicintorgnatorr4htmlogistical support during an extended commitment fresh troops must be rotated into the area the alliance has developed multinational joint logistics center concept to enhance logistics interoperability and cooperation 3 effective engagement nato must be able to engage successfully an adversary in wide range of missions from high to low intensity operations one concrete step envisioned in this area is the procurement of additional precisionguided munitions particularly for the suppression of enemy air defenses 4 survivability during outofarea missions nato troops and equipment cannot make use of existing military infrastructure on nato territories the alliance therefore must be able to provide sufficient force protection through improving air defense reconnaissance and intelligence capabilities it must also be able to counter the possible use of weapons of mass destruction 5 consultation command and control under dci the alliance is developing an enhanced consultation command and control ccc architecture that will emphasize international compatibility of communications and information systems increased multinational cooperation means that ccc systems will need to be interoperable at lower levels in the chain of command6 to oversee and direct dci developments nato formed high level steering group composed of senior officials from member countries and chaired by the alliances deputy secretary general the group meets monthly to review the implementation of the initiative and to plan and coordina dcirelated activities of the nato defense committees as an additional measure to help dci meet its stated goals nato has integrated the initiatives objectives into the alliances regular defense planning process through the force goals that are negotiated with member states every two years7 current issues dci has been criticized in some quarters some observers have questioned the need for the initiative arguing that nato already enjoys vastly superior technological prowess and that the alliances current military capabilitieswhatever their shortcomingsare more than sufficient to meet any threat8 others are skeptical of the possible motives behind dci they contend that given the current security environment massive defense spending increases are unnecessary and wasteful and that dci merely serves to boost sales for

february 8 2001technology arms and equipment manufacturers it has also been suggested that the requirements of dci effectively raise the bar for those countries that are currently hoping to join nato supporters of dci meanwhile have expressed reservations over two major issues the first concerns whether member states particularly the europeans will be willing to commit sufficient funding in their defense budgets to make the changes some of them costly that dci requires the second question is whether esdp will complement or conflict with the initiative allies defense spending to meet the goals of dciand esdpthe europeans intend to restructure and modernize their militaries and address among other things deficiencies in equipment procurement and in their research and development programs all these activities however imply increased defense spending which would require reversal of the trend of the past decade between 1992 and 1999 defense expenditures by european nato countries fell 229 although the united states has also cut back on defense it still spends significantly higher share of gdp on defense than the nato average quoting nato sources the london sunday telegraph reported in march that only the czech republic hungary norway poland portugal and turkey plan to increase military spending in real terms over the next five years10 on the other hand germany which has the secondlargest military in the alliance has drastically reduced its military budget some european member states are eliminating conscription in favor of smaller armies of volunteer forces move that would be costly in the short to mediumterm in addition nato armed forces also are attempting to cope with unanticipated costs such as the air campaign against yugoslavia and peacekeeping in kosovo as well as such factors as higher oil prices the europeans reportedly are seeking additional savings through rationalizing their defense industries and improving their procurement practices some europeans have argued that one of the reasons they have had problems modernizing their militaries arises from us policies including restrictions on the transfer of military technol ogies controls on defenserelated exports and reluctance to co produce equipment at the may 2000 north atlantic council meeting the united states announced its defense trade security initiative intended to address this concern11 because each country wishes to protect its sovereignty by maintaining diversified defense force the sum of european military spending will always buy less defense than similar amount of spending by the united states some have argued that nato would best improve its capabilities if groups of countries combi ned their resources for certainhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20907crs5 12 defense capabilities initiative targets the future by linda kozaryn space daily september 24 1999 13 statement on the defence capabilities initiative issued at the meeting of the north atlantic council in defence ministers session held in brussels on 8 june 2000 nato press release m nacd1200064 june 8 2000projects or if individual countries specialized their defense capabilities in complementary framework nato officials point to the alliances airborne warning and control system program as an example of pooled assets the alliance is also reportedly considering tapping the commonfunded nato security investment program12 nato does not dictate how much member states spend on their militaries nor does it criticize countries that spend far below the alliance average the fact that there was consensus on dci would seem to imply that all recognize the need to boost their defense budgets however some governments reportedly believe that they can satisfy dcis goals simply by restructuring their forces and changing their procurement planswithout spending more most analysts doubt whether any of the goals of dci can be attained without significant increase in defense spending by all member states dci and esdp some policymakers have been questioning whether esdp is working in complementary fashion with dci they suggest that esdp may divert the attention and energies of eu members from improving their individual military capabilities while they address their collective eu project they argue for example that the dispute over the degree of autonomy of esdp from nato can jeopardize political goodwill within the alliance and degrade its military capability as well skeptics also contend that unless esdp focuses sharply on increasing real defense capabilities as specified in the dci targets it will wind up being just another paper institutionone that will need to call upon us military assets in the event of crisis finally analysts note that the esdp headline goals are aimed at providing the european force with the ability to conduct peacekeeping and related missions while the dci objectives are intended to address the full spectrum of potential conflicts they caution that some european governments may tend to regard the esdp headline goals as substitutes for rather than subset of the dci objectives nato officials and representatives are not unaware of the need to reconcile the goals of dci and esdp in june 2000 report the north atlantic council nacthe alliances political decisionmaking body stated that achieving dcis objectives will strengthen european defence capabilities and the european pillar of nato so that european allies will be able to make stronger and more coherent contribution to nato it will also improve their capability to undertake euled operations where the alliance as whole is not engaged the eus headline and capability goals and the objectives arising from dci will be mutually reinforcing in addition the initiative will improve the ability of allied and partner forces to operate together in natoled crisis response operations13 the nac statement which referenced report from the chairman of dcis high level steering group added that there had been progress in several areas outlined in the initiative including strategic transport airtoair refueling precision guided

meeting the dci objectives is likely to vary among member states depending upon where the different countries place the achievement of the initiatives goals within their national securityand thus their national budgetarypriorities the norwegian government for example has virtually embedded dci into its defense plans in poland there has been some concern over the possible high costs of dci but analysts argue that it is in polands national interest for all nato members to develop mobile interoperable forces and that therefore within our financial means we should aim at making our defense potential compatible with the capabilities of other allies14 the turks endorse dci and hope it will enhance efforts to modernize their military president sezer declared that tur key supports natos defense capabilities initiative and wants this initiative to share technology to larger extent within nato15 the french foreign minister meanwhile has argued that dci and esdp are consistent with one another adding that we have ensured compatibility between our eu headline goal commitments and those we have made under the dci16 in january 8 2001 washington post article former defense secretary william cohen described progress on improving nato defense capabilities as less than brisk he pointed out that while the united states has significantly increased its military spending other nato member countries have flatlined or decreased their defense budgets17 on may 10 at nato seminar in barcelona outgoing us ambassador to nato alexander vershbow concluded that rhetoric has far outpaced action when it comes to enhancing capabilities and gave the alliance failing grade he singled out the european allies in particular noting that nonus defense spending had increased far less than would be necessary to accomplish the dci objectives he indicated that current burdensharing arrangements were politically indefensible for the united states and linked future us support for esdp with improvements in european capabilities18 congress placed provision section 1039 in the fy2000 defense authorization act pl 10665 requiring the secretary of defense to report annually to congress on the implementation of dci and the progress that the alliance and individual allies are making toward the attainment of each of the dci goals in addition on november 8 1999 the senate agreed to senate
