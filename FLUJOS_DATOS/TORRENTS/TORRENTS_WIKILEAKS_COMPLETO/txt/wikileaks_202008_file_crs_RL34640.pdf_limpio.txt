stronger measures to control ballast water discharges from vessels which are major pathway for introduction of invasive species into us waters but there are differing views on how best to do that current federal authority to manage ballast water in the nonindigenous aquatic nuisance prevention and control act of 1990 as amended nanpca has been criticized as inadequate several states notably michigan california minnesota oregon and washington have passed or are considering their own ballast water laws creating concern that separate state programs could create patchwork of inconsistent regulatory requirements this concern was part of the rationale for title v of hr 2830 the coast guard reauthorization act of 2007 passed by the us house of representatives on april 24 2008 it would have established strengthened national ballast water management program administered by the coast guard this legislative approach was supported by many in the maritime industry and by number of environmental advocacy groups such as the national wildlife foundation they argued in essence that nationally uniform program providing certainty to the regulated community requiring standards more stringent than existing coast guard or international rules and specifying compliance deadlines is the best legislative approach however hr 2830 was opposed by other advocacy groups such as the natural resources defense council nrdc and several of the stat that have moved forward with their own ballast water programs they contended that the legislation would largely have preempted state efforts and provide slower and less effective approach to controlling ballast water discharges than that of the clean water act evaluating these differing views was complicated by an environmental protection agency epa proposal to control ballast water and other discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels through the mechanism of clean water act permit epa finalized this permit in december

disturbances and costs national attention was drawn to the invasive species problem with the arrival of zebra mussels in the great lakes in the late 1980s since then virtually all coastal and great lakes states have experienced ecological change and loss from zebra mussels and other aquatic nuisance species1 ballast water has been identified as major pathway for introduction of ans ships use large amounts of ballast water to stabilize the vessel during transport ballast water is often taken on in the coastal waters in one region after ships discharge wastewater or unload cargo and then discharged at the next port of call wherever more cargo is loaded which reduces the need for compensating ballast thus the practice of taking on and discharging ballast water is essential to the proper functioning of ships because the water that is taken in or discharged compensates for changes in the ships weight as cargo is loaded or unloaded and as fuel and supplies are consumed however ballast water discharge typically contains variety of biological materials including nonnative nuisance exotic species that can alter aquatic ecosystems federal authority to address ballast water concerns in the united states is contained in the nonindigenous aquatic nuisance prevention an d control act of 1990 nanpca as amended by the national invasive species act of 1996 nis and is administered by the us coast guard together these laws initially required program to prevent the introduction and spread of ans into the great lakes by managing vessel ballast water discharges and subsequently extended the great lakes program to all us ports and waters the current national ballast management program pursuant to these laws directs all ships that have operated outside the us exclusive economic zone to undertake high seas ie midocean ballast exchange before entering us waters however ballast water exchange is believed to be only partially effective and is often not carried out due to safety considerations the current federal program has been criticized as inadequate including criticism of the coast guard for delays in implementing necessary rules 2 today there is wide agreement on the need for stronger measures to control ballast water discharges but there are differing views on how best to do that several states notably michigan california minnesota oregon and washington have passed or are considering their own ballast water laws raising concern that separate state programs could create patchwork of inconsistent regulatory requirements this concern was part

more information see crs report rl32344 ballast water management to combat invasive species by eugene h buck 2 ibid 3 ballast water management also was the subject of s 1578 reported by the senate commerce science and transportation committee in march 2008 srept 110269 the provisions of that legislation were similar but not identical to title v of hr 2830 they are not discussed in this report because discussion among interested parties during the 110 th congress primarily focused on hr 2830 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34640g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g146g151g144g561g4

management requirements for us and foreign vessels that carry ballast water and use ports or places in waters subject to us jurisdiction it would have strengthened the existing provisions of law by amending nanpca section 1101 to require that such vessels have ballast water management plan maintain record books comply with ballast water exchange re quirements and comply with ballast water treatment requirements the last of these is the central feature of the legislative proposal under the legislation as passed by the house vessels that enter drydock 6 between january 1 2009 and december 31 2011 would have to meet ballast water treatment standards for living organisms specified in the international maritime organizations imos 2004 international convention for the control and management of ships ballast water and sediment see column 2 of table 1 further all vessels subject to the legislation would have to meet specific performance standards contained in the legislatio n during the first drydocking after december 31 2011 but later than december 31 2013 after that date these statutory standards see column 3 of table 1 would apply to all ships subject to the law whether or not they have drydocked for needed repairs or construction by then the statutory standards were modeled after but are 100 times more stringent than the imo standards 4 large number of national and regional environmental groups supported hr 2830 including the union of concerned scientists great lakes united national audu bon society defenders of wildlife natural areas association healing our

required to install any treatment technology until the coast guard approves and certifies it even technology to meet the imos minimal standards by january 1 2010 the coast guard and epa would be required to complete feasibility review of the statutory standards to determine whether appropriate technologies are available for compliance one or more 24month delays may be granted if technology is not available at the same time the coast guard and epa are required to revise the statutory standards sooner to be more stringent if technology is available under hr 2830 as passed by the house vessels would have been allowed to continue using technologies that comply with whichever of these standards applies to them for 10 years thus if vessel begins using systems to meet the less stringent imo standards by december 31 2011 it could use that technology for 10 years and not be required to meet alternative more stringent statutory standards before december 31 2021 similarly vessel using innovative ballast water treatment technology approved by the coast guard would have 10year grace period allowing use of that technology in lieu of meeting the statutory standards existing ballast water requirements that apply to vessels operating solely in great lakes waters called lakers call for midocean exchange of ballast before ships first enter the lakes the statutory standards in hr 2830 would not have applied to vessels operating exclusively there unless the coast guard and epa were to so require because it is assumed that lakers do not transport invasive species however critics pointed out that lakers can spread invasive species among the great lakes through contaminated ballast water that is taken on in the lakes and transported between great lakes ports under hr 2830 the coast guard and epa would have been directed to review the statutory standards every three years beginning in december 2012 and revise them as necessary title v

programs was one of the key issues in dispute between supporters and critics of hr 2830 under current law within the framework of the ballast water management program now implemented by the coast guard state and local programs to control ans are permitted 7 this general nonpreemption has allowed states like michigan california and others to develop ballast water management programs with performance standards or technology requirements that are more comprehensive than the coast guards rules require hr 2830 as passed by the house envisioned program that would be implemented by federal agencies principally the coast guard and epa the intention was to establish nationally uniform requirements that would protect all us waters from ballast water discharges of ans replacing the minimal coast guard rules and handful of state laws that are more protective of those states waters but not all waters under h r 2830 states could apply to the coast guard for approval to administer their own inspection and enforcement authority for ballast water discharges to determine vessel compliance with the federal laws requirements otherwise the role of states under the legislations ballast water treatment provisions was limited8 hr 2830 would not have altered the general non preemption provision described above that was enacted in 1990 but it would have added new language specifically preempting states or localities from adopting alternative or more stringent treatment requirements or ballast water exchange requirements that are inconsistent with or that conflict with the requirements in the legislation concerning ballast water exchange and performance standards new nanpca section 1101q titled preemption however states could impose greater fines or penalties for violations of the federal law and could adopt alternative incentive programs to encourage rapid adoption of ballast water treatment technology also any more stringent standard under federal state or local law concerning land or waterbased facilities to receive ballast water would not have been preempted the key element of the preemption provision in hr 2830 as passed by the house stated that as of january 1 2012 the legislations requirements concerning ballast water exchange and standards would supersede any provision of state or local law that is inconsistent with or conflicts with nanpca as amended or regulations specifically state rules requiring ballast water treatment that were in effect on january 1 2007 such as michigans could continue until january 1 2012 but after that date the preemption in hr 2830 presumably would take effect barring the states program if it is inconsistent with or in conflict with the statute questions of inconsistency could be germane to the regulatory approach in michigans program enacted in 2005 state legislation because it differs from that in hr 2830 the michigan program requires vessels to use one of four specified types of ballast treatment technology rather than numeric 7 16 usc 4725 8 under the legislation states could identify list of vessels that pose relatively high risk of introducing ans in their waters and they could consult with the coast guard about ex empting certain vessels from performance standards if the risk of introducing ans is considered insignificant

that requires ships entering california ports to treat ballast water to meet specific performance standards beginning january 1 2009 the performance standards adopted by the california state lands commission in response to this law also are modeled after but are more stringent than the imo ballast water convention standards they are shown in column 4 of table 1 the california standards are 1000 times more stringent than the imo standards that would initially have applied under hr 2830 as passed and they also are more stringent than the statutory numeric standards in the bill in certain respects ie california prohibits discharge of detectable living organisms greater than 50 micrometers in size because californias standards were not in effect on january 1 2007 enactment of hr 2830 as passed by the house apparently would have preempted them even in the interim before january 1 2012 hr 2830 as passed by the house was support ed by the maritime industry and number of environmental advocacy groups such as the national wildlife federation see footnote 4 who argued in essence that nationally uniform program providing certainty to the regulated community requiring standards more stringent than existing coast guard or international rules and specifying compliance deadlines is the best approach during house consideration of hr 2830 californ ia state officials proposed that the bill be amended to change the january 1 2007 grandfathering date to january 1 2009 and to allow the coast guard to delay the january 1 2012 date they also proposed that the numeric standards in the legislation be made consistent with and as stringent as californias regulatory standards see column 4 of table 1 thus californias existing standards could remain in effect until january 1 2012 and then would apply nationally after that date california officials also proposed that the bill be amended to allow states to impose fees on vessels in order to implement state ballast water management programs none of these proposals was adopted but there reportedly was subsequent discussion among legislators about these and other issues in order to overcome opposition to the bill however environmental groups that opposed housepassed hr 2830 contended that the proposed changes were relatively minor and did not overcome serious deficiencies in the bill namely that the legisl ation largely would preempt state efforts could override cwa authorities and would have provided slower and less effective approach to controlling ballast water discharges than that of the cwa 9

g348g561preemption provision also opposing federal preemption were nrdc and some other environmental advocacy groups see footnote 5 preemption of state programs was one of the reasons why critics of hr 2830 would have preferred addressing ballast water treatment through an alternative approach specifically the clean water act as discussed below epa has authority under the cwa to address ballast water discharges but it had declined to do so the cwa is administered by epa not the coast guard and it has aspects that differ from hr 2830 first cwa section 510 allows states to adopt standards more stringent than federal rules which hr 2830 likely would have prohibited10 the language in cwa section 510 provides that states may adopt discharge effluent limitation or other requirements so long as they are not less stringent than federal requirement under the cwa this provision is arguably more generous than hr 2830 which would have allowed state or local law that is not inconsistent with or does not conflict with the federal law under the cwa federal requirements are the floor while under hr 2830 federal requirements arguably would be the ceiling for state law second under cwa section 505 wide range of entities may bring citizen suits in federal court against the administrator of epa for failure to carry out nondiscretionary duty under the act they also may bring citizen suit in us district court against persons who violate prescribed effluent standard or limitation by comparison hr 2830 as passed would have provided that citizens may petition the coast guard to take an enforcement action and if the coast guard fails to do so can sue in federal court to require the coast guard to take the actions required under the law critics of the legislation argued that this was more restrictive and cumbersome enforcement approach than the citizen suit provision of the cwa third the critics of hr 2830 argued it would be preferable that epa have responsibility for dealing with vessel discharge issues including ballast water management because epas primary mission is to protect public health and welfare according to this view the coast guard which has multiple missions has shown insufficient interest in pollution control generally and ballast water management specifically under the cwa epa could for example issue scientifically based national performance standards called effluent limitation guidelines requiring minimum level of treatment or pollution control to assure protection of public health and the environment cwa performance standards are implemented through discharge permits which are issued by epa or an authorized state for fiveyear terms and must be renewed thereafter permit issuance requires opportunities for public participation opponents of hr 2830 noted that epa could use the cwa authority to promulgate stringent ballast water management standards with uniform minimum treatment standards based on technology on the other hand the legislations supporters contended that while the cwas permitbased approach works well for industrial plants and other fixed stationary dischargers it would not work well for mobile sources such as vessels particularly if stateissued permits were to call for requirements that could vary from one location to another the federal courts have held that epa already could have promulgated effluent limitation guidelines for ballast water and other vessel discharges the clean water act prohibits the discharge of pollutants from point source into the navigable waters of the united states without 10 hr 2830 did not prohibit more stringent state standards in so many words rather it would have prohibited state or local law that is inconsistent with or conflicts with the federal law it is not foregone legal conclusion that state standard more stringent than its federal counterpart is inconsistent with or conflicts with the federal law

not including sewage vessel discharges which are regulated under cwa section 312 from cwa permitting requirements this longstanding regulation was challenged in federal district court by environmental advocacy groups who wanted epa to address ballast water as source of ans in 2005 the court found that congress had directly expressed its intention that discharges from vessels be regulated under the cwa and that the regulation at issue contradicted that intention in september 2006 the court issued final order vacating revoking the regulatory exclusion as of september 30 2008 the ninth circuit us court of appeals upheld the district courts ruling on july 23 2008 11 on june 17 while waiting for the court of appeals or congress to provide relief from the district courts order epa proposed two cwa general permits in order to respond to the court one applicable to commercial vessels and one applicable to small recreational vessels 12 general permit covers multiple facilities within specific category for specific period of time not to exceed five years after which it expires categories covered by general permits have common elements such as similar types of operations that discharge the same types of wastes because of the large number of potential sources of vessels epa believed that it made administrative sense to use general permits rather than individual permits on august 31 the federal district court agreed to epa s request to delay vacatur of the regulatory exemption until december 19 2008 to ensure that permits could be issued before the exemption is eliminated epa finalized vessel general permit for vessels subject to permit requirement on december 18 the permit became effective on december 19 2008 however on the same day the federal district court granted an epa motion to delay vacatur of the existing exclusion in 40 cfr 1223a until february 6 2009 thus the effective date remains december 19 but regulated sources need not comply with terms of the permit

prescribes technologybased effluent limits for 26 effluent streams or discharge types including ballast water discharges the only available evidence of how epa would approach ballast water management under its cwa authority is reflected in this permit its ballast water requirements are minimal largely requiring what current coast guard rules require 14 like hr 2830 the vgp mandates midocean ballast water exchange for ships traveling outside the 200nauticalmile exclusive economic zone eez of the united states this requirement already applies under the coast guards 2004 mandatory ballast water management rule codified at 33 cfr part 151 epa s vgp also requires ballast water exchanges at least 50 nautical miles from shore for vessels engaged in pacific nearshore voyages which are not covered by the coast guards mandatory exchange procedures further like hr 2830 the vgp requires vessels that declare they have ballast on board either to seal the ballast tanks to prevent any discharge or to carry out saltwater flushing like hr 2830 the vgp includes requirements that vessels maintain log book and records of ballast water management and submit reports of noncompliance to epa annually hr 2830 would have required that reports be submitted monthly to the coast guard vessels would be required to comply with these requirements upon the effective date of the permit as noted above the effective date of the permit was december 18 but on that date the district court agreed to epas request to delay the vacatur of the existing regulatory exclusion until february 6 2009 significantly unlike hr 2830 the vgp does not include numeric limits on living organisms or pathogenic discharges some environmental groups have advocated that epa issue such standards epa explained this position in fact sheet accompanying the vgp 15 epa is not requiring any numeric treatment standards for the discharge of living organisms as part of this permit issuance and is instead requiring management practices eg ballast water exchange that decrease the risk of ans introduction epa is proposing this approach because treatment technologies that effectivel reduce viable living organisms in manner that is safe reliable and demonstrated to work onboard vessels are not yet commercially available requiring numeric effluent limit for the discharge of living organisms is not practicable achievable or available at this time epa will consider establishing treatment requirements in the next generation of permits ie sooner than 2013 that will provide for compliance with treatment standards that will be expressed as units of living or viable organisms per unit of volume in ballast water discharge continued 29 2008 14 separately under cwa section 312n epa and the navy are

standards which are unlikely to come into force for some time or even with californias more stringent standards the vgp includes special enforcement provisions but would use existing provisions of the cwa that act authorizes administrative civil and judicial civil and criminal enforcement of the law including permit violations in addition as noted above persons may bring citizen suit in us district court against persons who violate prescribed effluent standard or limitation proponents of hr 2830 pointed out that cwa citizen suits would be limited to demonstrating noncompliance with the minimal provisions of the vgp some of the groups that were critical of hr 2830 took the position that the vgp is good first step toward regulating ballast water discharges through the cwa but in comments submitted to epa they recommended improvements in number of areas 16 as previously described cwa section 505 allows individuals to bring cwa citizen suits against the administrator of epa for failure to carry out nondiscretionary duty under the act following issuance of the vgp in december 2008 some of the same environmental advocacy groups that originally challenged epa for not addressing ballast water as source of ans brought suit in federal court asserting that the ballast water provisions of the permit fail to meet federal requirements because it allows ships to discharge untreated ballast water containing invasive species 17 g5g152g151g140g149g158g141g146g151g144g561g22g145g152g158g144g145g157g156g561 two existing provisions of nanpca expressly state that regulations governing ballast

any provision of state or local law this is inconsistent with or conflicts with the legislations requirements concerning ballast exchange and treatment standardswould also have preempted inconsistent or conflicting state water quality standards some who favored hr 2830 as passed by the house contended that if the legislation were enacted arguably it would not bar epa from using cwa authority to address ballast water dischargesat least in way not inconsistent with nanpca as it would be amended by hr 2830 the specific preemption language in the bill described above addressed state or local laws that are inconsistent with hr 2830 it did not address potentially separate federal requirements under other authority which could raise different question of reconciling overlapping federal statutes first hr 2830 did not explicitly prohibit epa from finalizing the draft vgp for vessels that do not benefit from the twoyear moratorium in pl 110299 second hr 2830 did not explicitly prohibit epa from including ballast wa ter requirements for the exempted vessels eg commercial fishing vessels in the vgp after the twoyear moratorium expires as noted the ballast water requirements in the vgp are minimal but hr 2830 did not expressly prohibit epa from reissuing the vgp later with more stringent requirements or from taking other actions that epa determines are appropriate and third hr 2830which focused on harmful living microorganisms and sediment in ballast waterdid not explicitly prohibit epa from addressing other contaminants that could be present in the discharge eg toxic chemicals oil or particulates that were found in the waters where the ballast was brought on board however uncertainty about these points was central to the debate about the legislation critics of hr 2830 asserted that by superseding nanpcas existing savings clause the legislation could be read as limiting the application of the cwa to invasive species in ballast water discharge if it were read in that manner they contended it woul d backtrack from longstanding provisions of law previously adopted by congress in nanpca and nisa thus weakening existing law from their perspective the result could exclude states and the public from participating in most regulatory decisions place environmental decisions in the hands of the coast guard rather than epa preclude epa and citizen enforcement actions under the cwa and freeze development of improved technologybased treatment standards 20 finally it should be noted that the federal courts order that epa must regulate discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels discussed previously continues to apply even if hr 2830 or other similar ballast water legislation had been enacted21 thus except for categories of vessels exempted or covered by temporary delay pursuant to congressional action eg pl 110288 and pl 110299 even if similar legislation were to be enacted in the future epa still is required to regulate vessel discharges such as deck runoff oily bilge water releases and graywater laundry and sink wastewater discharges 20 henry henderson program director natural resources defense council midwest office et letter to
