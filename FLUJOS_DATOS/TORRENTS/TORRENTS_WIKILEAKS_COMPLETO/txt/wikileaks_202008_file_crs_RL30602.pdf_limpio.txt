2000 mark jickling specialist in public finance government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30602the electronic stock market summary stock markets exist to funnel capital from investors to the businesses that can best use it to create jobs and national wealth the process is run by intermediaries who extract payments from users and suppliers of capital in exchange for services that make the market more efficient for both central marketplace with standardized procedures offers savings to investors and corporat ions who in its absence would expend considerable resources searching for each other and negotiating terms the us stock market has experienced marvelous 18year bull run which has brought great wealth to both investors and market professionals despite this prosperity however there is widespread uncertainty and anxiety about the future of the intermediaries who currently make up the market new electronic technology in the form of cheap computers and communications and above all the internet is driving trading costs down to levels unimaginable few years ago technology has the potential to cut out the middleman altogether in some situations one can be sure that even giant institutions like the new york stock exchange will survive the next 10 years why should this be of concern to legislators and regulators perceived problems with the markets current structure and direction fall under the umbrella term market fragmentation one aspect of technological change has been the emergence of multiple venues for trading stocks rather than single marketplace to some market observers and participants this fragmentation is good thing sign of innovation and competitio n others however believe that the dispersal of trading has negative consequences they are concerned that price competition may be inhibited so that investors pay more than they should further some believe that the logical end of the computerization of stock trading is single 24hour global stock exchange in the absence of centralized us market such market may be more likely to emerge in europe or asia in response to these issues the securities and exchange commission sec is considering new regulations that would significantly alter present trading practices and market structures several private sector initiatives recently put forward would be less radical some proposals would create central facility for the display and execution of orders to buy and sell stock opponents of this idea argue that such facility would be obsolete before it could be built and that it would stifle future innovation and competition another view is that while longterm market dynamics may favor central marketplace it should be allowed to develop without government direction congress held seven hearings on the future of the stock market during the first half of 2000 any new sec rules will be carefully scrutinized this report provides background against which the competing proposals and

sagging market investment dealers digest june 19 2000 p 1the electronic stock market electronic technology is nothing new on wall street automation has been top priority in the stock market since the late 1960s when the new york stock exchange nyse nearly choked on its paperwork the automation process accelerated after 1975 when congress outlawed fixed brokerage commissions and established as statutory goal national market system to be achieved by electronic linkages among the various stock markets1 in those days automation meant mainframe computers and private communications lines both of which were expensive as result the principal beneficiaries of the first wave of electronic technology and deregulation were 1 large institutional investors whose dominance was assumed to be permanent feature of the market by the mid1980s and 2 the brokerage business many of whose member firms expanded from hereditary partnerships into diversified multinational corporations the current technological revolution in the stock market by contrast is based on relatively cheap telecommunications and computing power and the internet the focus has shifted to individual investors who include nearly half of all american households2 individuals have gained access to the market on terms until recently available only to institutions and professional traders data on stock prices and trading volume brokerage research on companies and industries and company financial statements filed with the securities and exchange commission sec are available instantly over the internet about 15 million us investors have online brokerage accounts which may link them to automatic transaction systems where their trades can be completed in seconds competition among some 150 online brokers has cut commissions for small investors to levels once enjoyed only by pension funds and other large institutional investors with the market power to negotiate deep discounts3 trades that few years ago cost say 90 can be done for 15 while several firms have begun to offer free trades with fewer and fewer strings attached day trading firms provide daredevil investors with direct connection to the markets execution systems where they can literally buy and sell with the click of mouse and compete toetotoe with traders from morgan stanley and goldman sachs the reemergence of the individual investor has

securities industry hit an all time record of 183 billion in 1999 almost double the 1995 figure wages paid by brokerage firms also doubled from 30 billion in 1995 to 60 billion in 19994 in these circumstances one would expect to find sense of triumph among us securities market participants or at least degree of selfsatisfaction but the very opposite is the case there is widespread uncertainty and anxiety about the future of the stock market on every side there are proposals and initiatives for major change in market practices and institutions for example nasdaq and the nyse the two largest us stock markets want to change from memberowned organizations structure that in the case of the nyse dates back to the 18th century into forprofit corporations with shares owned by the public the present governance structures are said to be too cumbersome to meet new technologybased competition group of the largest securities firms has proposed central trading facility where orders from all markets would be displayed and could be executed such facility has the potential to reduce the existing exchanges to ordertakers or entry portals to the market the sec published in february 2000 request for comment on six possible regulator changes ranging from requiring disclosure of trading information now considered proprietary to the establishment of centralized order display and transaction facility the house and senate held seven hearings in the winter and spring of 2000 on the theme of the stock market of the future the underlying concern was expressed by senate banking committee chairman gramm we live in world where capital is highly mobile and everyone is acutely aware that it is as easy using laptop computer to trade on the financial exchanges in germany as it is to trade on the new york stock exchange if we want this goose that routinely lays the golden egg to stay in america we have to try to provide an environment that will enhance its staying here5 there is consensus that major regulatory or legislative changes are required such initiatives would be highly contentious matter how carefully designed they would inevitably favor the commercial interests of certain groups over others however the divisions within the securities industry do not follow the usual patternhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30602crs3 6 it is so new that there is standard acronym some

and where asks the guest are the customers yachtsof innovators versus the status quo most expect the status quo to be swept away by technology one is sure how stocks will be traded in 10 years this report provides background against which the competing proposals and visions of the markets future can be evaluated the following sections describe 1 how buyers meet sellers in the major us stock markets 2 how electronic technology is transforming the markets and 3 the proposals for modifications in market structures now being considered by congress regulators and the industry market structure and middlemen investors buying and selling stock generally do not meet directly in the stock market transactions occur through series of intermediaries or middlemen the functions performed by intermediaries and the systems they use to transmit display and execute orders to buy or sell determine the structure of the market the structure of us markets is not homogenous the stock exchanges and the overthe counter market that is nasdaq each accounting for about half of total trading volume employ intermediaries and therefore process transactions in markedly different ways third model of intermediation has emerged in recent years the ecn or electronic communications network6 essentially computer that replicates the basic transaction mechanisms of the traditional markets the main features of these three structures and the characteristics of the major intermediaries are set out below brokers stockbrokers provide innumerable specialized services for their various clients but the most basic thing they offer is access to the market private individual matter how wealthy cannot walk onto the floor of the nyse and begin trading as noted above electronic technology and the internet have greatly changed the terms of access to market data and to the transaction mechanisms themselves especially for small investors as result customers can choose from among many types and levels of brokerage service perhaps more than ever before the interests of brokers and customers can conflict as in any financial agentprincipal relationship the brokers incentive is to enrich himself not necessarily the customer7 customer funds may be misappropriated or deployed in ways that primarily benefit the broker as result the brokerage profession is closely regulated by state and federal law and by industry selfregulationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30602crs4 brokerage regulation is compendious subject but perhaps its central tenet is what is called the duty of best execution which means that the broker must fill the customers order under the best terms reasonably available consequence of the impact of new technology on the market is that brokers may have several alternative venues to execute customer orders each of which can claim to be the best to see how this has evolved it is necessary to look at the next and final layer of intermediation which involves the firms at the heart of the market who complete trades by matching buyers and sellers or who execute customer orders by buying or selling as principals using their own capital the exchange specialists trading on the floor of the new york stock exchange takes place at locations called specialists posts each stock listed on the exchange is assigned specialist whose function is to make market in that stock which means bringing buyers and sellers together and maintaining continuous price quotations the specialist is described as brokers broker part auctioneer part airtraffic controller brokers with customers order in hand to buy or sell particular stock go to the specialist for that stock before automation this meant physically approaching the specialists post today it still may but more often orders are routed through electronic systems figure 1 stock transactions on the new york stock exchange seller broker specialist broker buyer most transactions involve the specialist matching buyer and seller on about 10 of trades however the specialist acts as principal specialists are expected to step in with their own capital when there is temporary imbalance of buying and selling interest to smooth price transitions the monopoly specialist franchise is normally very profitable in 1999 nyse specialis ts earned return on capital of 220 compared to 94 for all nyse member firms not only do all transactions pass through the specialists post but the specialist has significant information advantage over other traders about two thirds of all orders are limit orders orders to buy and sell only at particular specified price the rest are market orders or orders to buy or sell immediately at the going price limit orders are placed with the specialist who holds them until they become marketable until the market price hits the specified limit price only the specialist knows the total buying and selling interest represented by limit orders to trade away from the current market price this knowledge confers market power for example if stocks price is falling the specialist who knows that further drop will trigger large limit orders to buy clearly has much better idea of where the price is likely to go than another trader who only sees the price drop to prevent abuse of the market power inherent in the monopoly franchise and superior information specialists are closely monitored by the exchanges the basichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30602crs5 8 there are an average of about 12 market makers per nasdaq stock but hundreds of firms may make market in the largest most active nasdaq companies 9 the top five specialists make market in 1626 out of the 2730 nyselisted stocksnyse rule is that specialist cannot trade for its own account if there is any other trader willing to make the same transaction at the same price nasdaq market makers on the nasdaq instead of single specialist for each stock there are multiple market makers8 the market makers publish bid and ask quotations the prices at which they are willing to buy or sell which are transmitted electronically to all brokers and market makers in the system there is nasdaq trading floor only network of computer screens displaying quotations market makers income comes from the gap between the bid and ask prices called the spread which of course represents trading cost to investors nasdaq is dealer market the market makers take part in all transactions rather than matching buyers and sellers where the nyse relies on direct regulation the nasdaq model relies on competition among market makers to keep spreads as low as possible and to maintain orderly markets figure 2 stock transactions on the nasdaq market seller broker market makers broker buyer another key difference between the nyse and nasdaq market structures is in the identities of the market making firms nyse specialist firms for the most part specialize in market making and never trade directly with public investors9 nasdaq market makers on the other hand include many of the largest diversified securities firms wall streets household names thus it is common for customers broker to work for the same firm as the market maker who executes the customers order the market maker in this situation fills the order out of its own inventory in effect trading against its own customers the trade is said to be internalized internalization of customers orders is permitted by the sec despite the potential conflict of interest provided that the market maker gives the customer the best price quoted anywhere in the nasdaq system called the national best bid or offer or nbbo even if that price is better than the market makers own currently published quotations dealing on this step up and match basis is common among nasdaq market makers

market fragmentation discussed below see us securities and exchange commission commission request for comment on issues relating to market fragmentation release 3442540 february 23 2000 other consideration such payments for order flow are an important source of income for many discount brokerages including some of the biggest online brokers in converse form of internalization some brokerages have acquired marketmaking firms to capture the dealer spread as well as commission from the same trades nyse rules make internalization rare in that market however this may change because one of the major rules rule 390 which prohibits member firms from executing transactions in nyselisted stock anywhere except on an exchange is set to be repealed in proposing the repeal of rule 390 the nyse asked the sec to make new rule requiring that internalized trades take place only at price better than not just equal to the nbbo the sec approved the repeal in may 200010 but declined to institute the new rule which would have affected all markets not just the nyse11 ecns ecns electronic communications networks also known as atss alternative trading systems are computer systems that collect limit orders and either match them and execute them internally or if match is found route them to an outside market maker for execution figure 3 illustrates the possible outcomes if the trade is passed on to market maker the ecn has operated as an ancillary intermediary if the trade is matched and executed internally however layer of intermediation has been bypassed buyer and seller have met directly without the interposition of dealer unlike specialists and nasdaq market makers ecns do not take positions with their own capital in the market they simply offer transactions facility

computers replace stock exchanges 13 customers who gain access to an ecn through broker will pay commission of course but since the ecns are registered brokers themselves they can and do deal directly with public customers 14 ecns make money by charging fee for access to their systems island the second largest ecn charges 14 cent per share 15 see us securities and exchange commission report pursuant to section 21a of the securities exchange act of 1934 regarding the nasd and the nasdaq market august 6 1996 p 21ecns typically operate with staff of few dozen compared to the thousands employed by nasdaq and the nyse but in terms of transaction capacity they are not far short of the traditional markets the nine ecns now operating handle about 30 of nasdaq volume or about 200000000 shares per day they have much smaller share of nyse volume but this could change with the repeal of rule 390 thus far operational capacity has not been constraint on ecn volume regulation of ecns is work in progress they are regulated by the sec as brokerdeal ers although much broker regulation is clearly irrelevant to them since they do not accept customer funds or act as fiduciaries under regulations adopted in 1998 ecns have the option of registering with the sec as exchanges three have applied for exchange status which has not yet been granted nasdaq and nyse are selfregulators with large market surveillance operations the sec has not yet decided how much of this activity will be required of ecnexchanges alternatively ecns may continue to operate as brokerdealers under regulation ats which subjects them to some of the rules that apply to exchanges as their volume passes certain thresholds reporting of price and volume data rules for fair access to the system approved structures of governance and so on12 ecns offer significant advantages to their customers when bids and offers are matched internally the traders do not pay brokerage commissions13 or dealer spreads trading costs can be dramatically lower than in the traditional markets14 turnaround times can be nearly instantaneous however what has brought ecns into the mainstream of stock trading is not so much these cost and time savings but an sec regulation after mid1990s investigation of pricing practices on the nasdaq the sec concluded that twotiered market was developing where nasdaq market makers used ecns to trade among themselves and with few large institutional investors at prices that were better than the published bid and ask quotations available to public investors15 in 1997 new order handling rules took effect requiring nasdaq market makers to make public any prices they quoted to an ecn the result was that ecn prices became available on the same screens that carried nasdaq market makers quotes the benchmark nbbo national best bid or offer price now includes ecn prices to comply with the order handling rules ecns were integrated into selectnet nasdaqs automatic display and

participation in the itscaes system release 34 42536 march 16 2000addition rule recently approved by the sec will give ecns access to the intermarket trading system that links the exchanges16 whether ecns represent the future of the stock market is open to question to all outward appearances nasdaq and the nyse have performed superbly in recent decades both as vehicles for business capital formation and as venues for the growing volumes of trading generated by the long bull market still it is noteworthy that many of the largest securities firms including retail brokerages specialists and market makers have invested in ecns the pillars of the market appear to be hedging their bets at the least ecns are emblematic of the way that cheap offtheshelf technology can now provide reasonable substitute for the elaborate and expensive market mechanisms that have evolved over time this is the backdrop for the debates underway in congress at the sec and among market participants themselves about the future of the market policy questions the sec is considering range of possible rule changes that would significantly alter the trading arrangements described above private sector proposals from nasdaq and from major securities firms would bring equally significant changes what are the problems these proposals mean to address and what specific solutions are being offered problems with the current market structure several problems in the current system of stock trading come under the umbrella term market fragmentation the market is said to be fragmented by the practice of internalizing customer orders which then never interact with the wider market by brokers who accept payment for routing all their customer orders to single market maker and by the emergence of ecns the effect of all of this is to create several venues for trading the same stocks this fragmentation is not always seen as problem to some it is sign of competition that spurs innovation and produces improvements in technology and services to those who do see it as problem however market fragmentation has two kinds of harmful effects 1 it diminishes effective price competition among market makers and 2 it scatters trading interest among various market centers making the pricesetting mechanism less efficient and making us markets as whole more vulnerable to foreign competition imperfect price competition when brokers accept payment for order flow from market maker the market maker agrees to execute all the brokers orders at the best available price the nbbo even if that price is better than the market makers current quotations how does this harm the customer in market like nasdaq one would normally expecthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30602crs9 17 us securities and exchange commission special study report concerning display of limit orders may 4 2000 23 pmarket makers to compete for order flow by offering the best prices in the form of the narrowest spreads however if substantial number of market makers are ready to match any price offered market maker who posts better quotation will not attract more orders but will simply improve the general market price when this happens of course it is good for investors the problem is that in this environment there is little incentive for any dealer to be the first to offer better price since it will not reap the benefit of increased order flow some believe that restoring true price competition among nasdaq market makers requires that payment for order flow be restricted or banned however defenders of payment for order flow argue that it does not prevent dealers from competing on non price factors such as speed of execution or the quality of their proprietary order handling systems and also that it allows brokers to charge lower commissions initiatives to reduce market fragmentation assume that superior price competition occurs when all customer orders can interact directly rather than when they are captured by competing market centers this implies the superiority of central marketplace in allowing customer orders to drive the pricesetting process this applies particularly to limit orders where customers specify that they are willing to buy or sell at particular price rather than the current market price limit orders allow investors to be price setters rather than price takers as noted above however market makers and specialists can profit from the knowledge of limit orders they hold that are not visible to other traders they have an incentive to keep their limit order books private in 1997 as part of the package of order handling rules that required publicat ion of ecn price quotes the sec required market makers to expose limit orders that improve the market makers bid or ask quote for example if market maker is willing to buy stock at 40 the bid and to sell at 40 14 the ask customer limit order to buy at 40 18 improves the spread the customer in other words is willing to pay more than the market maker for the stock but the market maker will not sell at that price before 1997 the market maker could simply hold on to the limit order until the price of stock rose and the market makers own bid price reached 40 18 if the bid never reached that level the order would not be filled at all under the new rules the limit order to buy has to be made public and someone willing to accept 40 18 could fill the order getting more for the stock than the market maker was then offering if other market makers ask quotes were also 40 14 the limit order would become the nbbo until it was filled the order handling rules require that limit orders that narrow the spread be displayed to the market within 30 seconds of receipt recent sec study found that many market makers often fail to meet that deadline or that they program their automated systems to wait until the 30th second before making displayable limit orders public17 again the longer the market maker holds on to the limit order the more likely it is that prices will move to where it can fill the order itself and profit from the spread the sec calls this private option exercised by the market maker at thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30602crs10 18 as an illustration of liquidity imagine that city ordinance permits the sale of used cars only to people who live on the same block as the seller such market would be characterized by wildly inconsistent prices someone who had wrecked his car but could not afford new one might have to offer quite lot to induce one of his neighbors to part with car on the other hand seller of an identical vehicle might have to go very low to interest any of his neighbors some wouldbe buyers or sellers would find takers at any price once the law is repealed and the newspaper classifieds are again filled with used car listings the market becomes more liquid the market now includes many buyers and sellers and comparison shopping is possible prices for similar cars are likely to be fairly close togethercustomers expense and regards deficiencies in limit order display as failure to meet the duty of best execution several of the market structure proposals discussed specifically below call for improved disclosure of limit orders if limit orders away from the current price quotes were made public traders other than market makers would have better idea of the total buying and selling interest in the market and price setting might become more efficient diminished liquidity another concern relating to market fragmentation is the effect on market liquidity financial markets are said to be liquid when buyers have difficulty finding sellers and when transactions can be expected to occur at close to the last reported price in other words when the appearance of new buyer will not cause prices to rise dramatically or seller cause them to fall18 basic principle of market economics is that the more informed buyers and sellers there are the more efficient the market will be that is the more likely it is that prices set in that market will incorporate all relevant information held by traders in the stock market this means that in the long run capital will be allocated to the most productive users with benefits accruing not only to investors but to the economy at large some view the existence of internalization where single firm encompassing both broker and market maker effectively constitutes an isolated market and the growth of alternative market centers such as ecns as phenom ena that siphon off liquidity from the central market if these markets are setting their own prices their lower volume will make them prone to shortterm volatility when buyers outnumber sellers or vice versa if number of satellite market centers are taking price cues from central market or from each other the concern is that the price setting mechanism will be less robust than if all orders meet in single forum very few would argue that fragmentation of the us stock markets up to now has compromised the price setting process to degree that threatens serious misallocations of capital or dangerous market volatility the concern is about the trend if ecns can win increasing shares of nasdaq and nyse volume and if nyse firms in the postrule 390 market choose to internalize their customer orders rather than send them to the floor of the exchange market fragmentation may begin to have visible economic consequenceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30602crs11 19 testimony of chairman alan greenspan before the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs hearing 106th congress 2nd session april 13 2000however to accept these arguments against fragmentation is not necessarily to endorse government remedy traders have natural preference for liquid markets federal reserve chairman alan greenspan made this point in april before the senate banking committee in the long run unfettered competitive pressures will foster consolidation as liquidity tends to centralize in the system providing the narrowest bidoffer spread at volume two or more venues trading the same security or commodity will naturally converge toward single market one market offering marginally narrower bidask spreads will attract the business of others improving its liquidity further and reducing that of its competitors this in turn will engender an even greater competitive imbalance leading eventually to full consolidation of course this process may not be fully realized if there are impediments to competition or if markets are able to establish and secure niches by competing on factors other than price19 the role of government in this perspective is not to impose particular structure on the markets but to ensure that the eventual outcome is arrived at through true competition the perceived tendency of markets to centralize to deepen liquidity underlies concerns about foreign competition to us markets consolidation of stock and derivatives markets has become common around the world in recent years except in the united states earlier this year the london and frankfurt exchanges europes two largest announced merger wouldnt 24hour market listing the shares of companies from all countries offer the greatest possible liquidity is foreign super market likely to become the main venue for trading us shares the technical barriers to the establishment of such market are relatively minor the legal and regulatory barriers are rapidly falling the main problem in creating viable new market is attracting liquidity from existing markets this may prove very difficult nasdaq and the nyse are now the worlds most liquid stock markets and have indicated willingness to change to meet new competition while ecnlike trading structures have not yet been tested in prolonged bear market or crash still there is doubt that wellregulated foreign market that offered significantly lower transactions costs as well as access to capital on global scale could find favor with us traders and issuers of securities there are other dimensions to the issue of market liquidity structures that ensure liquid markets for highvolume stocks may not do so for less actively traded companies large and small traders have different liquidity requirements national market structured like an ecn where buyers and sellers were matched automatically might provide adequate liquidity for small investors but would it suit the needs of large institutions that sometimes wish to liquidate portfolios worth hundred s of millions of dollars the effect the market impact of the publication of such large sell order might be significant price drops imposing high transaction cost on the institutionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30602crs12 20 dynamic markets timeless principles remarks by chairman arthur levitt at columbia law school september 23 1999 21 see note 9 on p 6 abovethe nyse was confronted by this problem decades ago as institutional trades grew too large for the trading crowd on the floor to handle the solution was the emergence of upstairs trading where brokers known as block positioners find an opposite party before the order is sent to the floor for execution as sec chairman arthur levitt put it in 1999 speech for online investors brokers are conduits to markets for institutions they are prospectors for liquidity20 the point is that different market participants have different uses for market structures and intermediaries proposed modifications to market structure the secs market fragmentation release in its february 2000 concept release21 the sec set out for public comment six possible approaches to the issues discussed in this report none of the six has been formally proposed yet although the comment period has expired the six sec proposals were as follows require greater disclos ure by market centers and brokers concerning trade executions and order routing if such information were available from all brokers customers and regulators could evaluate how well their orders fared when they were sent to particula r market makers in exchange for order flow when the broker attempted to find the best price on offer from all market makers or when orders were routed to an ecn if any of these had material impact on the quality price speed etc of trade executions customers could choose their brokers accordingly restrict internalization and payment for order flow the sec could adopt the nyse suggestion that internalization be permitted only at prices better than the current nbbo or similar rule that would make the practices more expensive for market makers require exposure of customer market orders to legitimate price competition rather than simply fill market orders at its current quote market maker could be required to seek price improvement for example if buy order was received when the current ask quote was 40 18 the order could be exposed for period of time at 40 116 to see if seller could be found who was willing to accept less than the market makers ask quote adopt an interm arket prohibition against market makers trading ahead of previously displayed customer limit orders in other words market makers would not be allowed to trade for their own accounts at their own quoted prices if customer limit order thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30602crs13 improved those prices had been displayed by another market center but had not yet been filled this prohibition would require intermarket linkages to display the size time and price of limit orders entitled to priority execution and to permit automatic execution of limit orders across market centers provide intermarket time priority for limit orders or market maker quotations that improve the nbbo currently there is guarantee that the first trader to offer price improvement over the current nbbo will be the first to trade at that price other market makers may simply step up and match the price time priority would mean that trades could occur at the new price or at an inferior price until the price improvers order had been filled provided that the new price was widely disseminated and accessible through automatic execution establish nationwide pricet ime priority for all displayed trading interest this takes the previous option step further national linkage system nls would be established that encompassed all markets displaying customer orders and market maker quotes to the public as well as to market participants orders at the same price would have to be filled strictly in the order in which they were posted on the nls market makers would not be allowed to trade for their own accounts except at price better than that displayed on the nls all trading interest on the nls would be available to automatic execution and the public would have access via brokers exchanges or ecns the central limit order book clob in february 2000 three large brokerage firms merrill lynch goldman sachs and morgan stanley testified before the senate banking committee in favor of market system that resembles the secs nls option this proposal is called central limit order book or clob and would link the exchanges nasdaq market makers and the ecns into unified electronic network the linkages would assure that orders received in one market could be executed or matched with orders from other markets pricetime priority would be required meaning that all orders including limit orders would be recorded and displayed on central facility that would regulate trade executions on

supermontage nasdaq trading screens would include more information than they do now all trading interest in nasdaq stocks at the current price the nbbo would be displayed as would trading interest two price levels away from the current price market participants would thus be able to see the size of limit orders held by market makers to trade at prices other than the going price supermontage would also have an automatic execution capacity combining nasdaqs selectnet system whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30602crs14 22 section 11ac v further specifies that congress finds it in the public interest to create an opportunity for investors orders to be executed without the participation of dealerhandles large trades and its small order execution system soes execution through supermontage would be voluntary displayed orders could be filled elsewhere allowing nasdaq market makers to continue to internalize their customer orders the supermontage system would not require pricetime priority in filling orders these three proposals have elements in common but they have drawn support and opposition from different quarters nasdaq distinguishes its proposal from the clob which it attacks as mandatory centralized system that removes the incentive for market makers to provide liquidity by committing their own capital the ecns are critical of supermontage calling it an anticompetitive attempt to take away their trading volume in nasdaq stocks all three proposals would create market that in many respects resembles the ecn model where limit orders are disclosed and where matching of customer trades without the participation of dealer takes priority over market makers trading for their own accounts with their own capital this is mixed news for the ecns on the one hand it is kind of recognition that they have identified an investor need that the traditional markets did not provide on the other hand if those traditional markets adopt enough elements of the ecns market structure is there still place for the ecns themselves in the business conclusion the secs national linkage system the clob and supermontage all aim to increase the information available to public investors and to consolidate trading that has become somewhat scattered the twin goals are to increase transparency and liquidity which everyone agrees are good things the question then arises why are these proposals necessary why have investors not insisted on market with these characteristics there are two responses the first is that investor preferences for liquid and transparent markets have been thwarted by the parochial interests of certain market institutions one persons market imperfection is someone elses profit opportunity us securities law is not neutral on the question of market structure in 1975 congress enacted section 11a of the securities exchange act calling for the establishment of national market system of electronically linked exchanges and giving the sec full power to mandate such system or any of the systems now proposed22 the sec has chosen to let markets evolve following their own lights and the most visible result of the national market system legislation is the intermarket trading system its which links the exchanges its is widely regarded as technologically archaic and carries only about 2 of exchange volume why clearly the dominant nyse has incentive to share its trading with the small regional exchanges similarly the market structure reforms now under discussion will be strenuously opposed and possibly quashed by market makers exchangeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30602crs15 23 datek kicks off decimalization next week reuters june 26 2000brokers and institutional investors depending on how the particular interests of each are affected such response however may provide justification for government intervention in market organization second however it is possible to view the increase in market fragmentation as temporary dislocation brought about by the rapid adoption of new electronic technology technology is not assimilated at the same pace throughout the market for example the sec has for several years sought to convert stock pricing from the traditional fractions of dollars to decimals in order that smaller spreads and price increments could be quoted decimalization was set to occur in 1999 but the sec delayed citing the demands on the securities industry of making its computers y2k ready the sec has still not set firm date for mandatory conversion but datek leading online broker recently announced that it will price securities in cents anyway and donate to charity any profits arising from rounding decimals into fractions23 with todays technology market innovators do not have to wait for regulatory fiat or universal adoption eventually if the innovation attracts customers the rest of the market will catch up and the longterm trends that promote increased transparency and central pool of liquidity will likely resume with or without new regulations or perhaps not contrary interpretation is that decentralization is the wave of the future just as businesses have found that network of small computers can be more powerful than single mainframe so number of market centers offering quite different trading services may be as effective provider of liquidity as central market if they are linked by electronic technology and widely accessible similarly competi tion and investor choice may be adequate substitutes for government rules mandating transparency if this is the way us markets evolve attempts to establish centralized global exchange in london or singapore are unlikely to make much headway with us investors there is shortage of speculation about the future of the stock market it is unique moment in market history demand for the markets products by investors seeking return on their money and by companies seeking equity capital has never been higher at the same time the mechanisms by which those products are delivered have been transformed by new technology and the transformation is likely to accelerate government oversight can help ensure that the passage does not compromise competition investor protection or economic efficiency but the markets final destination still lies over the horizon
