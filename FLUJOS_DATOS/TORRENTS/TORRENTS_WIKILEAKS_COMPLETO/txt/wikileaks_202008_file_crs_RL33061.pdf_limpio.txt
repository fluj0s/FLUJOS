legislative history explaining the meaning and scope of the new committees jurisdiction and the jurisdictional relationship between the new committee and 10 existing committees this complex document is guideline to the speaker in his referral of legislation and to all the affected committees on their potential claim to jurisdiction over specific subject matter this report analyzes the legislative history to explain how it allocates jurisdiction among committees by retaining jurisdiction over some subject matter in one or more of the existing committees by sharing jurisdiction over other subject matter between the new committee and one or more of the existing committees and by defining the primary claim of the homeland security committee to yet other subject matter realignment of house committee jurisdictions has traditionally been accompanied by concern and contention among committees however referrals reflecting the 109th congress rules changes and the complex arrangements in the legislative history seem to indicate that jurisdictional denouement existed the first half of the first session of this congress referrals seemed consistent with the legislative history and the rules chan ges seemed to be implemented without contention even in the potential sequentia l referral of two measures reported from the homeland security committee the committ ee reached agreements with existing committees that could claim jurisdiction whether the denouement lasts through inevitable change makes the evolution of the new committees role worth watching this report analyzes 828

agreed to in the house jan 4 1995 before this change the house allowed the spea ker to make joint referral of measure to two or more committees for concurrent consid eration other forms of referral were also allowed and are generally in effect today see sec 101 of hres 988 agreed to in the continuedhomeland security and house committees analysis of 109th congress jurisdiction changes and their impact on the referral of legislation introduction the referral of legislation and the jurisdiction of committees are closely related the cornerstone of the houses referral system is directive to the speaker who refers legislation1 the speaker is to refer legislation so as to ensure to the maximum extent feasible that each committee that has jurisdiction under clause 1 of rule x over the subject matter of provision thereof of measure to be referred may consider such provision and report to the house thereon2 house rule x cl 1 lists the jurisd iction of each standing committee of the house the descriptions of jurisdicti on vary using both broad and narrow subject terms program names and ag ency names the rule is supplemented by precedents agreements and other information the parliamentarians not accompanying rule x in the constitution jeffersons manual and rules of the house of representatives list precedents formal agreem ents between committees may be printed in the congressional record such agreements are often referred to as memoranda of understanding nd are generally considered by the parliamentarian to be binding in referral decisions the speaker also on occasion makes announcements concerning the referral of gislation other information such as comments made on the floor of the house in the course of debate on the houses adoption of its rules may also ffect the referral of legislation since legislation under this system may need to be referred to two or more committees the house at the beginning of the 104th congress directed the speaker to designate primary committee in referring measures and to designate other committees to receive referral in addition or sequentially3 committee receivinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33061crs2 3 continued house oct 8 1974 previously the speaker referred measure to just one committee 4 hres 5 2i agreed to in the house ja n 7 2003 in explaining the package of rules changes proposed to the house rules committee chairman dreier said about this change section 21 permits the joint referral of measures without designation of primary jurisdiction this change is meant only as minor deviation from the normal requirement under the rules for the designation of one co mmittee of primary jurisdiction and should be exercised only in extraordinary jurisdictionally deserving instances rep david dreier remarks in house congressional record daily edition vol 149 jan 7 2003 p h11 5 house rule xii cl 2ca referral sequentially usually does so for the consideration of only those provisions within its jurisdiction subsequently in the 108th congress the speaker was given discretion not to designate primary committee many congressional observers perceived that this change was to provide the speaker with flexibility in referring homeland security legislation the house amended rule xii cl 2c1 to add the phrase shown here in italic c in carrying out paragraphs and b with respect to the referral of matter the speaker 1 shall designate committee of primary jurisdiction except where he determines that extraordinary circumstances justify review by more than one committee as though primary 4 the speaker also has other referral options in order to allow each committee with jurisdictional claim to ve an opportunity to review piece of legislati on and he may set appropriate time limitations on referral5 committees also have oversight res ponsibilities which provide them with authority to review or investigate matters of interest within thei r jurisdiction general oversight responsibilities are scribed in house rule x cl 2 special oversight functions for specific committees are provided in rule x cl 3 oversight authority also extends from the grants of legislative jurisdiction in rule x and from the enactment of laws and othe r actions consequently th ere may be more overlaps in oversight jurisdiction between committees than there are in legislative jurisdiction at the beginning of the 109th congress the house created standing committee on homeland security vested it with jurisd iction in rule x and supplemented that jurisdiction with other docum entation principally legi slative history described below this report analyzes the referral of legislation to the new committee and other standing committees in light of the changes to rule x and the supplemental guidelines in

chairman dreier inserted in the congressional record legislative history concerning the meaning and scope of the changes to rule x14 the legislative history in the first part of its first section explained that the new committees legislative jurisdiction over overall homeland security policy was to be interpreted on governmentwide or multiagency basis similar to the committee on government reforms jurisdiction over overall economy efficiency and management of government operations and activities the legislative history stated further surgical addresses of homeland security policy in sundry areas of jurisdiction oc cupied by other committees would not be referred to the committee on homeland security on the basis of overall homeland security policy jurisdiction this part of the legislative history gave an example of jurisdiction over critical infrastruct ure protection the homeland security committee would have jurisdiction over coordinating the homeland security efforts by all of the critical infrastructure protec tion sectors while jurisdiction addressing the protection of particular sector w ould lie with the committee otherwise having jurisdiction over that sector15 second the legislative history interpreted the new committees legislative jurisdiction over the department of homeland securitys dhss organization and administration to be confined to orga nizational and administrative efforts and would not apply to progra mmatic efforts within the department of homeland security within the jurisdiction of other committees16 third the legislative history explained

circumscribe the oversight jurisdiction of other committees nothing in this clause shall be construe d as prohibiting or otherwise restricting the authority of any other committee to study and review homeland security activities to the extent that such activity directly affects matter otherwise within the jurisdiction of that committee17 fourth the legislative history in its second section interpreted the individual committee concerns between the new committee on the one hand and nine standing committees and the permanent select committee on intelligence on the other this section of the legislative history detailed jurisdictional relationships covering number of specific policy nd programmatic areas the relationships are detailed in the analysis of referrals section below in addition in further explanation of the relationship between the new committee and the ways and means committee the legislative history contained copy of the delegation from the secretary of the treasury to the secretary of homeland secu rity of general authority over customs revenue functions vested in the secretary of the treasury as set forth in the homeland security act of 200218 referral precedents in the speakers announcements for the 109th congress the speaker included statement about the referral of legislation to the new committee the 109th congress established the committee on homeland security the chair would announce that the speakers referrals of measures to the select committee on homeland security of the 108th congress will not constitute precedent for referrals to the new committee19 emphasis added hres 5 summary chairman dreier also inserted sectionbysection summary of hres 5 in the congressional record which included summary of the jurisdiction granted to the homeland security committee20 in remarks to the house chairman dreier commented on the creation of the new committee this change in house rule x which governs the committees and their legislative jurisdictions is delicately cr afted architecture it creates primary committee while recognizing the other gitimate oversight roles of existing committees we envision system of pur poseful redundancy by that we mean more than one level of oversight and an atmosphere in which the competition of ideas is encouragedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33061crs6 21 rep david dreier remarks in the house congressional record daily edition vol 151 jan 4 2005 p h14with this jurisdiction and the legislativ history that i will be placing in the record the department of homeland security will have more certainty as to which committee has the primary responsibility for homeland security at the same time the american people will live w ith the assurance that we are working to prevent anything from falling through the cracks21 chairman dreiers remarks seemed to emphasize the primary legislative role of the new committee within the house on the subject matter of homeland security and the complementary role of other committees on this subject matter selection of measures for study criteria the legislation included in this study was selected according to the following criteria 1 only

committees other information such as announcements by the speaker may so influence the referral of legislation in the 109th congress the house created standing committee on homeland security vesting it with jurisdiction in rule x cl 1i this statement of jurisdiction was implemented most significantly by changes in the jurisdiction of three standing committees and by legislative history inserted in the congressional record that distinguished the jurisdiction of the new committee from those of 10 existing committees relevant excerpts from the rules changes and legislative history appear below with the individual committee anal yses moreover the speaker announced that referrals of legislation to the select committee on homeland security in the 108th congress would not constitute preceden t

immigration and customs enforcement had arrested 582 suspected gang members and their associates in the previous two weeks and more th an 1000 such individuals since march the secretary stated that more than ninety percent of those arrested were illegal aliens55 this kind of announcement is reminde r of how broad is dhss mandate congress created the department at president bushs request to combat terrorism directed at the united states and most americans probably think of this role whenever they hear refere nce to dhs as the presiden t explained his proposal for the department in ddressing the nation the department of homeland security will be charged with four primary tasks this new agency will control our borders and prevent terrorists and explosives from entering our country it will work with state and local authorities to respond quickly and effectively to emergencies it will bring together our best scientists to develop technologies that detect bi ological chemical and nuclear weapons and to discover the drugs and treatments to best protect our citizens and this new department will review intelligence and law enforcement information from all agencies of government and produce single daily picture of threats against our homeland analysts will be responsible for imagining the worst and planning to counter it56 capturing suspected gang members who are illegal aliens promoting recreational boating safety nd investigating counterfeitin g are not federal programs that most americans would probably think of as dhs responsibilities but they also are in addition to its homeland security responsibilities the agencies and programs reorganized to form the department had many more congressi onally mandated duties than homeland security this situation challenged congress in creating the department and subs equently in its own realignm ent of committee jurisdiction over homeland security as indicated earlier in this report the house created select committee on homeland security in the 108th congress and superseded its potential continuation with standing committee on homeland security in the 109th congress the new committee was given jurisdiction over overall homeland security policy and the organization and administration of dhs but its jurisdiction over specific homelandsecurity policy ar eas was limited to functions of the department of homeland security relating to those policy areas rule x cl 1i with the establishment of the permanent committee again as indicated rules chairman dreier inserted in the congressional

jurisdiction from that of existing committees providing guide to the speaker in the referral of legislation much of the legislative history served to distinguish strictly homeland security issues that would be under the exclusive or concurrent jurisdic tion of the homeland security committee from both homelands ecurityrelated issues and nonhomeland securityrelated issues that would conti nue to be under the jurisdiction of other committees of the house this section of conclusions analyzes some of the choices the house made in realigning committee jurisdiction over homeland security and the operation of those choices related to the referral of legislation early in the 109th congress delimiting the jurisdictional m eaning of homeland security i n implementing the rule x changes the legislative history contains three approaches to the homeland security committees juri sdiction in addition to understand the legislative historys explanation related to specific committee or subjectmatter one must look in more than one place in that document first the legislative history details grants of exclusive jurisdiction for example the homeland security committee was granted jurisdiction over overall homeland security policy rul x cl 1i1 the firs t section of the legislative history explaining the meaning of these and the other words in clause 1i states that the phrase overall homeland security policy is to be interpreted on governmentwide or multiagency basi s similar to the committee on government reforms jurisdiction over overall ec onomy efficiency and management of government operations and activities 57 with regard to governmentwide or multi agency homeland security activities the homeland security committee was granted comprehensive jurisdiction second the legislative history details gran ts of shared jurisdiction an example is in the jurisdictional relationship between the homeland security committee and the transportation and infrastructure committee as defined by the functions assigned dhs in the homeland security act of 200258 the homeland security committee was granted jurisdiction over port security and domestic preparedness for and collective response to terrorism r ule x cl 1i3a and 3d in the section of the legislative history delineating the jurisdictional relationship between the two committees the transportation and infrastructure committee retained jurisdiction over the coast guard however the legislative history then explains the nature of shared jurisdiction over th coast guard the homeland security committee has jurisdiction over port security and some coast guard responsibilities in that area will fall within the jurisdiction of both committees59httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33061crs36 60 ibid p h26 61 ibid p h25in this same section of the legislative history in the instance of emergency preparedness the transportation and infrastructure committee retained its general jurisdiction over the federal emergenc management agency fema the legislative history provides bills addressing femas general preparation for disaster from any cause shall be referred to the committee on transportation and infrastructure with regard to emergency preparedness and terrorist acts however the committee on homeland security shall have jurisdiction over the department of homeland securitys res ponsibilities with regard to emergency preparedness only as they relate to acts of terrorism60 consequently one might expect all or most coast guard and fema legislation to be referred to the transportation and infrastructure committee the homeland security committee might seek sequential referral if legislation deals with port security and includes provisi ons affecting the responsib ilities of the coast guard or if the legislation deals specifically with emergency preparedness and acts of terrorism the homeland security committee might be designated the primary committee in referra l with the transportation and infrastructure committee possibly seeking sequential referral third as explained in the legisla tive history the 10 named committees each retained jurisdiction in many instances to the exclusion of the homeland security committee even when the programs or activities described are among dhss responsibilities for example the ho meland security committee was granted jurisdiction over bordersecurity xcept immigration policy and nonborder enforcement rule x cl 1i3a in the section of the legislative history delineating the jurisdictional relationship between the homeland security committee and the judiciary committee the legislative history amplifies the meaning of this provision of the homeland security committees limited jurisdiction and the judiciary committees relatively broad jurisdiction rule x cl l9 over immigration policy the legislative history explains the judiciary committees jurisdicti on over immigration policy shall include matters such as the immigration and naturalization process numbers of aliens including immigrants and nonimmigrants allowed classifications and lengths of allowable stay the adjudication of immigration petitions and the requirements for the same the domestic adjudication of immigration petitions and applications submitted to the department of labor or the department of homeland security and setting policy with regard to visa i ssuance and acceptance its jurisdiction over nonborder enforcement shall be limited to those aspects of immigration enforcement not associated with the i mmediate entry of individuals into the country including those aspects of th bureau of immigration and customs enforcement61 the homeland security committees juri sdiction over specific components of immigrati on is carved out of the judiciary co mmittees continuing broad jurisdiction and the explanation in the legislative history seems clear that the carveout does not provide the homeland security committee w ith shared jurisdiction although thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33061crs37 62 ibid p h25 63 ibid p h25departments of justice labor and state all play significant roles in executing immigration laws the homeland security department is the parent of the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement the bureau of customs and border protection the bureau of citizenship and immigration services and other units which have large workloads in executing immigration laws through its immigration jurisdiction the judiciary committee conti nues to have key legislative and oversight role affecting the homeland security department in addition in seeking understanding of jurisdiction granted to the homeland security committee or retained by other committees it is often necessary to look in more than one place in the legislative history for example to obtain fuller understanding of the distinction of the homeland security committees jurisdiction from that of the energy and commerce committee one would look in the first section of the legislative history where the meaning of the jurisdictional grant to the homeland security committee in rule x cl 1i is set forth there it is explained that while overall homeland security policy is within the jurisdiction of the homeland security committee specific instances of homeland security policy might be outside the committees jurisdiction surgical addresses of homeland security policy in sundry areas of jurisdiction ccupied by other committees would not be referred to the committee on homeland security on the basis of overall homeland security policy jurisdiction this paragraph of the legislative history then goes on to cite an example that is relevant to differentiating the homeland security committees and the energy and commerce committees and other committees jurisdictions for example the committee on homeland security shall have jurisdiction over bill coordinating the homeland security efforts by all of the critical infrastructure protection sectors jurisdic tion over bill addressing the protection of particular sector would lie with the committee otherwise having jurisdiction over that sector62 an additional distinction in the committees jurisdictions appears in the section of the legislative history delineating the jurisdictional relationship between the homeland security committee and 10 existing committees in the case of the energy and commerce committee after explaining conceptual difference between its and the homeland security committees jurisdictions there is another example of the distinction in jurisdictions the committee on energy and commerce and other relevant committees shall retain their jurisdiction over bills addr essing the separate entities that comprise the first responders for example the committee on energy and commerce shall retain its jurisdiction over bill directing the department of health and human services to train emergency medical personnel63 the section of the legislative history distinguishing the jurisdiction of the homeland security committee from 10 existin g committees also contains in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33061crs38 64 ibid p h25 65 ibid p h26 66 pl 107296 116 stat 2135 67 legislative history p h26explanation of one existing committees ju risdiction distinctions that might be relevant to one or more of other existing committees for example the explanation of the energy and commerce committees jurisdiction contains this information that is applicable to the distinction between its and other committees jurisdiction and that of the homeland security committee the committee on homeland security shall have jurisdiction over measures that address the department of homeland securitys activities for domestic preparedness and collective response to terro rism in rule x cl 1i3d the words to terrorism require direct relation to terrorism the committee on homeland securitys jurisdiction over c ollective response to terrorism means that it shall receive referrals of bills addressing the department of homeland securitys responsibilities for and assistance to first responders as whole the committee on energy and commerce and other relevant committees shall retain their jurisdiction over bills addr essing the separate entities that comprise the first responders64 related statement explaining the transportation and infrastructure committees jurisdiction is short and is made more understandable in reading the lengthier distinction contained in the energy and commerce committees jurisdictional explanation where the larger framework is apparent the brief transportation and infrastructure committee statement reads the committee on homeland security shall have jurisdiction over the department of homela nd securitys responsibilities with regard to emergency preparedness onl as they relate to acts of terrorism65 yet another instance in which an understa nding of the jurisdictional distinctions between the homeland security committee and the existing committees requires looking in more than one place are the re ferences to the homeland security act of 200266 for example the ways and means committees jurisdiction was amended to customs revenue from customs rule x cl 1t1 consistent with the grant of jurisdiction to the homeland security committee over customs except customs revenue rule x cl 1i3b th explanation of the ways and means committees jurisdiction in the legislative history states that the committees jurisdiction over customs revenue is intended to include those functions contemplated in section 412b2 of the homeland secu rity act of 2002 and includes those functions as carried out in collection di stricts and ports of entry and delivery67 the cited section of the ho meland security act provides functions the functions referred to in paragraph 1 are those functions performed by the following personnel and associated support staff of the united states customs service on the day before the effective date of

from the secretary of the treasury to the secretary of homeland security of ge neral authority over custom s revenue functions vested in the secretary of the treasury as set forth in the homeland security act of 200269 are read with the explanation it seems clear that specific and limited carving out of the ways and means committees jurisdiction over customs policy occurred similar to the judiciary committee retainin g jurisdiction over important components of immigration policy the ways and means committee retained jurisdiction over important components of customs policy other subject matter not all legislative references to the words homeland security or terrorism are covered by the legislative history for example benefits proposed in legislation to be made available to the victims of terrorist attacks such as the victims of the 911 attacks are not mentioned in the legislative history such legislation introduced in the 109th congress was not referred to the homeland security committee but to the committee or committees with jurisdiction over the benefit proposed to be be stowed another example of the use of the word terrorism that is absent from the legislative history is terrorism insurance legislation introduced in the 109th congress amending the terrorism risk insurance act of 200270 was referred to the financial services committee drafting choices including the us code or statutory provisions that might be amended popular title options and other considerations can influence the referral of legislation under the specific language of rule x cl 1 and relevant interpretive materials such as the legislative history in this instance the terms homeland security or terrorism included in legislation do not alone provide much guidance of how bill might be referred just as their absence does not71 implementation of the rules changes the parliamentarian acting for the speaker referred many nd perhaps all measures included in this study pursuant

the select committee on homeland security which was designated as primary and in addition to the transportation and infrastructure judici ary energy and commerce and science committees oversight as noted in the introduction committees oversight jurisdiction may have more frequent overlaps than their legislative jurisdiction appendix b lists all committee meetings expressly relevant to the subject matter of the house rules changes and the legislative history that were held by the homeland security committee and the 10 existing committees through may 26 2005 many of these meetings are hearin gs and markups related to specific legislation others are oversight hearings on an issue which of course could result in legislative activity or would inform legislative activityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33061crs47 72 see crs report rl32711 homeland security compe ndium of recommendations relevant to house committee organization and analysis of c onsiderations for the house by michael l koempelthe committees held more meetings than are listed in appendix b other meetings did not expressly relate to the subject matter of the rules changes or the legislative history the subject matter of the homeland security committees meetings seemed targeted and closely related to the specific aspects of its legislative jurisdiction other committees meetings also seemed to be focused on discrete subject matter within their jurisdiction comparing the list of topics on which the committees held hearings there were few hearings where the topic of hearing in one committee was the same topic in another hearing alt hough hearing by one committee on an agency budget or specific program could well ve contained testim ony of interest to another committee concluding observations realignment of committee jurisdiction whether accomplished legislatively through amendments to chamber rules or changed through precedent created by bill referrals and memoranda of understanding or negotiated in legisla tive history traditionally cau ses concern if not outright conflict among committees as jurisdictional realignment is discussed initially as possibility in congress committees begin to explain why such change would disadvantage them and cong ressional policymaking and once changes are made committees do not always adhere to the new arrangements without complaint whether in public or through less public foru ms what is rare therefore is the response of affected house committees to the changes made to accommodate the creation of homeland security committee with legislative authority debate on the rule x changes and the legislative history related to the homeland security committees creation cannot be consider ed extensive detailed contentious or overt even the minority pa rtys alternative house rules package did not include different appro ach to homeland security ju risdiction and debate on the minorityparty package did not engender mu ch discussion on the creation of the new committee and the related jurisdictional changes existing committees concerns with standing homeland security committee were voiced or at least could have been voiced at the time changes were being designed during the second session of the 108th congress in fact both the select committee on homeland security and the house rules committee held hearings in the 108th congress on the creation of homeland security committee and on possible jurisdictional changes that creati on of committee might necessitate72 some committee chairs and ranking members objected to the creation of standing homeland security committee arguing and documenting that their panels had conducted oversight and consid ered appropriate legislati on in additi on some argued that new committee would exacerbate rather than solve the jurisdictional problem that advocates of new committee hoped to ameliorate by the time the 109th congress convened it is possible that chair of an existing committee wanted to object to jurisdictional realignment related to homeland security for fear of beinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33061crs48 73 house select committee on homeland security recommendations of the select committee on homeland security on changes to th rules of the house of representatives continuedthought to be opposed to homeland security rather than to new house structure to deal with the issue as legislation began to be introduced and referred pursuant to the rule x changes there was public indication that committees sought referrals of legislation where they thought referral wa s incorrectly made in some instances the referral of particular bill when comp ared to related bill introduced in the 108th congress was simplified as advocates of the new committee expected in other instances the referral of pa rticular bill when compared to related bill introduced in the 108th congress was referred to yet nother committee as opponents of new committee predicted in fact as the preced ing analysis seems to attest referral of legislation that could have been made differently in the designation of primary committee or in the failure of committee to receive referral at all was not questioned on the floor there were also additional memora nda of understanding included in the congressional record whether this denoue ment erodes through time remains to be seen it should be noted however and c ould be argued that committees with jurisdiction over aspects of homeland s ecurity such as first responders immigration and transportation security among others that were most affected by the creation of new committee on homeland security with legislative jurisdiction were busy some might say c onsumed with work on other pressing issues in the first quarter of the 109th congress for example the energy and commerce committee reported out comprehensive energy bill hr 6 pl 10958 the transportation and infrastructure committee completed work on highway bill after number of temporary extensions of programs authorized by the legislation hr 3 pl 10959 and the judiciary committee finished work on reauthorization of the usa patriot act hr 3199 other committees were also i nvolved with major legislation such as the ways and means committees considera tion of the dominican republiccentral america free trade agreement drcaft hr 3045 pl 10953 and social security reform and the government reform committee held extensive hearings on steroids use in professional sports this observation is not to imply that committees cannot consider several impor tant issues at time but to indicate the workload of congress todate it also remains to be seen how change in the chair of the homeland security committee might affect bill referrals on june 30 2005 president bush nominated representative christopher co x of california the first chair of the new committee to be member of the securities and ex change commission the senate confirmed the nomination july 29 2005 in addition to chairing the standing committee in the 109th congress representative cox also chaired the select committee on homeland security in the 108th congress the select

to the committees creati on the member currently chairs one of the panels the jurisdiction of which was changed in rule x to accommodate the new committee two potential candidates serve on two other com mittees with jurisdiction over homeland security issues and other subject matter that is covered in the legislative history fourth potential candidate was an advocate of creating the homeland security committee and giving it defined jurisdiction as has already been noted rules committee chairman dreier stated the rule x changes reflected delicately crafted architecture system of purposeful redundancy and an atmosphere in which the competition of ideas is encouraged75 these concepts seem to indicate flexible arrangement operating within the rule x changes and the guidance of the legislative history it is too early to tell whether the patterns observed in this study will continue congress is always an evolving institution and the homeland security co mmittee and its jurisdictional relationship with other committees are likely to evolve within the flexible arrangement put in place by the house new secretary of homeland security since february 15 2005 new chair of
