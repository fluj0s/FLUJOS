sovereignty july 1 1997 issues involving hong kong have virtually ceased to be debated in the united states by nearly all accounts the one country two systems formula that china promised for hong kong is working hong kong remains remarkably different from china with credible legal institutions entrenched individual liberties and diverse and freewheeling public debate on both major and minor policy questions still hong kong continues to be confronted with significant and unique challenges that put extra pressure on government decision makers hong kongs policy environment now is more diverse than the single issue it faced whether or not to trust china prior to the handover officials in hong kong must deal with growing range of issues social welfare programs housing industrial competitiveness education upon which there is an increasingly diverse public debate they must operate in governmental setting in which normal dialogue with their own capital beijing is not only greatly constrained by international agreement but subject to continual international scrutiny at times hong kong government officials have been criticized as being insufficiently vigilant in protecting hong kongs interests against encroachment real or imagined by beijing since late 1999 series of unpopular decisions by the hong kong government has contributed to increased public criticism and disaffection moreover some hong kong residents believe that since march 2000 beijing has become increasingly concerned about developments in hong kong and has begun to be somewhat more assertive and more visible in its involvement as result spirited debate has been underway in hong kong over number of issues that have implications for us interests what hong kong should want for its future whether and how to make the hong kong government more accountable to the public how fast hong kong should move toward more complete democratization and how close or distant should be hong kongs relationship with china the decisions hong kong makes will have implications for the united states which currently cites hong kongs promised autonomy as reason for treating hong kong more favorably than china under us law

focuses on the situation in hong kong as it continues its political and social transformation after the july 1997 reversion to chinese sovereignty part of the reports findings are based on study mission to hong kong in late novemberearly december 2000 that visit sponsored by the hong kong economic and trade representatives office in washington dc involved series of 27 interviews with representatives of the hong kong government and legislature us officials stationed in hong kong locally based journalists and foreign correspondents scholars members of human rights and religious organizations and representatives of the hong kong and international business communities the purpose of the trip was to assess developments in hong kongs political economic and social environment in the more than three years since its reversion from british to chinese rule on july 1 1997 and analyze the challenges that hong kong faces in the coming years in addition the report draws on independent assessments of developments before and since the study mission based on reports in the press and on continuing discussions with government officials journalists and scholars background britains return of its premier colony hong kong to china in 1997 had its roots in the terms under which the british originally acquired the territory through combi nation of wartime concessions and 99year lease the latter negotiated and signed with china in 1898 in 1982 approaching the end of its lease the british government began series of difficult bilateral negotiations with the peoples republic of china prc about hong kongs future these ultimately led to the sinobritish joint declaration of 1984 which provided for returning all of hong kong including land held in perpetuity to chinese sovereignty on july 1 1997 throughout their lengthy negotiations through the 1980s and 1990s leading up to 1997 both the british and prc governments made promises and took actions that continue to affect hong kong today beijing devised one country two systems policy in which it promised that after the prc resumed sovereignty over hong kong the territory would be run by hong kong people themselves without central government interference under the high degree of autonomy that it said hong kong would enjoy as special administrative region sar of china beijing pledged that hong kong could keep its current political economic and legal systems for 50 years beijing reserved the right to make decisions on foreign and national security affairs for hong kong and to be the ultimate authority for interpreting honghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30895crs2 1 hong kongs defacto constitution is known as the basic law information about the basic law including full text can be found at httpwwwinfogovhkbasic_lawflashhtmlkongs new constitution1 for its part london sought to lay foundation of governance by which hong kong could continue the freedoms and capitalist system it had as british colony british negotiators were able to incorporate broad range of protections for legal institutions and personal liberties into hong kongs constitution in addition london succeeded in establishing framework for an elected legislature broader public participation and other democratic initiatives which hong kong had not known during most of its existence under british rule since its reversion to chinese sovereignty often called the handover hong kong in essence has been reinventing itself based on the blueprints and fledgling institutions laid out in sinobritish negotiations by nearly all accounts from wide social and ideological spectrum the one country two systems experiment is working hong kong remains remarkably free and unfettered place with credible legal institutions remarkable individual liberties and critical and even raucous press there is frank and public debate on political social and economic issues and people appear unafraid to criticize hong kong government officials or governmental policies in september 2000 hong kong held its second round of legislative elections for the legislative council legco and to date political enfranchisement generally is continuing at the pace and in the manner envisioned in the basic law still hong kong has been criticized at times as being insufficiently vigilant in protecting its own authority and jurisdiction from encroachment either actual or perce ived by beijing while many of those interviewed by the author in novemberdecember 2000 felt that beijing had been nearly invisible in hong kongs affairs for the first two and half years after the handover surprising number seemed to think that there had been slight but perceptible change in beijings attitude and level of involvement in hong kong beginning in februarymarch 2000 they attributed this to variety of reasons partly for instance to the fact that the hong kong public had begun to grow increasingly dissatisfied with the government during this period and had been vocal in expressing that dissatisfa ction these observers variously described this februarymarch period as the time of an outbreak of democracy in hong kong the start of deepening pessimism in hong kong the beginning of beijings fears that there was conspiracy in hong kong against the current chief executive mr ch tung and simply as the februarymarch 2000 watershed us policy toward hong kong current us policy toward hong kong is set out in the ushong kong policy act of 1992 pl 102383 this act allows the united states to treat hong kong different ly from the way it treats china throughout wide range of legal economic and trade laws the act specifically states that such special treatment is predic ated upon an autonomous hong kong under the act the president has the power to halt agreements or take other steps if he determines that beijing is interfering unduly in hong kongs affairs and that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30895crs3 2 specific intention of the hong kong policy act was to permit the us government to treat hong kong differently from the way it treats the rest of china in us law thus the united states has an extradition treaty with hong kong but not with china maintains liberalized export control regime with hong kong but restrictive one with china and gives hong kong permanent mostfavorednation mfn trade status or normal trade relations as it is now known but will not give it to china until china joins the world trade organization or wto 3 for the text of the april 25 2000 report see httpwwwstategovwwwregionseap000401_ushk_pol_act_rpthtmlterritory is not sufficient ly autonomous2 among other provisions the us hong kong policy act does the following declares that support for democratization is fundamental principle of the united states that should apply to us policy toward hong kong after 1997 declares congressional support for the sinobritish joint declaration and makes number of findings about what that agreement provides for including the fact that there will be elections for hong kongs legislature legco and that all agreements the united states has implemented with hong kong by june 30 1997 will continue in force after that date requires the united states to apply the same laws toward hong kong after 1997 as were in force before then but permits the president to suspend those agreements beginning july 1 1997 if he determines china is not giving hong kong sufficient autonomy requires the secretary of state to report to congress every 18 months on the situation in hong kong including on the development of hong kongs democratic institutions3 this report discusses some of the challenges that hong kong currently faces and attempts to assess how they fit into the autonomy framework trends in political institutions and governance hong kong is currently wrestling with several problems of governance related to the handover including problems with the structure of government its accountability and responsiveness to the electorate the pace of further democratic changes and hong kongs political relations with its sovereign government the peoples republic of china prc according to interviews official statements and press accounts many feel that some of these problems are systemic and that they have arisen because the hong kong government is forced to operate within the confines of an imperfect political framework inherited from series of sinobritish compromises there appears to be agreement across the ideological spectrum including within both prodemocracy and probeijing groups that the current political system in the territory is flawed and unsustainable views differ however about how these flaws should be fixedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30895crs4 4 after he arrived in 1992 hong kongs last british governor christopher patten made electoral changes that greatly broadened the hong kong franchise for the 1995 legislative elections the chinese government claimed the changes violated sinobritish agreements in protest china in 1997 dissolved the legislature elected under the new rules in 1995 and appointed provisional legislature for one year the first official hong kong legislative council elected under chinese sovereignty then was elected to twoyear term in 1998 under new and more restrictive electoral arrangements 5 yeung chris back to basics vow democrats slide in support prompts soul searching by leaders south china morning post september 12 2000 p 1one reason that the current systems problems have become more apparent some suggest is that hong kongs principal concern during sinobritish negotiations whether or not to trust beijing has changed since the handover thus in the year 2000 beijings involvement in hong kong is perceived to be minimal one country two systems is working is constant refrain as public fear of beijings interference has faded new problems of governance have arisen for which there is sovereign power to hold responsible since beijing ostensibly is not serving in this direct role as was london absent the buffer of an assertive and active sovereign power the entire hong kong government structure has been put under increasing pressure with the hong kong public increasingly vocal in its reaction to and criticism of unpopular policy decisions and performance problems legislative elections of 2000 on september 10 2000 hong kong held elections for its 60seat legislature the legislative council legco these were the second legco elections since the handover4 in contrast to the first posthandover legco elections of 1998 when 53 of the electorate voted only 4357 of hong kongs 3 million registered voters cast ballots in 2000 martin lees democratic party remained the largest party in legco with twelve seats but it picked up more seats than it had in the1998 elections and its share of the total votes actually fell to 347 down from 426 in 1998 this was referred to in later press accounts as severe setback for the democrats5 on the other hand the democratic alliance for the betterment of hong kong dab often referred to as probeijing party picked up one more seat total of eleven despite lastminute scandal involving key party leader the dab share of total votes grew to nearly 30 5 percentage points more than its showing in 1998 the probusiness liberal party lost two seats winning only eight and none in directly elected slot one verdict on the elections in hong kong was that the low voter turnout reflected public disillusionment with both its limited political role and with the policy decisions of the hong kong government others pointed out that the turnout was actually reversion to norm after the highwater mark of the 1998 elections the accountability problem on the executive side primary political problem is consistently describe d as lack of accountability function many suggest of the hybrid framework for governance established under the basic law the chief executive now mr tung cheehwa serving fiveyear term until 2002 at times has been said to be the only accountable person in the executive arm of the government he has an executive council to advise him on policy matters as hehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30895crs5 6 the executive council is provided for in articles 5456 of the basic law its makeup and membership are at the sole discretion of the chief executive 7 from conversation with scholar in hong kong december 2000carries out the responsibilities of his office but council members serve on parttime basis and are minimally accountable to the electorate6 of the thirteen current executive council members only three are hong kong government officials the ten current nonofficial members do not have responsibility for managing government departments although they do draw monthly honorarium of 60000 hong kong dollars for their services about 7700 the real work of managing the governments bureaucracy is carried out by hong kongs civil service senior members of which head government departments and bureaus but while hong kongs civil service is widely regarded as highly competent and effective there are limits to its public accountability as well civil servants are not elected by the public nor are they under schedule c type of appointment as in the american system even at the cabinet level most civil servants tend to be career track employees with lifetime contracts they may be dismissed in case of serious malfeasance but according to hong kong observers they cannot be fired to satisfy political need thus hong kongs chief executive is seen to have limited leverage over his own government bureaucracy and it owes special political allegiance to him critics then say that it is primarily the chief executive who pays the political price for public dissatisfaction with hong kong government policies or performance given the nature of tungs office and the manner of his selection by an 800member election committee rather than by direct public franchise the hong kong public has little recourse to register disap proval and the chief executive has limited options with which to handle public dissatisfaction as one observer put it what is tung to do to satisfy the people condemn himself daily or resign7 by all accounts the perceived problems in government accountability worsened in 2000 and translated into lower popularity ratings for the government in general and for the chief executive personally among the reasons cited for growing public dissatisfaction throughout the year were lower public confidence in the ability of hong kongs economy to maintain its competitive edge against the rising economic power of chinese cities such as shanghai and shenzhen deepening concerns about the strength of hong kongs social safety net of government programs and growing perception that hong kong has an elite driven government which pays little attention to the needs and desires of average citizens in addition series of scandals involving the hong kong housing authority including revelations about shoddy construction in public housing dating back to 1999 appear to have been importan t catalysts for growing public dissatisfaction early in the year although the chairwoman of the hong kong hous ing authority rosanna wong ultimately resigned as result of the housing authoritys difficulties the scandals prompted vigorous debate over what shouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30895crs6 8 ms wong resigned as chairwoman of the housing authority on june 24 2000 the director of housing tony miller remained in his post an article in the south china morning post of june 29 2000 quoted him as saying i have intent ion of resigning on the basis of political factors or other pressure as nonpolitical civil servant one can resign only on matter of principle or belief 9 south china morning post june 29 2000 10 the address can be found at httpwwwinfogovhkgiageneral200010111011140htm 11 mr leung will replace the current financial secretary donald tsan g whom mr tung named as the successor to chief secretary anson chan when she leaves that post and retires at the end of april 2001 both mr tsang and mrs chan are career civil servantshappen to the senior hong kong government officials in charge in such cases8 both the chief executive ch tung and the chief secretary anson chan stressed that the senior officials involved had done nothing wrong but had uncovered and publicized the problems and had attempted to launch reforms in return they had been put on public trial in manner that has potentially damaging effects on the governance of the sar9 one of the proposals being discussed to address the governments accountability problem is the establishment of ministerial system that would make senior civil servants political appointees who would be more accountable to the chief executive for his part mr tung in his annual policy address of october 11 2000 acknowledged the problem of government accountability as one of three major areas of public concern and he appeared to be contemplating the establishment of contract system for senior civil servants rather than the current system of career appointments10 his most recent seniorlevel appointment reinforces this notion on february 15 2001 mr tung announced that he was choosing mr antony leung businessman and nonofficial executive council member as hong kongs new financial secretary11 but while many portray the hong kong governments accountability problems as systemic byproducts of its hybrid governmental structure others see them more as deliberate strategy of chinese leaders who are frustrated with their inability to exert direct control over hong kong according to these critics beijings wishes for hong kong are that it remain firmly executiveled government whose decisions support chinas national interests and are carried out by quiet and comp liant civil service taking little independent initiative chinese leaders are said to be particularly upset by more independentminded civil servants who have supported initiatives in hong kong that beijing strongly opposes thus this group sees beijing maneuvering behind the scenes putting pressure on hong kong government officials promising financial incentives or retribution to hong kong businesses and intimidating critics by harsh public pronouncements according to these critics making hong kongs traditionally apolitical civil service more accountable to outside pressure serves to undermine its traditional political neutrality and integrity political parties and legcoexecutive relations related problem of governance concerns hong kongs legislature the legislative council particularly its relationship to the executive arm of the hong kong government constitutedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30895crs7 12 give basic law timetable 13 there is currently an ongoing debate in hong kong about interpreting article 74 of the basic law which states among other things the written consent of the chief executive shall be required before bills relating to government policies are introduced 14 from an interview with an official from hong kongs constitutional affairs office largely by election legco does not have comparable accountability problem to the executive legislators have constituencies to which they are accountable and they must stand for reelection according to fixed timetable12 but there are other systemic problems of governance involving legco for one it is weak body with limited jurisdiction legco can impeach the chief executive and can vote on legislation but legco members cannot introduce legislation relating to government policies without the written consent of the chief executive13 chief executive tung is described as often excluding legco from his policy calculus seeming to view legco as competitor or even an adversary rather than as partner in governance others cite an equally important problem to be that legco is by and large the only part of the hong kong government in which political parties are represented although some parties are represented in the executive council as result hong kongs political parties have little voice in the executive arm or government bureaucracies and the executive arm has natural ally in the legislature there is oil smoothing the machinery of government in the words of one hong kong government official14 not surprisingly members of hong kongs political parties including parties thought to be supportive of beijing suggested that political parties must be let into the executive side of the government for smoother working relationship between the branches legco is also in transition because the issues important to hong kong are changing prior to and just after the handover democraticminded parties in hong kong were able to capitalize on public fears about china to support rapid democratization in that environment prodemocracy parties such as martin lees hong kong democratic party received broad electoral support but in recent years as fears about china have faded in hong kong political parties that continue to emphasize prodemocracy and antic hina platforms are seen to have lost political ground to others focusing on issues that affect peoples daily lives such as education social welfare and stronger and more equitable economy on these issues the democratic alliance for the betterment of hong kong dab party often identified with probeijing sentiments is judged to have read the public mood more successfully and to have gained support while prodemocratic parties appear to have lost support ironically the growing importance of these social welfare issues may have contributed to marginal increase in legcos independence as legislative body in summer of 2000 for instance during the scandal involving the hong kong housing authority the hong kong democratic party proposed an unprecedented confidence vote in legco on officials in the housing authority the motion passed easily supported even by the supposedly probeijing dab move that was said tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30895crs8 15 the scandal led to the resignation prior to the legco vote of rosanna wong chairman of the housing authority who had been appointed to the post by chief executive tung 16 the basic law annex ii iii p 90have surprised the chief executive and others in the hong kong government15 some suggested that as issues of public policy become more predominant in hong kong legco may become what one observer called the conscience of hong kong acting as greater advocate for its perceived constituencies pace of democratization debate over the pace of hong kongs democratization is continuing although not at the same intensity as prior to and immediately after the handover the basic law which stipulates that universal suffrage is the ultimate goal for selection of both legco and the chief executive offers blueprint for democratization up to 2007 but not beyond for choosing the legislature legco already has begun the transition from wholly appointed body as it was during most of british rule to an elected body in keeping with the timetab specified in the basic law the 60member legco elected in 2000 is comprised of 24 members elected by universal suffrage 30 elected by functional constituencies select peer groups from the community such as the professions commerce and labor and 6 by special 800member election committee the election committee itself which also elects the chief executive is comprised of 800 people elected in separate subsector elections including such interests as the hotel sector the finance sector the agricultural sector etc in 2004 the election committee will cease playing its role in legislative elections and the ratios of legislators in legco will change to 30 members elected by universal suffrage and 30 elected by functional constituencies the basic law does not specify how the legco election is to be conducted after the third term of 2004 but instead states with regard to the method for forming the legislative councilafter 2007 if there is need to amend the provisions of this annex such amendments must be made with the endorsement of twothirds majority of all the members of the council and the consent of the chief executive and they shall be reported to the standing committee of the national peoples congress for the record16 since the basic law does not specify anything further beyond the 2004 election for legco it is unclear what decisions the hong kong government will make for the legislatures electio n in 2008 and 2012 prodemocracy advocates in hong kong generally argue for faster pace of democratization as soon as 2008 and are fearful that hong kongs current government backed strongly by beijing is opting for as slow pace as possible some however have pointed out that dismantling the functional constitue ncies necessary step before universal suffrage will be problematic as this move is likely to be strenuously opposed by those professions that benefit from this unique voting arrangement these observers believe that slower pace toward universal suffrag will be unavoidable in order to accommodate these diverse interests for choosing the chief executive while the position of chief executive is also ultimately to be subject to universal suffrage article 45 of the basic lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30895crs9 17 the basic law provided that in 1997 the first term the chief executive would be chosen by special 400member selection committee which was chosen by special handover preparatory committee which itself was appointed by beijing annex i of the basic law provides for the 800member election committee for choosing the chief executive in the 2nd 2002 and 3rd 2007 terms and states that the method for choosing this election committee shall be determined by hong kong itself in an electoral law this same 800member election committee also chooses the limited legco seats subject to election committee selection 18 the basic law annex i 7 p 87many observers in hong kong thought this more problematic than direct elections for legco and thus highly unlikely for the foreseeable future the basic law specifies that in 2002 and 2007 hong kongs chief executive is to be chosen by special 800 member election committee thus providing the appearance of democratic choice for this top position17 such an election committee chose the current chief executive tung cheehwa in 1997 however it is widely accepted view in hong kong and elsewhere that the election committee chose mr tung because he was the candidate that beijing demonstrably preferred and that when mr tung speaks it is really beijing who is speaking the basic law limits chief executive to more than two consecutive fiveyear terms thus tung is eligible to be chosen again as chief executive in 2002 on the method for selecting the chief executive after 2007 the basic law states if there is need to amend the method for selecting the chief executives for the terms subsequent to the year 2007 such amendments must be made with the endorsement of twothirds majority of all the members of the legislative council and the consent of the chief executive and they shall be reported to the standing committee of the national peoples congress for approval18 hong kongs relationship with the prc less visible political debates in hong kong involve issues concerning hong kongs unique relationship with its sovereign power in beijing there appears to be for instance subtle change underway in hong kongs perception of how close its contacts with the prc should be early on in the transition process while sinobritish negotiations were continuing the broad view in hong kong was that the territorys interests would best be served by insulating it as much as possible from entanglement with mainland china there was broad support then for assuring the integrity of the hong kongchina border protecting hong kong from potentially massive migration of labor from the prc maintaining hong kongs separate currency and financial systems and other similar protections consistent with high degree of autonomy now however many in hong kong appear to be finding somewhat stifling the disciplines imposed in the name of one countrytwo systems what one observer called the tight corset of nonconjugal relations applied by sinobritish agreements broadening view in hong kong is that these special protections now appear increasingly artificial that they are actually hampering trade and other normal contacts many feel that hong kong may be losing business opportunities on the mainland to other uncorseted global competitors reflecting this official exchanges and contacts between hong kong and the prc have increased in the pasthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30895crs10 19 south china morning post june 2 2000 p 1 20 in january 2001 for instance ms regina ip hong kongs secretary for security warned local falun gong members about their activities in early february 2001 ms nellie fong member of chief executive tungs executive council was quoted in television interview as appearing to suggest that falun gong activities in hong kong would come under anti subversion laws that may be enacted under article 23 of the basic lawthree years to total of 2815 in 2000 according to the hong kong economic and trade office in washington dc taiwan falun gong some of hong kongs uneasiest public moments in its relations with china arise when the formers notions of personal liberty bump up against beijings notions of national state security these moments tend to involve taiwan as in the case when chinese official warned hong kong businesses not to do business with proindependence partners in taiwan hong kongs acting chief executive at the time strongly defended hong kongs ability to trade freely saying in our view business decisions are best left to businessmen and should not invite the interference of any official of whatever status19 another notable policy difference involves the falun gong spiritual group which beijing has banned as an illegal evil cult posing the severest of security threats to the nation in china public security bureau officials routinely round up falun gong followers and impri them in hong kong however falun gong is legally registered group whose members can practice freely exercise and meditate publicly and petition the government without retribution to date the hong kong government has resisted pressure from beijing to adopt different policies on both trade with taiwan and on the treatment of falun gong still pressure continues both from beijing and from within hong kong to adhere more to beijings line on such issues20 antisubversion laws related to hong kongs continuing policy differences with china about personal liberti are ongoing concerns about the potential enactment of antisubversion laws in hong kong such laws in china are broadly interpreted to include wide range of activities often considered benign and nonthreatening in the united states such as peaceful public demonstrations and public criticism of government decisions although the hong kong government has not enacted any antisubversion laws article 23 of the basic law directs hong kong to enact its own laws to prohibit subversive activities against the chinese government debate is continuing in hong kong over the prospects for such laws and how they are likely to be enforced government opinion polls since early in 2000 many feel beijing has begun to grow increasingl anxious about public criticism of the hong kong government and the chief executive according to one observer beijing has come to believe that hong kong civil servants have sometimes openly undermined tungs policies consequently chinese leaders early in 2000 were thought to have taken steps to try to bolster tungs popularity ratings and rally the government apparatus to support him these perceptions were bolstered by allegations in widespread hong kong news reports that an aide to hong kongs chief executive had pressured university political scientist to stop continued polling of public opinion about mr tung and the hong kong government meeting chinese leaders held with honghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30895crs11 21 interview with hong kong scholar december 2000 22 observers pointed out in particular the very public tirade of chinas party secretary jiang zemin against hong kongs media on october 27 2000 23 on april 17 2000 mr tung was quoted in rthk radio 3 interview as making the following statement about press freedom in reality hong kongs press freedom freedom of speech freedom of publication are protected by the basic lawas chief executive i shall continue to implement the basic law which protects the freedom of the presskong business tycoons which was portrayed in the press as an effort to pressure the tycoons to support mr tung for second term and chinese vicepremier qian qichens reported statement to hong kongs chief secretary anson chan that he encouraged her to better support mr tung statement described in some hong kong press accounts as scolding for not giving more vocal support to mr tung according to one scholar china finds it painful to have to support tung openly risking criticism of interference because of beijings determination to demonstrate to the world and especially to taiwan that china can be trusted to keep its international agreements21 negative opinion polls about mr tung are thought to be particularly disturbing to beijing because of the prevailing public perception that china strongly supported his selection any inadequacies in mr tungs administration therefore reflect poorly on beijing and yet chinese leaders are constrained by international agreement from taking any direct action even more troubling to beijing is the credibility problem it faces if dissatisfaction with tungs policies in hong kong remains high if an election committee were to reelect tung in 2002 despite widespread and measurable public discontent with his policies beijing would find it difficult to disassociate itself from responsibility for tungs selection freedom of the press the broad general view in hong kong remains that the press in hong kong is still raucous and boisterously free but that there also is some eviden ce of growing political pressure being exerted on the press to curb negative reporting according to individual accounts this pressure appears related to the hong kong governments political problems beijings concerns about declining public support for the chief executive some reporters suggest has translated into greater pressure on hong kongs media to be less critical of the chief executive and of hong kong government decisions beijings criticism of the hong kong press through intimidating comments by chinese leaders and critical articles in chinese official media is only the most visible source of this pressure22 the less visible sources of pressure are hong kongs newspaper owners themselves most of whom have significant business and economic interests with the mainland which they want to protect in addition some reporters felt that in cases of controversy over media reporting there has been strong defense of the press or of press freedom by hong kongs chief executive23 or byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30895crs12 24 anson chan longtime hong kong civil servant

the exception was the case of willy lam longtime south china morning post reporter editor and columnist who had written column that appeared june 27 2000 alleging chinese leaders were pressuring hong

working for an international newspaper based in hong kong november 2000 27 from interviews with western journalists supported by an interview with us diplomat in hong kong novemberdecember 2000other senior hong kong officials with the exception of the chief secretary anson chan24 with one exception one interviewed recalled an instance where an official from either beijing or hong kong had interfered directly in press report or had put direct pressure on reporter to kill or change story25 instead according to some press freedom in hong kong is being attacked at the fringes26 and succumbs at times to selfcensorship while straight news reporting of events in the mainland is still unfettered these critics say there now is less editorial comment in newspapers or periodicals less analysis of the news and less effort to identify trends and determine what they mean moreover according to these reporters some issue areas in hong kong are widely seen to be offlimits to the media entirely including stories reporting on the activities in hong kong of the peoples liberation army pla garrison the chinese liaison office clo the chinese communist party ccp and chinas ministry of foreign affairs mofa coverage of issues involving taiwan is also considered to be extremely sensitive and the one area where beijing is most likely to overstep by attempting to intervene directly27 but while some reporters sense pressure at the margins on hong kongs media others see particular change in press freedoms the primary problem for the press in hong kong they say is lack of access to information the same problem hong kong s press had under british rule as well some reporters speculate that critical statements from chinese leaders in particular party secretary jiangs explosive tirade of october 27 2000 actually are sign of beijings frustration at its lack of control over the content of hong kong reporting questioned about the controversial case of willy lam the south china morning post reporter who had written an article alleging undue beijing pressure on hong kong business tycoons and who had resigned rather than agree to having his chinareporting duties at the paper changed some reporters pointed out that even though lams article included unflattering implications about the controlling shareholder of lams newspaper robert kuok the paper still had published the column httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30895crs13 28 overholt william hong kong politics the second transition begins in nomura asia january 19 2001 p 2 other longterm trends apart from political trends and issues involving press freedom observers note number of other continuing and competing trends as hong kong proceeds in its transition several saw the most significant developments in hong kong to be cultural rather than political according to these observers hong kong is becoming distinctly more cantonese and less western city not unexpected development given the change in sovereignty some suggested that even now less than four years after the handover the chief executives personal style of governance resembles more the autocratic and patriarc hal style of mainland chinese communist leaders than it does those of developed democracies moreover this cultural trend appears inexorable with hong kong finding its identity tied more closely to china as each year passes as china continues to improve its infrastructure for example including in the transportation and housing sectors some hong kong residents may even find it more economical and attractive to live in china and commute to hong kong further blurri ng the cultural and physical boundaries between the two related to this trend is spirited debate over what kind of future hong kong wants for itself what amounts to an identity crisis this debate over identity has been underway since shortly after the handover and it appears to have multiple roots in part it is related to the special identity hong kong acquired during the early and mid1970s as the gateway to china through which western capital and business knowhow could gain special advantage in the mysterious and potentially vast china market hong kongs current identity crisis also appears based on its assessment that beijings willingness to grant hong kong high degree of autonomy has been based largely on the many benefits chinas own economy has derived from hong kongs exceptional economic performance and superior economic management what one observer has referred to as life and death for hong kong28 thus hong kongs ability to continue to generate these purely economic benefits for china has crucial political implications for hong kongs future some parts of the hong kong community stress that hong kong can only remain competitive by strengthening its current standing as an international financial and services center others believe hong kong should focus on gaining prominence as hightechnology manufacturing center still another trend is the growing fear of some that hong kongs wealthy elite are growing wealthier more politically powerful and less accountable to government this group has enviable access to top chinese leaders and stands to benefit enormously from mainlandstyle politics which emphasize personal connection over institutional authority some believe that this group shares beijings interest in forestalling the expansion of political pluralism in hong kong and assuring control by small hong kong elite of which they would be the principal members some also fear that in light of rampant official corruption in china this groups great wealth could be used to undermine the long tradition of rule of law in hong kong and affecthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30895crs14 29 see for example gilley bruce beijing tightens its grip in far eastern economic review january 25 2001hong kong government decisions while at the same time rendering the groups members immune from official sanction relatedly some see signs that over the longer term hong kongs government may be less open to criticism less responsive to public demands and less resistant to the demands of those with powerful personal connections29 there has been particular speculation about whether the departure of chief secretary anson chan in late april 2001 signals seachange in hong kong along these lines mrs chan has long been seen to be the governments strongest advocate and defender of hong kongs autonomy among other positions she supported the rights of falun gong practitioners in hong kong to continue their activities despite the groups having been banned as an evil cult in china she has also forcefully advocated delaying indefinitely the passage of antisubversion legislation favored by beijing and strongly defended the rights of the hong kong business community to do business with pro independence partners in taiwan some have suggested that beijings opposition to mrs chans principled outspokenness was the reason for her decision on january 12 2001 to step down early finally despite the concerns sometimes raised about beijings encroachment and hong kongs problems of governance there appears to be broad perception in hong kong that freedom of expression and political activism are more apparent now than ever before moreover many see this trend also as inexorable and likely to put even greater pressure on the government public dissatisfaction with current governmental decisions for instance is widely known and reported and is capabl of forcing the government to action public debate over issues remains diverse and dynamic and public sentiment about the government will continue to be measured and made known even as the election committee convenes in 2002 for its decision over the next chief executive assessment and implications china appears to remain keenly interested in the success of hong kong and of the one countrytwo systems formula in addition beijing assiduously appears to be trying to live up to its promises not to be involved in the daily running of hong kong beijing is practically invisible in the words of one american official in hong kong and so the possibilities for chinese interference in hong kong have faded perceptibly as issues that generate public concern nevertheless beijing seems to have become slightly less invisible on the hong kong scene since early in 2000 chinese leaders apparently feel themselves to be under increasing pressure to react to and even to defend hong kong government decisions in an environment of increasing criticism since the handover issues involving hong kong largely have ceased to command much attention in the united states nevertheless hong kong continues to be confronted with significant and uniqu challenges that put extra pressure on government decision makers officials in hong kong must deal with growing rangehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30895crs15 of issues social welfare programs housing industrial competitiveness education upon which there is an increasingly diverse public debate they must operate in governmental setting in which normal dialogue with their own capital beijing is not only greatly constrained by international agreement but subject to continual international scrutiny ultimately the verdict on hong kongs ability to be successful and autonomous will have implications for the international communitys significant investments and economic interests in hong kong for the credibili ty of chinas international commitments and for the future of taiwans relationship with china observers from within and outside hong kong continue to watch for signs of unwarranted chinese intervention what one hong kong government observer referred to as beijings fingerprints in hong kongs affairs although hong kongs reversion to chinese sovereignty is progressing without major incident the bush administration and members of congress will be faced with several decision points as the transition continues to unfold us policymakers will have to assess the impact of the march 2001 departure of chief secretary anson chan regarded as the principal government defender of hong kongs autonomy and major link of continuity with hong kongs past they will have to assess whether in 2002 the special election committee actually appears to be reflecting measurable public preference in its votin g for hong kongs next chief executive and thus whether that choice appears either to validate or subvert the notion of hong kong autonomy ultimately assessing hong kongs future decisions solely on the basis of an autonomy litmus test is likely to prove increasingly problematic for us policymakers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30895crs16 appendix i chronology of significant developments in hong kong 011201 chief
