natural resources policy division summary electric utilities have been subject to comprehensive federal and state economi c regulation since enactment of the public utilities holding company act of 193 5 puhca and the federal power act this regulatory framework remained virtuall unchanged between 1935 and 1978 the oil embargoes of the 1970s created concerns about the security of the nations electricity supply leading to enactment of the publi c utility regulatory policies act of 1978 purpa for the first time utilities wer required to purchase power from outside sources this first incremental change to traditional electricity regulation started movement towards marketoriented approach to electricity supply following th enactment of purpa two basic issues stimulated calls for further change whether to encourage nonutility generation and whether to permit utilities to diversify into non regulated activities the energy policy act of 1992 epact increased competition in the electri c generati ng sector by creating new entities that can generate and sell electricity t wholesale without being regulated as utilities under puhca purpa began to shif t more regulatory responsibilities to the federal government and epact continued that shift away fr om the states by creating new options for utilities and regulators to mee t electricity demand as the electric utility restructuring debate evolves additional policy issues to b addressed may include federalstat jurisdictional roles stranded cost recovery industry structure and noneconomic regulatory factorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98419crs2 puhca is title i f the public utility act of 1935 49 stat 803 1935 15 us code 79 et1 seq pl 95617 92 stat 3117 116 us code 26012electric utilities have been subject to comprehensive federal and state economi c regulation since 1935 electricity service has been considered natural monopoly meaning that th industry has 1 an inherent tendency toward declining longterm costs 2 high threshold investment and 3 technological conditions that limit the number f potential entrants the federal regulation scheme was codified in 1935 with the passage of the fede ral utility act its two components the federal power act and the publi c utilities holding company act of 1935 puhca defined the nature of federal electric1 utility regulation until the passage of public utility regulatory policies act of 197 8 purpa2 as the electric utility industry evolved flaws with the natural monopoly theor became more apparent first there is nothing natural about utilitys monopoly t provide electric service because exclusive franchises in the utilitys service area ar granted by gove rnment second several utilities primarily some municipals coops and publicly owned utilities do not own all of their generating facilities for these utilities contractual arrangements rather than unified control have been adequate to meet thei r obligation to serve their customers in an efficient manner basic purpa provisions purpa was in part intended to augment electric utility generation with mor efficient ly produced electricity and to provide equitable rates to electric consumers purpa created new type of wholesale generators called qualifying facilities qfs purpa addressed several major modifications in the economic regulation of electri c power facilities including interconnection planning cogeneration rates and smal l hydroelectric facility regulation purpa injected the federal government as regulator into the domain of economic regulation of electric power that formerly was th responsibility of the states qfs are exempt from regulation under puhca and the federal power act fpa by purpa two types of generators can be cert ified with ferc as qf to gain purpa benefits small power producer and cogenerator qualifying small powe r production facility is def ined in the fpa as an electric generator that meets certain ferc rules including requirem ents regarding fuel use fuel efficiency and reliability 16 usc 791a825r cogeneration is the s equential production of both electric energy and steam or other forms of usefu l energy such as heat which are used for industrial commercial heating or cooling purposes to be considered qf cogenerator must meet fer c ownership and operatio nal requirements that are similar to those required of small power producers avoided costs departing from traditional utility rate regulation purpa shifted the price basis for wholesale electricity from the sellers cost to the purchasers cost under purpa th ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98419crs3 edison electric institute 1996 capacity and generation nonutility sources of energy 3 october 1997 page 7 pl 95620 signed into law on november 9 1978 4local utility must purchase all power produced by qfs in their service area at avoide d cost ferc adopted rules under purpa to define avoided cost the likely costs for both energy and f acilities that would have been incurred by the purchasing utility if that utility had to provide its ow n generating capacity purpa raised some doubt as to whether the avoided cost concept was consistent with constitutional just compensation requirements but these fifth amendment concerns were obviated in 1986 kansas city power light co v state corporation commission the rules requiring electri c utilities to pay cogenerators and small power producers avoided cost were found not to take property without just compensation in instances where the electric utility coul d charge ratepayers avoided cost and earn profit state rate regulators have wide latitude in establishing the procedure to assig n avoided costs initia lly avoided costs were frequently set too high resulting in more qf power than host utilities could reliably transmit or sell this became large problem i n some parts of the united states particularly california to avoid this problem man states are now using bidding systems to determine avoided costs in these systems nonutility generators bid to provide the cheapest power to utilities these biddin g systems are intended to substitute for ratemaking approvals of power purchas transactions but participating state utility commissions still determine ground rules fo r these auctions and provide oversight bidding resu lts in more competitively based price putting the emphasis back onto the sell ers costs rather than the purchasers avoided cost new entrants to electricity markets with the introduction of purpa the federal government opened the electricit generating sector to other entrants and raised questions about the natural monopol justification of generation owner ship and regulation the emergence of qfs increased the diversity of generation own ership to degree according to the edison electric institute in 1996 nonutility generating capacity was approximately 11 of the us total approximately 77 of this nonutility capacity is from cogenerators and small powe r producers ie qfs 3 in addition to purpa the fuel use act of 1978 fua helped qfs becom e4 established under fua utilities were not permitted to use natural gas to fuel ne w generati ng technology qfs which are not utilities were able to take advantage f abundant natural gas as well as new generating technology such as combinedcycle and fluidized bed combustion these techno logies lowered the financial threshold for entrance into the electricity gene ration business as well as shortened the lead time for constructing new plants fua was repealed i n 1987 but by this time qfs and small power producers had already gained portion of the total electricity supply market this ability to build relatively small but economic generating capacity along wit h the utilities reluctance to build additional capacity encouraged some to enter into th electricity supply business without meeting the requirements to be qf these entities called independent power producers ipps sell power at wholesale only however httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98419crs4 for discussion on competitive bidding see poling parker abel holt kiefer kaufman 5 electricity new regulatory order prepared for the house committee on energy an d commerce committee print 102f june 1991 p 101102because they are not qfs they are not afforded the protections of purpa and mos t importantl they were not exempt from puhca most utilities find regulation unde r puhca t be restrictive and burdensome in addition puhca is seen by some to be barrier to electricity market entry by nonutility businesses the influx of qf power challenged the costbased rates that previously guide d wholesale transactions before implementation of purpa ferc approved wholesal interstate electricity transactions based on the sellers costs to generate and transmit th power as more nonutility generators entered the market in the 1980s these fer c approved costbased rates were questioned since nonutility generators typically do not have enough market power to influence the rates they charge ferc began approvin g certain wholesale transactions whose ra tes were result of competitive bidding process these rates are called marketbased rates 5 this first incremental c hange to traditional electricity regulation started movement towards marketoriented approach to electricity supply currently most nonq f cogenerators and small power producers are affiliated with parent utility companies and are not tr uly independent of regulated utilities independent and affiliated powe r producers began to blur the status and obligations of utility regulation at both the federal and state levels the issues of whether to encourage independent power producers and whether to permit utility diversification into nonregulated markets resulted in call for further regulatory reform call for further reform epact following the enactment of purpa two basic issues stimulated calls for furthe r reform whether to encourage nonutility generation and whether to permit utilit diversification independent power produce rs and some utilities argued that to encourage competition in electricity supply ip ps should be exempt from puhca regulation it was seen that this exemption would encourage investment in ipp facilities before puhc reform companies that operated nonutility and utility businesses had been reluctant t build independent facilities for fear of having all their operations regulated unde r puhca additionally independent power producers argued that t heir corporate structure was being distorted and made overly complex by the machinations necessary to avoi d regulation under puhca the argued this result overly complex corporate structures was the exact opposite of the purpose of puhca the energy policy act epact increased competition in the electric generating sector by creating new entities that can generate and sell electricity at wholesale without being regulated as utilities under puhca by creating new options for utilities an d regulators to meet electricity demand the effect of epact on the electric supply system is potentially more farreaching than purpas introduction of cogenerators and smal l power producers to the electricity supply mixhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98419crs5 ferc docket number rm93100 appears in federal register vol 58 51 feb 18 19936 p 88978907 these requirements include description of the eligible facility eligibility for ewg status any7 lease arrangements with affiliated or nonaffiliated electric utilities and any requirements placed on those affiliates by state public utility commission vertical integration refers to the three components of electricity supply generation 8 transmission and distribution affiliate transactions can occur if state regulators determine that 1the commission has th e9 authority in addition to the resources to examine the financial books of the electric utilit company an d any relevant affiliates and 2 the commission determines that wholesale transfer of power between an ewg and an affiliated electric utility would benefit consumers not violate continuedhow did epact reform puhca epact established exempt wholesale generators ewgs and foreign utilit companies fucos as entities that are not considered electric utilities and are therefore exempt from the federal power act and puhca state regulators can now allow utilities to purchase electricity from ewgs at contracted marketbased rates rely on traditiona l costofservice regulation or combination of both ewgs can be constructed anywhere including foreign countries both registered and exempt holding companies unde r puhca may own and operate ewgs portion of generatin g facility can be considered an ewg if the othe r part of the facility is not owned by utility affiliated with the ewg electricity from these facilities that is sold in the united states must be sold at wholesale to utility or other generator not to retail customers in addit ion epact provides ewgs with system to assure transmission of their wholesale power to purchasers on february 11 1993 the federal energy regulatory commission ferc issued its final ewg regulations required by 711 of epact this rule covers filin g6 requirements and procedures for applicants seek ing ewg status ewg status is primarily selfreg ulating ferc requires that an applicant file sworn statements that it complie s with the st atutory requirements for ewgs applicants are guaranteed ruling on their7 application within 60 days without any public hearings ferc acknowledged som consumer groups concerns that the proposed rule did not allow for sufficient public notice and in the final rule ferc agreed to consider comments that specifically question th adequacy or accuracy of an application puhca reform under epact provides protection to consumers against financia l abuses between regulated and unregulated entities including crosssubsidization during the legislative debate opposing views were expressed on the sensibility of allowin g transactions between affiliates consumer groups and state utility commissions argue d that the risks of abovemarketcost transactions outweighed possible benefits associated with vertical integration including ewgs some utilities however argued that som e8 affiliate transactions would benefit consumers and should be allowed in the end congress expressed desire to continue protection of consumers interests but assumed that affiliate transactions if allowed at all would be subject to very stringent stat regulation also if every state commission that has jurisdiction over the electric utilitys rates approves an electric utility may purchase electricity from an affiliated ewg9httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98419crs6 continued any state law would not give an unfair competitive advantage to an ewg and would be in th public interest securities and exchange commission adoption of rules forms and form amendment s10 relati ng to exempt wholesale generators and foreign utility companies federal register vol 58 189 october 1 1993 p 5148851507 for discussion on transmission access and ferc orders 888 and 889 see issue brief 9600311 parker larry b electric utility restructuring overview of basic policy questions crs12 report for congress 97154enr january 28 1997the law also allows for state utility commissions to request financial informatio n from regulated electric utility an ewg or an affiliate of an ewg that sells electricity to regulated electric utility this will assure state regulators that the wholesale contracts that regulated electric utility enters will not degrade the reliability of electric service or be of greater financial risk than desired another consumer protection afforded by the law is that registered holding company must seek the approval of the securities an d exchange commission sec when it issues securities to purchase an ewg guarantees securitie s for an ewg or enters into any type of service maintenance or constructio n contract epact allows holding companies and ewgs to have financial interests in foreig n utility companies the securities and exchange commission was required to issue rules to protect ratepayers from any harm that might result from holding companies foreig n investment activities the sec issued its final rule on october 1 1993 in issuing it s10 rule the sec noted that sumer protection and competition are potentially inconsistent goals the commission noted that th ere is an inherent tension between the drive toward competitive energy market and the demand for eff ective consumer protection the rules required by the legislation cannot re solve this tension but must instead operate within it the rule imposes retained earnings requirement on these diversification activities allows sec access to books and records and limits the number of domestic utilit employees who could provide servi ces to both affiliated ewgs or affiliated foreign utility companies what is next one unintentional consequence of purpa was to introduce competition into th electric generating sector the main effect of the debate and enactment of epact was to continue reevaluat ion of traditional electric utility regulation purpa began to shift more regulatory responsibilities to the federal government and epact continued tha t shift away from the states this occurred without agreedupon goals for how electricity should be supplied and regulated in the future ferc has addressed some of th unresolved issues created by epact such as transmission access however as th e11 electric utility restructurin g debate evolves additional policy issues likely to be addressed include federalstate jurisdictional roles stranded cost recovery industry structure an d noneconomic regulatory factors12
