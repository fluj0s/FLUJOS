that it will not return foreign national to country where his life or freedom would be threatened this principle is embodied in several provisions of the immigration and nationality act ina most notably in provisions defining refugees and asylees aliens seeking asylum must demonstrate wellfounded fear that if returned home they will be persecuted based upon one of five characteristics race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion aliens present in the united states may apply for asylum with the united states citizenship and immigration services

has become an alternative pathway for immigration rather than humanitarian protection pr ovided in extraordinary cases others maintain that current law does not offer adequate protections for people

extent an asylum policy forged during the cold war can adapt to changing world most people who have traditionally received refugee or asylum status were fleeing communist or socialist countries from 1946 through 2000 the united states gave legal permanent resident lpr status to 35 million re fugees asylees and other humanitarian entrants over half 53 of all of these refugees and asylees were from

the 1967 united nations protocol relating to the status of refugees hereafter refugee protocol7 the refugee protocol does not require that signatory accept refugees but it does ensure that signatory nations afford certain rights and protections to aliens who meet the definition of refugee at the time the united states signed the refugee protocol congress and the administration assumed that there was need to amend the ina and that the withholding of deportation provisionsthen 243h of inawould be adequate in 1974 the ins issued its first asylum regulations as part of 8 cfr 108 prior to the passage of the refugee act of 1980 there was direct mechanism in the ina for aliens granted asylum to become legal permanent residents lprs the refugee act of 1980 codified the refugee protocols

or unwilling to return to and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country because of persecution or wellfounded fear of persecution on account of race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion8 the law defined asylees as aliens in the united states or at port of entry who meet the definition of refugee for the first time the refugee act added statutory provisions to ina that enabled those granted refugee and asylee status to become lprs after certain general requirements were met 9 the 1980 law specified that up to 5000 of the refugee admissions numbers which are set annually by presidential determination in consultation with congress could be used by the attorney general to give lpr status to aliens who had received asylum and their spouses and children and who have been physically present in the united states for one year after receiving asylum continue to meet the definition of refugee are not firmly resettled in another country and are otherwise admissible as immigrants at that time it appears that congress and the administration assumed that the 5000 ceiling would be more than adequate 10

developed due to the 5000 ceiling compounding the frustration with the backlog was the worry of many of those asylees from eastern europe thatas result of the improved political and human rights conditions in their native countriesthey longer would qualify as refugees under the law meanwhile the number of aliens filing asylum claims surpassed 100000 in 1989 the immigration act of 1990 sought among other major immigration reforms to address the backlogs in asylee adjustments to lpr status foremost it doubled the annual limit from 5000 to 10000 lpr adjustments it also allowed those asylees who had filed for lpr adjustments before june 1 1990 to do so outside of the numerical limits effectively clearing out the existing backlog the immigration act of 1990 further granted lpr status to those asylees who had qualified for lpr status as of november 29 1990 but were unable to obtain it because of the prior numerical limits and improved country conditions the crumbling of communism in eastern europe and the arias peace talks in central america gave optimism to many that the number of asylum seekers would lessen in the future 11

these asylum seekers ultimately became lprs through special laws enacted for cubans and haitians 11 in feb 1987 the presidents of salvador honduras and guatemala signed 10point peace plan for central

asylum in the united states at that time if the alien received an unfavorable decision from the immigration judge he or she also could seek administrative and judicial review of the case critics of this policy argued that illegal aliens were arriving without proper documents filing frivolous asylum claims and obtaining work authorizations while their asylum cases stalled in lengthy backlogs in the late 1980s and early 1990s the mass exodus of thousands of asylum seekers from central america cuba and haiti prompted further concerns that the thencurrent policy was unwieldy and prone to abuses because it provided for multiple levels of hearings reviews and appeals the 1993 bombing of the world trade center heightened fears that international terrorists might enter the united states with false documents file bogus asylum claims and disappear into the population supporters of the thencurrent system asserted that the regulatory reforms begun by the first bush administration and expanded by the clinton administration had already corrected the bureaucratic problems that had plagued the asylum process they emphasized that the united states was signatory to the refugee protocol and that ina codified the internationallyheld legal principle of nonrefoulement ie that an alien would not be forced to return to country where his life or freedom would be threatened they also pointed out that aliens considered to be terrorists were already excluded by law from entering the united states proponents argued that aliens fleeing the most dangerous situations were likely to escape with fraudulent documents to hide their identity and maintained therefore that even aliens lacking proper documents should be entitled to full hearing and judicial review to determine if they might be admissible the illegal immigrant reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 iirira pl 104208 made substantial changes to the asylum process establishing expedited removal proceedings codifying many regulatory changes adding time limits on filing claims and limiting judicial review in certain circumstances but it did not alter the numerical limits on asylee adjustments g7g161g153g142g141g146g157g142g141g561g20g142g150g152g159g138g149g561 among the significant modifications of the ina made by the iirira are the provisions that created the expedited removal policy 12 the goal of these provisions was to target the perceived abuses of the asylum process by restricting the hearing review and appeal process for aliens at the port of entry as result if an immigration officer determines that an alien arriving without proper documentation does not intend to apply for asylum or does not fear persecution the immigration officer can deny admission and order the alien summarily removed from the united states the amendments to ina made by iirira provide very limited circumstances for administrative and judicial review of those alie ns who are summarily excluded including those who are deemed not to have credible fear as discussed below 13 12 the iirira provisions amended 235 of ina 13 for full discussion see crs report rl33109 immigration policy on expedited removal of aliens by alison siskin and ruth ellen wasem httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32621g23g495g21g495g561g11g150g150g146g144g155g138g157g146g152g151g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561 g152g151g561g3

home must be kept in detention while their credible fear cases are pending14 if an asylum officer determines that an alien does not have credible fear of persecution the alien is removed if the asylum

iirira made to the asylum process is the requirement that all applicants must file their asylum applications within one year of their arrival to the u15s aliens may be exempted from this time

on the filing of asylum applications includes bar against those who have been denied asylum in the past unless changed circumstances materially affect their eligibility 18 the reforms also established serious consequences for aliens who file frivolous asylum applications for example the attorney general now has the authority to permanently bar an alien from receiving any benefits under the ina if

regulatory revisions of the asylum process that the former bush and clinton administrations made most notably alie ns are statutorily prohibited from immediately receiving work authorization at the

there is significant possibility taking into account the credibility of the statements made by the alien in support of the aliens claim and such other facts as are known to the officer that the alien

stem from multiple motives the courts have ruled that the persecution may have more than one motive and so long as one motive is one of the statutorily enumerated grounds the requirements have been satisfied27 1997 bia decision concluded an applicant for asylum need not show conclusively why persecution occurred in the past or is likely to occur in the future but must produce evidence from which it is reasonable to believe that the harm was motivated at least in part by an actual or imputed protected ground28 generally the asylum seeker must demonstrate in mixed motive cases that even though hisher persecutors were motivated for noncognizable reason eg the polices desire to obtain information regarding terrorist activities in the sikh casesthe persecutors were also motivated by the asylum

have statutory limits on adjustment of status after year of conditional residence they argued that it served policy function and only created unnecessary bureaucratic delays reaching 18year wait for asylees to obtain the lpr green card by the end of fy2004 some also criticized the 1000 cap on asylees who flee coercive population control policies arguing that it too was arbitrary and unfair singling out one group of asylees for differential treatment supporters of numerical limits expressed concern that unlimited asylum adjustments would have magnet effect that would encourage unauthorized migration and they maintained that the numerical limits dampen this flow of grants they pointed out that those who obtain asylum are permitted to stay in the united states and thus have

seeker should provide evidence which corroborates otherwise credible testimony such evidence must be provided unless the applicant does not have the evidence or cannot obtain the evidence without leaving the united states it would have required an alien applying for withholding of removal to be subject to the same credibility determinations and burdens as an alien applying for asylum it would have provided that court shall reverse determination as made by trier of fact with respect to the availability of corroborating evidence in either asylum or withholding of removal cases unless the court finds that reasonable trier of fact would be compelled to conclude that such corroborating evidence is unavailable 57 for legal analysis of hr 418 see crs report rl32754 immigration analysis of

as passed by the house the border protection antiterrorism and illegal immigration control act of 2005 hr 4437 had several provisions on which advocates for asylum seekers expressed concern foremost 407 of hr 4437 would have mandated that expedited removal be applied to all aliens except those from canada and mexico encountered within 100 miles of an international land border who have not been in the united states more than 14 days in addition title ii of hr 4437 would have upgraded the consequences of illegal presence from civil offense to criminal offense since many asylum seekers arrive without proper documents or are in the united states illegally when they claim asylum some argued the bill would have subjected them to mandatory detention and generally barred them forever from obtaining asylum and subjected them to arrest by state and local law enforcement who encounter them 59 others pointed out that hr 4437 retained the protections in current law for aliens who express fear of persecution or an intention to seek asylum the opportunity for credible fear determination when the 109 th congress closed the major immigration reform proposals remained pending 58 us house

would seek asylum in the united states hoping to remain hidden among the hundreds of thousands of pending asylum cases critics point to asylum seekers from countries of special concern ie saudi arabia syria iran north korea china pakistan egypt lebanon jordan afghanistan yemen and somalia as potential national security risks some argue further thatsince asylum is discretionary form of immigration reliefnational security risks should outweigh humanitarian concerns and thus asylum relief should be restricted and judicial review of asylum cases more limited others point out that asylum seekers are subject to multiple national security screenings and thatif an asylum seeker is suspected or known terroristthe law already bars alien terrorists they argue that the extent to which security risks exist the risks result more from the limited intelligence data on terrorism rather than an expansive asylum policy some assert further that asylees from countries of special concern may be beneficial to us national security because they may have useful information that assists in the war on terrorism much like assistance provided by communist defectors during the cold war opponents of limiting the judicial review of asylum cases contend that it would erode two traditional values of us politythe right to due process and freedom from repression and persecution

asylum policy the first contacts many asylum seekers have with the us government are with customs and border protection cbp inspectors border patrol officers and immigration and customs enforcement ice agents whom some maintain are not adequately trained in asylum policy and other humanitarian forms of immigration relief they maintain that these cbp officers and ice agents are front line law enforcement who are so geared up to protect against potential terrorists criminals and other threats that the they may not be flexible enough to recognize bona fide asylum seekers they also question whether there is sufficient communication among the key immigration agencies cbp eoir ice and uscis others point out that the cbp inspectors border patrol officers and ice agents follow the policy and procedural guidelines to ensure that aliens who express fear of returning home are given the opportunity to have their fears considered by an asylum officer andor an immigration judge they maintain

aliens who express fear of persecution or an intention to seek asylum the opportunity for credible fear determination they usually cite statistics indicating that more than 90 of aliens who express fear are deemed to be credible pass their credible fear hearing and are able to bring their cases to an immigration judge they also note that the us commission on international religious freedom uscirf study found that dhs has manda tory procedures in place to ensure that asylum seekers are protected under expedited removal 62 testifying on the issue of expedited removal c stewart verdery jr formerly assistant secretary for border and transportation security policy and planning in dhs concluded i am heartened to see that internal and external reviews of the asylum process largely have concluded that dhs has handled this subset of cases appropriately 63 critics of expedited removal maintain that lowlevel immigration officers authority to order removal is virtually unchecked the officers decision to place the person in expedited rather than regular removal proceedings they argue can result in the person losing substantive rights indeed they assert that there have been reports of abuse of the procedure since it was first implemented at the ports of entry and many indivi duals with valid claims have been erroneously removed64 critics refer to one investigation that found cases where aliens had requested the opportunity to apply for asylum but were refused and pushed back at primary inspection65

who main tains that detention of asylum seekers is inherently undesirable66 detention is psychologically damaging some further argue to an already fragile population that includes aliens who are escaping from imprisonment and torture in their countries asylum seekers are often detained with criminal aliens practice that many consider inappropriate and unwarranted some contend that congress should provide for alternatives to detention eg electronic monitoring for asylum seekers in expedited removal others argue that the mandatory detention of asylum seekers provision should be deleted 61

any alien who poses criminal or national security risk proponents for current law warn that releasing asylum seekers in expedited removal undermines the purpose of expedited removal and creates an avenue for bogus asylum seekers to enter the united states they argue that mandatory detention of asylum seekers is an essential tool in maintaining immigration control and homeland security any loosening of these policies they allege would divert the cbp and ice officers fr om their homeland security duties to track down wayward asylum seekers supporters of current law also contend that it sends clear signal of deterrence to aliens who consider using asylum claims as mechanism to enter illegally 67

are several key points of comparison both na tions have history of repressive governments with documented human rights violations both countries have history of sending asylum seekers to the united states by boats finally although us immigration law is generally applied neutrally without regard to country of origin there are special laws and agreements pertaining to cubans and haitians despite these points of similarity the treatment of cubans fleeing to the united states differs from that of haitians 68 many observe that cuban migrants receive more generous treatment under us law than haitians or foreign nationals from any other country69 as consequence of special migration agreements with cuba wet footdry foot practice toward cuban migrants has evolved put simply cubans who do not reach the shore ie dry land are interdicted and returned to cuba unless they cite fears of persecution those cubans who successfully reach the shore are inspected for entry by dhs and generally permitted to stay and adjust under the cuban adjustment act caa the following year despite what some consider generous treatment of cubans there are others who charge that the forced return of cubans interd icted at sea violates the spirit if not the letter of us asylum and refugee law critics maintain that the haitians are being sing led out for more restrictive treatment than any other group of asylum seekers 70 haitians interdicted at sea are repatriated as are cubans however critics charge that haitians who reach the united states are more likely to be detained and less likely to be paroled after the credible fear determination71 the administration maintains that paroling haitians as is typically done for aliens who meet the credible fear threshold may 67 for further analysis of

persecution as was done for resistance to coercive population control policies proponents argue that those aliens fleeing such acts as female genital mutilation fmg rape by military or police forces honor killings or domestic violence are not adequately protected by the ina because the alien must demonstrate that the abuse was based on race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion they contend that the judicial decisions thus far have been contradictory and often cite attorney general john ashcrofts announcement that he is reconsidering the decision of his predecessor attorney general janet reno to vacate the bia ruling denying asylum to guatemalan woman who sought asylum based on repeated domestic violence by her husband 72 they assert that amending the ina to add gender as basis would strengthen the policy clarify the ambiguities resulting from varied judicial decisions and speed up the lengthy asylum adjudication process others maintain that current law affords sufficient protections for aliens fleeing genderbased violence and persecution they cite the legal guidance for asylum officers issued in 1995 that stated severe sexual abuse does not differ analytically from beatings torture or other forms of physical violence that are commonly held to amount to persecution73 supporters of current law point out that the bia held in matter of kasinga that subjective punitive or malignant intent is not required for harm to constitute persecution and set the precedent for asylum on the basis of fmg in1996 74 they assert that adding gender as basis for asylum would impose western cultural norms as well as create migration magnet for women living in maledominated cultures and countries
