developments lead up to elections the political environment in indonesia will increasingly be shaped by the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for 2009 it is thought that rising food and energy prices have to an extent undermined popular electoral support for the president there was reportedly widespread discontent with his decision to increase the price of subsidized fuel by 287 in may 20081 it is likely that president susilo bambang yudhoyonos support from coalition partners beyond his own small democrat party will be increasingly limited as elections near yudhoyonos main rival is likely to be former president megawati sukarnoputri yudhoyonos popularity dropped in one poll held 10 days after the fuel price hike from 381 in december 2007 to 207 while megawatis approval rate increased from 274 to 304 over the same period2 despite these factors some observers believe that yudhoyono may be reelected to second fiveyear term as president in 2009 others are less sure the election will probably be contest between well established political figures yudhoyonos political situation will also likely mean that he will be very cautious on islamic issues and economic policy in the run up to the polls the general election commission of indonesia kpu3 has announced that it is planning on shifting the general parliamentary election date to april 8 or 9 2009 the indonesian house of representatives dpr previously directed the kpu to set the date to be eligible to run in the parliamentary elections party must have broad representation in twothirds of indonesias 33 provinces much media attention has been directed at the recent electoral performance of the prosperous justice party pks that has more islamist agenda than the mainstream political

president is now directly elected by popular vote under existing rules parties must have 3 of the seats of the dpr to nominate presidential candidate6 in june 2008 the dpr was debating proposed legislation that would change this requirement the governments proposal to raise the threshold to 15 of house seats or 20 of the popular vote for parties or coalitions was supported by indonesian democratic partystruggle pdip while golkar and the national awakening parties favor an increase of the minimum threshold for political parties or coalitions to 30 of house seats smaller parties such as the national mandate party prefer allowing all parties that qualify for parliamentary election to be able to name presidential candidates7 religious freedom indonesias reputation as moderate muslim nation has come under scrutiny as the ahmediya minority sect as well as moderate groups that support religious freedom have come under attack by small religious extremist groups in recent months the governments response appears to seek to avoid alienating both religious extremists and moderates on the one hand the government issued decree banning the sect from spreading its message on the other hand it pledged not to persecute ahmediya its move to arrest those extremists that used violence against moderates demonstrating in support of religious tolerance also demonstrates the governments desire to place limits on how far the extremists can go most muslims do not believe ahmadiyyah are true muslims because they do not believe that mohammad was the last prophet many see the issue as indicative of the extent to which the government will bend to religious extremists at the cost of minority groups rights to freedom of religion the extremist komando laskar islam thought to be affiliated with the islamic defenders front fpi attacked an alliance of moderate groups known as the national alliance for freedom of religion and faith that was demonstrating peacefully in support of religious freedom on june 1 2008 at the indonesian national monument square monas in jakarta the fpi has in the past been involved with demonstration against the us embassy and the offices of playboy

bilateral relations between the united states and indonesia at the statetostate level have improved much in recent years this improvement in relations is seen to be the result of common security

the election of president sb yudhoyono who is generally seen as reformoriented the goodwill towards and increased understanding of indonesia in the united states in the wake of the december 26 2004

issues may yet limit the extent of the bilateral relationship particularly in the area of militarytomilitary cooperation should new human rights abuses occur others attitudes towards indonesia may

of president george bush moved to open international military and education and training imet foreign military financing fmf and foreign military sales fms programs for indonesia this was viewed by many as first step toward normalizing the militarytomilitary relationship indonesia has been key player in the war against terror in southeast asia and as an increasingly important geopolitical actor

new zealand and india in addition to the asean states china japan and korea other countries led by china reportedly favored more exclusive grouping that left out india australia and new zealand this move was viewed by some observers as favorable to american interests sunny tanuwidjaja the east asian summit and indonesia the jakarta post february 1 2006 crs6 strong commitment to reform to recognition of human rights and to fighting corruption18 during the cold war the united states was primarily concerned about communist influence in indonesia after the cold war congressional views on indonesia were more influenced by ongoing concerns over human rights abuses by the indonesian national defense forces tni the events of 911 added the concern of how best to pursue the war against terror in southeast asia some members of congress remain dissatisfied with progress on bringing to justice indonesian military personnel and police responsible for human rights abuses in east timor the january 2006 arrest of anthonius wamang who is thought to have led an attack near the town of timika in papua that killed two americans may resolve what has been an irritant in the relationship as the united states moved from the postcold war world to fight the war against terror human rights concerns have increasingly been weighed against american security interests and particularly the need to develop effective counterterror cooperation with indonesia to combat radical islamic groups there is also increasing appreciation of indonesias geopolitical position within southeast asia among american decisionmakers some analysts have argued that the need to obtain effective counterterror cooperation and to secure american strategic interests in the region necessitates working relationship with indonesia and its key institutions such as the military other observers take the view that the promotion of american values such as human rights and religious freedom should guide us relations with indonesia while others would put trade and investment first some have viewed military cooperation between the us military and the indonesian military during relief operations following the december 2004 tsunami in sumatra as having focused attention on the issue of the need for military to military cooperation avian flu most cases of the h5n1 virus in indonesia are thought to have been

dr ribka tjiptaning stated that there is reason to extend cooperation and breach national sovereignty22 historical background modern indonesia has been shaped by the dynamic interaction of indigenous cultures with external influences especially the succession of influences of hinduism buddhism islam dutch colonial rule and powerful and nationalistic independence movement23 the geographic definition of modern indonesia began to take shape under dutch direct colonial rule which began in 179924 the dutch east indies were occupied by japan during world war ii following the japanese surrender in 1945 independence was declared by nationalist leader sukarno after fouryear anticolonial insurrection the republic of indonesia gained its independence from the dutch in 1949 the dutch retained control of the present day territory of papua and west papua until the transition period 19631969 indonesian independence was followed by period of parliamentary democracy which was replaced in 1959 by president sukarnos guided democracy that lasted until 196525 in the late 1950s the united states provided clandestine assistance to military rebellions in outlying provinces of indonesia out of fear that the communist pki was gaining control of the country26 on september 30 1965 the military under general suharto neutralized sukarno one interpretation of events is that the military stepped in to avert communist coup in the aftermath an estimated 500000 indonesians lost their lives in riots and purges that were characterized as anti communist president suharto ruled indonesia until 1998 during this 32year period his authoritarian new order provided the political stability thought necessary by his supporters for fast paced economic growth indonesias economy grew at an average annual rate of almost 7 from 1987 to 199727 suhartos death 21 public affairs section the truth about namru2 us embassy fact sheet april 23 2008 22 dpr want government to reject namru2 sinar

designed to enhance good governance and expand democracy were implemented particularly important was 1999 law that transferred enormous authority from the central government to provincial and districtlevel government however by 2003 the momentum for reform appeared to be faltering29 president yudhoyono is thought to have moved the reform agenda forward but has been hindered by his limited support in parliament the source of legitimacy or lack thereof for government has changed for the indonesian people over time the dutch colonial administration was viewed as illegitimate the sukarno presidency sought to base its rule on moral concepts but it did not provide sufficient economic development this was subsequently provided by president suharto until 1997 when the asian financial crisis undermined his ability to do so at that point with economic growth declining indonesians were longer prepared to accept what was increasingly viewed as corrupt and authoritarian regime this brought on the era of democratic reform whose energy prior to 2004 had appeared to be dissipating before fully completing its goal of instituting responsive and representative government political transition indonesia has done much to consolidate its democratic reform process following the suharto era since his departure civil society has expanded and vigorous and open media has emerged in addition to the first direct election of the president the military longer has seats in parliament and the police have separated from the military indonesia has made significant progress toward institutionalizing its democracy and more firmly establishing civil society30 the general elections commission functioned well during the 2004 elections31 indonesias parliamentary elections in april

limited32 structure of parliament indonesias national legislative structure consists of three separate bodies first is house of representatives dpr of 550 members elected from party lists in multiseat districts the dpr has the primary role in passing laws second is 128seat regional representative council dpd whose members are elected directly third is the peoples consultative assembly mpr which is composed of members of both the dpr and the dpd it is responsible for passing constitutional amendments and conducting presidential impeachments the role of the military the indonesian national defense force tni is generally regarded as the strongest institution in indonesia its origins date to the struggle for independence the tni traditionally has been internally focused playing key role in indonesian politics and preserving the territorial integrity of the nation largely from internal threats rather than focusing on external security concerns its strong tradition of secular nationalism has acted to help integrate the nation the key elements of the military in indonesia are the army strategic reserve command the army special forces command other special forces and the military regional commands there are also air force and naval commands while the military now has less formal role in the politics of the nation than it had in the suharto era it remains key actor behind the scenes33 some observers are concerned about its indirect influence over politics the indonesian military has attracted negative attention through its past involvement with human rights abuses in east timor aceh papua and maluku although current problems appear largely limited to papua and west papua during the initial period of reform the tni officially abandoned the doctrine of dwifungsi or dual function which gave it an official role in the politics of the nation34 appointed members to the legislative bodies from the military were removed while the police were separated from the tni efforts were also begun to more firmly establish civilian control of the armed forces supporters of the reform agenda in indonesia would like to see additional measures taken including reform of the armys territorial structure full withdrawal of the military from business activities and improving the militarys sensitivity to human rights35 32 damien kingsbury indonesia 2007 asian

angel rabasa and john haseman the military and democracy in indonesia challenges continued crs10 the tni budget is thought to be to large extent selfgenerated this part of the tni budget is largely outside governmental control the tni has emerged from the reformasi period with its territorial command structure intact even as it lost its military representatives in parliament36 the tni will likely continue to play key role in the evolution of the indonesian polity in the years ahead it could continue to play largely constructive role supporting democratic change or at least not obstructing it or it could act to slow change it will also likely seek to preserve its prominent place in indonesian society37 while slowed there are still signs that the reform process continues in indonesia policy document to guide the government in its efforts to take over tni controlled businesses was commissioned in 2008 as of june 2008 it was reported that the tni controlled some 1520 business units 1071 cooperatives and 25 foundations in indonesia 2004 law requires the tni to get out of business by 200938 the dpr was also to consider legislation in 2008 to amend law on military tribunals to allow military personnel to be tried in civilian courts for civilian crimes39 it is thought that such moves would at least in part limit the tnis independence from civilian authority autonomous and secessionist movements centerperiphery tensions between the dominant javanese culture and minority groups in outlying regions have been sources of political instability and strife for the indonesian state there are signs that indonesia is adapting its approach to such tensions to alleviate autonomous or secessionist tension this relatively more moderate approach has reached accommodation where other efforts to quell indonesias fissiparous tendencies have failed the primary security threats to indonesia are generally thought to come from within the political center of the indonesian archipelago is located in jakarta on java the densely populated island where 60 of indonesias population lives traditionally power has extended from java out to the outlying areas of indonesia this has been true both under dutch rule when jakarta was known as batavia and the modern indonesian state throughout its history there has been resistance in peripheral areas to this

ethnic cultural andor religious identities very different from those of java such diversity has led to debate about whether indonesia is an organic state or an artificial creation of dutch colonial rule analysis of early indonesian history reveals level of integration in terms of economics and trade if not extensive political unity while early indigenous empires were precursors of the indonesian state political unity is generally considered to have been product of dutch colonial rule including series of lengthy wars to subdue outlying islands and independent political units it has been suggested that key lesson of indonesian history is that unifying the archipelago administratively can only be done by the use of force40 forces of economic integration or the creation of national identity stemming from the nationalist movement which started in java in 190841 could be viewed as other integrative forces east timor the portuguese whose influence in timor dates to the 1600s gave up control of the island in 1975 with the portuguese departure three main parties emerged of these frente revolucionaria do timor leste independente fretelin leftist leaning group soon emerged as the dominant party on december 7 1975 indonesia invaded east timor with the then tacit compliance of the united states and australia42 indonesia australia and the united states are thought to have been concerned that east timor would turn into another soviet satellite state similar to cuba third of the population of east timor is thought to have died as result of fighting or warinduced famine during the subsequent guerilla war fought by fretelin against indonesias occupation43 on august 30 1999 east timorese voted overwhelmingly to become an independent nation 986 of those registered to vote in the referendum voted with 785 rejecting integration with indonesia in the wake of the vote prointegrationist militias attacked proindependence east timorese and destroyed much of east timors

package being offered by then president habbibie44 it is thought that the tni had two key reasons for trying to forestall an independent east timor first there was an attachment to the territory after having fought to keep it as part of indonesia second was the fear that east timorese independence would act as catalyst for further secession in aceh and papua the subsequent devastation of east timor may have been meant as warning to others who might seek to follow its secessionist example some believe that tni involvement in the violence stemmed largely from local rogue elements others believe that it was orchestrated higher up in the military command structure 45 east timor gained independence in 2002 since that time indonesia and east timor have worked to develop good relations the joint commission of truth and friendship was established to deal with past crimes46 2500 page report issued in early 2006 by the east timorese commission for reception truth and reconciliation cavr which was given to united nations general secretary kofi annan found indonesia responsible for abuses of east timorese during its period of rule over east timor the report reportedly found that up to 180000 east timorese died as result of indonesian rule47 this created tension in the bilateral relationship between indonesia and east timor nevertheless then east timorese president xanana gusmao and president yudhoyono reaffirmed their commitment to continue to work to resolve differences between the two countries48 the united nations tribunal which included the serious crimes investigation unit shut down in may 2005 during its sixyear operation the tribunal convicted some east timorese militia members for their role in the atrocities of 1999 but was unable to extradite any indictees from

independence aceh was one of the last areas to come under dutch control its struggle for independence from indonesia was once again taken up by the group gerakan aceh merdeka gam until peace agreement was reached in the wake of the december 2004 tsunami which killed over 130000 people and devastated much of aceh the peace agreement signed by gam and the government of indonesia in helsinki in august of 2005 brought an end to conflict that claimed an estimated 15000 lives under the agreement partial autonomy was granted to aceh as was the right to retain 70 of oil and gas revenue the recently resolved struggle dates to 1976 in the late 1980s many of gams fighters received training in libya gam then began to reemerge in aceh this triggered suppression by the tni from which gam eventually rebounded former president megawati then called on the military to once again suppress the free aceh movement this was the largest military operation for the tni since east timor the decision to take

indonesian provinces of west papua and papua west papua and papua have population of approximately two million and an area of approximately 422000 square kilometers which represents about 21 of the land mass and less than 1 of the population of indonesia papua has long land border with papua new guinea to the east about 12 million of the inhabitants of west papua and papua are indigenous peoples from about 250 different tribes the rest have transmigrated to the region from elsewhere in indonesia there are about 250 language groups in the region papuans are mostly christians and animists the province is rich in mineral resources and timber57 papuans are melanesian people and are distinct from the malay people of the rest of the indonesian archipelago like indonesia papua and west papua were part of the dutch east indies many papuans have sense of identity that is different from the main malay and predominately muslim identity of the rest of the indonesian archipelago and many favor autonomy or independence from indonesia58 papua did not become part of indonesia at the time of indonesias independence in 1949 the dutch argued that its ethnic and cultural difference justified dutch control until later date under president sukarno indonesia began mounting military pressure on dutch west papua in 1961 the united states sponsored talks between indonesia and the dutch and proposed transfer of authority over papua to the united nations under the agreement the united nations was to conduct an act of free choice to determine the political status of papua the act of free choice was carried out in 1969 after indonesia had assumed control over papua in 1963 the act of free choice which led papua to become part of indonesia is generally not considered to have been representative of

west papua the free papua movement or organisasi papua merdeka opm emerged in opposition to indonesian control by some estimates as many as 100000 papuans are thought to have died as the result of military operations during the course of this conflict59 others assert that this figure is an overestimation coordinator of the institute for human rights and advocacy john rumbiak has reportedly stated that the government in jakarta has allowed the military to prevail in papua to take the security approach which has denied ordinary people their rights and enriched military officers who are making big money for themselves through dealings with mining logging and oil and gas interests60 the united states has large business presence in the region the arrest and trial of anthonius wamang who has been sentenced to life in prison in november 2006 for carrying out an attack in 2002 that killed two americans working for the freeport mine near timika papua has done much to resolve an issue that had been an impediment to closer relations between the united states and indonesia the mine is subsidiary of freeport mcmoran of new orleans some have wondered why wamang and his codefendants did not use the trial to reassert earlier statements that the indonesian military was involved61 the human rights watch report endemic abuse and impunity in papuas central highlands of july 2007 made the following statement among our key findings are that while civilian complaints of brutal treatment by soldiers continue to emerge police officers rather than soldiers are responsible for most serious rights violations in the region today we found that both army troops and police units particularly mobile paramilitary police units brigade mobil or brimob continue to engage in largely indiscriminate village sweeping operations in pursuit of suspected militants using excessive often brutal and at times lethal force against civilians62 june 2008 report by the international crisis group warned of the potential for intercommunal conflict in papua it pointed out that tensions were most acute along the west coast of papua and that continuing muslim migration from elsewhere in indonesia was key factor that is increasing strain between christians and muslims in papua63 59 indonesian police demonstrators clash in papua province oster dow jones may 10 2005 60 people under the jackboot the west

indonesia communal tensions in papua international crisis group report june 16 2008 crs16 intercommunal strife and pan islamic movements while the vast majority of indonesians practice moderate form of islam very small radical minority have sought to establish an islamic state some extremists are hostile to the christian minority and an even smaller group would use violence to establish an islamic khalifate throughout the muslim areas of southeast asia while they represent an extremely small percentage of the population such groups have created much internal turmoil in indonesia distinction can be drawn between groups such as the now disbanded lashkar jihad that focused on indonesian inter communal conflict between muslims and christians in the malukus and factions of jemaah islamiya ji which have used terrorist methods to promote an extreme islamist agenda with linkages to qaeda there have also been allegations that lashkar jihad was tool of hardliners within the military that opposed the reform movement and who allowed or possibly even assisted lashkar jihad activities that destabilized the nation thereby highlighting the need for strong military that could impose order64 there has also been intergroup conflict elsewhere in indonesia such as between muslims and christians in sulawesi and the muluccas and between local dayaks and internal madurese migrants in kalimantan65 there has been much attention focused on the potential rise of islamic sentiment in indonesia in recent years this is most notable in political context with the rise of the pks justice party in the 2004 election in that election the pks increased its seats to 45 from 7 out of 550 following the 1999 parliamentary election many have attributed the success of the pks in parliamentary elections in 2004 and in more recent local elections to its campaign platform of good governance and its party organization rather than to its islamist character the pks is not the largest muslim party and does not represent the large muslim mainstream groups it is of interest because it has grown fast and proved effective both among the poor and among intellectuals as such it is new phenomenon and its scale and importance are as yet unclear some 904 of indonesians believe religious affairs should be within the framework of pancasila and the constitution some 916 of indonesians believe that indonesias state ideology is correctly based on pancasila66 another manifestation of the rise of political islam in indonesia is the march 2006 demonstrations outside the united states embassy in jakarta sponsored by hizbut tharir which featured banners that read now is the time for the caliphate to rule the world with sharia and crush the zionist america and israel67 challenge to the secular nature of the indonesian state is over cultural and moral issues not only the strictly fundamentalist muslims but also more traditional 64 see sydney jones work for the

western cultural and moral values in indonesian society the challenge has four components one is the direct action by radical muslim groups against businesses and institutions which they accuse of representing western cultural and moral values the most widely publicized group is the islamic defenders front fpi the fpi targets such businesses for direct violent action squads of fpi cadre have forcibly shut down gambling dens discos nightclubs and bars that serve alcoholic beverages and brothels the fpi also has targeted christian churches attacks by the fpi and likeminded muslim groups have forced the closure of upwards of 100 christian churches since september 2004 including more than 30 in west java alone68 the fpi is estimated to have supporters in the tens of thousands at most it and similar groups receive financial backing from saudi arabia its influence is felt widely partly because police and law enforcement authorities have adopted permissive attitude toward its activities arrests of fpi members are few and infrequent despite the governments revisions of public assembly laws to make it easier to disband violenceprone groups69 the second component is pressure by muslim groups on authorities to establish islamic sharia law this is felt primarily on the provincial and local levels the state departments human rights report for 2006 cited an estimate that more than 56 shariabased local laws have been issued throughout indonesia these laws often require that women wear head scarves require that officials read the koran in arabic segregate men and women in public places and prohibit alcohol and gambling so far the central government have not challenged the constitutionality of such laws70 at the national level the indonesian parliament is considering an antipornography law fundamentalist muslim groups like the islamic defenders front are lobbying for farreaching law that would outlaw kissing in public and women exposing their navels71 the third is judicial action against nonmuslims or indonesians who are accused of insulting muslim beliefs the state departments 2006 human rights reports described an increase in local court rulings in favor of fundamentalist muslim groups since 2004 nationally the most celebrated case involves the indonesian governments prosecution of the editor of playboy indonesia for breaching the 68 yuli tri suwarni

boarding schools in indonesia observers warn that the instruction in these schools increasingly is of fundamentalist nature that emphasizes intolerance of other religions and nonmuslim secular practices former indonesian president abdurrahman wahid warned in april 2007 that the teaching of fundamentalist islam in the pesantren schools is an acute problem and that the problem is spreading

recovered since and is considered to have wellbalanced economy with all major sectors contributing domestic consumption accounts for roughly majority of indonesias gdp but expanded foreign investment and exports are considered crucial for gdp growth real investment grew by 92 in 2007 and foreign investment grew by 13 over the same period75 foreign businesses have in the past been reluctant to invest in indonesia in part because of concerns about the legal and judicial framework corruption is key concern and deterrent to investment indonesia ranked 143 out of 179 countries in the 2007 corruption perceptions index conducted by transparency international76 indonesian economic growth is expected to slow to 59 in 2008 from 63 in 2007 declining exports to the us and elsewhere as well as rapidly rising fuel and food prices are thought responsible for the slowdown there is concern that political dynamics in the lead up to elections will lead to reluctance to further reduce fuel

papua in the near future86 the environment the logging of indonesias forests both legal and illegal is an issue of increasing concern to many indonesia has the worlds third largest tropical forests and the worlds largest timber trade rain forests are thought to be an important sink for global atmospheric carbon and play vital role in climate rain forests contain an estimated twothirds of the planets plant and animal species it is estimated that logging and other clearing of rain forests has reduced their extent from 14 of the earths surface to 6 special report by the economist estimated that about 2 million hectares of indonesian forest an area the size of massachusetts are logged each year in the 15 years leading up to 2006 indonesia lost one quarter of its forests such rate of logging is unsustainable one 2006 estimate projected that at current rates of logging indonesias forests would be logged out in 10 years87 the destruction of indonesias forests would likely lead to widespread species extinction it is estimated that illegal logging deprives indonesia of some 3 billion annually burning of logged land to clear it for palm plantations and other uses in southeast asia led to widespread haze over the region which accounted for an estimated 8 of greenhouse gasses worldwide in 199788 the united states and indonesia moved to begin to address the problem of illegal logging in april 2006 bilateral talks were initiated to reach an agreement to deal with the problem of illegal logging in indonesia which is estimated to account for 80 of all logging in indonesia89

plantation companies and farmers it is thought that orangutans will disappear if present deforestation trends continue91 the javanese tiger and the balinese tiger became extinct in the 1970s only about 400 sumatran tigers are thought to remain alive this is dramatic decrease from an estimated 1000 sumatran tigers in the 1970s their decrease is similarly attributed to combination of deforestation illegal logging and poaching effective control of the illegal trade in wild animal parts is thought to be essential for the species survival92 the javanese rhino is similarly threatened

in 1889 in the punjab in british india was prophet the ahmadiyya belief was first brought to indonesia from india in 1925 their views place them at odds with more mainstream muslims who believe that the prophet mohammad was the last prophet ahmadiyya do accept mohammad as prophet and one of gods messengers as result of their differences many in muslim society including in indonesia do not view amadiyya as true muslims ahmadiyya also seek converts it is reported that they have open supporters among indonesias elite94 some indonesians have been calling for the ahmadiyya to be banned and driven out of indonesia it is estimated that there are some 200000 to 500000 ahmadiyya in indonesia95 attacks against ahmadiyya and their mosques have grown in recent years though indonesia is

fatwa by indonesias highest religious authority the indonesian ulama council to ban the sect for its deviance the ulama council shortly thereafter submitted its fatwa to the indonesian attorney generals office and asked the government to ban the group according to one report the government of indonesia through the attorney generals office has banned the group from practicing in indonesia due to its view that the ahmadiyya are deviant sect and because they are causing restlessness in the muslim community in indonesia96 on april 18 2008 the day following reports that the group had been banned indonesian vice president jusuf kalla stated that there would be detention of ahmadis97 the ulama council subsequently felt that the government did not go far enough in its actions on april 20th thousands of muslim hardliners protested to demand the active disbanding of the ahmadiyya it is thought that muslim extremists would go beyond banning of the practicing of the ahmadiyya belief and would favor adopting further measures that would actively seek to disband andor drive the group out of indonesia98 some outside commentators view the decision to crackdown on the ahmadiyya as

police announced in april 2007 that its investigation showed that munir was poisoned during stopover at singapores changi airport105 many have hoped successful investigation and trial of those

june 2007 authorities made major breakthrough arresting the head of the overall ji organization zarkasih and jis military commander abu dujana it was reported in march 2006 that qaeda helped fund suicide attacks in indonesia in the previous four years with money brought to indonesia through thailand and malaysia115 divisions within ji have apparently revolved around the extent to which ji should focus on western targets as opposed to focusing on instituting islamist rule in indonesia some are also focused on imposing an islamic chaliphate not only in indonesia but also in malaysia and brunei and muslim areas of the philippines and thailand and in northern australia majority are thought to favor focus on indonesia116 the ji also is reportedly split over whether to continue major terrorist attacks or shift tactics toward political action and attacks against smaller targets violent efforts to rekindle intercommunal violence between christians and muslims in sulawesi and the muluccas have largely been contained ji has not conducted major terrorist attack since 2005 and experts believe that the arrests of zarkasih and abu dujana have weakened the organization substantially117 many indonesians view the war against terror in fundamentally different way than the united states this was particularly so prior to the bali bombing of october 2002 in which approximately 200 people were killed including many western tourists the bali bombing and marriott bombing of august 2003 changed the governments perception of the threat and evoked rigorous response

promoting bilateral assistance and focuses on diplomatic financial law enforcement intelligence and military tools two key objectives of the us government are to build the capacity and will of regional states to fight terror these objectives are pursued through number of programs the united statesasean work plan for counterterrorism has identified information sharing enhancing liaison

earthquake off the coast of sumatra triggered tsunami wave that killed an estimated 122000 with an additional 114000 missing and left over 406000 displaced persons in indonesia most of the devastation was in aceh in northwest sumatra which was the closest landfall to the epicenter of the indian ocean earthquake this disaster led to massive international relief effort in which the united states played leading role in indonesia this included helicopterborne assistance from the aircraft carrier uss abraham lincoln which was accompanied by the uss bonhomme richard and the uss fort mchenry before their departure from the area 2800 relief missions were flown some 2200 patients were treated and 4000 tons of relief supplies were delivered137 in the wake of the tsunami the us government pledged total of 3973 million in humanitarian and recovery assistance for indonesia138 options and implications for the united states debate concerning us policy towards indonesia has in recent years been largely framed by human rights and security interests based on past debate in congress individual decisionmakers approaches to this question will likely involve consideration of mix of us foreign and strategic policy interests with indonesia these will likely include consideration of possible tradeoffs between foreign policy approach that stresses the promotion of human rights and one that seeks to strengthen bilateral ties in order to assist in the struggle against violent islamist extremists and to promote united states geopolitical interests among possible policy approaches the us might consider the following options continue to focus on and give primary consideration to indonesias pivotal role in the war against radical violent islamists in southeast asia indonesia likely will remain an indispensable partner in the struggle against violent islamists in southeast asia for years to come as such many view it as prudent that the united states maintain good working relationship with indonesia such an approach could build on momentum in developing bilateral militarytomilitary ties built in 2005 and 2006 and develop enhanced exchanges training and militarytomilitary relationships in order to bring the full capabilities of the tni into the 136 drawn from state department budget justification material 137 indonesia tsunami reconstruction usaid may 11 2005

indonesian police continue to focus on human rights concerns over past abuses by the indonesian military many feel that there remains serious lack of accountability for past human rights abuses by the indonesian military particularly the human rights abuses perpetrated by pro integrationist militias in east timor in 1999 and that more could be done on either bilateral or multilateral basis or both to increase accountability for past abuses such an approach could involve closer working relationship with the united nations and east timor past efforts by the united nations such as the tribunal in dili including the serious crimes investigation unit and special panels for serious crimes have been shut down while the indonesian trials ended in acquittals for all indonesians subsequent unsponsored commission of experts found the indonesian trials to be manifestly inadequate139 as part of its oversight role congress may opt to consider range of policy options for relations with indonesia in this context the following options for the bilateral relationship may be of interest while such policy options are at times mutually exclusive they often need not be nonzero sum approach might seek to blend american foreign policy interests through focus on an enhanced emphasis on the promotion of democracy good governance civil society and the rule of law as well as human rights and security interests such an approach by not taking zero sum view of tradeoffs between human rights and security interests would be aimed at achieving both enhanced partnership on security issues and enhanced promotion of human rights and other interests in indonesia by promoting and supporting ongoing democratic and civil society developments in indonesia supporters of this approach believe that it could have an indirect positive impact on indonesias human rights record as well as reinforce ties between the two states place enhanced emphasis on the promotion of democracy and the rule of law in indonesia such an approach is seen as consistent with the presidents national security strategy which emphasizes building the infrastructure of democracy140 such an approach in indonesia could include additional funding and other support to continue consolidating democratic reforms the continued establishment of an impartial electoral framework political party development memberconstituent relations and strengthening of national legislative bodies141 the promotion of democratic values could also have positive impact on other issue areas such as the promotion of human rights 139 human

indonesia httpwwwndiorg crs32 give the geopolitical importance of indonesia more weight when considering bilateral ties indonesias position on the straits of malacca as moderate muslim country as the largest member of asean and as state that does not seek to exclude the us from regional multilateral fora or from the region gives it geopolitical importance to the united states as such and in light of expanding chinese influence in the region it is prudent in the view of many that relations with indonesia be developed so that indonesia does not seek to move away from the united states in international fora or by developing alternative strategic relationships indonesia remains one of the least well understood geopolitically important nations to america expanding bilateral educational exchanges research grants and language training could seek to educate indonesias present and future elites while giving them an enhanced understanding of the united states and its values such educational exchanges could also provide americans the opportunity to better understand indonesia and the role that it plays in its region and in the islamic world place enhanced emphasis on transnational issues such as environmental degradation including rainforest destruction preservation of biodiversity and global warming and avian flu the united states and indonesia initiated what would be firstof itskind agreement to combat illegal logging in april 2006 consolidating and extending such initiatives could help protect indonesias environment many feel that indonesias biodiversity and diminishing environment would likely benefit from enhanced protection with only 13 of the earths surface indonesia has an estimated 10 of the worlds flowering plants 12 of the worlds mammals 16 of the worlds reptiles and amphibians 17 of the worlds birds and over 25 of the worlds fish142 united states assistance to indonesia to help it protect its rainforests from illegal logging would help protect the environment upon which indonesias biodiversity is dependent avian flu has the potential to kill many in the united states addressing the problem of potential humanto human transmission in indonesia may be highly effective way to contain an outbreak but thus far indonesia is generally considered to be underresourced to handle the threat do more to advance american trade and investment interests in indonesia in april 2006 us trade representative rob portman pointed to developing building blocks that could serve as the basis for negotiating free trade agreement fta between indonesia and the united states143 continued emphasis on further developing 142 indonesian biodiversity httpwwwgeocitiescomrainforest4466biodiverhtm 143 us indonesia strengthen economic ties says us trade representative us fed continued crs33 these building blocks which include such agreements as efforts to curb illegal logging and the trade in endangered species may help move the two states towards an fta american companies have also encountered difficulties in indonesia in recent years and may benefit from enhanced support or guidance from the us government elements of all of the options discussed here can be found in current american foreign policy towards indonesia though the mix in emphasis has shifted over time 143 continued news april 5 2006 crs34 figure 1 map of indonesia zamboanga davao
