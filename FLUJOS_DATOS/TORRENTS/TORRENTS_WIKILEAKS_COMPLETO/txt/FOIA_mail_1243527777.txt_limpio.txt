date thu 28 may 2009 122257 0700 hi darrell et got chance to read the paper and comments enroute to atlanta heres some feedback general comments are modest and should be easy to accommodate that said i think we have to take the comments of rev 2 seriously im guessing that its francis zwiers and in any case he knows what hes talking about regarding stats also important id make sure we check and recheck every single calculation and dataset this paper is going to get the attention of the skeptics and they are going to get all the data and work hard to show were we messed up we dont want this especially you since it could take way more of your time than youd like and itll look bad very much worth the effort in advance ok rev 1 wow never had it so good rev 2 general comment we should take this one seriously get caspar and bettes help the new synthesis could be telling us especially when the outlier in fig 4b is discounted see below that the arctic is in reality more sensitive to changes in radiative forcing than reflected in the model are there other experiments or reasons to think this is true if so lets make this point and back it up with these other pieces of evidence for example does the ccsm get arctic warming from the earlmid holocene to present correctly does the model underestimate the arctic change obs over the last 100 years since the reviewer raised this you could add some refs and prose if needed to respond not lot but some and we need to respond one way or the other specific comments 1 agree in the abstract i suggest changing the sentence to read this trend likely reflects steady orbitallydriven reduction in summer insolation as confirmed by 1000year transient climate simulation note that this removes more than enough words to meet the eds requirement too 2 for this one id simply state that the forcing is stronger in the arctic than at lower lats double check how much and also add what giff suggested 3 agree make the suggested clarification 4 important and hopefully easy i leave to whomever did the calculation to make sure any serial correlation bias was taken into account make sure all p values are thus corrected 5 ditto makes sense too 6 clarify 7 this reviewer knows what heshe is talking about do what they suggest and double check its done well 8 dont delete the instead point out that youve strengthened it and that it is important to place the new synthesis in longer term holocene context it also clarifies to interdisciplinary readers why the arctic is so sensitive perhaps more sensitive than in models see above that said i would cite kerwin et 99 ive attached it it provides added detail and balance also since youre responding to reviewer comment and strengthening the ms you can add the ref wo hassle or so im guessing on recent experience 9 yep delete all attributions in the ms on p 6 lone 129 can say support the connection between the arctic summer cooling trend and orbitallydriven reduction 10 reviewer is correct see my response above for the general comment and see if you can work with hisher ideas to improve the outlier has to be just that need an explanation before you can remove from any analysis however 11 makes sense do it 12 yep change text as suggested 13 agree change p 7 line 153 to read 1980s appears to have been the single 14 agree change line 167 on p 8 to read trend our new synthesis suggests that the most recent 10year other suggested changes p 3 line 69 change region to read regional p 6 line 128 2600 to 1600ad isnt going to make sense to readers please provide some context som or p 7 line 145 insert arctic before summer p 11 line 234 change to read century tenyear means bold lines were used because you dont really say what the bold and unbold lines are this will help the reader make sure they have it right fig 4 and caption need to explain why the isolation axes are labeled differently the numbers and that both are still cover the same number of wm2 didnt look at som but make sure its all bomber too since there is good chance it will get picked apart and any errors thrown back in our face in counter productive manner thanks nice job best peck probably wo email for while in the amazon although one never knows on 52609 108 pm darrell kaufman 1darrellkaufmannauedu wrote coauthors i just received the reviewers comments and editors decision on our science manuscript attached the decision isnt final but it looks like good news with very reasonable revisions reviewer 1 had nothing substantial to suggest reviewer 2 was rather thorough i think i can address hisher suggestions but could use some help with three 1 the reviewer challenged our assertion that because climate change is amplified in the arctic the signalnoise ratio should be higher too we dont have more than 1 sentence to expand on the assertion in the text we could plead the case to editor and hope that it doesnt trip up the final acceptance or we could omit it from the text suggestions 2 the reviewer suggested that if we are concerned about outliers influencing the mean values of the composite record we should attempt socalled robust regression procedure such as median absolute deviation regression does anyone have experience with this 3 the reviewer was concerned that we overestimated the strength of the relation between temperature and insolation in the long ccsm simulation namely she criticized the leveraging effect of the one outlier in the modelgenerated insolation vs temperature plot fig 4b and suggested that we use 10year means instead of 50 year dave you up for this please please forward any input to and ill compile them and let you all have look before i submit the final revisions im hoping we can turn this around this week thanks darrell begin
