fighter jsf program background status and issues summary the defense departments f35 lightning ii joint strike fighter jsf is one of three aircraft modernization programs in tactical aviation the others being the air force f22a fighter and the navy fa18ef fighterattack plane in november 1996 the defense department selected two major aerospace companies boeing and lockheed martin to demonstrate competing designs for the jsf jointservice and multirole fighterattack plane lockheed martin won this competition and was selected to develop and produce the jsf family of aircraft including conventional takeoff and landing ctol carriercapable cv and short takeoff vertical landing stovl versions for the us air force navy and marine corps the united kingdom as well as other allied services originally designated the joint advanced strike technology jast program the jsf program has attracted considerable attention in congress because of concerns about its cost effects on the defense industrial base and implications for us national security in the 21st century the jastjsf program is designed to address the high cost of tactical aviation the need to deploy fewer types of aircraft to reduce acquisition and operating costs and projections of future threat scenarios and enemy capabilities the programs rationale and primary emphasis is jointservice development of nextgeneration multirole strike aircraft that can be produced in affordable variants to meet different operational requirements developing an affordable triservice family of aircraft with different but similar combat missions poses major technological challenges if the jsf is to have jointservice support the program must yield affordable aircraft that can meet such divergent needs as those of the us air force for successor to its lowcost f16 and a10 fighterattack planes those of the us marine corps and the uk royal air force and navy for successor to their harrier stovl aircraft and the us navys need for successor to older fa18s and complement to its fa18ef fighterattack planes this report discusses the background status and current issues of the jsf program additional information and analysis can be found in crs report rl33543 tactical aircraft modernization issues for congress which also discusses the air force f22a the navy fa18ef and the marine corps v22 the jsf program is also addressed in

jsf program background status and issues introduction the f35 lightning ii joint strike fighter jsf program is developing and building family of nextgeneration tactical aircraft for the air force the marine corps and the navy as well as for export1 as now projected the jsf is the defense departments dods largest acquisition program in terms of cost and number of aircraft to be produced and the longest in terms of procurement duration current dod plans call for production of 2456 aircraft in three versions over 28year delivery period2 the us air forces program of record is to purchase 1763 conventional takeoff and landing ctol versions of the f35 to replace its current force of f16 falcons and a10 warthogs in february 2003 air force officials announced its intentions to analyze acquisition of the stovl jsf to improve future close air support cas capabilities3 to date however the air force has not committed to purchasing other variants besides its ctol platform while speculation continues as to the procurement intentions of the usaf the largest purchaser of the f35 the air force official position still remains at 1763 ctol f35s4 the department of the navy composed of the navy and the marine corps plans to procure of 680 jsfs the marine corps plans to field the short takeoff vertical landing stovl version of the plane to replace its current fleet of av8b harrier verticalshort takeoff and landing vstol attack planes5 the navy plans to procure carriercapable version termed cv to replace older carrierbased 1 unlike the f22a raptor the f35 was designed for export

denmark turkey the netherlands and norway6 the united kingdom is anticipated to be the largest foreign purchaser of the f35 with projected 138 stovl aircraft figure 1 f35 lightning ii joint strike fighter background the jsf program emerged in late 1995 from the joint advanced strike technology jast program which began in late 1993 as result of the administrations bottomup review bur of us defense policy and programs having affirmed plans to abandon development of both the a12afx aircraft that was to replace the navys a6 attack planes and the multirole fighter mrf that the air force had considered to replace its f16s the bur envisaged the jast program as replacement for both these programs in 1995 in response to congressional direction program led by the defense advanced research projects agency darpa to develop an advanced short takeoff and vertical landing astovl 6 current anticipated partner orders uk 138 italy 131 australia 100 turkey 100 canada 88 netherlands 85 denmark

marine corps and british navy participation7 the name of the program was then changed to joint strike fighter to focus on joint development and production of next generation fighterattack plane and unlike the socalled joint air forcenavy tfx program of the 1960s program proponents note the jastjsf program has been truly joint from its inception during the jastjsf programs 19941996 concept development phase three different aircraft designs were proposed by boeing lockheed martin and mcdonnell douglas the latter teamed with northrop grumman and british aerospace in competitive program expected to shape the future of us tactical aviation and the us defense industrial base8 on november 16 1996 the defense department announced that boeing and lockheed martin had been chosen to compete in the 19972001 concept demonstration phase in which each contractor would build and flighttest two aircraft to demonstrate their concepts for three jsf variants conventional takeofflanding shortfield takeoffvertical landing and the carrier takeofflanding on october 26 2001 dod selected team of contractors led by lockheed martin to develop and produce the jsf the three variants ctol cv and stovl aircraft are to have maximum commonality in airframe engine and avionics components to reduce development production and operation and support costs mainly because of their projected costs three tactical aircraft programs are being analyzed by both congress and the administration to determine the best combination of the types and numbers of aircraft to meet the future needs of the military the emergent jsf program the air force f22a program and the navys fa18ef program congressional decisions on these programs will have important implications for defense funding requirements us military capabilities and the us aerospace industry design and performance contrary to some misconceptions that the joint strike fighter would be one aircraft used by several services for different missions the program focused on the development and production of three variants with common components land based conventional takeoff and landing ctol version for the air force carrier based version cv for the navy and short takeoff vertical landing stovl version for the marines and the uk the jsf program is family of aircraft performing similar missions with mix of components systems and technologies 7 since the early 1990s darpa had funded various stovl projects expected to develop aircraft to replace both us marine corps av8b harriers and the uk royal navys sea harriers the merger of these researchdevelopment efforts with the jast program in early 1995 cleared the way for usuk collaboration in jsf development 8 john tirpak strike fighter air force magazine october 1996 pp 2228 philip hough an aircraft for the 21st century sea power november 1996 pp 3334 crs4 component commonality among the three variants is projected to be at 70 to 909 many of the highcost components are common including engines avionics and major structural components of the airframe former secretary of defense william cohen stated that the jsfs joint approach avoids the three parallel development programs for serviceunique aircraft that would have otherwise been necessary saving at least 15 billion10 the jsf will be powered by the pratt whitney f135 engine which was derived from the f22as pratt whitney f119 power plant consistent with congressional direction in 1996 dod established an alternative engine program f136 with the general electricrollsroyce fighter engine team to compete with the f135 for jsf production and operations and support contracts in addition to teaming up with ge on the f136 engine rollsroyce is contracted to develop and produce the stovl lift fan system that will be used with both the f135 and f136 engines the net costbenefit of an alternate engine for the jsf program has periodically been debated and dod has attempted to eliminate funding for the f136 removing funding for the engine in the fy2007 fy2008 and fy2009 budget requests11 congress has acted multiple times throughout the programs history to ensure continued dod support for the f136 all jsf planes will be fifthgeneration singleengine singleseat aircraft with supersonic dash capability and some degree of stealth low observability to radar and other sensors12 combat ranges and payloads will vary in the different service variants for example as currently planned combat radius requirements are 590690 nautical miles nm for the air force 600730 nm for the navy and 450550 nm for the marine corps all three variants are planned to carry weapons internally two 2000 lb weapons for the ctol and cv variant and two 1000 lb weapons for the stovl13 all versions will also carry aim120 amraams advanced

fourbarrel gd425 under development for the f35 will be carried internally in the ctol version and externally in the cv and stovl variants15 performance features regarding radar signature speed range and payload were determined on the basis of tradeoffs between performance and cost with the latter being critical factor program officials have emphasized that cost and performance tradeoffs are critical elements of the program and were the basis for the jointservice operational requirements that determined the selection of the lockheed martin contractor team for the system development and demonstration sdd phase16 the 1997 quadrennial defence review qdr report observed that uncertainties in prospective jsf production cost warrant careful departmental oversight of the cost benefit tradeoffs in design to ensure that modernization and force structure remain in balance over the long term17 in other words production costs must be low enough that these aircraft can be bought in sufficient quantities to maintain desired force levels thus the parameters of the jsfs performance and operational capabilities are subject to refinement for reasons of cost technological developments and future threat assessments18 program management the jsf program is jointly staffed and managed by the department of the air force and the department of the navy comprising the navy and the marine corps with coordination among the services reinforced by alternating air force and navy department officials in key management positions for example lt general george muellner usaf was the programs first director in 1994 with rear admiral craig steidle usn serving as deputy director subsequently rear admiral steidle directed the program with brigadier general leslie kenne usaf as his deputy in late 1996 and his successor as program director in august 1997 the current director is maj gen charles davis usaf service acquisition executive sae responsibility also alternates with the air force having that responsibility when the program director is from the navy department and the navy in that role with an air force director of the program 13 continued office september 2007 14 steven zaloga

the joint program office notes that the f35s key performance parameters kpps have not changed since milestone b in 2001 crs6 in 2004 appropriations conferees followed house recommendation to direct dod to review this alternative management arrangement house appropriators believed that management of program acquisition should remain with one service and that the us navy due to its significant investment in two variants of the f35 should be assigned all acquisition executive oversight responsibilities19 conferees directed that dod submit report on the potential efficacy of this change prior to the release of the dod report former air force chief of staff general jumper was quoted as saying that he also supported putting one service in charge of jsf program acquisition20 however general jumper highlighted the significant investment the air force was making in the jsf program in response to the congressional language favoring the navy in dods response to congress the report noted the current arrangement ensures one service does not have disproportionate voice when it comes to program decisions and that the current system is responsive efficient and in the best interests of the success of the jsf program21 since dods response to congress in 2004 the issue of jsf program management has not been raised funding and projected costs the defense departments quarterly selected acquisition report of december 25 2007 estimated the jsf program at 2988 billion in thenyear dollars for 2456 aircraft which equates to program acquisition unit cost pauc of 1216 million per aircraft the average procurement cost apuc which does not include rd or other costs is estimated at 1039 million per aircraft the december 2005 sar noted that the jsf program breached nunnmccurdy cost growth limit unit cost growth over 30 of the original acquisition program baseline22 the december 2007 pauc and apuc cost estimates are respectively 388 and 380 higher than cost estimates made in october 2001 since 2002 the jsf program estimate has increased by 100 billion due primarily to oneyear extension in the programs system development and demonstration phase corresponding oneyear delay in procurement from fy2006 to fy2007 revised annual quantity profiles and revised labor and overhead rates23 much of this increased cost and schedule slippage was incurred to address weight driven

depicts graphically the acquisition system and where sdd fits into the process25 figure 2 defense acquisition management framework like some other aviation procurement programs the jsf has experienced cost growth schedule slippage and reduction in production rates for example to address growing weightdriven performance problems encountered early in sdd dod extended the sdd phase one year and correspondingly delayed the f35s scheduled first flight from late 2005 to the summer of 2006 first flight occurred on december 15 2006 the beginning of lowrate initial production shifted from 2006 24

acquisition board approving low rate initial production lrip in march 2006 crs8 to 2007 currently sdd developmental flight testing will conclude october 2012 and the sdd contract period of performance will end year later26 in june 2005 dod officials reported that weight reduction efforts were successful and approved the revised development schedule27 extending sdd and producing aircraft at lower annual rates however contributed to increased unit cost growth rather than request additional funding jsf program officials instead paid these costs by spending approximately fourfifths of its 2 billion in management reserves28 faced with an impending contract overrun dod cut two test aircraft from the f35 program and reduced the number of sdd flight tests29 the goal of these costsaving measures was to help bring the management reserve account back up to about 1 billion which is considered an acceptable amount to complete flight testing the jsf is expected to remain in production at least through the 2030s current plans call for the jsf to be manufactured in several locations lockheed martin will build the aircrafts forward section in fort worth tx northrop grumman will build the midsection in palmdale ca and the tail will be built by bae systems in the united kingdom final assembly of these components will take place in fort worth italy is working with lockheed martin and the

air force 642 for the marines 300 for the us navy and 60 for the royal navy in may 1997 however the qdr recommended reducing projected procurement for the us armed forces from 2978 jsf aircraft to 2852 1763 for the air force 609 for the marines and up to 480 for the navy32 thus the program would comprise 2912 aircraft 2852 us and 60 uk jsfs based on these recommendations procurement profiles

officials announced that under current plans current shortfall in fighter aircraft of 15 aircraft would grow to deficit of over 90 aircraft by fy201734 it is unclear what impact this potential projected shortfall might have on the dons jsf procurement plans congress and dod may have occasion to revisit the air forces f35 procurement plans in hearings on the air forces fy2009 budget request air force leaders testified that due to new estimates of the life of the legacy fighter force the current f22 and jsf procurement plans would likely leave gap of up to 800 fighter aircraft by the year 202435 since the jsf is longterm program projected quantities are more subject to change than in the case of aircraft already in fullrate production nearterm reductions in quantity could be made up in future years either through increased us purchases or through foreign sales however concerns have been raised that near term quantity reductions could scare off foreign participation and raise the aircrafts unit price the gao views the budget and schedule changes to the jsf program in more negative light in march 2005 gao wrote that the original business case for the aircraft unexecutable in large part because of decreased numbers of aircraft to be procured36 potential f35 bases in october 2006 air force officials indicated the six tentative locations where f35s would be based these locations were nellis afb nv edwards afb ca hill afb ut eglin afb fl shaw afb sc and kadena air base japan the air force is now awaiting environmental studies before making final determination the marine corps has tentatively indicated that mcas beaufort mcas yuma mcas iwakuni mcas miramar and mcas cherry point will be the bases for the f35 again pending their environmental studies and approval of the basing plan basing decisions for the jsf may be of interest to many in congress the f35 is thought by many to be the last manned aircraft that dod is likely to develop for some time and is projected to be in service long after other combat aircraft have been retired those wishing to keep military bases relevant and to potentially brac proof them may compete vigorously for the jsf 33 see

as way to defray some of the cost of developing and producing the aircraft and to prime the pump for export congress insisted from the outset that the jast program include ongoing efforts by the defense advanced research projects agency darpa to develop more advanced stovl aircraft opening the way for british participation from the allied perspective they saw the f35 as an affordable avenue to acquiring fifthgeneration fighter technical knowledge such as stealth and industrial opportunities for domestic firms the two jsf developmental phases where international participation has been offered are 1 systems development and demonstration sdd and 2 production sustainment and followon development psfd initial operational test and evaluation iote subset of sdd is another area that

demonstration sdd eight countries from 2001 to 2002 signed on to the jsf program to support the anticipated 10year sdd phase partnership was broken down into three levels by the size of monetary contributions to the program the higher the investment level the greater the nations voice with respect to aircraft requirements design and access to technologies gained during development the united kingdom is the only level 1 partner contributing approximately 2 billion to this phase uk participation actually began at program outset on december 20 1995 the us and uk governments signed memorandum of understanding mou on british participation in the jsf program as collaborative partner in the definition of requirements and aircraft design this mou committed the british government to contribute 200 million towards the cost of the 19972001 concept demonstration phase37 on january 17 2001 the united states and united kingdom finalized the uks sdd participation which equated to approximately 8 of the total sdd program program proponents noted the uks signature represented strong international affirmation of the jsf concept even though prime contractor competition and selection had not been

level iii partners with contributions ranging from 125 million to 175 million while contributions are less than their level i and ii partners the benefit to all nations who participate is strong

objectives for performance cost effectiveness and commonality combine to make it arguably the most challenging defense acquisition program ever discussion of the most pertinent issues appears below these issues are not mutually exclusive and overlap along several dimensions concurrency of testing and production the 2005 national defense authorization act directed the gao to conduct annual reviews of the jsf program to assess the sdds meeting of key cost schedule and performance goals48 in march 2006 the gao issued its second report highly critical of the jsf testing and production schedule49 gao asserted that the amount of overlap between testing and production in the jsf program is risky and could lead to considerable cost growth in the future gao noted that the jsf program was to begin lowrate initial production lrip before 1 of flight tests had been completed gao noted that up to 424 f35 aircraft may be built at cost of 49 billion before development testing is complete

would delay fielding of the f35 osd noted that there was gao analysis as to the costs of legacy fleet extensions or procurement price increases the jsf joint program office noted that program acquisition strategy was designed to take advantage of knowledge gained from the f22 program and legacy programs along with improvements in modeling and simulation to reduce the development period52 while this strategy presents increased program risk proponents note projected cost savings as result of an expedited testing cycle and retirement of legacy systems proponents also highlight that fixes discovered during more concurrent ie expedited testingproduction cycle are usually much less expensive than the costs associated with more exhaustive testing period with less overlap and extended production period this argument is strengthened somewhat by defense aerospace case study that determined continuity in development is the best way to avoid cost overruns53 programs that are able to manage developmental issues without lengthy program freezes were more apt to keep production cost growth to minimum midcourse risk reduction plan in december 2007 dod announced that it had decided to cut two test aircraft from the jsf program54 other changes to the test program included foregoing intermediate flight test measurements reducing the number of flight tests and employing ground laboratories and flying test beds nonjsf aircraft instrumented to simulate the f35 instead of actual jsf aircraft55 dod calls these changes to the f35 flight test program the midcourse risk reduction plan the purpose of the plan is to save approximately 600 million and replenish management reserves pot of money saved to mitigate unforseen developments in the development program these reserves had been depleted by program officials who needed to pay escalating program costs 50 ibid p 6 51 dod information paper for sasc psms stan oconnor and creighton greene in response to gao06356 june 17 2006

to the midcourse risk reduction plan argue that it adds risk to program already facing excessive risk due to the overlap between development and production described above generally speaking opponents believe that this plan is detrimental to the test program and raises the risk that design and performance shortcomings will not be discovered until late in the process when it will be more costly to redress them specifically opponents note that the number of jsf flight tests planned has been reduced twice prior to the midcourse risk reduction plan in october 2005 dod planned 6979 f35 flight tests currently only 5147 are planned56 further eliminating two test aircraft it is argued removes an important hedge against potential attrition if something were to go awry with one or more of the test aircraft fewer are available to take up the slack proponents of this move state that test flights would have been reduced regardless of the status of the management reserve account owing to testing efficiencies gained through commonality and lab investments proponents also assert that arguments against this plan are based on old models of test evaluation the jsf they say is implementing stateoftheart technological advances in aircraft instrumentation and simulation which reduces the need for actual flight tests affordability much has been made about the f35s overall price tag of almost 300 billion ty in addition to the aggregate amount of funding required several other affordability issues stand out first as the production phase of the f35 accelerates the program will require large and sustained expenditures at the same time dod is facing acute budgetary challenges over the next 20 years dod projects spending over 10 billion annually on the f3557 at the same time dod aims to recapitalize other aircraft fleets such as tankers increase the army and marine corps personnel endstrength and prosecute the wars in iraq and afghanistan in other words the timing of f35 program costs may be as big of challenge as the overall amount second as the competing funding requirements described above collide both dod and congress may be tempted to reduce the overall number of f35s to be procured experience suggests that reducing multiple defense acquisition programs is more feasible than cancelling one planned procurement quantities of the f22 and the fa18ef for example have been reduced by 70 and 54 respectively procuring fewer aircraft reduces overall costs but increases the aircrafts perunit cost this would be particularly detrimental to program such as the f35 which was designed specifically to be moderately priced third there are strong differences of opinion over how f35 costs are calculated and presented dods latest estimate of the f35 program for example shows the 56 joint strike fighter recent decisions by dod add to program risks government accountability office gao08338 march 2008 p16 57 f35 jsf selected acquisition report sar office of the secretary of defense atl december 25 2007 p1521 crs15 overall cost decreasing from 299 billion in december 2006 to 298 billion in december 2007 some suggest that these figures are misleading because the largest savings reported by dod in its latest report were not achieved by improvements in design or manufacture but instead were achieved by moving costs from one category to another58 the gao offered strong criticism of jsf cost estimates writing that they were not comprehensive not accurate not well documented nor credible59 in summary gao noted that the jsf cost estimates did not include 7 billion for the f136 engine and that the official jsf cost estimates are at odds with estimates made by three independent dod agencies jsf supporters dispute the gaos findings arguing that the program offices cost models are more reliable than those used by other organizations60 fourth there are number of factors that will influence jsf costs either positively or negatively which are difficult to predict by statute dod must pursue the jsf f136 alternate engine program as mentioned above gao notes that the f136 development costs are not included in current jsf cost estimates the larger question is whether these costs included or not will be recouped by competition between the f135 and the f136 during jsf production and operation61 also the don has not yet determined how many of its 680 f35s will be cv variants and how many will be stovl variants these aircraft have different operational capabilities and different production and operating costs finally jsf program officials anticipate major savings because of high degree of commonality in components and systems among the three versions which are to be built on common production line however the f35 is not meeting its goals for commonality and as the program wrestles with final development challenges commonality could be compromised further which would lead to cost increases62 projected fighter aircraft inventory shortfalls in the late winter and early spring of the fy2009 legislative cycle both air force and department of the navy don officials testified that they were facing projected fighter gap because of high combat aircraft utilization rates in afghanistan and iraq legacy air forces a10s f15s f16s fa18s were wearing out faster than previously predicted while new aircraft procurement eg f22a f 35 fa18ef remained steady or had declined at its worst don officials projected deficit of more than 90 aircraft in fy2017fy202063 air force officials projected potential gap of up to 800 fighter aircraft by the year

in number of different ways dod officials could for example accelerate f35 procurement and increase the total number to be procured air force officials have testified that they wish to double f 35 purchases over the next five years to alleviate the projected shortfalls65 although accelerating f35 purchases may appear beneficial to the programs supporters it might also have negative consequences jsf officials have stated that to meet the current schedule they may be forced to field less capable stovl aircraft and upgrade them at later dates it is not clear what effect this block upgrade approach would have on overall costs66 another way to address the projected fighter shortfall would be to purchase more f15s f16s fa18efs and f22s all of which are still in production the navy reportedly is considering procuring 69 more super hornets to close the fighter gap67 this option might be cheaper than purchasing more f35s although these aircraft are less capable than the f35 the f22 is the exception in this comparison because it is more expensive than the f35 and more capable in many dimensions additional purchases of these aircraft however especially if at the f35s expense could raise f35 unit cost and potentially alienate foreign partners who are already concerned about cost growth in the jsf program68 similar option would be to execute service life extension slep program for those aircraft that are wearing out prematurely this option may prove to be cheaper than purchasing new aircraft however sleping aircraft keeps them in depot and unavailable for operations for months if not years which can constrain military capabilities and place even greater pressure on those aircraft still flying final option to address the projected fighter gap would be to do nothing by sticking with the current fighter aircraft procurement plans dod may end up reducing the overall inventory of combat aircraft this may be risk that is worth taking considering other us aviation capabilities such as bombers cruise missiles and armeduavs and the lack of perceived threats on the other hand todays relatively large inventory of fighter aircraft is wellworn from excessive use there is reason to think that tomorrows smaller fighter aircraft inventory would not experience equally high operations tempo 64 continued operations plans and requirements senate armed services

us defense industry as dods largest single weapon system acquisition program the jsf is focal point for discussions regarding the us defense industrial base the october 2001 award of the jsf engineering manufacturing development emd contract to single company lockheed martin raised concerns in congress and elsewhere that excluding boeing from this program would reduce that companys ability to continue designing and manufacturing fighter aircraft this in turn would have negative effect on the us defense industrial base69 similar concerns were raised in 2006 when dod proposed terminating the f136 alternate engine in this case some worried that if the f136 were cancelled general electric ge would not have enough business designing and manufacturing fighter jet engines to continue competing with pratt whitney the manufacturer of the f135 engine in the future this would leave the united states dependent on only one domestic manufacturer of this class of engine others argued that ges considerable business in both commercial and military engines was sufficient to sustain ges ability to produce this class of engine in the future70 the jsf program could also have strong impact on the us defense industry through export most observers believe that the jsf could potentially dominate the combat aircraft export market much as the f16 has like the f16 the jsf appears to be attractive because of its relatively low cost flexible design and promise of high performance also analysts note that during his first stint as defense secretary donald rumsfeld played an instrumental role in launching the f16 program by including foreign partners in the aircrafts development71 many competitors including frances rafale swedens jas gripen and the european typhoon are positioned to challenge the jsf in the fighter export market or take its market share if the program is cancelled also few countries have expressed interest in buying either the f22a or the fa18ef the one country that has expressed interest in the f22a japan will most likely be unable to procure the f22 because of proposed clause in the fy2008 appropriations bill upholding ban on f22 exports72 instead japan is being redirected towards the f35 it can also be argued that the demand for civilian transport aircraft after 2000 will be strong enough to sustain robust us aviation industry given the need to replace aging aircraft with quieter and more fuelefficient planes for expanding domestic and international travel markets for example the worldwide fighterattack 69 for more information

commercial jet transport market is projected to be worth about 435 billion at that time compared with its european and asian competitors the us aviation industry appears to be wellpositioned to meet the needs of an expanding world market for civil aircraft after the turn of the century73 the extent to which such economic conditions may preserve an adequate us defense industrial base for the development and production of combat aircraft is debatable however given the significant differences between civilian and military aircraft requirements and technologies others fear that by allowing foreign companies to participate in this historically large aircraft acquisition program dod may be inadvertently opening up us markets to competitors who enjoy direct government subsidies these government subsidies could create an unfair advantage for them relative to us companies it is argued and the result could be the beginning of longerterm foreign penetration of the us defense market that could erode the health of the us defense industrial base in may 2004 the gao release report that found the jsf program could significantly impact the us and global industrial base74 the gao found that two laws designed to protect segments of the us defense industry the buy american act and the preference for domestic speciality metals clause would have impact on decisions regarding which foreign companies would participate in the jsf program this is because dod has decided that foreign companies that participate in the jsf program and which have signed reciprocal procurement agreements with dod to promote defense cooperation are eligible for waiver program proponents note the economic potential that comes with participation in the program 2003 dod study into international participation concluded that the potential exists for partner nations to earn between 5 and 40 of revenue for every 1 invested through program contracts75 current program policy to eschew offset arrangements will favor governments and corporations that take an aggressive approach to providing bestvalue bids for jsf work on the positive side this approach seeks to be the most costeffective however partner countries that cannot compete effectively in this environment could be frustrated by the lack of contracts awarded over the last couple of years press reports have indicated that number of partner nations have threatened to withdraw from the program because of frustrations over workshare and technology transfer issues76 as previously discussed the f35 73 richard aboulafia
