free trade agreements or ftas with australia chile singapore and other trading partners negotiations are currently ongoing with respect to the establishment of additional ftas in keeping with congressional directive established in the bipartisan trade promotion act of 2002 pl 107210 one objective of forming the ftas is to establish standard of intellectual property protection similar to that found in united states law as result most of the ftas stipulate minimum levels of protection with respect to copyrights data protection patents trademarks and other forms of intellectual property these standards relate to such provisions as the term of protection scope of rights and mechanisms by which these intellectual property rights are acquired and enforced the different ftas vary in their comprehensiveness and level of detail each of these agreements has nonetheless been drafted in manner that complies with current us law as result the effect of each fta is to obligate signatories to such agreements to amend their intellectual property laws to match or resemble those of the united states the ftas have been described as an effective mechanism for advancing us interests in securing intellectual property protection increased levels of intellectual property protection with respect to computer software music moti on pictures and pharmaceuticals may promote more favorable balance of trade for us industry decrease domestic prices for innovative goods and services and serve other policy goals the fta framework has at times proven to be more advantageous forum for achieving the intellectual property goals of the united states than multilateral settings nonetheless concerns have arisen over the in tellectual property provisions of the ftas some observers believe that certain fta provisions may lock the united states into current intellectual property policies inhibiting opportunities for future reform other commentators are concerned that under existing multilateral agreements in particular those of the world trade organization the intellectual property obligations found within one fta may extend beyond that particular treaty partner finally some observers perceive the ftas to be an inappropriate and unfair vehicle for international intellectual property reforms due to the strong bargaining position of the united states the scope of these potential consequences counsels continued congressional attention towards the ftas that the united states has already formed as well as those ftas that are planned for the future

these legal regimes as they exist in the united states will aid subsequent analysis copyrights provide protection for original works of authorship the types of creations addressed by copyright range from traditional works of art including literature music and visual art to such modern forms of artistic expression as sound recordings motion pictures and even computer software10 copyright protection arises automatically as soon as the work has been fixed in tangible form11 authors may register their works with the us copyright office component of the library of congress if an author chooses to register his work he obtains certain procedural and substantive advantages during copyright enforcement12 the copyright law affords authors the exclusive right to reproduce adapt and publicly distribute perform and display the protected work subject to limitations such as the fair use privilege13 the term of copyright is ordinarily the life of the author plus 70 years14 patents provide exclusive rights to inventors of new useful and nonobvious inventions15 the patent law concerns hard technologies including chemical electrical and mechanical products and processes as well as other pragmatic innovations in fields ranging from biotechnology to business methods16 an inventor may obtain patent by filing patent application with the united states patent and trademark office uspto such an application must completely describe and precisely claim the invention17 patents issued confer the right to exclude others from making using selling offering to sell or importing into the united states the patented invention18 the term of patent is ordinarily 20 years from the date the application was filed19 trademarks consist of any word or symbol used by merchant to identify its goods or services and to distinguish them from those of others20 to be subject to protection under the trademark laws mark must successfully distinguish the origins of its associated goods and not be confusingly similar to marks used by others or merely describe the characteristics of those goods 21 trademark rights arise under state law as soon as the mark is used on goods in commerce22 however trademarks may be registered with the uspto step that affords significant substantive and procedural advantages23 trademark law also protects the appearance of product packaging and in some cases the actual physical configuration of the goods if these 9 see generally roger schechter and john r thomas intellectual property the law of copyrights patents and trademarks 2003 10 id 11 id 12 17 usc

using any mark that creates likelihood of confusion as to the source or sponsorship of the associated goods or services24 trademark rights persist so long as the mark continues to be used and retains its distinctiveness25 another intellectual property right concerns the protection of pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical test data most national governments regulate the marketing of pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals in the interest of public health 26 this oversight includes required showing that these products are safe and effective before they can be distributed to the public such evidence is not generated by government laboratories however rather national governments require sponsors of new drugs and agricultural chemicals to submit test data that evidence their safety and efficacy27 because the required test data may be very costly to generate sponsors of new pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals often do not disclose test data to the public otherwise the sponsors competitors could avoid the expenses of developing this data for themselves sponsors also desire government agencies that receive the test data to maintain the data in confidence28 in addition brandname pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical firms often seek to limit the ability of generic competitors to rely upon the data in order to obtain marketing approval of their own products even if they cannot actually view the data themselves29 in the united states federal legislation limits the ability of generic competitors to reference data generated by the manufacturers of brandname pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals with respect to pharmaceuticals these marketing exclusivities consist of period of time during which the food and drug administration fda protects an approved drug protection from competing applications for marketing approval under the hatchwaxman act30 drugs that qualify as new chemical entity31 may obtain five years of marketing exclusivity32 the hatch waxman act also provides for threeyear marketing exclusivity awarded to drug sponsor that conducts new clinical studies upon drug that does not qualify as new chemical entity33 the 24 see r

provides for data protection for agricultural chemicals under somewhat different certain terms and conditions35 number of rationales explain the intellectual property laws some legal experts assert that intellectual property laws are needed to encourage individuals to create new works of authorship inventions and other innovative subject matter it is believed that absent system of proprietary rights free riders could readily exploit these works without having to bear the costs of creating them individuals would in turn possess diminished incentives to devote their efforts to being authors or inventors 36 in addition intellectual property rights are said to facilitate market mechanisms by creating discrete welldefined property interests that decrease transaction costs and encourage commercial exchanges37 on the other hand intellectual property laws have been subject to criticism some assert that intellectual property rights are unnecessary due to market forces that already suffice to create an optimal level of creative activity the desire to become famous or to gain lead time advantage over competitors may well provide sufficient induc ement to write or to invent without the need for further incentives38 in an era where information can be readily transmitted around the globe the notion that an innovation can be an object of possession has also been challenged39 each of these contentions has varying degree of persuasiveness as of yet however conclusive study has demonstrated that the social benefits of the intellectual property laws outweigh the costs as result the justifications and criticisms of intellectual property remain open to challenge 40 g22g145g142g561g22g20g11g18g21g561g3g144g155g142g142g150g142g151g157g561 at present time unified

in different jurisdictions42 absent some obligation particular nation is not required to provide intellectual property rights that resemble those of the united states or even to establish such laws at all43 since the nineteenth century however many nations in fact have committed to provide certain standards of intellectual property protection via bilateral and multilateral international agreements44 the most significant of these is the wto agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights commonly known as the trips agreement45 domestically the uruguay round agreements act in 1995 made significant amendments to us intellectual property laws in an effort to comply with the trips agreement46 as discussed below the trips agreement required each wto member state to provide minimum substantive standards of intellectual property protection and enforcement g9g142g151g142g155g138g149g561g18g155g152g159g146g156g146g152g151g156g561 the trips agreement requires each wto member state to observe the standards of national treatment and mostfavorednation with respect to its intellectual property laws 47 following the national treatment principle wto members agree to treat foreign inventors worse than domestic inventors in their patent laws so long as these foreign inventors are nationals of wto member state it would be impermissible for ex ample for the uspto to charge nationals of wto member state higher application fee than is required of us citizens or to provide shorter patent term for such inventors than is granted to us inventors under

for pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical test data under certain conditions although this obligation is stated succinctly in article 393 of the trips agreement it has proven controversial article 393 specifically provides members when requiring as condition of approving the marketing of pharmaceutical or of agricultural chemical products which utilize new chemical entities the submission of undisclosed test or other data the origination of which involves considerable effort shall protect such data against unfair commercial use in addition members shall protect such data against disclosure except where necessary to protect the public or unless steps are taken to ensure that the data are protected against unfair commercial use many commentators have observed that in contrast to the more specific wordings of many other trips agreements provisions article 393 establishes broad parameters using vague language72 in particular terms such as new chemical entities considerable effort and unfair commercial use receive further definition within the trips agreement as result the precise nature of the obligations article 393 imposes upon wto member states is not entirely clear73 g17g157g145g142g155g561g11g151g157g142g149g149g142g140g157g158g138g149g561g18g155g152g153g142g155g157g162g561g20g146g144g145g157g156g561 the trips agreement also establishes minimum standards

signates itself developed developing or least developed country for wto members other than developing and least developed countries the compliance date for all requirements of the trips agreement was set to january 1 199679 for signatory states designated as developing countries the trips agreement set the general compliance date as january 1 2000 however there is one exception to this general date if on january 1 2000 developing country did not extend patent protection to all areas of technology within the meaning of article 27 that developing country may delay implementation of these provisions for an additional five years prior to the trips agreement for example many developing countries did not allow patents to issue on pharmaceuticals the practical effect of this additional transition period was that developing countries did not need to allow patents concerning pharmaceuticals until january 1 2005 leastdeveloped countries are entitled to lengthier transition period in implementing trips agreement obligations effective dates with respect to leastdeveloped countries are found in the trips agreement itself as well as the 2001 declaration on the trips agreement and

january 1 2016 without prejudice to their ability to seek other extensions of these transition periods the trips agreement does not oblige its signatories to protect subject matter that fell into the public domain prior to the time its obligations became effective82 for example suppose that particular developing country as compared to developed or leastdeveloped country traditionally did not allow patents to issue on pharmaceuticals if that developing country joined the wto it must amend its patent law to authorize pharmaceutical patents the trips agreement requires only that patents be allowed on new products as of january 1 2005 however and does not mandate that patents be granted retroactively as result within that developing country patent protection need not be afforded to pharmaceuticals that were public available prior to january 1 2005 even if those pharmaceuticals were patented elsewhere

that the trips agreement has led to large transfers of wealth from poor countries to the developed world and in particular to the united states 83 others have contended that the introduction of strong intellectual property rights protection into the developing world restricts sustainable development and perpetuates their dependence upon developed nations84 still others believe that deleterious public health consequences will result from the trips agreement requirement that patents issue on pharmaceuticals proponents of the trips agreement instead believe that the introduction of fullfledged intellectual property laws around the globe will provide needed incentives for investment and innovation 85 such efforts could promote solutions to problems that are particular to the developing world including the provision of nutritional needs and cures for diseases not common in the developed world supporters also observe that the trips agreement was one component of multifaceted wto agreement and believe that the developing world obtained trade benefits in exchange for assuming obligations to protect intellectual property even after decade of experience with the trips agreement the

restriction exists under us law in enacting the bipartisan trade promotion act of 2002 congress stated that an overall negotiating objective of such agreements was to encourage our treaty partners to agree to standard of intellectual property protection similar to that found in united states law91 in keeping with this mandate the united states has entered into numerous ftas that have required their signatories to provide higher levels of intellectual property protection than are required under the trips agreement92 with respect to the intellectual property laws each of the ftas stipulates standards that comply with current us law as result the united states need take action in order to comply with those provisions of the fta in contrast the us treaty partner must often substantially amend its intellectual property laws in order to comply with the fta93 this report next offers an overview of these fta tripsplus94 intellectual property obligations it should be noted that the

conditions of the use of the work g18g138g157g142g151g157g156g561 several ftas require their signatories to provide oneyear grace period to patent applicants under these provisions individuals are granted one year from the date they publicly disclose their inventions to decide whether to file patent application or not 98 ftas also commonly require their signatories to accede to the patent cooperation treaty99 an international agreement that expedites multinational patent acquisition procedures100 certain of the ftas also call for patent term extension based upon administrative delays the trips agreement obligates all wto members to provide patent term of twenty years from the date of filing101 however patent applicants obtain enforceable rights until such time as the patent actually issues as result extensive patent office delays could substantially diminish the period of time in which the patent proprietor enjoys enforceable patent rights certain of the ftas therefore call for patent term extension in the ev ent of unreasonable delays in partys issuance of patents 102 some ftas also place additional conditions on the grant of compulsory licenses beyond the requirements of the trips agreement for example the australiaus fta provides that compulsory license may be issued only to remedy an antitrust violation or in cases of public non commercial use national emergency or other ci rcumstances of extreme urgency in these latter instances the fta signatory must limit use of the patented invention to the government or governmentauthorized entity and shall provide the patent proprietor with reasonable compensation further the patent proprietor is not required to provide additional undisclosed information or technical knowhow that is related to the patented invention103 g22g155g138g141g142g150g138g155g148g156g561 number of the ftas also pertain to the trademark law they stipulate that mark need not be visually perceptible in order to be

entity that has been previously approved in the territory of the party108 some of the ftas additionally require their signatories to allow threeyear term of marketing exclusivity in various circumstances for pharmaceuticals that do not qualify as new products109 among them is the australiaunited states free trade agreement which provides in part with respect to pharmaceutical products if party requires the submission of new clinical information other than information related to bioequivalency or b evidence of prior approval of the product in another territory that requires such new information which is essential to the approval of pharmaceutical product the party shall not permit third persons not having the consent of the person providing the information to market the same or

the united states has for many years pursued policy of encouraging our trading partners to expand legal protection for intellectual property115 decreased levels of intellectual property piracy with respect to computer software music motion pictures and pharmaceuticals may promote more favorable balance of trade for us industry as professor j thomas mccarthy member of the faculty of the university of sa n francisco law school clearly stated we care because if intellectual property protection exists regarding technical and entertainment information then we have little to sell the rest of the world116 enhanced levels of intellectual property protection around the world may also serve other goals of the united states for example pharmaceuticals are often sold at higher prices in the united states than in other nations117 the previous unavailability of patent protection for innovative pharmaceuticals in some foreign jurisdictions is one factor that may have contributed to this price difference the introduction of patent protection fo r pharmaceuticals in developing countries will potentially allow innovative drug companies to recover portion of their rd expenses in foreign jurisdictions in turn because us consumers will longer be responsible for funding such large share of the rd expenditures of innovative drug companies on global basis the price of medications may decrease in the united states it is possible however that developing country markets may not prove sufficiently profitable such that prices would be reduced for us consumers 118 in comparison with

consultations over proposed patent law harmonization treaty before the world intellectual property organization wipo119 one uspto news release stated for example that recent events at wipo raise serious questions as to whether wipo is even viable forum for further meaningful patent discussions120 in contrast the ftas have already resulted in significant patent law reforms for many us trading partners in addition by establishing certain multinational intellectual property norms with the assistance of number of trading partners the united states may be better able to negotiate on multilateral basis in the future 121 g18g152g157g142g151g157g146g138g149g561g14g152g140g148g556g11g151g561g7g143g143g142g140g157g156g561 although many observers have cited the merits of ftas with respect to the intellectual property interests of the united states others have expressed concerns about the effects or implications of these agreements some commentators have expressed concern that the ftas may potentially introduce complications to us law reform efforts even in circumstances where modifications to domestic intellectual property rules are considered desirable in the future 122 in particular should the congress later wish to make changes to its ws that are inconsistent with the terms of the ftas the united states would either have to renegotiate these agreements or face the possibility of violating their terms potential example of this situation involves the importation of patented pharmaceuticals into the united states topic that the singaporean australian and moroccan ftas address for example article 159 paragraph 4 of the united statesmorocco fta provides each party shall provide that the exclusive right of the patent owner to prevent importation of patented product or product that results from patented process without the consent of the patent owner shall not be limited by the sale or distribution of that product outside its territory footnote 10 party may limit application of this paragraph to cases where the patent owner has placed restrictions on importation by contract or other means this provision impacts among other topics practice commonly termed parallel importation123 or reimportation124 parallel imports are authentic products that are legitimately distributed abroad and then sold in the united states without the permission of the authorized us dealer these goods are legitimate in that they are produced by the brandname drug company or its authorized representative in particular parallel imports are not generic versions of brandname drug distributed by different manufacturer nor are they pirated copies that form part of the black market because parallel imports disrupt the marketing arrangements established by the brandname drug company however they are sometimes called grey market goods 125 119 the wipo is specialized united nations agency that serves as forum for intellectual property the wipo website

block imports of proprietary pharmaceuticals the fact that the patent proprietor or its representative previously sold the drug outside the united states does not affect this analysis this rule rejects principle termed international exhaustion under which sale of drug anywhere in the world exhausts the us patent the ftas that address this issue therefore comport with governing us judicial opinions legislation that had been proposed before the 109th congress would have altered the current rules concerning the parallel importation of patented pharmaceuticals the proposed affordable health care act s 16 senator kennedy would have in part introduced the following provision into the patent statute it shall not be an act of infringement to use offer to sell or sell within the united states or to import into the united states any patented invention under section 804 of the federal food drug and cosmetic act that was first sold abroad by or under authority of the owner or licensee of such patent 127 if enacted this proposal would have caused the international exhaustion principle to apply to foreign sales of patented pharmaceuticals in circumstances where the patent owner sold the patented pharmaceutical abroad the patent owner would have longer been able to block imports of these products into the united states this result appears to conflict with article 159 paragraph 4 of the united statesmorocco fta as well as the counterpart provisions of the singaporean and australian ftas perhaps out of recognition of the impact of the ftas on the parallel importation issue representative northrup introduced an amendment to the science state justice commerce and related agencies appropriation act 2006 pl 109108 section 631 of that legislation provides none of the funds made available in this act may be used to include in any new bilateral or multilateral trade agreement the text of 1 paragraph 2 of article 167 of the united statessingapore free trade agreement 2 paragraph 4 of article 179 of the united statesaustralia free trade agreement or 3 paragraph 4 of article 159 of the united statesmorocco free trade agreement this provision apparently prevents future ft as from incorporating language rejecting an international exhaustion rule for pharmaceuticals this provision does not address the existing singaporean australian and moroccan ftas however this

ftas extend to limited set of trading partners on its face it would appear that us obligations undertaken in particular fta would extend only to its fellow signatory or signatories commitments undertaken in the trips agreement may extend fta obligations to much broader range of us trading partners how ever in particular every wto member may in fact be entitled to enjoy the benefits of the commitments made with particular fta due to the mostfavorednation obligation imposed by article 4 of the trips agreement that provision stipulates with regard to the protection of intellectual property any advantage favour privilege or immunity granted by member to the nationa ls of any other country shall be accorded immediately and unconditionally to the nationals of all other members although article 4 of the trips agreement does pr ovide four exceptions to this mostfavored nation obligation none of these exceptions seems applicable to the ftas128 in view of article 4 of the trips agreement some experts believe that particular fta may extend us obligations not just to its partner or partners to that agreement but to all wto members as well129 other commentators differ however stating that free trade agreements are exempted from mostfavorednation obligations due to certain provisions of the general agreement on tariffs and trade130 one possible consequence of the breadth of fta obligations is that other trading partners may be less willing to make concessions with respect to their intellectual property laws given that they may already be entitled to the full scope of commitments that the united states made in existing ftas 128 article 4 of the trips agreement goes on to stipulate that exempted from this obligation of mostfavored nation treatment are any advantage favour privilege or immunity accorded by member deriving from international agreements on judicial assistance or law enforcement of general nature and not particularly confined to the protection of intellectual property b granted in accordance with the provisions of the berne convention 1971 or the rome convention authorizing that the treatment accorded be function not of national treatment but of the treatment accorded in another country c in respect of the rights of performers producers of phonograms and broadcasting organizations not provided under this agreement d deriving from international agreements related to the protection of intellectual property which entered into force prior to the entry into force of the wto agreement provided that such agreements are notified to the council for trips and do not constitute an arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against nationals of other members as applied to the ftas these treaties do not appear to be general agreements concerning judicial assistance or law enforcement they also do not appear to have been carried out under the auspices of the berne or rome conventions nor do they appear to be limited to the rights of performers phonogram producers and broadcasting organizations finally the three ftas were completed after the wto agreement came into effect rendering the final exception seemingly inapplicable 129

smaller trading partners of the united states as explained by trade attorney george gonzalez the process of bilateral negotiation in multilateral world context favors the negotiating stance of the affluent developed states over the wealthconstrained developing states131 under this view access to the us market for agricultural products textiles and other basic goods is extremely important to less wealthy nations as result us trading partners are readily willing to accede to the intellectual property proposals of the united states during the fta negotiation process some observers have criticized the united states for allegedly taking advantage of its strong bargai ning position and superior intellectual property expertise when it completes ftas132 it should be appreciated however that many observers believe that the adoption of robust intellectual property laws lies in the best intere st of us trading partne rs including developing nations commentator jean raymond homere has concluded for example that developing countries with stronger intellectual property regimes are in better position to attract knowledgerelated foreign direct investments fdi flows133 the ftas may also encourage greater innovation as well as the exploitation of creative works within jurisdictions that previously lacked strong intellectual property rights134 it may also be appreciated that any international agreement necessarily involves an exchange of benefits and obligations among the signatory states and that the partners to particular fta may be best situated to assess the advantages and disadvantages of entering into that agreement for themselves g5g152g151g140g149g158g141g146g151g144g561g17g139g156g142g155g159g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 congressional interest in the ftas as vehicle for advancing the intellectual property interests of the united states is fueled by number of objectives among them are combating high levels of intellectual property piracy overseas supporting research and developmentbased domestic industries and establishing more favorable balance of trade although the ftas are believed to be an effective mechanism towards achieving these goals concerns have arisen about both their fairness as well as their consequences in terms of us obligations towards other trading partners and their impact upon contemplated changes to domestic law the scope of these potential consequences counsels continued congressional attention towards the ftas that the united states has already formed as well as those ftas that are planned for the future 131
