summarizes the courts decision in hudson and will not be updated legal background beginning with the us supreme courts decisions in weeks v united states1 and mapp v ohio 2 the mandates of the four th amendment have been enforced through the application of an excl usionary rule which generally states that evidence illegally seized may not be used against the defendant in weeks federal agent had conducted an illega l warrantless search for evidence of gambling in mr weekss home the evidence seized in the search was used at trial and weeks was convicted on appeal the supreme court held that the f ourth amendment barred the use of evidence secured through warrantless search week ss conviction was reve rsed and thus the federal exclusionary ru was developed in mapp the court held that the exclusionary rule should and did apply to the states it was logically and c onstitutionally necessary wrote justice clark for the majority that the exclusion doctrine an essential part of the right to privacy be also insisted upon as an essential ingredient of the right to be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures to hold otherwise is to grant the righthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22475crs2 3 id at 65556 justice black concurred doubting that the fourth amendment compelled adoption of an exclusionary rule but rely ing on the fifth amendment for authority id 4 ker v california 374 us 23 1963

nw 2d 376 1999per curiam people v stevens 597 nw 2d 53 1999but in reality to withhold its privilege and enjoyment3 further the court held that because illegally seized evidence was to be excluded from federal and state courts the standards by which the questi on of legality was to be dete rmined should be the same regardless of whether the court in which th evidence was offered was state or federal4 the application of the exclusionary rule became matter of uncertainty in the latter part of the 20th century courts found themselves cons tantly weighing the costs versus the benefits of applying the rule how far s hould court go in protecting the rights of defendants against illegal searches and seizures when they have allegedly broken the law should the exclusionary rule be invoked to pr otect these rights when the police have acted in error as opposed to intentionally overstepping constitutional bounds the court revisited the issue of the rules applicability most recently in hudson v michigan facts and procedural history in hudson the defendant was arrested in 1998 when police entered his detroit home with search warrant the door was unlocked and police admitted they violated th knockandannounce requirement5 of waiting few seconds before entering6 officers found crack cocaine in hudsons pocket as well as other drugs and gun elsewhere in the home he was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to deliver and illegal fir earm possession hudsons attorney moved to suppress the evidence found in the home argu ing that the police had violated hudsons fourth amendment rights by ignoring the knockandanno unce requirement upon entering his home while hudsons case was in the trial cour t the michigan supreme court ruled in people v stevens7 that suppression is inappropriate when entry is made pursuant to warrant but without following proper knockandannounce procedure in spite of stevens the trial court judge ruled the ev idence found in hudsons home should be suppressed and dismissed the ch arges however the michig an court of appeals reversed the suppression order relying on stevens 8 hudson was ultimate ly convicted and sentenced to18 months probati on for the cocaine found in his pocket hudson appealed arguing that the conviction was unconstituti onal because the drugs in hudsons pocket should have been suppressed as evidence af ter the knockanda nnounce violation the michigan court of appeals affirmed the conviction and the mich igan supreme courthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22475crs3 9 692 nw 2d 385 2005 10 545 us _____ 2005 the case was initially argued in the court on january 9 2006 when justice sandra day oconnor was still on the court the justices on april 19 ordered it re argued by which time justice oconnor had been replaced by justice alito 11 joined by chief justice roberts and justices kennedy thomas and alito 12 slip op at 5 13 id at 9 stating that ignoring knockandannounce can realistically be expected to achieve absolutely nothing except the prevention of dest ruction of evidence and the avoidance of life threatening resistance by occupants of the premis esdangers which if there is even reasonable suspicion of their existence suspend the knockandannounce requirement anyway 14 id 15 id at 11 16 id at 12denied hudsons leave to appeal9 on june 27 2005 the us supreme court accepted review in the case10 united states supreme court decision in 54 decision the court ruled that violation by the police of the knocka ndannounce rule when entering home with warrant does not bar the use of evidence ga thered in the search the opinion written by justice scalia11 relied on two fundamental theories first in employing costbenefit analysis the majority concluded that suppr essing the evidence was simply too high penalty to pay for violating ones fourth amendment rights to knock on the door whether that preliminary misstep had occurred or not scalia wrote the police would have executed the warrant they had obtaine d and would have discovered the gun and drugs inside the house12 suppressing the evidence he further noted would be tantamount to getoutofjail free card while violati on of the warrant requirement would have led to suppression the majority contended that there is very little deterrent effect or value to the suppression of eviden ce seized after viola tion of the knockand announce requirements13 moreover the court stated that the pur pose of the knockandannounce rule was to protect life property and dignity by gi ving the homeowner time to respond to the door thus eliminating the need for police officers to break down the door according to the court the rule has never protected ones interest in preventing the government from seeing or taking evidence described in warrant14 second the majority concluded that the need for deterrence is minimized inasmuch as the legal landscape has changed the cour t reasoned that other means of deterrence were available and effective civil remedies are now available including attorneys fees for civilrights plaintiffs the court noted that lower cour ts are allowing colorable knock andannounce suits to proceed unimpeded by assertions of qualified immunity15 in addition the court reasoned that the inc reasing professionalism of police forces including new emphasis on internal police discipline reduces the need for deterrence the court concluded that police officers as result of training recognize and respect constitutional guarantees16httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22475crs4 17 concurrence at 2 18 dissent at 1 19 see

exclusionary rule against the incremental deterrent benefits of invoking it in grand jury proceedings 23 pennsylvania board of parole v scott 524 us 357 1998 24 nix v williams 467 us 431 1984holding that evid ence obtained through an unlawful search or seizure is admissible in court if it can be established to very high degree of probability that normal police investigation would have inevitably led to the discovery of the evidence 25 the attenuation exception to the exclusionary rule states that evidence may be suppressed only if there is clear causal connection between the illegal police action and the evidence wong sun v united states 371 us 471 1963justice kennedy wrote separate opinion to concur in the majoritys conclusion apparently attempting to minimize the decisions impact on the viability of the exclusionary rule he iterated that the knockandannounce rule is not something that should be taken lightly he further noted that while suppression of evidence is not necessary when such violations occur civil lawsuits can still be brought against the police and that legislatures have duty to ensure police officers act competently and lawfully17 the dissent written by justice breyer and joined by justices stevens ginsburg and souter argued that the excl usionary rule should apply to knockandannounce violations justice breyer wrote that not only is the knocka ndannounce rule historically important but that there are only very sm all number of exceptions to the exclusionary rule none of which the knock andannounce rule fits within according to the dissent the majoritys decision weakens perhaps destroys much of the practical value of the constitutions knocka ndannounce protection18 implications of hudson v michigan hudson continues trend by the court toward narrowing the applicability of the exclusionary rule as remedy for unreasonable searches and seizures beginning in the 1970s court decisions have limited the rules application defendants who th emselves were not subjected to illegal searches and seizures were found unable to object to the introduction against themselves of evidence illegally obtained from cocons pirators or codefendants19 and defendants whose rights had been infringed could find the ev idence admitted for impeachment purposes20 the exclusionary rule also was found to be inapplicable in civil cases21 grand jury proceedings22 and parole revocation hearings23 other exceptions to the exclusionary rule include the 1 inevitable discovery doctrine24 2 attenuation exception25 3 independenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22475crs5 26 allows evidence to be admitted in court if knowledge of the evidence is gained from separate or independent source that is co mpletely unrelated to the illegality at hand segura v united states 468 us 796 1984holding that po lice officers illegal entry upon private premised did not require suppression of evidence subsequently discovered at those premises when executing search warrant obtained on the basis of information wholly unconnected with the initial entry 27 the goodfaith exception may allow some eviden ce gathered in violation of the constitution if the violation results in only minor or technical error if magistrate is erroneous in granting police officer warrant and the officer acts on the warrant in good faith then the evidence resulting in the execution of the warrant is not suppressible however there are number of situations in which the goodfaith exception will not apply 1 reasonable officer would have relied on the affidavit underlying the warrant 2 the warrant is defective on its face for failing to state the place to be searched or things to be seized 3 the warrant was obtained by fraud on the part of government official or 4 the ma gistrate wholly abandoned his judicial role see us v leon 468 us 897 1984 massachusetts v sheppard 468 us 981 1984 illinois v krull 480 us 340 1987source exception26 and 4 goodfaith exception27 hudson further narrows the applicability of the exclusionary rule by eliminating criminal defendants primary remedy for knockandannoun ce violations by police officers although limited to knockandannounce violations the majority opinion in hudson calls into question the continued viability of the exclusionary rule as remedy for other fourth amendment violations
