the 200 million included in the fy1999 supplemental may be carried over to fy2000 coast guard analysis of the fy2000 budget introduction the coast guard appropriation is constrained and its management challenged by increased responsibilities for drug and illegal immigrant interdiction on the high seas as well as its aging watercraft and aircraft the administration requests 41 billion for coast guard discretionary funds in fy2000 both appropriations subcommittees have held hearings on the proposal and reported legislation on june 23 1999 the house passed the appropriation compared to the total 45 billion appropriated in fy1999 the fy2000 request would be 357 million or 8 less than all appropriated fy1999 funds1 however compared to the base appropriation excluding the onetime emergency and supplemental fy1999 funds the request could be considered an actual increase of about 230 million or 6 in addition to these discretionary funds there are mandatory funds of 64 million for state boating safety grants compared to the 41 billion requested the senate september 16th recommended 40 billion in hr 2084 s 1143 srept 10655 and on june 23 1999 the house passed 40 billion in hr 2084

crs report rl30208 appropriations for fy2000 department of transportation and related agencies within the coast guard appropriation there are seven major accounts covering operations capital projects environmental activities alteration of bridges retired pay reserves and research coast guard funds are included in the roughly 21 or about 12 billion of the roughly 55 billion appropriatio n that is not firewalled essentially fixed appropriation tied to trust funds and thus not under the annual control of the appropriations committee2 the house appropriations committee explained in its report that the coast guards requested level was simply not possible due to the firewalls while the bill enjoyed an 8 increase under the budget allocation highway and other needs took most of that increase leaving the coast guard scrambling for the remaining crumbs according to the committee essentially both reported versions fund most coast guard activities at fy1999 base appropriation levels operation and maintenance for the operations and maintenance program om the budget seeks 30 billion in budget authority 107 million or 4 less than fy1999 representing about twothirds of the coast guards resources this program account funds seven central mandates assigned to the agency these include search and rescue aids to navigation marine safety marine environmental protection enforcement of laws and treaties ice operations and defense readiness each of these would increase 4 above fy1999 levels under the proposal five hundred twentyone million dollars of the total operations budget would be directed to drug interdiction activities plus 21 million in capital expenses for total of 542 million an amount approved by both committees roughly onehalf of the om account or 14 billion is for compensating personnel this includes 4524 civilian and 34869 military personnel in fy1999 emergency and supplemental funding measures congress added over 148 million to this account in actions on the fy2000 request for om the senate approved 28 billion the house 28 billion the senate and house marks are at roughly fy1999 levels for personnel resources operation and maintenance for all commands districts and headquarters this level should not negatively affect the operational readiness of the coast guard according to the committee the senate bill includes legislative language allowing the secretary of transportation to transfer up to 60 million from federal aviation agency operations to coast guard operating expenses for the purpose of providin g additional funds for drug interdiction activities or activities related to the office of intelligence and security3 the report of the conference committee h rept 106355 stated the secretary of transportation may use any surplus funds that are made available to the secretary to the maximum extent practicable for drug interdiction activities of the coast guardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30246crs4 4base funding excluding emergency and

15 significant part of the request is proposal to authorize the collection and spending of user fee for coast guard navigation services to commercial vessels the budget anticipates the fy2000 fee collections would be 41 million and future year collections 165 million per year both the senate and housepassed bills deny this proposal and include language restricting the use of fy2000 funds for developing user fee proposals in the future acquisition construction and improvement another major component of the request would allocate funds for acquisition construction and improvement the administration seeks 350 million 45 million or 13 less than fy1999 base funding4 and 2752 million or 44 less than the total funds appropriated in fy1999 each of the five main program activities would decline by about 13 the senate approved 370 million and the house 410 million for this account the conference agreed to 389 million both appropriation committees shared concern over how the coast guard would fund the deepwater major vessel replacement in future fiscal years the senate would establish special new account and both versions would authorize that the proceeds from the sale of surplus property be deposited into this appropriation account the fy2000 request of 44 million is still for planning the replacement the senate approved 45 million and up to 15 million more in discretionary funds for total ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30246crs5 60 million the house approved 40 million the conference approved 44 million with up to total of 50 million in fy 2000 with the additional funds derived from proceeds of sale of surplus property environmental compliance to address coast guard responsibilities for complying with environmental provisions the budget seeks 195 million in budget authority some 7 less than current year funding much of this 123 million is targeted to restoring and mitigating environmental contamination especially thousands of batteries disposed of by the coast guard in many offshore buoy locations also being addressed are hazardous waste sites at kodiak ak elizabeth nc and cape cod ma another part of the program addresses polychlorinated biphenyl pcb laden cutters and boats onefourth of this account or 4 million would be devoted to complying with environmental provisions and preventing pollution this includes hazardous waste minimization variety of small compliance projects and meeting compliance requirements under the oil pollution act clean air and clean water acts both appropriation committees praised the coast guards efficient management of its environmental restoration project the senate approved 125 million for this account the house 18 million and the conference agreed to 17 million alteration of bridges for four bridge replacement projects the senate approved 14 million the amount requested and the house 15 million the conference agreement was 15 million retirement at level of 730 million the allocation for retirement pay would be 46 million or 7 greater than fy1999 the senate approved 730 million the house 721 million this is scored as mandatory appropriation an issue with this account involved the administrations request that this funding be considered indefinite budget authority and that set appropriation level be replaced by such sums as are necessary both committees denied this overture and continued to require that this account be subject to appropriations the conference approved an appropriation of 730 million reserve training the administration requested and both bodies approved 72 million to train support and sustain ready military selected reserve force of 7600 members for direct support to the department of defense and to provide surge capacity for responses to emergencies such as cleanup operations following oil spills the requested level would be 2 million or 3 less than current year funding with an anticipated strength of 12853 about 100 less than the current year level the coast guard reserve is ready for active duty should conflict nationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30246crs6 emergency or disaster occur this account helps maintain this readiness through mobilization and other exercises research development test and evaluation funding for research would increase 27 to level of 22 million under the fy2000 proposal the house approved 21 million and the senate 17 million level with fy1999 funding the conference agreed to 19 million this account funds various activities to develop techniques methods hardware and systems to support coast guard missions priorities for 2000 include drug interdiction surveillance fuel cell vessel propulsion computerized searchandrescue tools and more effective oil spill response techniques states the coast guards budget justification most of the planned increase for fy2000 would be devoted to fuel cell research with an eye to future use and significant reduction of operating costs and crewing requirements the other priority is maritime sensor technology used in drug interdiction efforts to identify and intercept high speed go fast boasts used by drug smugglers oil spill liability trust fund the coast guard administers the 1 billion oil spill liability trust fund and annually about onetenth of the fund is allocated to the coast guard for its regular responsibilities the budget seeks 48 million for various associated costs including cleaning up spills boat safety discretionary appropriations are requested for the national recreational boating safety program which is now mandatory appropriation the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 includes permanent appropriations of 64 million annually from the aquatic resources trust fund maintained by motorboat fuel tax of 184 cents per gallon this includes 59 million for grants to states and 5 million for the coast guards coordination activity other coast guard requested funding includes 61 million for spill cleanup and initial damage assessment available without further appropriation from the oil spill liability trust fund key issues associated with the budget request the two key issues that have dominated debate over the fy2000 request for the coast guard involve the deepwater replacement program and user fees managing replacement of coast guard capital resources prominent issue is the coast guards management of major planned replacement of aging and outmoded high seas vessels and aircraft only planning and analysis funds are included for this in the fy2000 request actual purchases of nearly 10 billion are anticipated over 20year period beginning in fy2001 at house transportation and infrastructure hearings on february 11 1999 and at the house appropriations transportation subcommittee march 16 1999 the general accounting officehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30246crs7 5srept 106180 p 33criticized the agencys handling of this vital replacement program crs report 98 830 coast guard integrated deepwater system background and issues for congress discusses the issues associated with the program both appropriations committees voiced concern over the deepwater replacement program two things dominate that concern the budgetary magnitude of the effort compared to the budgetary limitations affecting the coast guard budget and the agencys management of the replacement program so far to deal with the capital needs the senate and house have recommended certain account changes however concern persists over how the replacement program is being managed in march 16 testimony before authorizing and appropriating committees gaotrced99116 strategies for procuring new ships aircraft and other assets gao has criticized the coast guards planning to date and raised concerns about how the agency will manage this complex multibillion dollar replacement project specifically gao maintains that the coast guard has not sufficiently justified the project and produced key data further the gao sees the need for new coast guard budget strategy since the costs of this project will outstrip resources the senate report stated committee remains concerned that this maybe too ambitious and unproven for an agency that has experienced difficulty in managing large and complex acquisition projects5 coast guard user fee proposal another issue involves the coast guards planned use of user fees the budget anticipates using 41 million from new user fees to recapitalize vessels information management and coast guard shore infrastructure not part of the deepwater replacement effort the administration will propose legislation to authorize user fees for commercial cargo vessels and cruise ships it anticipates collecting 41 million in fy2000 and 165 million annually when fully operational proposals for user fees for traditional coast guard services such as buoy placement and vessel traffic regulation have been controversial some argue that these services should be funded from general funds because of their widespread benefits others argue that user fees should be assigned in instances where the beneficiaries can be clearly identified based on senate and house report language the current proposal to institute commercial vessel user fees appears to be defeated future planning of such proposals also would be prohibited under senate and housereported bills which include legislative language prohibiting the coast guard from spending funds on development of user fee proposals httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30246
