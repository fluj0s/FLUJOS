implementing the provisions of the financial services regulatory relief act of 2006 pl 109351 new financial services regulatory relief measures were introduced in the 110th congress1 reducing the regulatory burden on financial service providers has been an ongoing 1 for information on regulatory relief measures in addition to hr 6312 in the 110th congress please see crs report rs22651 financial services regulatory relief implementation and reintroduced provisions in the 110th congress by walter w eubanks and crs report rs22661 credit union regulatory improvements act curia hr 1537 and s 2957 by pauline smale crs2 concern since the passage of the economic growth and regulatory paperwork reduction act egrpra 110 stat 3009394 mandating that financial regulators review their regulations at least once every 10 years in an effort to eliminate any regulatory requirements that are outdated unnecessary or unduly burdensome in addition the intended purpose of regulatory relief is to enhance the services provided by depository institutions and to contain the growing costs of regulatory compliance the experience of prior congresses has shown that bills incorporating provisions that would reduce regulatory requirements on banks thrifts and credit unions tend to receive stronger support or less opposition than legislative proposals that address the industries separately hr 6312 is viewed as compromise bill drafted to attract support from advocates for both the bankingthrift and the credit union industries the legislation like pl 109351 provides some but not all of the changes sought separately by advocates for the bankingthrift and the credit union industries therefore even if hr 6312 is enacted the industries interests in regulatory relief are likely to continue an overview of hr 6312 the credit union bank and thrift regulatory relief act of 2008 hr 6312 was httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22924 introduced on june 19 2008 by representative

longer maturity for certain credit union loans the regulatory relief act of 2006 gave the ncua the authority to increase the 12year maturity limit on nonreal estate secured loans to 15 years this section would provide the ncua with the additional flexibility to issue regulations to increase that 15 year maturity limit to longer term for specific types of loans sec 105 providing the national credit union administration with greater flexibility in responding to market conditions the rate of interest on loans made by federal credit union may not exceed 15 the usury limit under most

credit union membership access act pl 105219 permits only credit unions with multiple common bond charters to expand services to individuals and groups living in areas of high unemployment and below

communities these underserved areas include investment areas under the treasury departments community development financial institution cdfi program and qualified low income area under the new markets tax credit targeting formula adopted by congress in 2000 census tracts which would otherwise qualify but in which more than 50 of resident families make more than 75 000 per year would not qualify the

requirements with respect to outof state branches current law requires that federal savings associations must meet the qualified thrift lender qtl test both as entity operating regionally or

biennial report to congress it would also amend the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of 1989 and the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 to repeal certain reporting requirements reactions to hr 6312 the proposed credit union bank and thrift regulatory relief act of 2008 is viewed by many as compromise between the positions taken by credit union and the banking industries this compromise was reached after the banking industry launched an intense lobbying effort against the credit union regulatory relief act hr 5519 and the credit union regulatory improvement act hr 1537 which would have expanded the definition of the field of membership allowing more credit unions to provide financial services in unserved areas increased the cap on member business lending allowing credit unions to make more business loans and instituted riskbased system of prompt corrective action which would allow credit unions use their capital more efficiently and increase their capacity to make more loans the banking industry saw these provisions as making credit httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22924 unions more competitive with banks in addition to the tax exemption they already possess the compromise was reached after the credit union industry modified its definition of underserved areas by reducing them in addition hr 6312 would lift the cap on member business loans less than it was lifted in the earlier legislation and would drop the riskbased system perhaps what was most important was that the compromise added the provisions of the bank regulatory relief act of 2008 hr 5841 the banking industrys own regulatory relief bill that had already passed the house the resulting hr 6312 has the support of the credit union national association the independent community bankers of america and the american bankers association2 one provision in hr 6312 that was opposed in the past by some small banking institutions is the provision to pay interest on business checking accounts as mentioned above current law prohibits the payment of interest on checking account because banks are required to keep higher reserve balance on transaction accounts as these deposits can be withdrawn at anytime smaller depository institutions that are failing at higher rate than larger ones are likely to be even less profitable if they are required to pay interest on business checking accounts3 2 see cu reg relief bill sails through full house cuna new now june 24 2008 p 1 joe adler banks and cus alike lukewarm on kanjorski bill american banker
