introduction statutory proscriptions against the illega l importation of aliens into the united states can be found as far back as 18751 the modern statute that broadly prohibits various forms of alien smuggling predates the immigration and nationality act ina the current source for the bulk of the federal immigration laws and was first enacted in 19172 today this provision and its ma ny amendments can now be found in ina 2743 not only does this statute prohibit the smuggling of aliens across the us border but it also prohibits the tran sport and harboring of aliens within the united states thus the statute covers broad spectrum of activities that could conceivably subject to criminal liability any individual who provides assistance to an alien he knows or should know is unlawfu lly present within the united states recently there has been flurry of pr oposed legislation introduced in congress addressing alien smuggling the proposed legislation can be found in multiple bills all containing near identical language that seeks to alter seve ral statutory provisions in both the ina and title 18 of the united states code this report describes the law that currently governs alien smugglin g and then addresses how the proposed legislation would change the current law structurally and substantively activities currently proscribed ina 274 proscribes several ty pes of activities that can be characterized as alien smuggling these activities are characterized broadly potentially criminalizing wide range of activities this is particularly apparent when analyzing the scienter element of these provisions most of thes provisions state that violation occurs when defendant commits an offense knowin g or in reckless disregard of the fact that an aliens presence in the united states is in violation of the law4 reckless disregard requires more than mere ne gligence but it does not require that defendant have actual knowledge that the lien he is assisting is in the countryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34501crs2 5 black s law dictionary 1276 7th ed 1999 defining recklessness see also masson v new yorker magazine inc 501 us 496 510 1991 noting in libel case by public figure the utterer of the defamatory statement must have acted knowing the statement was false or in reckless disregard of its falsity mere negligence is insufficient rodriguezcastro v gonzales 427

authorization to come to enter or reside in the united states brings to or attempts to bring to the united states in any manner whatsoever such alien regardless of any official action which may later be taken with respect to such alien 9 united states v yoshida 303 f3d 1145 1151 1152 9th cir 2002 finding person who guided aliens to an airplane headed to the united states was guilty of unlawfully bringing the aliens to the united states even though she did not pilot the airplane see also united states v gonzaleztorres 309 f3d 594 9th cir 2002 10 mcfarland v united states 19 f2d 805 6th cir 1927illegally for there to be violation5 rather reckless disregard requires person to consciously disregard substantial and unjustifiable risk and such disregard must constitute gross deviation from the standard of care that reasonable person would exercise in the situation6 thus violation would occu r if defendant chooses to assist an alien in some manner when he should have known that the alien was in the united states illegally furthermore although defendant must ither know or act in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien is unlawfully present within the united states in order to commit violati on the person need not know that his act violates the alien smuggling statute and is unlawful in order to be susceptible to criminal liability7 thus scienter ie the intent requirement is only required in terms of the defendant knowing the alien is unlawfully present and the defendant knowingly assisting the alien ignorance about the unlaw fulness of the assistance is most likely not defense bringing an alien to the united states without authorization ina 274a2 makes it an offense to bring or attempt to bring an alien into the united states in any manner whatsoever while knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact an alien has not received prior official authorization to come to enter or reside in the united states regardless of any official action that may later be taken with respect to such alien8 the term bringing potentially broad term is not defined in the ina thus it has been subject to interpre tation by the federal courts for example the ninth circuit has held that bring ing may include activities beyond physical transport such as leading escorting or cau sing an alien to come along to the united states9 on the other hand the sixth circuit has held that merely accompanying or assisting an alien seeking unauthorized entry does not constitute bringing10 furthermore the breadth of this statute is also evident in statutory language

received prior official authorization to come to enter or reside in the united states and regardless of any future official action which may be taken with respect to such alien shall be punished as provided in subparagraph b 13 ina 274a1aii codified at 8 u sc 1324a1aii any person who knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact th at an alien has come to entered or remains in the united states in violation of law transports or moves or attempts to transport or move such alien within the united states by means of transportation or otherwise in furtherance of such violation of law shall be punished as provided in subparagraph b 14 united states v moreno 561 f2d 1321 1323 9th cir 1977 united states v velasquezcruz 929 f2d 420 8th cir 1991 applying moreno 15 moreno 561 f2d at 1323suggests that bringing an alien into the united states constitutes violation even when it was likely that the alien would be eligible for asylum or some other form of relief from removal11 bringing an alien to the united states at place other than designated port of entry ina 274a1ai makes it an offense while knowing person is an alien to bring or attempt to bring such person into the united states at place other than designated port of entry regardless as to whether the person was authorized to come to the united states12 although it appears that this statute overlaps with ina 274a2 it diffe rs in that it imposes criminal liability so long as the defendant knows that the person he is bringing into the united states is an alien knowledge of legal status is irrelevant however in order to incur liability the defendant must assist the alien in evading inspection at port of entry transporting aliens within the united states ina 274a1aii makes it an offense while knowing or in reck less disregard of the fact that an aliens presence in the united states is in violation of the law to transport move or attempt to transport or to move such alien within the united states in furtherance of the violation against the law13 although it appears that this statute is broad it does have limiting principle in order to incur criminal liability the violation must be committed in furtherance of the aliens unl awful entry or presence the ninth and eighth circuits have stated that pers ons transportation of an alien is not in furtherance of an aliens unlawful entry or presence if the transport was only incidentally connected to the aliens unauthorized entry or status14 certain factors the ninth circuit appears to weigh when determining whether there is transport violation are the time place distance and overall impact that the transportation has upon the aliens viola tion of immigration laws15 on the other hand the sixth circuit has rejected this direct and substantial relationship test and instead examines the intent of the person transporting thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34501crs4 16 united states v 1982 ford pick up 873 f2d 947 951 6th cir 1989 17 id at 952 18 see united states v

interpreting harboring statute as not requiring an intent to avoid detection rubiogonzalez 674 f2d at 1067 suggesting that harboring an alien is broader concept than other smuggling provisions relating to th concealment of an alien or the shielding of an alien from detection us v acosta evans 531 f2d 428 9th cir 1976 upholding harboring conviction of defendant who provided illegal aliens with apartment and concluding that harboring pr ovision was not limited to clandestine sheltering only 22 united states v lopez 521 f2d 437 441 2d cir 1975alien16 the circuit has suggested that the tran sport of friends relatives and co workers who are unlawfully present may not constitute transportation in furtherance of an immigration violation if the transport was meant only to maintain the aliens wellbeing and existence criminal liability seems to require that the assistance be given with specific intent to promote an aliens illegal presence within the united states17 other federal circuits in contrast have taken more general approach to assessing whether the transportation of an unauthorized alien is in furtherance of an aliens violation of the law by considering the individual facts and circumstances of each particular case18 harboring aliens ina 274a1aiii makes it an offense while knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien is unlawfully present in the united states to conceal harbor or shield from tection or attempt to conceal harbor or shield from detection such alien19 courts have typically construed the harboring statute broadly for example the fift h circuit has interp reted the provision concerning the shielding of aliens fro m detection to prohibit the warning of unauthorized aliens of the presence of immigration officers20 furthermore some courts have interpreted the harboring provision such that the mere sheltering of an alien knowing or in reckless disregard of the aliens unlawful status is ground for criminal liability regardless of wh ether it was done surreptitiously21 another court has interpreted this provisi on to require conduct tending substantially to facilitate an aliens remaining in the united states illegally22 encouraging or inducing an alien to come to enter or reside in the united states ina 274a1aiv makes it an offense to encourage or induce an alien to come to enter or reside in the united states while knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that the alien would be present within the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34501crs5 23 ina 274a1aiv codified at 8 u sc 1324a1aiv any person who encourages or induces an alien to come to ter or reside in the united states knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such co ming to entry or residence is or will be in violation

united states 543 us 209 2005 holding that federal statute making it crime to conspire to commit listed offense required prosecutors to prove only that conspiracy existed and not that any overt ac tion was subsequently taken in furtherance of the conspiracy 28 see united states v driscoll 449 f2d 894 1st cir 1971 united states v vegalimon 548 f2d 1390 9th cir 1977 29 ina 274a1avii codified at 8 us c 1324a1avii aids or abets the commission of any of the preceding acts shall be punished as provided in continuedin violation of law23 courts have recognized that encouragement or inducement can mean providing conscious material support fo r an aliens attempt to unlawfully enter or reside in the united states for example providing or selling an illegal alien fraudulent immigration and work documents so that he may more easily remain in the united states has been found to be grounds for liability24 indeed the seventh circuit has found that in orde r to demonstrate that pe rson encouraged or induced an alien all that the government needed to establish was that the individual knowingly helped or dvised the alien25 conspiracy to commit smuggling offense ina 274a1avi makes it an offense to engage in any conspiracy to commit any of the acts proscribed by ina 274a126 thus this provision only criminalizes conspiracies to bring or attempt to bring an alien into the united states at place other than designated port of entry to transport move or attempt to transport or move an alien to conceal harbor shield from detection or attempt to conceal harbor or shield from detection an alien and to encourage induce or attempt to encourage or induce an alien to come to enter or reside in the united states alternatively defendant could be charged with federal conspiracy offens under 18 usc 371 which is not limited to the offenses enumerated in ina 274a1 section 371 however may not be the best vehicle to pursue c onspiracy offense because unlike ina 274 it has statutory provision requiring that at least one conspirator commit an overt act to effect the underlying offens for there to be violation27 on the other hand several federal circuits appear to require showing of an overt act in order for there to be an ina 274 conspiracy offense28 aiding and abetting smuggling offense ina 274a1avii makes it an offense to aid and abet the commission of any of the acts proscribed by ina 274a129 alternatively under 18 usc 2 person who aids abetshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34501crs6 29 continued subparagraph b 30 see ina 274ah3 codified at 8 usc 1324a defining an unauthorized alien as an

12month period at l east 10 individuals with actual knowledge that the individuals are either unauthorized aliens30 or have been brought into the united states in violation of ina 274a31 this provision is distinct from ina 274a which more generally imposes penalties upon persons for employing any unlawfully present alien religious denomination exemption despite the rather broad sweep of i

which may be enhanced depending on the circumstances for example committing an alien smuggling offense in furtheran ce of commercial activity or causing serious injury or death to person while

the most significant change is the overall restructuring of ina 274 the proposed legi slation would consolidate most of the proscribed acts into paragraphs a1a and a1b of ina 27447 the only proscription left untouched is the one proscr ibing the employment of smuggled aliens unauthorized to work in the united states48 an issue that the proposed legislation does not address involves cr ossreferencing currently ina 101a43n defines an aggravated felony as an offense desc ribed in paragraph 1a or 2 of ina 274 if this crossreference is left intact this would mean bringing an alien into the united states at place other than designated port of entry would longer be an aggravated felony the result is that some one convicted of such an offense would longer be inadmissible for committing an aggravated felony and automatically subject to removal from the united states49 changes in sentencing the restructuring also places most of the penalty provisions in ina 274a1c50 the only sentencing provi sions unaffected by the new legislation concern several sentencing enhancements and the penalties for employing aliens unauthorized to work in the united states51 the proposed legislation would alter the current ntencing schema in several ways unless stated otherwise viola tion of any act in ina 274 merits fine imprisonment for not more than five years or both if the

ina 274 that would affirmatively assert extraterritorial jurisdiction for acts of alien smuggling that occur outside the united states although many courts have suggested extraterritorial jurisdiction exists over some offenses52 this provision would clarify that the full reach of the statute extends to acts committed by alien smuggling networks on the high seas and in foreign countries53 furthermore if defenda nt violates ina 274 on the high seas defense based on necessity can be raised unless 1 the defendant informs the coast guard as soon as practicable of the necessity nd if rescue is cl aimed information about the vessel engaging in the rescue and 2 the defendant did not bring or attempt to bring any alien into the land territory of the united states without lawful authority unless exigent circumstances existed that placed the life of the alien in danger54 finally the legislation would alter th religious denomination exemption by explicitly making it an affirmative defense which would clarify that the burden of proof is on the defendant re ligious denomination to dem onstrate that its conduct fallshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34501crs11 55 id 56 18 usc 2237a1 57 18
