multibillion dollar program at the heart of the armys transformation efforts it is the armys major research development and acquisition program consisting of 14 manned and unmanned systems tied together by an extensive communications and information network fcs is intended to replace such current systems as the m1 abrams tank and the m2 bradley infantry fighting vehicle the fcs program has been characterized by the army and others as highrisk venture due to the advanced technologies involved and the challenge of networking all of the fcs subsystems together so that fcs equipped units can function as intended the fcs program exists in dynamic national security environment which could significantly influence the programs outcome the administration has committed the united states to the long war struggle that could last for decades as the united states and its allies attempt to locate and destroy terrorist networks worldwide some question if fcs envisioned and designed prior to september 11 2001 to combat conventional land forces is relevant in this long war where counterinsurgency and stabilization operations feature prominently the fcs program has achieved number of programmatic milestones and is transitioning from purely conceptual program to one where prototypes of many of the 14 fcs systems are under development with variety of estimates on the total cost of the fcs program questions have been raised about fcs affordability in 2007 citing the impact of past budget cuts the army restructured the program from 18 to 14 systems in june 2008 primarily in response to both congressional and department of defense dod concerns about deploying fcs technologies to forces in the field sooner and overall program affordability the army restructured the program again as currently restructured the army will instead focus its fcs equipping efforts on infantry brigade combat teams ibcts as opposed to heavier fcs bcts the overall fcs program is in variety of developmental phases with some technologies on the verge of being fielded to units and others still under development with varying degrees of success the 111 th congress in its appropriation authorization and oversight roles may wish to review the fcs program in terms of its projected capabilities relevance to current and possible future military operations and program costs this report

good as or better than the armys current force in terms of lethality survivability responsiveness and sustainability 1 the primary issues presented to 111th congress are the capabilities and affordability of the fcs program and the likelihood given myriad of factors that the army will be able to field its first fcs brigade combat team bct by 2015 and eventually field up to 15 fcs bcts key oversight questions for consideration include the following future of fcs bcts impact of the june 2008 restructuring funding fcs at the expense of current ground combat systems financial crisis

adopted the future combat system fcs as major acquisition program to equip the objective force4 this transformation due to its complexity and uncertainty was scheduled to take place over the course of three decades with the first fcsequipped objective force unit reportedly becoming operational in 2011 and the entire force transformed by 20325 in order to mitigate the risk associated with the objective force and to address the nearterm need for more deployable and capable units the armys transformation plan called for the development of brigadesized units called the interim force in both the active army and the army national guard these interim brigade combat teams ibcts were the predecessors to the armys current stryker brigade combat teams sbcts 6 general shinsekis vision for the fcs was that it would consist of smaller and lighter ground and air vehiclesmanned unmanned and roboticand would employ advanced offensive defensive and communicationsinformation systems to outsmart and outmaneuver heavier enemy forces on the battlefield7 in order to initiate the fcs program general shinseki turned to the defense advanced research projects agency darpa not only because of its proven ability to manage highly conceptual and scientifically challenging projects but also because he reportedly felt that he would receive great of opposition from senior army leaders who advocated heavier and more powerful vehicles such as the m1 abrams tank and the m2 bradley infantry fighting vehicle in may 2000 darpa awarded four contracts to four industry teams to develop fcs designs and in march 2002 the ar my chose boeing and science applications international corporation saic to serve as the lead systems integrators to oversee certain aspects of the development of the fcss 18 original systems on may 14 2003 the defense acquisition board 8 dab approved the fcss next acquisition phase and in august 2004 boeing and saic awarded contracts to 21 companies to design and build its various

government accountability office gao has monitored of the fcs program since its inception one of gaos continuing program schedule concerns is that fcs design and production maturity are not likely to be demonstrated until after the production decision is made the critical design review will be held much later on fcs than on other programs and the army will not be building productionrepresentative prototypes to test before production the first major test of the network and fcs together with majority of prototypes will not take place until 2012 much of the testing up to the 2013 production

to provide voice video and data communications to fcs manned and unmanned ground and aerial vehicles one of the primary benefits of jtrs is that it is intended to operate on multiple radio frequencies permitting it to talk to certain nonjtrs radios that are expected to stay in the armys inventory jtrs is joint program and therefore is not part of the fcs pr ogram but is instead what the army describes as complimentary program jtrs is to form the backbone of the fcs network and therefore of critical importance to the programs success some have criticized the jtrs family of radios as falling short of what the fcs requires in terms of capabilities range and encryption but note that without the highbandwidth all digital jtrs there is simply way to transmit the vast amount of data that the new fcs networks will require 21

number of jtrs radios that it may require and looking for possible areas where current or legacy radios may instead be substituted so that the army can cut back the procurement of more expensive jtrs radios22 army officials note that jtrs radios which have been under development for more than decade are more capable and will be relied upon heavily in the fcs bcts the army is also planning to field lessexpensive version of the jtrs handheld manpack system hms radio to troops by 201123 this lessexpensive version will use the same high bandwidth soldier radio waveform but will transmit only data and voice and not images or videos that are planned to be part of the jtrs hms while it may be argued by some that in both these instances that the army is doing the prudent thing by attempting to reduce costs and get improved technologies to soldiers sooner others might question if the army really needs all the jtrs variants it plans to procure if it is settling for substitutes and less capable versions g18g152g157g142g151g157g146g138g149g561g20g138g141g146g152g561g21g153g142g140g157g155g158g150g561g18g155g152g139g149g142g150g156g344g346g561 one report suggests that the armys former assistant secretary of the army for acquisitions logistics and technology claude bolton was conc erned that within the next five years the army may not have enough radio spectrum to allow its nextgeneration networked force fcs to work as it is being designed to the concern is that beginning in 2010 when the army introduces jtrs and additional technologies designed to transmit vast amount of data from soldiers sensors and unmanned and manned ground and aerial vehicles the available bandwidth will become overwhelmed to get better appreciation for the potential problem both the army

in the armys july 2008 draft fy2010 program objective memorandum the army proposed to reduce funding for the m1 abrams tank the m2 bradley fighting vehicle and the stryker fighting vehicle primarily to shift funds to fcs the army proposal was said to add 62 billion from fy20102015 by decreasing funding to numbe r of army programs most noticeably by decreasing m1 abrams upgrades and procurement from fy2010 to 2013 by 940 million decreasing m2 bradley upgrades and procurement from fy2010 to 2013 by 293 million and cutting 13 billion from stryker upgrades and procurements from fy2010 to 2013 36 the army contends that this measure is needed because congress has cut roughly 1 billion from proposed fcs budgets from 2004 and that the money will be used to help buy fcs spin out technologies such as robots ua vs and ground sensors 37 some members have expressed their concern to the secretary of defense that reducing the levels of funding for abrams bradleys and strykers before the army even begins to test realistic fcs prototypes could place our future forces at risk if achieving the fcs programs aggressive schedule is delayed or if fcs manned ground vehicles cost more than is now forecasted38 members also note that it is possible that the aforementioned vehicles will be part of the armys inventory beyond 2050 and that they must continue to be upgraded to remain fully capable there is also concern that the armys proposed funding cuts would result in the termination of 2008 multiyear contract for upgrading m1 abrams tanks situation that could signal the defense industry that longterm agreements with dod are not to be trusted which could increase equipment costs in the future g8g5g21g561g5g152g156g157g561g7g156g157g146g150g138g157g142g156g561 in march 2006 gao

congressional budget office cbo study postulated that given historic cost growth in similar programs that annual fcs costs could reach 16 billion annually exceeding the armys estimates of 10 billion

than what the army has estimated conclusion that the army has rejected44 some maintain that this wide disparity in fcs cost estimates eight years into the program has resulted in lack of confidence that the fcs program can be conducted in costefficient manner on april 7 2008 dod provided congress with revi sed cost estimates on number of defense acquisition programs dod revised the total fcs

instances actually being deployed into combat46 there are concerns that complementary programsviewed as essential for fcs to achieve its full potentialare not achieving the same level of success the jtrs program which has been criticized as falling short of what fcs requiresraises some concerns the armys decision to acquire less capable jtrs radios for dismounted soldier use and the possibility that the army may substitute number of less capable legacy radios for other variations of jtrs radios suggests that overall program requirements are illdefined and in state of flux such potential hodgepodge of radios linking fcs systems will likely only exacerbate noted radio spectrum problems there is also concern that wint increments three and four are still not as well defined as they should be in the case of increment four the final incremen t intended to tie fcs to the tsa t system the uncertain future of the tsa t program likely has highly detrimental impact on program planning and budgeting requirements mandated in sections 211 and 212 of the fy2009 ndaa pl 110417 should provide congress with some preliminary insights on how jtrs radio spectrum difficulties win t development and potential lack of tsa t system could affect fcs survivability and effectiveness the value of these insights are predicated on the level of detail that the army and dod incorporates into these congressional requirements and reports in particular section 211s requirements to include number of these factors into the fcs system design review could prove useful in assessing the future viability of the fcs program 46 matthew cox guard stryker brigade to deploy with fcs uavs army times november 25 2008

smaller budget cuts were imposed across all programs if this does become the case fcs has been mentioned along with missile defense as candidate for cancellation some senior officers note that if we
