federal and state judicial proceedings every competent person may be compelled to testify testimonial privileges are exceptions to this rule they are generally granted to allow concealment of communications made in confidence between persons holding certain relationships that have been deemed worthy of protection testimonial privileges are generally granted by common law or by statute these include the lawyerclient and the doctorpatient privileges there is also one testimonial privilege expressly granted in the united states constitution the fifth amendments guarantee that person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be witness against himself absent statutory or constitutional recognition of journalists privilege reporter may be compelled to testify in legal administrative or other governmental proceedings thirtythree states and the district of columbia have recognized journalists privilege through enactment of press shield laws which protect the relationship between reporters their source and sometimes the information that may be communicated in that relationship 1 another 16 states have recognized journalists privilege through court decisions wyoming is the only state that has legislatively or judicially adopted journalists privilege the journalists privilege is distinct from other recognized privileges in that it vests only with the journalist not with the source of the information in branzburg v hayes 408 us 665 1972 the supreme court ruled for the first and only time on claim of journalists privilege it held that journalists have constitutional privilege to refuse to testify before grand jury unless the grand jury investigation was instituted or conducted other than in good faith id at 707 the court reasoned that the publics interest in prosecuting crime outweighed its interest in journalists being permitted to preserve their confidential relationships in branzburg the supreme court noted that there was merit in leaving state legislatures free within first amendment limits to fashion their own standards regarding journalists privilege id at 706 in addition the court noted that it goes without saying of course that we are powerless to bar state courts from responding in their own way and construing their own constitutions so as to recognize newsmans privilege either qualified or absolute id it is with that understanding that since branzburg 49 states and the district of columbia have either enacted legislation or issued court rulings protecting the press to varying degrees from unfettered disclosure of sources work product and information generally the various state statutes range in scope from broad protections that provide an absolute journalistic privilege to shield laws that offer qualified privilege the majority of state shield laws offer some form of qualified privilege to reporters protecting source information in judicial settings unless the compelling party can establish that the information is i relevant or material ii unavailable by other means or through other sources and iii that compelling need exists for that information states may vary this last prong with some requiring the compelling party to establish whether the need exists as to the partys case and others whether the need serves broader public policy 1 the most recent of these statute is that of the state of washington which was signed by the governor on april 27 2007 and takes effect july 22 2007

identity number of states also protect reporters notes outtakes or work product small minority of states further protect reporters personal observations in addition to addressing what is covered states differ as to who is covered and under what situations they are covered for instance many states require that newsperson must be professionally engaged in the dissemination of information to the public while other states use broader definitions of what constitutes pre ss person and may include individuals who are freelancers authors electronic publishers or educators some states further require that in order to qualify as member of the news media evid ence or records must be kept documenting actual publication or broadcast especially when radio or television media are concerned finally federal rule of evidence 501 provides that in civil cases that arise under state law but are brought in federal court privileges shall be determined in accordance with state law it also provides that in federal courts the privilege of witness shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the united states in the light of reason and experience the federal courts have not resolved whether the common law provides journalists privilege the remainder of this report sets forth the full text of the state shield statutes
