power gave the fda jurisdiction over previously unregulated cosmetics and devices and instituted safety measures such as requiring instruction labels on drugs and premarket approval process for new drugs2 since 1938 the law has been amended numerous times3 the fdca is organized into chapters that address drugs devices food and cosmetics as well as statutory definiti ons actions prohibited by the fdca the fdas general authorities imports and exports and other miscellaneous issues in order to understand how the fda attempted to regulate tobacco one must first understand the definitions of drug and device under the fdca drugs fall into three categories or an inclusive fourth category comprised of articles intended to become component of any of the othe r three categories these three categories are 1 articles recognized in the official united states pharmacopoeia or similar standardsetting body for prescripti ons and overthecounter medications 2 articles intended for use in the diagnosis cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease in man or other an imals and 3 articles other than foodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33719crs2 4 21 usc 321g1 5 oreilly 133 sunscreen is one

williamson tobacco corp see crs continuedintended to affect the structure or any f unction of the body of man or other animals4 when determining whether an article is drug under the second or third categories the agency takes the intent of the vendor into account however even if vendor does not intend to sell an item as drug the fda can still govern it as drug5 the term drug does not include food or dietary supplements6 the fdca defines device as an instrument apparatus implement ma chine contrivance implant in vitro reagent or other similar or related article including any component part or accessory which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes7 in addition in order to be device unde r the fdca an item must fall within one of three categories that are nearly identical to those the fdca uses to define drug see above in classifying an item as device the fda takes into account the manufacturers intent as to whether it is device this intent may be indicated in the products labeling and by how the ma nufacturer promotes distributes and sells the product8 combinations of drugs and devices are also regulated by the fda drug device combination product is defined to include among other things product that contains drug and device that are physically chemically or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as single entity9 examples of this type of drugdevice combination product include insulin injector pens metered dose inhalers transdermal patches and catheters with antimicrobial coating10 under the theory that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are combination of drug device or

the agency asserted that in order to provide the most ffective protection to the public health it had discretion in choosing whether to regulate combination products as drugs or devices and it chose to regulate cigarettes and smokeless tobacco as devices id at 44400would have given the agency jurisdicti on over these tobacco products as drugs devices or both drugs and devices13 the agencys rule concentrated on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco because the fda did not have sufficient evidence that cigars are drug delivery devices nd because young people predominantly use cigarettes and smokele ss tobacco products14 the fda found that nicotine was drug under the above statutory definition pr oviding that drug is an article that affects the structure or any function of the body15 this was because nicotine causes addiction and other significant pharmacological effects on the human body16 the fda further concluded that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco have device components that deliver nicotine to the body and are intended by tobacco manufacturers to do so17 in the case of cigarettes the fda said that the device that delivers the drug nicotine has components that work together upon combustion outside the body to form nicotinecontai ning aerosol which then delivers nicotine to the body when inhaled by the smoker18 with smokeless tobacco the device is component that provides nicotine to the c onsumer in form that is palatable and absorbable by the buccal mucosa which is the lining inside the cheeks and lips19 implementation of the final rule woul d have enabled the fda to regulate cigarettes and smokeless tobacco including their access by minors labeling and advertising under the device portion of the fdca20 in order to reach tobacco advertising and youth access to these tob acco products the fda rule relied on the agencys alreadyestablished authority to re strict the sale use and distribution of potentially harmful device or device that requires collateral measures necessary for its use if the secretary determines that there cannot otherwise be reasonablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33719crs4 21 21 usc 360je fdca 502e 22 61 fed reg 4461518 23 fda v brown

rule the fda could have issued rules on recordkeeping and manufacturing as well as reporting requirements in the event of contamination or serious adverse events th at are not wellknown in the scientific community22 with the 1996 rule in place the fdca so would have allowed the fda to place cigarettes in one of three classes of devices ranging from devices that present minimal harm to users to devices requiring fda approval because of the risk for illness and the need for regulatory control however before the fda could implement its final rule or issue any further regulations the tobacco industry challenged the final rule the industry argued that the fdca did not permit the fda to regulate tobacco that the fda could not regulate tobacco products because such items did not claim to provide health benefits and that the fdas advertisin g restrictions violated commercial speech protections guaranteed by the first amendment in fda v brown williamson tobacco corp the us supreme court held that the fda did not have the statutory authority under the fdca to regulate tob acco products as drugdelivery devices and therefore did not reach the first amendment issue23 the court used the test it had articulated in chevron usa inc v natural resources defense council 24 which addresses congressi onal intent and agency discretion when court reviews an agencys construction of the statute which it administers it is confronted with two questions first always is the question whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue if the intent of congress is clear that is the end of the matter for the court as well as the agency must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress if however the court determines congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue the court does not si mply impose its own construction on the statute rather if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue the question for the court is whether the agencys answer is based on permissible construc tion of the statute25 the court found that congress had spoke n on the issue of the fdas authority to regulate tobacco products under the fd ca by passing laws not administered by the fda that dealt with marketing labeling and education regarding tobacco products specifically the court held that the fdas interpretation of the fdca in its 1996 final rule was contrary to cong resss intent expressed in the fdcas overall regulatory scheme and in tobaccospecific legislation that congress has enacted26 according to the court if the fda had regulatory authority over tobaccohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33719crs5 27 id at 13537 28 for detailed explanations of the proposed 1997 national tobacco settlement and the 1998 master

rico began filing lawsuits against tobacco companies for reimbursement of tobaccorelated medical expenses particularly medicaid expenditures these lawsuits eventually culminated in the 1998 master settlement agreem ent msa but initially they resulted in june 1997 settlement between states attorneys gene ral and tobacco manufacturers the 1997 settlement incorporated all the provisions of the fdas 1996 tobacco rule discussed above the 1997 proposal included changes to the fdca and other federal statutes and required congressional gislative action in order to take effect the 1997 agreement however never took effect becau congress did not approve legislation implementing the settlement attempts by the 105th cong ress to pass such legislation comprised of the settlement and additional measures such as financial penalties if targets for re ducing underage tobacco use were not met ended when senator john mccains bill was defeated on two procedural votes on june 17 1998 after an extended floor debate29 the negotiated agreemen t would have resulted in tobaccorelated medical reim bursement payments to states of 3685 billion for 25 years and then 15 billion per year after the first 25 years additionally tobacco companies would have paid for programs to reduce adolescent tobacco use this settlement would also have granted immunity to tobacco manufacturers from future lawsuits and ended existing class action lawsuits filed by smokers and their relatives as well as nicotine addiction claims after the defeat of senator mccains bill the major cigarette companies resumed contractual negotiations with the states to settle the lawsuits in november 1998 attorneys general from 46 states the district of columbia and five us territories signed the msa with the major tobacco companies four states mississippi florida texas and minnesota did not join the msa but instead settled individually with the tobacco compan ies the msa did not settle individual union private

tobacco company causes an illness or injury to someone and state provides medical care for that illness or injury as for example out of medicaid funds then the state may sue the third party for reim bursement of such funds because the federal government pays for at least 50 of each states medicaid costs by law the federal government is entitle d to its share of any reim bursements of medicaid

more specified crimes within ten years section 1962d outlaws c onspiracies to violate 1962c or related provisions regarding racketeering activities the government alleged that pattern of racketeering activity existed because the defendants defrauded individual smokers of their property ie th money they spent on cigarettes39 during the trial the defendants appealed the us district court for the district of columbias opinion allowing the remedy of disgorgement the giving up of the tobacco industrys past profits gained by its deceptive practices to the us court of appeals for the dc circuit in 2005 the court of appeals overturned the district courts opinion thus limiting the remedial m easures that the district court could impose if it found that the defendants had violated rico40 because the court of appeals allowed only forwardlooking inj unctive relief the doj could not recover the 280 billion disgorgement that had been sought for tobacco profits earned since 1971 for marketing to youth41 the court of appeals stat ed that injunctive relief under rico42 must focus on preventing future wrongdoing rather than on punishing past conduct noting that congress explicitly craf ted set of remedial measures in the rico statute and likely did not intend to pr ovide other remedies the court of appeals was reluctant to infer an additi onal remedy such as disgorgement43 in august 2006

states attorneys general signed nd trial courts ratifie d the msa several states and cities created add itional restrictions on tobacco advertising for example baltimore passed ordinances prohibiting tobacco and alcohol advertisements on billboards except for commercial and industr ial zones of the city the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit upheld baltimores ordinances in two cases98 finding that they do not violate the first amendment99 in 1999 the massachusetts attorney general promulga ted advertising restrictions on cigarettes smokeless tobacco little cigars and cigars that he intended to fill the gaps left by the msa the regulations prohibited all sizes of outdoor tob acco advertisements within 1000 feet of playgrounds schools and parks including advertisements located within store that were visible from the outside of that store the rules also imposed similar 1000foot stat ban on pointofsale retail displays if the displays were less than five feet tall and located in stores accessible to youth100 additionally the attorney general restricted tobacco promotions samples and ci gar labels banned selfser vice displays and required customers to have contact with sales person before handling or purchasing tobacco products101 in 2001 however the us supreme court held in lorillard tobacco co v reilly that the fclaa preempted mass achusetts outdoor advertising and pointofsale restrictions for cigarettes because the fclaa preempts state regulations of cigarette advertising and promotion102 therefore the court struck down that portion of the regulations th court noted however that the fclaa preemption provisions do not apply to smokele ss tobacco or cigars or restrictions on cigarette sales103 therefore the court had to reach th issue of whether

found that the restrictions on outdoor advertising of cigars and smokeless tobacco were overbroad in that they prohibited advertising in substantial portion of the major metropolitan areas of massachusetts included oral communica tions and imposed burdens on retailers with limited advertising budgets105 the court also upheld challenges by smokeless tobacco and cigar companies to the outdoor advertising restrictions on the grounds that adults have right to information and the tobacco i ndustry has right to communicate truthful speech on legal products106 the justices then struck down the similar 1000foot state ban on pointofsale retail displays for cigars and smokeless tobacco under five feet tall in stores acces sible to youth they noted that the prohibition did not advance the goal of preventing minors from using tobacco products because some childre n are taller than five feet and others can look up at their surroundings107 according to one source at least 20 state and local laws have been repealed as result of lorillard 108 finally as to the question of massachus ettss regulation of cigarette smokeless tobacco and cigar sales the cigarette petitioners did not argue that the fclaa preempted massachusetts law109 as result the court evaluated arguments from cigarette smokeless tobacco and cigar petitioners that certain sales restrictions violated the first amendment the cour t upheld restrictions banning selfservice displays and requiring customers to have contact with sales person before handling or purchasing tobacco products110 according to the justices the state had substantial interest in preventing minor s from accessing tobacco products and the regulation was narrowly tailored so as not to significantly affect adult access to tobacco
