practices by suppliers licensi ng of equipment purchasers registration of equipment and application of civil penalties to suppliers for inappropriate enduse of equipment this re port will not be updated introduction question in the current deba over chemical and biolog ical terrorism is how well do current united states policies limit opportun ities to terrorist groups for acquisition of such weapons the domestic purchase and use of dualuse bi ological equipment1 such as fermenters centrifuges and other equi pment is one area suggested as potentially providing opportunities for terrorist biolog ical weapons development dualuse equipment has both legitimate civilian and military use regulating international sale of dualuse equipment is used as nonproliferati on policy tool similar regulation of domestic sales has not been employed this report will discuss the difficulties of applying domestic controls on dualuse biological quipment and the potential advantages and disadvantages

nationstatelevel weapons pr ogram was prerequisite fo r the production of high quality biological weapons modern advances in dualuse biological equipment may have significantly lowered technolog ical barriers previously thoug ht to impede individuals or small groups wishing to obtain biological weapons2 advanced dualuse biological equipment may allow biological weapons ma nufacture in smaller facilities which may be more difficult to detect3 many experts had thought th at the requirements of technical skills and education specialized equipmen t and pathogen source would provide significant barriers to terrorist groups4 although experts are di vided some believe that an individual or small autonomous terrori st group may have been able to manufacture and disseminate the anthrax spor used in the 2001 attacks5 they suggest anthrax spores might have been developed through the use of dualuse biological equipment by creating private laboratory to gr ow biological weapons6 the usa patriot

production scales using fermen ters as an example large temperature and atmos phere controlled fermenters ar used in industrial settings home brewers use fermenters of varying size and complexity from stainless steel temperature controlled brew pots to 5gall on closed plastic buckets diagnostic and research facilities use plastic petri dishes to culture and grow bacteria dualuse biological equipment may be used for different purposes in each field fermenters again as an example may be used in developing biological pesticides the bacterium used as bt pesticide bacillus thuringiensis is commonly grown through fermentation process producti on of medicines insulin is commercially extracted from genetically modified microbes vaccine devel opment anthrax vaccine is generated using fermenters and industrial enzymatic pro cesses such as those generating ethanol from biomass biodefense research uses dual use biological equipment to develop new detectors vaccines and treatments against pathogens what control mechanisms currently are in place while export controls do not apply to pur chase of dualuse biological equipment when the equipment is bought domestically from domestic supplier they may be considered as framework for domestic regulation of such equipment treaties and multinational agreements are used to control dualuse biological equipment at the international level the goal of multinational programs is to inhibit proliferation by increasing the technical barrier to weapon production examples of such multilateral controls include the wassenaar rrangement and the australia group7 d u l u s biological technologies are included within us export regulations which block export of some equipment without license thes export control progra ms have thresholds below which such controls do not apply quipment with capacity below these thresholds may be sufficient to develop limited biologi cal weapons capability and would not trigger such regulations export controls incl ude export administration regulations and international traffic in arms regulations8 other mechanisms including voluntary gove rnmental programs increased contacts between suppliers and purchaser s and industrial be st practices are used to monitor the use of domestic dualuse biolog ical equipment the depa rtment of homeland security has continued progra m named project shield

misuse of dualuse equipment thes practices include higher physical security of laboratory and production facilities10 congressional action 107th congress legislation was passed in the 107th congress controlling domestic sale or use of dualuse biological equipment however on november 6 2001 the senate committee on the judiciary subcommittee on equipment terrorism and government information held hearing addressing bioterrorism during this hearing the prospect of employing licensing or regula tion of dualuse biological equipment was considered dr ronald atlas president of the american society for microbiology expressed his opinion that licensing and regu lation would not be successful mechanism for controlling domestic developm ent of biological weapons as worrisome as it may be small flasks canisters home brewing bottles and other similarly mundane equipment provide all that is needed to grow th bacteria that cause anthrax plague and other select agents to cover the size relevant for bioterrorism one would have to capture everything of 5 liters and above and that would still not eliminate the possibility of growing the organisms in simpler vessels11 108th congress export

controls currently employed to limit proliferation of dualuse biol ogical equipment were devel oped with the perceived threat being from nations rather than terrorist groups some have claime d that export control mechanisms are not wellsuited to blocking terrorist acquisition of biological weapons since nations generally are interested in producing bulk amounts of weapons purchases generally are on large scale and failure to interdict single purchase may not be greatly detrimental to nonproliferati on program in the case of lone terrorist purchase of equipment with small limited capacity ma allow biological weapon development sufficient for use in terrorist acts for example the sale of fermenters with more than 100liter capacity is contro lled under export regulation13 consequently 10 or 50liter fermenter which has been suggested as sufficing for limited development of biological weapons14 could be purchased without triggering licensing requirements it has been reported though not conf irmed by the government that research project called project bacus funded by the defense threat re duction agency demonstrated the feasibility of assembling the equipment needed to estab lish biological weapons laboratory through purchase of dualuse bi ological equipment15 some contend that export controls econo mically injure domestic manufacturers of such equipment and that the united states is not sole supplier of many exportcontrolled technologies they suggest that export cont rol does not significantly increase barriers to proliferation of widely manufactured technologies and th at controls should be lowered on these items advocates of maintaining strict export control regulations maintain that the barriers created by export control are va luable and should be continued or expanded see crs report rl31832 the export administration act evolution provisions and debate by ian f fergusson for discussion of these positions current domestic oversight of dualuse biol ogical equipment through project shield america has also been questioned three cerns have been raised the degree to which industry members may ta ke on the job of federal officer s the mechanism of identifying manufacturers and technologies and the manner by which ma nufacturers are to determine suspicious behavior16 also while best manufacturin g practices may limit access to dual use equipment in industrial settings such efforts do not address purchase and illicit use of dualuse equipment outside of those settings licensing or registering domestic sales another option might be to license companies and individuals for purchase of dua luse biological equipment or registering the sale of such equipment this approach might mirror that now used for purchase of pathogens mechanisms involved

purchase is registered nd could be implemented also mechanism for the retirement and remova l of equipment longer in service may be required if registry format is used for dualuse biological equipment some difficulties inherent in such plan have been identified significant concern is the scale on which such licensing and regi stration would be effec tive registration of the purchase of common items such as dispos able plastic petri dishes might impose an unacceptable burden with respect to tracking paperwork and verifi cation alternately registration program that was too limited might prove to provide barrier to acquisition another concern lie s in determining what criteri would be used to develop licensing protocol as wide range of individuals ranging from home brewers to research scientists utilize this equipment final concern surrounds the effectiveness of such program in prohibiting s econdary sales transfer or use by unlicenced individuals others have advocated as solutions to sec ondary transfers installing electronic tracking devices or indelible registrati on methods as alternatives or additions to formal registry tracking17 encouraging information tracking of dualuse equipment as method to police the application of dualuse equi pment some have advocated increasing collection and coordination of information on dualuse equipm ent integration of vendor and other information might increase the ability of the us government to detect small scale domestic clandestine weapons progra ms others are concerned that such program might raise civil liberty issues18 another approach that has been suggested is to request that entities selling such dual use equipment show greater diligence in termining the end use for their products federal agencies selling surplus equipment might be required to verify or validate the end receiver or use of dualuse equipment companies that sell dualuse equipment might be advised to scrutinize sales to ensure that their products ar not diverted to production of weapons some have suggested the development of civil lia bility for companies who fail to perform due diligence before selling equipment that is later misused19 critics of this proposal doubt the practicability and political viab ility of such pos ition both in terms of industry incentive20 and in the ability of vendors to control equipment enduse21
