vote of 4005 senate appropriations committee reported by vote of 290 the report srept 108280 to the fy2005 dhs appropriations bill s 2537 introduction increasing border and transportation security are essential strategies for improving and maintaining homeland security border security entails regulating the flow of goods and people across the nation s borders so that dangerous and unwanted goods or people are detected and denied entry transportation security entails inspecting people and goods as they move among different locations within the country to reduce the possibility of terrorist attacks or the incursion of unwanted people or goods determining which goods and people are permitted and which are denied entry into the us involves system of sophi sticated border management this system must balance the need for securing the nations borders while facilitating the essential commerce and legitimate free flow of citizens and authorized visitors the system must be capable of examining minute deta ils of goods and people seeking entry but still fit within budgetary constraints and be administratively feasible improving transportation security s meant an expanded federal role in screening passengers and bagga ge traveling through airports and also increasing the presence of federal officers aboard domestic and international flights plans exist to extend the presence of federal officers to other modes of transportation more intensively in the future finally these management systems must accomplish their functions with minimum of disrupti on of legitimate ac tivities and wit hout unnecessary intrusion into the civil lib erties of persons affected by themhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32566crs3 background the homeland security act of 2002 pl 107296 transferred the functions relevant funding and most of the personnel of 22 agencies and offices to the newly created department of homeland security dhs dhs was organized in four major directorates border and transportation security emergency preparedness and response science and technology and in formation analysis and infrastructure protection the border and transportation security directorate bts along with its close functional sibling the us coast guard ar responsible for the first line of defense against terrorism and for securing and ma naging the nations borders included in these responsibilities are the inspection inve stigative and enforcement operations of the former immigration and naturalization service ins which had been responsible for managing nd coordinating entry into the united states and for enforcing immigration laws dhs border and transportation security objectives also include fulfilling the newly expanded federal role of the tsa in protecting the nations transportation system s initially involving airlin passengers baggage and freight the customs function previously the re sponsibility of the department of the treasurys us customs service now so forms part of bts the customs functions administered by dhs in conjunction with the us coast guard are expected to effectively secure all commercial traffic entering the nations ports the directorate also assumes responsibility fo r inspecting and monitoring plants and animals entering the united states to minimize the risk that noxious pests and diseases will be introduced into the country the activities for which bts has assumed responsibility are organized into three bureaus the bureau of customs and border protection cbp the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement ice and the transportation security agency tsa the inspection and border pa trol functions of legacy customs ins and animal and plant health inspection service aphis were merged into cbp the investigative and interior enforcemen t functions of legacy customs and ins were merged within ice the federal protective service fps the federal law enforcement training center fletc and the office of domestic preparedness odp were also included under bts by the homeland security ac t subsequently the federal air marshals have been transferred from tsa to ice the usvisit program has been transferred from ice to be managed at the bts directorate level and odp has been reconfigured and renamed the office of state and local government coordination nd preparedness oslgcp nd is managed at the dhs level the coast guard remains direct report or free standing agency within dhs but outside the bts directoratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32566crs4 appropriations for border and transportation security march 1 2003 was the effective date fo r shifting most of the responsibilities from former departments and agencies to the new dhs while the transfer of functional lines of authority and the pe rsonnel to carry out those functions was relatively straightforward problems arose with initial attempts to ascertain the exact amount of appropriated funds actually transferred co mparisons of responsibilities and analyses of requests for increased budg et authority proved difficult to develop this was due to the fact that functions now performed by dhs were previously performed by predecessor agencies which often had somewhat different purposes than homeland security the funding lines between fy2003 and fy2004 were not identical to lines of func tional responsibility before nd after transfer problem made more difficult because the basic documentation of appropriations in the presidents fy2004 budget was prepared afte r the formation of dhs but before final enactment of appropriations for the remainder of fy2003 however with the completion of appropriations for fy2004 baseline has been established making future appropriations decisions more easily compared to the previous years levels the distinction between border and trans portation security f unctions and other functions funded through the sa account lines is somewhat arbitrary in this sense our analysis uses something akin to functional classifica tion for border and transportation security consequently it does not include activities in the directorate for border and transportation security that have direct bearing on that function such as the federal protective service on th other hand this functional grouping does include the activ ities of the coast guard separate agency in dhs which is not part of the di rectorate for border and tran sportation security but which has an essential role in pr oviding border and transporta tion security as those words are commonly understood some functions contained in other accounts that are related to border and transpor tation security such as those aspects of the science and technology account which are used to improve security are excluded from this table tables in this report show an approxima tion of costs for border and transportation security based on identifying the accounts fo r which such security functions are the primary function involved and do not n ecessarily reflect dhs breakdowns as to estimated amounts specifically associated with the dir ectorate for border and transportation security for fy2005 the administration pres ented its request for dhs in an organization roughly akin to the conference committee in presenting the appropriated amounts for fy2004 the c onference report to hr 2555 hrept 108280 presented appropr iations in four titles the second of which security enforcement and investigations contains most of the functions identified in this report as related to border and transportation security the administrations fy2005 request follows this structure and has grouped the requests for the undersecretary for border and transportation usvisit cbp ice the tsa the us coast guard and the us secret service in title ii security enforcement and investigations for the purposes of this report we exclude appropriations for the us secret service but include appropriations for fletc which is located in title

are not added to the total there is discrepancy between the house and senate reports regarding the amount of offsetting fee collections for cbp for fy2004 enacted and fy2005 request the way the offsetting fees are applied for cbp the difference in fee collections changes the total amount available for obligation by cbp but does not change the total amount directly appropriated by congress for cbp therefore for the purposes of this paper we use the amounts listed in the house report tables for cbp offsetting fee collections for fy2004 enacted and the fy2005 request b this amount includes 63 million rescission of fy2004 funds previously appropriated by pl 10811 c there is 400 million difference in tsa offsetti ng fee collections reported by the administration and the house and senate the administration included in its request proposal to increase the aviation security fee both the house and senate denied this request and thus reflect 400 million less than the request in offsetting fee collections for tsahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32566crs8 operational components of border and transportation security while most observers indicate the need for additional funding in the area of border and transportation security the issue for congress is to determine the appropriate funding vel in the context of the curren t budget situation and competing claims for resources the following sec tions of the report pr ovide detail concerning the operational components of border and transportation security these include selected appropriations data issues of potential interest to the conferees and discussion of some of the challenges faci ng the different components of border and transportation security securing the nations borders and trans portation systems includes the regulation of imports and exports enforcement of laws pertaining to immigration and visitation borderrelated inspection of ag riculture and livestock oversight of the security of ports federal inspection of airline pa ssengers and baggage and comprehensive approaches to improving overall transpor tation security some observers might question the exclusion of the bureau of citizenship and immigration services bcis from the discussion of border and transporta tion security there is question that homeland security is enhanced by the well managed administration of routine immigration services however such services would remain even in absence of any threats to the homeland i mmigration activ ities would continue in any event and including the cost of these activities would distort the true summary costs of border and transportation security table 3 provides acc ount leve l details for the various component border and transportation agencies as identified in this

database that holds over 40 million records including wanted persons stolen vehicles deported fe lons gang members and terrorists5 integration of the two systems is widely regarded as vital component of tightening border security as it would allow cbp inspectors and usbp agents to access the fbis criminal database in order to establish whether apprehended aliens have outstanding warrants or criminal histories however integration has proved difficult for various technical and organizational reasons the house committee notes that dhs had testified that the integrated systems woul d be

that have privatized their baggage and passenger screeners both reports note that there is way for tsa or congress to know how many airports will opt out of the federal screener program beginning november 18 2004 the senate committee noted that if additional airports are awarded the ability to utilize private screeners tsa is expected to adhere to the reprogramming requirements stipulated in section 502 of appropriations act s 2537 the house co mmittee declared that it has provided tsa with the flexibility to cover passenger screening activities for federal screeners as well as for any private contracts awar ded under the opt out provision the house committee cautions that it expects tsa to live within the funding provided for personnel compensation and benefits how ever noting that screening costs for airports opting out should not exceed the costs of retaining federal screeners httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32566crs28 23 chris strohm dhs scraps computer prescreening syst em starts

may be some cost savings associated with privatization of screening staffing levels the house committee continues bill language limiting the number of screeners to more than 45000 fte employees at the end of 2005 because it believes that this provision is reasonable and has forced tsa to be more disciplined in spending taxpayer dollars the house committee notes that when tsa was first formed it overhired and mismanaged millions of dollars as it labored to federalize airport baggage screeners resulting in staffing levels especially at small and medium sized airports that became outrageously high while the committee notes that tsa has made progress towards streamlining and reshaping its workforce so that hightraffic airports receive more screening personnel it also believes that much more could be done regarding the development and installation of eds that reduce the number of ftes needed until these advancements are in place the committee believes it would be too easy for tsa to revert back to hiring screeners above the 45000 cap for this reason it is continuing the limitation the conferees include bill language capping the tsa fte screener workforce level at 45000 by the end of fy2005 the conferees also note that tsa may need to realign its workforce between airports th roughout the year to maintain security and customer service computer assisted passenger prescreening system capps ii and secure flight currently air carriers are re sponsible for implementing the capps system at airports tsa had been developing more advanced passenger prescreening system called cappsii how ever due to mounting privacy concerns and operational problems tsa recently announced it is scrapping its plans to implement cappsii this fall23 instead tsa administrator david m stone recently testified that capps ii is being reshaped and re packaged to address the privacy issues24 tsa recently announced the re placement program entitled secure flight which will differ from capps ii becau it focuses on identifying terrorists rather than on serving other law enforcement purposes25 one of the 911 commission report recommendations suggests that tsa take over administration of the existing capps system from the airlines until whatever program replaces it becomes operational this would probably add to tsa screener workload and thus result in an increased need for funds w ithin tsa possible issues for congress include whether current appr opriations levels are adequate for the reshaping of cappsii into the recently announced secure flight program and whether more funds should be appropriated for tsa if in fact the agency takes over the implementation of the existing capps system from air carriershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32566crs29 the conferees agree to provide 35 million for secure flight and note that an additional 10 million is provided under parate tsa account for crew vetting the conferees note their concern that 90 days may not be sufficient to plan test and analyze the system before its full imp lementation therefore the conferees encourage the tsa to focus first on getting watchlists operational and expect tsa to cooperate with gao in its review of secu re flight the conferees further note that dhs is proposing to check all watchlists though the new secure flight system as recommended by the 911 commission checkpoint support the senate committee recommends 75 million increase over the presidents request for th reconfiguration pur chase installation and maintenance of airport checkpoint equipment and th electronic surveillance of checkpoints the co mmittee notes that it is aware of tsa efforts to screen passengers baggage but that current deficiencies in the ability to detect explosives on passengers and their checked bags tinue to

increase of 35 million for chec kpoint security and adopted the senate reporting requirements crew vetting the house committee recommended 10 million for the vetting of foreign air carrier crews that the tsa has been undertaking since december 2003 the committee is deeply troubled that in fy2004 tsa spent 20 million of funding provided for cappsii for this activity without notifying congress the house committee notes that it believes th is activity is still necessary and states that it expects tsa to make clear distinction between cappsii and any other vetting activities it undertakes the conf erees provide 10 million for crew vetting explosive detection systems and explosive trace detection the house and senate committees both recomme nded additional funding for purchase of eds and etd machines the senate committee noted that its 60 million increase over the presidents request w ould have allowed tsa to procure next generation inline eds baggage screening machines the house also directed that the 20 million it would have provided over the presidents request be used to purchase the next generation eds machines which it noted are far smaller and less expensive than the current generation of screening units the conferees provide 30 million over the request for eds purchases the house committee also continues to encourage competition among vendors so that wide array of eds technologies can be made available to tsa the c onferees also adopt this language both the house and senate committees s upport tsa efforts to design the next generation of eds machines the house committee notes it expects 10 million of the 50 million it recommends to be spent initiating manhattan project ii program which will attempt to achieve quantum leap in next generation eds technology as opposed to the incrementa l approach currently being taken the conferees provide 54 million for next generation eds machines and like the house allocate 10 million for manhattan project ii program

recommended 13 million over the budget request while the house committee recommended 104 million above the budget re quest both the house and senate noted that 10 million of their respective dditional funding is provided for tsa to hire 100 additional air cargo inspectors the senate committee recommended that the remaining 3 million in additional fundi ng to expand the number of explosives detection canine teams while the house committees additional 400000 would have been spent on continuing tsas par ticipation in the ctpat program the senate committee also reco mmended some additional funding for developing technologies to secure air cargo within the research and development account the conferees provide total of 115 million for air cargo of which 40 million is for 100 additional inspectors and enforcem ent activities and 75 million for research and development of technolog ies to more effectively detect air cargo threats the senate committee also recommended continued funding for maintaining the known shipper databa which centralizes data provided by known shippers and indirect air carriers in order to immediately verify the status of specific shipper and encourages tsa to continue coordi nating this program with cbps ctpat program to develop the ability to better target domestic air cargo for inspection the house committee notes that it is encouraged by tsas work to develop etd system protocols to inspect air cargo on passenger and cargo aircraft and directs tsa to issue the protocols as soon as possible the house committee also would have continued and modified section 513 of pl 10890 requiring the secretary to research develop and procure certified systems to in spect and screen air cargo on passenger aircraft until these systems are developed the house committee directs tsa to enhance the known shipper program to prohibit highrisk cargo from being loaded on passenger planes additionally the language added to section 513 requires the tsa to at minimum double the per centage of air cargo currently being screened the conferees direct tsa to work more aggressively to strengthen air cargo security by strengthening the known shipper program to

ongoing eval uations of these aircraft are completed and clearly identify which aircraft the coast guard will need in the future the committee cannot fully support the budget request legacy and replacement assets both the senate and house committee reports voice concern over the condition of coast guard legacy assets the senate cites governmental accountability offi ce report which notes that coast guard assets are being used 40 more than originally anticipated when the deepwater program was conceived resulting in an acceler ated deterioration the senate report notes that the coast guard is expending more deepwater funding on maintaining legacy assets and less on acquiring re placement assets the senate committee directs the coast guard to submit report on its increased operational requirements post 911 and the impact that this is having on its legacy asset inventory by march 1 2005 the report is expected to include th costs associated with sustaining each legacy asset and timetable of all d eepwater replacement assets the house committee conversely is concerned that the coast guard is having problems maintaining its legacy assets due to perceived need to expend all available funding on deepwater procurement the house committee requires the coast guard to report within 30 days of enactment of the appropriations act its plans for maintenance of all legacy ve ssels and aircraft including the entity responsible for the maintenance and the estimated costs further the coast guard is directed to submit quarterly reports on its legacy maintenance plan beginning with the submission of the presidents fy2006 budget the confer ees adopt this house committee report language automatic identification system potential issue for congress concerns the automatic identification system ais vesseltracking system that the coast guard wants to implement as key part of its strategy for achieving maritime domain awareness mda ais is system that will identify the ship its size and its cargo before it enters an american seaport questions include the availability of radio frequency needed for ais and whether th system as currently planned will adequately cover all categories of ships that might pose threat to us homeland security both the house and the senate conference reports voice support for the ais program the house committee is concer ned that by the end of fy2004 only nine seaports will be able to receive ais signals from ente ring vessels and disappointed that only 5 million was requested for this program even though national plan to outfit the 55 largest seaports with this tec hnology is scheduled to be completed by the end of the calendar year the house committee is therefore providing 24 million to fund this effort in fy2005 the conference provides 24 million for ais nonhomeland security missions key potential issue is whether the coast guards resources are sufficient to adequately perform both its homeland and nonhomeland security missions the rrorist attacks of september 11 2001 increased coast guard requirements fo r homelandsecurity missions without obviously reducing requirements for othe r missions after september 11 2001 the coast guard significantly increased homeland security operations while reducing operations in other missions gao in reports and testimony on this topic have noted reduced number of coast guar d operating hours devoted to nonhomelandhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32566crs36 security missions and have expressed concerns regarding the coast guards ability to link application of resources to perfo rmance levels achieved for various missions the house and senate reports suppor t many nonhomeland security coast guard initiatives the house committee has included an extra 13 million for the coast guard to hire additional staff to ensure that it is in compliance with the us code title 14 sec 676 b watch standa rds at their search and rescue command centers according to the code indi viduals on duty are not allowed except in emergencies to work more than 12 hour s in 24hour period but staffing studies have shown the coast guard is unable to meet the standard at all facilities at all times the senate committee encourages the coast guard to continue its cooperative programs in the marine vessel and cold water safety education area which provides education and outreach on mar itime safety to fishermen and children the senate committee also recognizes the importance of the rescue swimmer program to coast guard operations and s upports the program ballast water program the ballast water program aims to prevent the introduction of alien nuisance species into american waters from the ballast tanks of foreign ships both the house and senate reports support this pr ogram the senate committee fully funds the request in order to assist the coast guard in transitioning the program from voluntary to mandatory enforcement policy the house committee also fully funds the request and not that because inva sive species spread readily once they have entered us water this program is of critical importance to all states with water resources regardless of their proximity to commercial ports the committee believes that there is void in the cgs medium to short range aerial surveillance assets which limits the cgs ability to costeffectively perform its homeland security related aerial surveillance missions the committee directs the coast guard to procure test and evaluate aircraft th at can perform mda missions icebreakers the house committee is very supportive of coast guard efforts to renegotiate the memo randum of understanding w ith the national science foundation nsf regarding the costs each agen cy shares for iceb reaking especially in the antarctic region the house committ ee continues to believe that the nsf is not adequately reimbursing the coast guar d for its icebreaking services in support of scientific research and notes that the cu rrent fleet of icebreakers is approaching the end of their service life the house committee directs the coast guard to evaluate and determine the present and future needs for polar icebreakers the coast guard should consider all appropria national defense homel and security scientific economic and environm ental interests of the united states the review should be completed and reported to the house committee by march 1 2005 the senate directs the coast guard to enter into an agreement with the national academy of sciences to conduct compre hensive study of the role coast guard icebreakers play in supporting us operations in the antarctic nd arctic the study should include different scenarios for continuing operations including the replacement of current assets and alternative methods th at do not involve the coast guard the study should also address po ssible changes in icebreaking missions due to environmental change the study s hould be submitted to the senate committee by september 30 2005 the conferees adopt this report languagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32566crs37 29 for crs reports related to 911 commission and transportation security recommendations go to crs at httpwwwcongressgoverplegissueshtm lister15htmlother reports in addition to the reports requested above the house and senate appropriations committees request the coast guard to submit the following reports the house committee is concerned that the coast guard has not presented report with the staffing and resource implications of the february 2004 decision to move to sector command structure they direct the commandant to submit such report less than 30 days prior to restruct uring including before and after staffing levels sector organizational structures sector chains of command and sector infrastructure and other issues that may require additional resources to implement the conferees adopt this house report nguage and requireme nts concerning the sector commands the house committee also directs the coast guard to submit report on the feasibility practicality and costeffectiveness of establishing permanent west coast helicopter squadr on by october 1 2004 lastly the house committee fully funds the budget request to aggressively imp lement the maritime transportation security act of 2002 the committee is concerned however that the coast guard plans to rely on foreign gove rnments to review foreign vessel security plans especially in light of the fact that some of these plans may not even be translated into english the committee directs the coast guard to review all vessel security plans and report their findings by october 15 2004 the conferees express similar concerns and direct the coast guard to use the port state control programs to ensure that foreign vessel security plan s are adhered to and in place the conferees direct the coast guard to report late r than march 1 2005 on the progress of the foreign vessel security oversight pr ocess including required resources the senate committee voiced concern that based on quarterly reports coast guard hours dedicated to nonhomeland security missions remain significantly below pre 911 levels the committee does note however that in most cases the coast guard continues to meet or exceed its performance goals in these operational areas the committee directs the coast guard to submit report on plans to develop system that can provide accurate representations of the costs necessary to meet performance goals amendment 3633 to senate passed hr 4567 requires dhs to submit report later than 90 days afte r the enactment of the act on opportunities to integrate the process by which the coast guard issues letters of recommendation for liquefied gas marine terminals the conferees adopt the this reporting requirement funding implications of the 911 commission border and transportation recommendations in its final report the 911 co mmission makes seve ral recommendations relating to border and transportation security29 many of these recommendations would have funding implications should th ey be adopted howe ver it is important to note that in none of the recommenda tions does the commission suggest specific funding increases decreases or allocati ons instead the commission points out the following broad areas that it believes need more attention and resources httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32566crs38 current transportation security efforts do not reflect forward looking comprehensive strategic plan that systematically evaluates all aspects of transportation security national plan for transportation security as th commission conceives it would identify the assets that need to be protected create riskbased priorities for their defense select the most efficient and cost effective methods for securing them and establish budget and funding streams the tsa is focused on aviation secu rity at the expense of other transportation modes the commission notes that while commercial aviation remains potential target opportunities to do harm are as great or greater in maritime or surface transportation in the absence of the aforementione d national plan the commission concludes that transportation s ecurity funding may be better allocated between all transportation modes investment should be made in t echnologies that have applications across transportation modes thes technologies include but are not limited to eds and etd systems currently used by tsa to screen passengers and their baggage for explosives nonintrusive inspection nii systems which are large scale xray and gamma ray imaging systems used by cbp at points of entry to inspect incoming vehicles trains and seacraft and radiological detection equipment rde used by cbp to detect traces of nuclear isotopes on vehicles cargo and people the commission calls for an expansion of current screening programs the us border security system should be expanded and integrated into larger network of screening points this network should include the transportation sy stem and access to vital facilities such as nuclear reactors dhs s hould design this comprehensive screening system and set common standards that can be applied system wide additionally dhs should complete its implementation of biometric entryexit screening system as quickly as possible and expand the screening of passenger s and baggage for explosives these recommendations are broad in natu re and as such difficult to quantify moreover the 911 commission makes concrete estimates of the funding implications involved with imple menting their recommendations
