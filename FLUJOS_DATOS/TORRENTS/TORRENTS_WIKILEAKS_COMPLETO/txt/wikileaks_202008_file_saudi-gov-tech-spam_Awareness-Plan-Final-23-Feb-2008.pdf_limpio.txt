increasing education and awareness is crucial part of comprehensive antispam strategy according to oecd awareness and educatio n is one of the critical components to fight against spam having an education and awareness pla n in place will educate users not to respond to spam messages one of the reasons why spammers are successful is t hat certain number of email recipients are still responding to spam purchasing advertised products or services visiting websites advertised by spammers or being tricked into submitting personal information in phishing scams considering the w cost of sending spam it is sufficient that even very small percentage of use rs respond by purchasing from spammers to allow them to make profit and theref ore to provide an incentive to continue spamming most of the developed countries have recognized through their discussions that part of the solution to eradicate spam consists in reducing the spam revenue flow increasing education and awareness is therefore an important part of comprehensive antispam strategy as it helps in red ucing the potential market of spammers and consequently their financial incentive s provide clear distinction between legitimate online marketing and spam education and awarenessraising can also help reduc spam which is sent by legitimate online users and direct marketers who are unaware f laws and regulations regarding unsolicited electronic communications this can be done by providing check list clearly identifying which types of electronic communication s are illegal while at the same time underlining the sanctions that may be applied for b reaching the law increase the level of security awareness in general education and awarenessraising in the context of s pam is broader concept than just dealing with the purchase of goods andor services advertised in spam the issue also deals with information security in general to educ ate users on how to protect their computers and their personal information and avoid being the victims of computer crimes as further explained in the next bullet point educate users on improving their computer security an increasing number of unsolicited messages
