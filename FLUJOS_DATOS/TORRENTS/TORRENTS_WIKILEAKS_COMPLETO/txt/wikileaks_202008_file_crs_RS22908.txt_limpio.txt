and industry division september 17 2008 abstract livestock producers in 2008 have seen sharply higher feed costs fueled by competing use demands for corn and soybeans and by higher energy prices some analysts argue that current public policies including financial incentives that divert corn from feed uses into ethanol production exacerbated if not caused these higher costs other factors which some believe to be at least as significant include crop production declines due to weather and higher global demand for commodities proposed options aimed at easing the impacts of higher feed costs include changes in ethanol incentives use of conservation land for forage use and direct aid to producers order code rs22908 updated september 17 2008 livestock feed costs concerns and options geoffrey s

commodities proposed options aimed at easing the impacts of higher feed costs include changes in ethanol incentives use of conservation land for forage use and direct aid to producers economic situation1 production costs through the first half of 2008 climbed in every segment of animal agriculture the main driver was feed which may account for 6070 of total livestock production costs in any given year overall total us feed expenses were forecast to reach recordhigh 48 billion in 2008 jump of nearly 10 billion or 26 over 2007 year that was 67 billion higher than 2006 corn accounts for about 90 of feed grains used for feed and soybean meal is the principal oil crop product used as feed according to the us department of agricultures usdas economic research service ers farmlevel corn prices have jumped from an average of 304 per bushel bu in the 20062007 marketing year september 1august 31 to record 420 per bu in the 20072008 marketing year and projected 500600 in 20082009 boon

feed costs for finishing feeder pig in iowa were about 42 or 30 of the total cost of production in may 2006 they reached 70 and 46 of total production costs in may 2008 from november 2007 through april 2008 the average loss for each iowa feeder pig finished for slaughter were nearly 22 per head2 cattle feeders who feed young cattle up to slaughter weight in the southern plains where the major us cattle feeding states include texas nebraska and kansas have been in the red since june 2007 according to the livestock marketing information center lmic southern plains feeders have been losing on average over 100 per head for much of 20083 cattlefax which provides market analysis for the cattle industry estimates that the total cost to produce cattle and beef from pasture to plate increased from 726 per head in 2005 to 1131 in 2008 or by 564 dairy producers have experienced cost pressures although farm milk prices have httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22908 remained relatively firm in 2008 due to strong exportfueled demand milk industry analysts also noted that feed costs have moderated somewhat from earlier levels and that cost impacts may have been muted because large share of dairy feed in 2008 seems to have either been grown on the dairy or contracted in advance5 shortterm effect when grain prices spike can be more production of red meat and poultry as herd sizes are reduced andor as more animals and milk are sold to maintain cash flow to cover higher prices this can depress farm and wholesale prices at least temporarily further exacerbating the costprice squeeze if current market conditions persist meat supplies will decline and prices rise through producer attrition and reduced capacity retail prices too will eventually adjust accordingly6 to date rising costs have largely been absorbed by livestock and poultry producers often with significant financial loss however higher costs of production will ultimately have to be reflected in higher prices for meat milk and eggs at retail counters in the united states and elsewhere this adjustment process is complex lengthy painful and not without unintended consequences lawrence and others wrote in choices see footnote 1 they added that speed of adjustment will vary significantly as industries with shorter production cycles such as poultry are able to respond in matter of months 2 cost of production data by john d lawrence and shane ellis iowa state university accessed june 2008 at httpwwweconiastateedufacultylawrencelawrence_websiteestreturnshtm lawrence has noted that these losses follow 10 years that

l outlaw agricultural and food policy center texas am university before the senate committee on energy and natural resources june 12 2008 crs3 whereas adjustments in industries with longer production cycles such as beef can take period of several years reasons for higher feed costs7 strong economic growth in developing countries rising commodity prices including for feed are rooted in confluence of factors some with shortterm impacts but others longerterm an example of the latter is steadily increasing world population boosted by robust growth in purchasing power especially in developing countries such as china and india analysts believe this trend could mean sustained increase in global demand for more and different kinds of food including as household incomes improve highervalue foods like meat and dairy products this dietary shift in turn implies increased demand for animal feeds weatherrelated crop shortfalls global grain production declined in 2005 and 2006 cutting into existing stocks and reducing exportable supplies crops here as well as in australia canada the european union eastern europe and some countries of the former soviet union were reduced mainly due to poor weather conditions on the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22908 other hand weather may have had less of an impact on corn than on food crops like wheat and rice world corn output was expected to increase from 712 million metric tons mmt in 20062007 to 790 mmt in each of 20072008 and 20082009 in the united states the worlds leading producer 2008 production was estimated by usda at 121 billion bushels approximately 1 billion bushels below the previous year among the reasons cited were spring rains and flooding followed by dry august in the corn belt8 surging us exports since january 2002 the us dollar has declined in value relative to the currency of us export competitors eg canada australia or the eu and grain importing nations eg japan taiwan etc effectively making us grain exports cheaper and therefore more competitive despite the rise in perbushel prices in terms of yeartoyear export volumes us corn exports are projected up nearly 18 to record of almost 25 billion bushels in the 20072008 marketing year other contributing factors former usda chief economist keith collins cited number of other factors that have contributed to feed and other food price increases these include higher demand for feed caused by increasing numbers of fed animals in the united states twoyear rise in corn production costs from 186 per acre in 2005 to nearly 230 in 2007 due mainly to higher energyrelated fertilizer and fuel costs and actions by number of foreign governments to insulate their own markets from high commodity prices such as limiting exports of their own agricultural commodities and subsidizing domestic production andor consumption9 7 adapted in part from crs report rl34474 high agricultural commodity prices what are the issues where additional details and unless noted sources may be found 8 usda ers feed outlook september 16 2008 9 collins keith the role of biofuels and other factors in increasing farm and food prices june 19 2008 study conducted in support of review by kraft foods global inc crs4 government biofuels policy perhaps the most widelydebated factor has been government biofuels policy current us biofuel production is almost entirely cornbased ethanol nearly 65 billion gallons of cornethanol were produced in 2007 compared with an estimated 450 million gallons of primarily soybeanbased biodiesel the energy independence and security act of 2007 eisa pl 110140 extended and substantially expanded the existing renewable fuel standard rfs usage requirement mandating that an increasing volume of biofuels be blended with conventional fuels the rfs mandates the use of at least 9 billion gallons of biofuel in us fuel supplies in 2009 more than doubling to 205 billion gallons by 2015 and to 36 billion gallons by 2022 the us biofuels sector is also supported by tax credit of 51 cents for every gallon of corn based ethanol blended in the us fuel supply to drop to 45 cents in 2009 and an import tariff of 54 cents per gallon of imported ethanol in addition several federallysubsidized grant and loan programs assist biofuels research and infrastructure development of the 160 us ethanol plants with total capacity now in excess of 9 billion gallons per year only about dozen use feedstocks other than corn or milo or barley also feed grains10 usda estimates that in crop year 20072008 about 23 of the us corn crop will have been used to produce ethanol this share is projected to grow to more httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22908 than 33 in 20082009 although high corn prices have slowed plans for expanded capacity plants already on line are expected to operate so long as they can cover their variable costs the runup in corn demand which is expected to be longlasting has directly sparked substantially higher corn prices to bid available supplies away from other uses like livestock feed according to number of agricultural economists corn ethanol byproducts now mainly distillers grains from drymill ethanol plants but also corn gluten feed and corn gluten meal can be fed by livestock producers to help offset higher feed corn prices according to the national corn growers association the equivalent of an additional 1 billion bushels of feed will be available in the coming year through ethanol byproducts11 because of the cost and difficulty of drying and shipping distillers grains are best utilized by feeders closest to ethanol plants research indicates that distillers grains should constitute more than 3540 of feedlot cattle rations 1020 of dairy cow rations and 10 for hogs broiler chickens and turkeys according to anderson reviewing several different studies and economic models collins concluded that implied changes in the price of corn due to its use in ethanol might range from 25 to 60 2008 study by the food and agricultural policy research institute fapri attempts to measure the pure and joint price effects of the us biofuels rfs and the tax credits suggesting that joint implementation of both the rfs and the tax credit supports corn prices by about 20 substantial portion of corn price effects are likely transmitted to the soybean market via competition for land primarily in the corn belt where soybeans and corn are both widely grown study by the center for agricultural research and development card found that jointly the rfs and tax credit supported corn prices by 16 fapri and card found the impacts of the tax incentives to be highly dependent on petroleum prices higher petroleum prices substitute for government 10 source renewable fuels association june 19 2008 at

neither study included the effects of grants and subsidized loans available for biofuels research and infrastructure outlook and options the us response to recent developments in grain markets is of keen interest to us meat dairy and poultry producers who have long been wary of any government policies that can raise feed prices congressional committees in 2008 have held number of hearings on the causes and impacts of rising commodity costs the house agriculture committee convened six hearings between midmay and midseptember 2008 on commodity futures trading and related matters including proposals to increase oversight by the commodity futures trading commission of futures markets where some critics argue excessive speculation added significantly to the 2008 price spikes in oil and other commodities others counter that futures traders simply react to market conditions economists seem to agree that us government initiatives are unlikely to have much impact on such price drivers as foreign population and income growth and concurrent demand for commodities weatherrelated production shortfalls and inflation generally at least in the short term however number of options have been offered to address httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22908 other perceived reasons for high feed prices reduce domestic ethanol incentives several bills propose to reduce ethanol production incentives by repealing lowering or freezing the rfs the biofuels tax credit andor the ethanol import tariff such as hr 5911 hr 5986 hr 6137 hr 6183 hr 6324 s 3031 and s 3080 outside of congress attention focused on an april 25 2008 letter to the us environmental protection agency epa from texas governor rick perry requesting waiver of 50 of the 2008 rfs for grainderived ethanol now at 9 billion gallons the letter cited epas authority under sec 211o of the clean air act to approve such waiver if the rfs requirement would severely harm the economy of state region or the country the epa in august denied the request stating that its analysis found compelling evidence that the rfs mandate is causing severe economic harm during the time period specified by texas12 opponents have argued that an epa waiver or reductions in the financial incentives proposed in the various bills would not have much of an immediate impact on corn prices see fapri and card studies above at any rate other factors such as global grain shortfalls strong us exports and higher oil prices played much larger role in high feed costs some have continued to assert use conservation land some have argued that as much as onethird of the nearly 35 million acres april 2008 in usdas conservation reserve program crp could be returned to agricultural production without environmental harm the 2008 farm bill pl 110246 caps national enrollment in the crp which is intended to keep environmentally sensitive lands out of production for 1015 years at 32 million acres what about incentives like easing producer penalties who want to end their crp contracts early discouraging reenrollment or renewal of existing contracts permitting temporary use of more crp acres for grazing cutting andor raising other feedstuffs opponents of opening conservation land assert that the loss of environmental benefits will 12 epa keeps biofuels levels in place after considering texas request august 7 2008 press release which can be found along with fact sheet on the epa findings and the august 13 2008 federal register notice at httpwwwepagovotaqrenewablefuels crs6 far outweigh any gains to animal agriculture in part because such lands have always been considered marginally productive in the first place also much of this marginal crp acreage previously was more suitable for and planted in wheat not corn or soybeans usda on may 27 2008 announced the potential eligibility of more than 24 million acres enrolled in crp for and forage in 2008 to help livestock producers hit by higher feed prices usda set number of limitations on use of crp acreage to minimize impacts on nesting birds and on the most environmentally sensitive lands the national wildlife federation sued the department arguing that it did not prepare an environmental impact statement on the new policy in july us district court issued temporary restraining order tro and then permanent injunction suspending usdas crp opening except for applicants that had been approved by or had applied prior to the tro or who had invested at least 4500 toward haying or grazing equipment and preparation prior to the tro where the application was approved prior to the tro haying and grazing must be completed by november 10 for subsequent approvals haying and grazing must end by september 30 and october 15 respectively13 financial assistance for livestock producers over the past decade alone httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22908 many of the nearly annual supplemental appropriations measures containing emergency agricultural aid have included money for animal agriculture amounting to at least 32 billion in total often to cover the cost of high feed prices or lost pasture use14 separately section 32 of the act of august 24 1935 is permanent appropriation available to usda for variety of purposes and it has been tapped not only to pay for disaster losses but also to address economic and market problems15 thus some argue there is policy precedent for providing direct payments to livestock and poultry producers to help them cope with sharply rising feed costs on the other hand both the 2008 farm bill pl 110 246 and the fy2008 usda appropriation part of pl 110161 contain language seeking to constrain section 32 spending or at least the secretarys flexibility to use it other options some have urged us officials to push harder for the elimination of various foreign barriers that obstruct international trade and distort market price signals to producers including tariffs unjustified technical and phytosanitary standards export controls and various domestic agricultural subsidies further it is argued investments should be increased particularly in developing countries in agricultural research and education to increase productivity in transportation and marketing infrastructure and in other types of alternative energy production here and globally these efforts could all help to ease the upward pressure on feed grain and other commodity prices others counter that regardless of their merits these types of solutions would offer little if any shortterm relief to the financial problems currently facing livestock producers 13 see crs report rs21613 conservation reserve program status and current issues by tadlock cowan the order does not affect july 2008 usda announcement to permit grazing only on crp land in
