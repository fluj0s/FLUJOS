to reduce the variation and number of products in the market obra 90 limited insurers to selling ten standardized policies with precisely defined benefits the ten standardized policies simplified price comparisons and decision making for medicare beneficiaries and led to consolidation in the market with fewer products and sellers however some pr oblems remained premium increases continued critics expressed dissatisfaction with the range of offerings claiming that the limited choices did not fully meet the needs of some beneficiaries and confusion persisted in some of the dimensions that were not addressed by the medigap reforms for instance in the methodology used to calculate premium increases over time there are several differences between the medigap experience and medicare part d when considering whether standard izing benefits might yield improvements in the part d market in contrast to digap medicare part d is new and the market is likely to change dramatically in the coming years many observers expect that the medicare part d market will consolidate in subsequent years both in the number of carriers and the number and scope of pr oducts offered as carriers learn which products are most attractive to medicare be neficiaries and whic h ones are profitable strong federal presence in medicare part d and the additional complexities of prescription drug benefit when compared to supplemental insurance product also suggest that the experiences might not be entirely similar consequently the policy decision should incl ude considerations about not only whether and how to standardize benefits but also when to do so httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33300contents m d i g p 1 background 1 b r 9 0 n d s s 9 4 2 r s u l t f r f r m s 3 c n t i n u i n g p r b l m s 3 d c

ssaa 941 this report highlights the lessons learne d from the medigap experience and how they might provide insight into the current medicare part d market medigap background the history of medigap is noteworthy for its lessons in federal regulatory intervention in health insurance markets medigap plans have been in existence since the 1970s and have been sold by hundreds of insurance companies2 however dissatisfaction with the medigap market grew substantially over the years beneficiaries complained of marketing abuses by companies and agents where medicare beneficiaries were sometimes sold multiple medigap plans or plans that duplicated coverage that they already had through retiree health plans other plans offered very little value the multiplicity of offerings from numerous carriers also led to confusing array of medigap product choices for bene ficiaries high premium increases compounded the dissatisfaction nd congress responded to complaints of marketing abuses high pr essure sales practices fra ud and confusing array of choices by passing laws that set restrictions on the medigap market prior to 1980 states were solely res ponsible for regulating medigap but this changed when congress enacted public law 96265 section 507a known as the baucus amendment responded to wi despread public dissatisfaction by establishing voluntary certification standards designed to encourage states to enact legislation that incorporated basic re quirements establishe d by the nationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33300crs2 3 loss ratio is defined as the proportion of benefit costs to premium revenue low loss ratio means that the amount of benefits paid is much less than the premiums received and so the insurer would be more profitable co rrespondingly high loss ratio value close to but less than one indicates that premiums ba rely cover the cost of benefits paid and so the insurer would be less profitable ss ratio greater than one would mean that premiums were insufficient to cover the cost of benefits the baucus amendment required minimum loss ratio of 60 for individual policies and 75 for group policies 4 gao medigap insurance law has increa sed protection against

including providing consumer guide and outline of benefits to pros pective policyholders3 although the baucus amendment achieved many of its goals there continued to be large number of products sold in this market as there were limits on how many and what type of benefits could be offere d in excess of the minimum standards4 beneficiaries found it difficult to co mparison shop effectively in the face of hundreds of policy configurations obra 90 was designed to address this shortcoming obra 90 and ssaa 94 the primary changes in the medigap market were the result of the medigap provisions of the omnibus budget rec onciliation act of 1990 mo st of which went into effect in 1992 and the social secu rity act amendments of 1994 these laws addressed the problems in the market by 1 simplifying choices 2 promoting competition as means to hold down premium increases and 3 providing consumer protections the medigap reforms of obra 90 limited insurers to selling 10 standardized policies with precisely defined benefits5 the 10 packages designated through j were designed by an advisory group convened by the naic with plan being the most basic policy and plan j being the most comprehensive three of the packages plans h i and j offered some prescrip tion drug coverage obra 90 required all medigap carriers to offer plan and carri ers may choose to offer any of the other nine options to medicare benefici aries at the carriers discretion obra 90 also contained numerous provisi ons designed to offer more consumer protections for medicare bene ficiaries these protecti ons include mandatory open enrollment periods limitations on preexisting conditions the requirement of free look provision to allow bene ficiaries time to decide wh ether the medigap plan that they selected was

increasing premiums failure to meet standards would generate requirement for the company to issue premium refunds one of the protections introduced by obra 90 made it illegal to sell duplicate medigap coverage to benefi ciaries but it also barred the sale of policies that duplicated other coverage to which beneficiary was entitled for instance through retiree health plan as result some insurers

10 standardized policies simplified price comparisons and decision making for medicare beneficiaries6 by 1999 about 107 million medicare beneficiaries more than onefourth of all medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in medigap policy7 complaints about carrier and agent abuses also declined substantially after obra 908 along with the reduction in the va riety of medigap products came consolidation in the market followi ng the 1992 implementation of obra 90 provisions there were fewer pr oducts and fewer sellers as many carriers with smaller market shares left the business9 over time the medigap

insurers and consumer advocates have complained about inconsistent regulation across states and that variation in wording requirements nd the presentation of policy forms resulted in less consistenc

rate policies in three ways 1 using community rating without any age differentiation 2 with i ssueage rating or 3 with attainedage rating the choice of rating methodology has implications for the cost of the premium over time communityrated premiums do not change as the policy holder ages issueage premiums are based on the age of the beneficiary when the policy is issued and increase with inflation but not age attainedage premiums can be less expensive initially when purchased but increase as the beneficiary ages decision making and the number of choices the effect of having many choices on decision making is not fully understood traditional economic theory argues that mo re choices lead to greater satisfactionfigure 2 distribution of medigap plans 1999httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33300crs6

desire too much of good thing journal of personality and social psychology vol 79 pp 9951006 2000 18 boards of trustees of the federal hospital insurance and federal supplementary medical insurance trust funds 2005 annual report since the decision maker can select the choice that is most closely aligned with the individuals preferences however some behavioral economists psychologists and others argue that the cost associated with having to evaluate each choice could offset the gains provided by achieving the best fit some research suggests that individuals faced with many choices may find that having more alternatives can be counterproductive particular ly when the differences ar small the prospect of having too many choices can be demotiva ting leading the decision maker to avoid making any decisions at all having mo re options may lead to less confidence that the decision makers choice is optimal and subsequently lower willingness to commit to single choice some recent empirical studi appear to support this theory one study found that plans that offered more 401k options had lower participa tion rates compared to plans that offered only handful of choices every ten funds added other things equal is associated with 15 to 2 drop in the pa rticipation rate16 another study found that while grocery store consum ers were initially mo re attracted to booth displaying 24 jam choices higher pe rcentage of consumers who saw only six choices subsequently purchased the jam by factor of 10 related work also showed that ex poste satisfaction was higher among thos who had fewer than those who had more choices17 at the other extreme having too few c hoices can also inhibit participation if the limited choices available do not provide the decision maker with an improvement over the status quo then choosing not to par ticipate will be optimal therefore other things being equal the more varied th preferences across the populati on the less likely that one choice will be optimal for the majority while these theories might partly explain the early enrollment experience of medicare part d the late enrollment penalty adds significant incentive whose effects have not yet been fully realized lateenrollment penalty helps to create and maintain broad base of enrollees so that pooling the collective experience can significantly reduce the average risk for all enrollees without such penalty beneficiary enrollment decisions would reflect an appropriate selfassessment of risk in the aggregate this could lead to premiuminflating spiral where only the highest risk beneficiaries choose to enroll leadin g to even higher premiums and riskier enrollees with each iteration although dicare part b is voluntary and offers one choice to participate or not the participa tion rate is 94 due in part to the late enrollment penalty18 the early experience with medicare part d enrollment may reflect both the demotivating aspect of having many choices as well as the fact that the latehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33300crs7 19 medicare beneficiary is not subject to pa rt d late enrollment penalty if the individual is enrolled in another insurance plan that prov ides coverage of prescription drugs costs and the actuarial value to the individual equals or exceeds the actuarial value of the standard prescription drug coverage under part d plan that meets this criteria is deemed to be creditable coverage 20 out of 434 million total medicare beneficiaries 105 million were either dual eligibles 62 million enrolled in medicare advantag plan prior to 2006 43 million or retirees with creditable coverage 100 million of the remaining 229 million 49 million signed up for standalone plan and 05 million enrolle d in medicare advantage drug plan as of february 13 2006 see kaiser family foundation policy brief tracking prescription drug coverage under medicare five ways to look at the new enrollment numbers february 2006enrollment penalty has not yet been impos ed as of midfebruary 2006 about 24 of medicare beneficiaries who were not automatically enro lled or did not have other creditable coverage19 had signed up for medicare part d plan20 while more beneficiaries may enroll as the lateenrollment penalty deadline nears trying to make the decision in the face of an impending deadline may also elevate accompanying stress levels evaluating proposals to extend the open enrollment period before imposing the late enrollment penalty requires balancing complex set of costs and benefits to medicare beneficiaries insurers cms nd taxpayers medicare beneficiaries who simply need more time to gather and inco rporate information to assist in decision making would be wellserved by an extension of the open enrollment period however there are likely to be beneficiaries for whom the extension is simply an opportunity to delay the choice for thes individuals the decision process would not change materially except that it would occur later additionally insurers calculated premiums based on expected enrollment linked to predetermined open enrollment period extending the signup pe riod could affect the enrollment and the covered expenditures in biased manner if fewer beneficiaries enroll in the early part of the year there would be proporti onally fewer covered co sts incurred if this happened in random or unbiased manner however extending the open enrollment period might provide the opportunity for bene ficiaries who were low risk those who did not use or expect to use many prescr iption drugs to postpone enrollment until the last possible minute providing an additional period during which late enrollment penalty would be in effect the effect of this scenario would be to create an enrolled population that differs from the one insurers projected when form ulating their plans and bids standardization options for medigap and medicare part d the medigap market of the 1980s and th current medicare pa rt d market both present the beneficiary with great many choices but the standardization approach applied to the medigap market through obra90 has limited parallels and applicability to the current medicare part

states that each part d eligible individual is entitled to obtain either the standard prescription drug coverage with access to negotiated prices23 or b alternative prescription drug coverage with at least actuarially equivalent benefits and access to negotiated prices24 25 thus vendors may vary their pr oducts and compete on premiums and costsharing requirements so long as they meet the actuarial

potential costsavings from increased availability and use of prescripti on drugs are likely to accrue to the insurers of parts and b through decreased hospita lization and physician visits there would appear to be an advantage for insurers that cover parts and b in addition to part d thus some industry observers have suggest ed that some companies may be offering freestanding part d plans to entice

of states however unlike the medigap market prior to 1990 there will always be significant role for the federal government in the medicare part d market variation across insurance products including

states32 in contrast the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms reviews and approves every part d plan ffered by every insurer thus problems that the medigap market faced such as duplicate

90 required the naic to develop 10 packages of benefits while proponents have touted the simplicity the 10 choices created others have argued that the packages are not sufficiently varied and that some beneficiaries are not wellserved by any of the choices for the medigap mark et consensus on part d standardization may also be difficult as to whether ther is manageable number of standardized packages that can be agreed upon and the dimensions to be standardized the medigap experience with premium rating illustrates the difficulties and tradeoffs inherent in standardizing benefit obra 90 did not sp ecify how carriers could set their premiums and as result three thods were used across medigap products beneficiaries and consumer advocates dislike attainedage rating since the premiums increase with age as incomes tend to decline in contrast most insurance carriers prefer to have the option to choose the rating methodology so that they can offer more choices and products in the market while the obra 90 and ssaa 94 reforms that led to standardized benefits stabilized the medigap market it is not clear that this action would have similar effect on the medicare part d market such an approach could be premature the problems in the medigap market were well established and persis tent the medicare part d market is likely to undergo signifi cant changes as all pa rties beneficiaries insurers drug manufacturers pharmacy be nefit manages cms learn about the new benefit and how it develops the medicare part d market will likely consolidate over the next few years and some insurers will exit while others enter the market however beneficiaries and plans are likel to face difficulties and challenges while the market moves through this transition intermediate interventions might help alleviate the difficulties associated with the great breadth and number of choices without placing rest rictions on specific options before the optimal set of standardized packages are clearly identified whether such actions are most appropria tely addressed thr ough legislation or regulation will depend on the specific objectives one possible intermediate intervention would be to limit each plan s ponsor to more than two offerings as suggested by draft call letter from cms to plans considering participating in 2007 while this restriction would reduce th number of choices it would also force companies that currently offer more than two choices to change their business practices33httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33300crs14 33 continued healthbeat news at

continue to be offered in subsequent years will be important in determining the variety of choices under medicare part d consequently the policy decision should include considerations about not only whether and how to standardize be nefits but also when to do so
