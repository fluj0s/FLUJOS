passed in 2002 the fee amounts and performance goals articulated and incorporated in statute were the result of an agreement between fda and the medical device industry in or der to facilitate th reauthorization of mdufma in april 2007 the fda and industry published the results of their negotiations with notice of an ap ril 30 2007 public meeting on the topic according to fda during the five year s covered by the proposals through 2012 fda would receive approxima tely 287 million from user fees this represents an increase from the 110 million fda received during the first four years of the program the industry agreement also calls for ch anges in the fee st ructure performance goals small business relief and thirdparty inspection pr ogram in addition the agreement reflects fdas

http www fdagovmedical device user fee and modernization act mdufma reauthorization overview fda and medical device review in order to understand the significance of mdufma basic introduction to fda and the medical device review process is useful the united states food and drug administration fda is the agency responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices in the united states according to statute medical device is an instrument apparatus implement ma chine contrivance implant in vitro reagent or other similar or related article including any component part or accessory which is 1 recognized in the official national formulary or the united states pharmacopeia or any supplement to them 2 intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditi ons or in the cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease in man or othe r animals or 3 intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals nd which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes federal food drug and cosmetic act 21 usc 301 201h ffdca according to this definition medical device can be anything from tongue depressor to home pregnancy test to wheelchair to pacemaker types of medical devices vary widely as do their respective manufacturin g requirements in part due to the diversity of medical devices compared to the drug industry the device industry is more fragmented smaller stimated earnings of 80 billion in 2004 compared to the drug industrys estimate d 222 billion and dominated by smaller companies fda is divided into six centers each charged with regulating particular type of product the center within fda primarily responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices is the ce nter for devices and radiological health cdrh one other center the center for biologics evaluation and research cber regulates some devices specifically those associated with blood collection and processing procedures as well as with cellular therapies eg

panel track supplements 180 day supplements real t ime supplements and 30da notices panel track supplements are akin to second entire pmas they reflect new indications for use or significant changes in device design or performance and require substantial clinical data as artificial heart valve approved for use to replace the aortic valve and proposed for use in the mitral valve would require the submission of panel track supplement 180day supplements ar submitted for significant changes to medical device components ma terials designs specifica tions software labeling or color additives proposed change in blood glucose monitoring system from wired to wireless telemetry would require this type of submission real time supplements are submitted when there are minor changes to the design software sterilization or labeling of device change in the storage temperature and expiration dating for an injectable gel woul d require this type of supplement 30day notices are submitted for modifications to manufacturing processes or methods such as change in the sterilization process fda offers one alternative that can be used in place of pma the product development protocol pdp pdp is based upon early cons ultation between the sponsor and the fda leading to devi ce development and testing plan acceptable to both parties it aims to minimize the risk that the sponsor will unknowingly pursue with the associated waste of capital and other resources the development of device that fda will not approve one additional type of submission is 513g request so named because of the section of the ffdca that regulates it 513gs enable requesters to obtain information from fda regarding the regulato ry status of their devices or products of all devicerelated sub missions pma or panel track supplement is the most rigorous and time consuming application process for manufacturers and review process for the fda 510k is signif icantly less rigorous and is much more common the majority of medical devices that come to market do so with 510k clearance rather than pma approval see table 2 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33981crs4 5 fda medical device user fee and modernization act public meeting

report to hr 3580 mdufma the medical device industry is growing rapidly the complexity of medical device technology is increasing at an equally rapid pace unfortunately fdas device review program lacks the resource s to keep up with the rapidly growing industry and changing technology beca use prompt approval and clearance of safe and effective medical devices is critical to improving public health it is the sense of the committee that adequate funding for the program is essential6 in addition to filing applications for clearance or approval with fda device manufacturers must be registered with f da and file annual re ports in addition fda inspects establishments where medical devices that are marketed in the united states are manufactured to assess compliance with fdas quality system requirements for ensuring good manufacturin g practices gmp and other applicable requirements according to the g overnment accountability office gao during quality system inspections

fda officials met with industry leaders to agree upon mutually acceptabl fee types amounts exceptions and performance goals8 the agreement specified that in return for the additional resources provided by medical device user fees fda was expected to meet performance goals defined in november 14 2002 letter from the secretary of the department of health nd human services hhs to the chairman and ranking minority members of the committee on h ealth education labor and pensions committee of the us senate and the committee on energy and commerce of the us house of representative9 mdufma was enacted in order to provi fda with the resources necessary to better review medical devices to enact needed regulatory reforms so that medical device manufacturers can bring their safe and effective devices to the american people at an earlier time and to ensure that reprocessed medical devices are as safe and effective as original devices10 mdufma amended the ffdca to enact three significant provisions for medi cal devices 1 it established user fees for premarket reviews of devices 2 it allowed establ ishment inspections to be conducted by accredited persons third par ties and 3 it

requiring fees and exceptions to the general rule mdufma gives fda the authority to collect user fees from manufacturers seeking to market medical devices all of the fees charged under mdufma are for types of applications required for fda approval or clearance of product according to fda there were fluctuations in the number of applications submitted from year to year and fee revenues repeatedly fell short of expectations13 to remedy the situ ation mdufa 2007 would introduce three new types of fees which would generate about 50 of the to tal fee revenue and that would be more stable than application fees the new f ees are an annual establishment registration fee paid once each year by each manufacturer an nnual fee for filing periodic reports applicable to class iii devices approved under pmas premarket reports and pdp processes and fee for filing 30day notice the fda agreement states that the implementation of these new fees would allow for significant reduction in mdufa 2007 of existing application fees see table 7 generally fees would increase each year by 85 which according to fdas recommendation would ensure that fee revenues contribute their expected share to total program costs and provide industry with stability and predictability in the fee revenues it would expect to pay for the newly created establishmen t fee the secretary could increase the fee amount in fy2010 up to an additional 85 over the annual 85 increase if fewer than 12250 establishments paid the fee in fy2009 this measure is designed to ensure that the fees collected from this source total 45 of total fee revenues both mdufma and proposals for mdufa 2007 set fees as percentage of the full fee for pma also called the base fee which is generally the most involved type of application that device manufacturer could make to fda ffdca 738a2a14 during the course of mdufma the amount of the base fee and thus the amounts of all of the other fees rose each year from 154000 in fy2003 to 281600 in fy2007 ffdca 738c1 see table 8 the percentages of the base fee assigned to various types of submissions have changed slightly from mdufma to mdufa 2007 but the concept is the same the following is one example from mdufa 2007 30day notice f ee is equal to 16 of the base fee mdufa 2007 would strike provision that enables the secretary to adjust the premarket notification fee amount annually so

including training to enhance scie ntific expertise fda would in turn provide summary information on the types of training provided to staff on an annual basis performance goals in addition to

along with fdas mdufma user fee authority for purposes of mdufa 2007 the fda agr eement proposes to meet fewer and more rigorous goals that build on the prog ress made in mdufma in making these

medical devices status of fdas program for inspections by accredited organizations report to congress gao07157 january 2007accredited thirdp arty inspections accredited thirdparty inspections were introduced in mdufma as amended by mdtca with the goal of reducing the burden on fda inspectors by enabling fdaaccredited persons third parties to conduct certain in spections on fdas behalf fda is required by statute to in spect certain domestic establishments where medical devices are manufactured at least once every two years according to the gao fda has not been m eeting this requirement21 instead five or six years sometimes pass between fda inspections at any one establishment gao reports that fda accredited the fi rst third party on march 11 2004 as of october 31 2006 of 23 organizations th at had applied to conduct thirdparty inspections of establishments 16 had received fda accreditation and seven had completed the necessary training nd were cleared to conduct independent inspections as of october 31 2006 tw accredited organizations had conducted independent inspections one inspecti on of domestic establishment and one inspection of foreign establishment during that same period 36 inspections of domestic establishments and one inspection of foreign establishment were conducted by accredited organizations jointly with fda officials as part of training that fda requires of accredited organizati ons these 38 inspections represent just over 1 of the 3470 inspections that fda reported to gao it conducted between march 11 2004 and october 31 200622 gao reports that several factors may influence manufacturers interest in voluntarily requesting an inspection by an accredited organization according to fda and representatives of affected entities there are potential incentives and disincentives to requestin g an inspection as well as reasons for deferring participation in the progra m potential incentives include the opportunity to reduce the number of inspections conducted to meet fda and other countries requirements and to control the scheduling of the inspection potential disincentives include bearing th cost for the inspection and uncertainty about the potential consequences of making commitment to having an inspection to assess compliance with fda requirements in the near future some manufacturers might be deferring partic ipation for example manufacturers that already contract with specific accr edited organization to conduct inspections to meet the requirements of other countries might defer participation until fda has cleared that organization to conduct independent inspections23 mdufa 2007 would change the third party accredited person inspection program in three major areas according to the fda agreement the proposals

devices marketed in the united states and to permit fda to focus its inspectional resources on those firms and products posing the greatest risk to public health the first change would be to streamline the administrative burdens associated with qualifying for the program for example rather than having to petition fda for clearance to use third party the propos would require only that firms provide fda with 30 days prior notice of their intent to use third party listed on fdas website the second change would be to expand participation in the program for example the current thirdparty program restricts qualified ma nufacturers of class ii and class iii medical devices to two consecutive thirdparty inspections after which fda must conduct the next inspec tion unless the manufacturer petitions and receives waiver mdufa 2007 would per mit firms to use third parties for an unlimited number of consecutive inspections without seeking waiver however fda would continue to conduct for caus or followup inspections whenever it deemed such inspections appropriate the third change would be to permit device companies to voluntarily submit to fda reports by third parties assessing conformance with an appropriate international quality systems standard such as those set by the international standards organization fda would consider the in formation in these reports in setting its inspection priorities reprocessed singleuse devices some reprocessed suds are relatively simple items for external use such as inflatable sleeves to improve blood circ ulation while others are complex and invasive such as catheters that are inserted into the heart to monitor cardiac functioning according to gao report i ssued in 2000 prior to mdufma some devices both suds and those marketed as reusable had been reprocessed inhouse by hospitals and other treatment facilities while others had been reprocessed by companies formed for that purpose24 at that time the practice of sud reprocessing raised public health concerns primarily regarding the potential risks of infection and device malfunction and led to complaints by the original device manufacturers that fda had not maintained consistent regu latory standards for different types of medical device companies before mdufma the regulatory requirements for manufacturers of reprocessed singleuse devices basica lly depended upon the class of the device manufacturers of reprocessed class i and ii singleuse vices were required to have 510k unless the device was exempt fro m 510k reproce ssors of class iii devices were required to obtain premarke t approval mdufma made reprocessorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33981crs19 of some previously exempt devices l onger exempt from the 510k submission requirements it required re processors to submit 510ks th at include validation data validation data were also re quired for many reprocessors of singleuse devices that were previously the subject of cleared 510 ks finally repro cessors of class iii devices needed to submit premarket report new type of pma to fda mdusfa added the requirement that an sud would be deemed as misbranded and thus not legally marketable in the united states unless it identified the manufacturer mdufsa allowed such info rmation to be provided by detachable label intended to be ffixed to the medical record of patient mdufa 2007 does not focus on suds but does contain requirement that sud reprocessors pay the propos ed annual establishment fee other mdufa 2007 provisions in addition to the above provisions as described below mdufa 2007 would require the production of veral annual repor ts and hr 2900 would authorize appropriations for postmarket surveillance and would require study of nosocomial infections those acquired in hosp itals related to medical devices annual reports mdufma requires the secret ary to submit annual progress reports to relevant congressional committees regarding the progress of fda in

specifies that the implementation report should include description of the use of such fees fo r postmarket safety ac tivities s 1082 would also continue the requirement but inst ead of requiring that description of postmarket safety activities be included in the implementation report it would require the inclusion of information on all previous cohorts for which the secretary has not given
