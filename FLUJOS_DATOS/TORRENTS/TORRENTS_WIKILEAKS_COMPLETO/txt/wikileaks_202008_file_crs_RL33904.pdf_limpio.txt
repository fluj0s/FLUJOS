finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33904the lowincome housing tax credit framework for evaluation summary the lowincome housing tax credit lihtc is an economic incentive to produce affordable rental housing these federal housing tax credits are awarded to developers of qualified projects who either use or sell the credits to investors to raise capital or equity for real estate projects the tax benefit reduces the debt andor equity financing that the developer would otherwise ve to obtain with lower financing costs beneficiaries of tax credits can offer lowe r more affordable rents see crs report rs22389 an introduction to the design of the lowincome housing tax credit by pamela j jackson for detailed descrip tion of how the lihtc program works and an overvie w of legislative developments proponents of the credit view the lihtc as highly effective because of the more than one million rental units already fi nanced by the credit proponents also emphasize that the credit is responsible for the production of up to 50 of all multifamily housing starts in any given year opponents argue that the lihtc is not effective or at minimum far less effec tive than supporters claim because lihtc units have supplanted other affordable rental housing and because the supplyside credit program is more costly than demandside subsidies like the section 8 housing voucher program opponents also argue that the lihtc program does not serve verylowincome households who are often most in need of affordable housing as policy makers begin to address affordable housin g issues modifications to the lihtc could be considered this re port which will be updated in the event of significant legislative events discusses some fundamental public policy questions questions neither extensively explored nor re solved is the lack of affordable housing result of housingmarket failure does the lihtc address the affordable housing problem and is the lihtc efficient or c ould it be improved these questions are not definitively answered in economics literature determining the size of the affordable housing market may be of value national inventory system coul d be created to record information about the net gains or losses of affordable rental units also to the extent the effectiveness of the lihtc relies on the ability of state housing authorities to select marginal projects those projects that if not for the lihtc would not be develope d it could be useful to know whether states are lecting these projects do applicants who fail to win credit awards subsequently go on to build housing without the tax credit congress may not alter the lihtc program as tax expenditure the program does not require an appropria tion or reauthorization lternatively congress might modify the lihtc program some attention has focused on examining the rules of the lihtc program to determine where its compatibility with other housing finance programs can be increased policymakers have also discussed whether the lihtc program could be modified to target affordable housing production for households with very low income another option is to repeal the lihtc program

investors may also be able to claim depreciation and capital gains losses on the real estate investmentthe lowincome housing tax credit framework for evaluation overview the lihtc was created by the tax re form act of 1986 tra pl 99514 to provide an incentive for the acquisition and development or rehabilitation of affordable rental housing in the two decades since its enactment the lihtc has become the leading source of financing fo r affordable rental housing as the 110th congress begins and legisla tive conversations turn toward affordable housing the lihtc may receive attention proponents of the lihtc view the credit as highly efficient and effective as evidence of effectiveness advocates st ate that the lihtc is responsible for producing 50 of all multifamily housing star ts annually and virt ually all affordable rental housing in the united states since the credit was introduced1 proponents also suggest that the very high price of tax credits in equity markets is sign of the credits popularity opponents claim that the lihtc has crow ded out other forms of rental housing finance and that result not the credits value is the leading source of financing for rental housing additionally the credit is pe rceived as more costly and less efficient than demandside subsidies like the secti on 8 housing voucher program opponents also claim that the price of tax credit dollars is high not because of its efficiency but because the credit offers d eep subsidy to investors as well as other tax benefits2 as policy makers begin to address affordable housin g issues modifications to the lihtc will likely be considered this report discusses some fundamental public policy questions that have not received much attention is the lack of affordable housing result of housingmarket failure does the lihtc address the affordable housing problem and is the lihtc efficien t or can it be improved despite the significance of the tax credit in housing finance markets th questions are not definitively answered in economics literature httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33904crs2 3 us congress report of the bipartisan millennial housing commission meeting our nations housing challenges may 30 2002 at httpgovinfolibrary untedumhc mhcreportpdfthis report where possible attempts to answer these questions where it is not possible to answer the policy questions this report draws attention to the information actions or both necessary to obtain the answ ers the principal conclusions of this report are as follows the perceived lack of affordable housing while of concern to policy makers the press and to some degree the general public is not necessarily caused by housingmarket failure there is insufficient empirical evidence to determine what is causing the affordable housing crisis the evidence is unclear that the lihtc actually helps to solve the affordable housing problem and ther is some evidence that it may actually crowd out replace other affordable housing development rather than increase the number of housing units the lihtc has complicated system of delivery that may increase costs relative to the benefits it provides moreover it may be less efficient than other affordable housing programs after discussing how affordable hous ing is defined this report examines whether housingmarket failure exists whether the lihtc program is efficient and whether the lihtc is cost effective relative to other programs and concludes with discussion of seve ral policy options what is affordable housing there is growing consensus among po licy makers and the general public that the nation faces shortage of affordable housing particularly rental housing the 2002 bipartisan congressiona lly mandated millennial h ousing commissions final report confirmed and defined the shortage as crisis3 the harvard joint center for housing studies 2006 state of the na tions housing report identified housing affordability as one of the key challenges facing the nation but is the affordability crisis the result of housing market fa ilure warranting govern ment intervention in housing markets to answer that questi on we start by defining the concept of affordable housing the term affordable housing is widely used and generally refers to housing of standard decent quality nd that family can afford without compromising their ability to meet other needs while higherincome families generally have range of housing that under this definition is availa ble to them families with lower incomes have fewer options housing affordability for middle and lowerincome groups is generally measured in terms of cost bur den generally cost burden measures thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33904crs3 4 affordability is sometimes measured in term s of income adequacy which compares annual household income to the income needed to pa annual rent costs for example in the united states the median middleincome household earned 165 times the income needed to rent the medianpriced apartment 5 some industry analysts criticize the 30 asure as arbitrary and point out that the measure fails to take into account other household needs 6 joint center for housing studies

see crs report rl32162 the size and role of government economic issues by marc labonte actual percentage of household in come spent on housing by renters4 households are considered costburdened if more than 30 of annual income is spent on housing5 when families are considered housingco st burdened they may have difficulty affording necessities such as food clothi ng transportation and medical care in 2004 76 million renter households were c onsidered cost burdened with an additional 84 million renter households considered severely cost burdened paying more than 50 of their income toward housing while so moderateincome renters experience severe rent burdens wincome renters face the greatest burdens more than 86 of severely costburdened renters were in the bottom quintile of the income distribution6 economists report that the problem of severe rent burdens may be growing while the supply of lowcost rental units may be declining creating an affordable housing shortage it is estimated that th inventory of affordable units with inflationadjusted rents of 400 or less including utilities declined by 12 million from 1993 to 2003 with losses of units due to repair abandonment or demolition the shortage of affordable rentals availa ble to lowincome households is estimated at 54 million7 is there housing market failure according to standard economic theory an economy best satisfies the wants and needs of its participants if markets operate free from distortions such as taxes government intervention in housing markets as in any market may be justified on economic grounds if market failures exist market failures can occur when market left on its own fails to allocate resources efficiently8 if market failure exists and subsidy remedies that failure then there is economic justification for the subsidy based on efficiency if market failure does not exist then there is economic justification for the subs idy based on efficiency9 there may however be justifications for government interventi on based on other publicpolicy goals suchhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33904crs4 10 crs report rl32162 the size and role of government economic issues 11 housing is

run housing supply ri ses and housing prices adjust 12 joint center for housing studies of harv ard university the state of the nations housing 2006 p 25 available at http wwwjchsharvar

1978 pp 3942as ensuring minimum level of housin g consumption for all households or equalizing opportunities for housing consumption certain socially undesirable phenomena ma be valid targets of public policy such as pay inequality poverty lack of ffordable housing and inflation but there is consensus as to whether these problems meet the definition of economic inefficiency10 some economists argue that the lack of affordable housing is not market failure to be corrected but rather result of increased demand being met with slow supply response whic h causes prices to rise11 if the lack of affordable housing is supplyresponse probl em state and local landuse regulations may be contributing factors12 landuse restrictions and zoning laws are examples of government regulatory areas that can hinder the timeliness of supply responses to changes in demand another key factor potentially contributing to lack of affordable housing but one not categorized as market failure is the unwillingness of lenders to make loans to investors because of class or race bias form of discrimin ation often referred to as redlining where discrimination in lending occurs capital subsidies for affordable housing might improve th allocation of capital13 if market failure exists the presence of externalities may be the culprit an externality itself type of market failure exists when the activity of an individual directly affects positively or negatively the welfare of another and that result or consequence is not incorporated in market prices14 economic theory suggests that there are externalities in housingservices markets because there are both private costs and benefits for indivi duals as well as social costs and benefits for the public at large high prices for housing in certain areas can increase housing prices in adjacent areas also to the extent that housing structures perhaps older ones induce blight there is an imposition of external costs on society these externalities of housing sometime serve as grounds for government intervention in such areas as neighborhood redevelopmen t and housing production15 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33904crs5 16 for instance

housing analysts argue that if subsidie s are warranted for reasons having only to do with income inequality then income suppor t is the most appropriate form of aidyet the few studies that have ex amined the lihtcs contribution to neighborhood quality have f ound only small effects both negative and positive16 in some cases the new construction of lihtc projects positively influenced the price of singlefamily homes in the immediate surr ounding area in other cases the lihtc projects negatively influenced the price of singlefamily homes the lack of affordable housing raises host of important economic issues for example to the extent that households spend disproportionate amounts of income on housing other basic necessities might be neglected one recent report found that households devoting more than 50 of thei r income to housing paid an average of 175 for food and 35 for healthcare per month in 2003 in comparison households spending less than 30 of their income on housing paid an average of 248 for food and 109 for healthcare monthly17 if health care spending for instance is insufficient for households it could lead to poor health and wellbeing this outcome could create both priv ate costs for the household and social costs for the community negative externa lities either through incr eased public subsidies for health care or increased diseas and poor health for others yet it can be argued that the negativ externality experienced by households in the example above is not confined solely to the housing market in that case the externality might be more appropriately viewed as matter for the health care marketplace correcting market failures may not be the only reason for government intervention other reasons could include th desire to increase equality of outcomes to provide minimum level of housing consumption by all members of society or to create equity of opportunity ensuring viable participation in housing markets by providing some minimum endowment of assets18 if housing subsidies like the lihtc contribute toward these outcomes then the subsidies may be justified most economists however would argue that demandside subsidy like housing vouchers would be more appr opriate than the lihtc supplyside subsidy in satisfying this type of policy objective19 other economists argue that the supply of rental housing is insufficient to meet mand and thus supplyside subsidies are necessary policy tools to comple ment demandside subsidies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33904crs6 20 kirk mcclure the lowincome housing ta x credit as an aid to

scored by state housing offici als based upon the planned projects perceived continuedonce the question justifying the lihtc is addressed the ne xt policy question that arises is does the lihtc address the affordable housing problem the next section of this report addresses this question does the lihtc address the ffordable housing problem the fact that the lihtc is source of financing for large number of rental housing units is undisputed industry experts often cite these data as evidence of the credits success left unaddressed is the issue of whether or to what extent the units financed with the lihtc would have been built without the lihtc and for tax credit units built to what extent if any do they crowd out existing units the following section attempts to address this issue but to date the relevant data to make these determinations are not readily available number of studies assert the positive imp act of the lihtc is large in 2000 for example mcclure cited several studies of the credits impact and stated that the lihtc has been success in that it generated many rental housing units that are now occupied by low and moderateincome households although estimates vary the program has contributed to the reha bilitation or construction of somewhere between 500000 and 900000 units20 more recent estimates from the us depar tment of housing and urban development hud indicate that 13 million units were placed in service between 1997 and 200321 these estimates however do not indicate whether or not the lihtc units constitute net additions to the housing st ock the lihtc data do not reflect all additions to the housing stock and the portion of those additions that the lihtc represents thus assessing the lihtcs impact on the housing stock involves two related issues for investigation marginality housing pr oduction choices made at the margin and crowding out whether subsidized ffordable housing replaces other affordable housing are the projects at the margin being selected one issue that arises in assessing the impact of the lihtc on th stock of housing is whether the projects receiving the taxcredit awards are at the margin of being developed22 in

plans for the lowincome housing tax credit program the urban institute metropolitan housing and communities policy center may 2002 p 2 24 inframarginal projects in this context are those well within the margin ie projects that could proceed with or without lihtc funding 25 as in all capital markets the demand curve is the marginal product of capital the supply curve is the marginal cost of capital or what has been referred to in this report as the user cost of capital user cost of capital is also ca lled rental cost of capital and refers to the cost of acquiring and using capital goodswords are tax credits awarded to projects that would not proceed if not for the tax credit financing alternatively are tax credits awarded to projects that could proceed and be successfully developed without the aid of tax credit financing to the extent that tax credits are awarded to projects not at the margin ie inframarginal projects that could proceed without tax credit financing it could be argued that the lihtc does not add to the housing stock thus the effectiveness of the lihtc relies heavily on the ability of state housing authorities to select and fund marginal projects project financing along with sponsorship and costs are criteria used by states in the selection process that could be used in identifying marginal proj ects other factors include the geographic location of the project local housing needs resident characteristic s project activities and types building characteristics and affordability23 these other factors may lead state housing authority official s to select nonmarginal proj ects if the goal were to focus resources on financing marginal project s an alternative lection method could be to select the marginal projects first and then from within that pool select the projects that meet housingagency prioritie s this alternative would however add complexity time and cost to the selection process some observers have suggested that state housing authority officials may be more likely to select inframarginal projects rather than those at the margin because the former are generally perceived as more likely to succeed24 under such circumstances rather than selecting do or die projects housin g officials may wish to be perceived as successful in s upporting housing production and they may not wish to take risks in selecting projects that may or may not succeed the marginality problem is illustrated in figure 1 which shows the market for lowincome housing capital the dema nd for housing capital slopes downward from left to right and the supply curve is perfectly horizontal25 in case 1 if the tax credits were widely available to all investors the tax credit would simply cause downward shift in the supply curve as noted by s given the downwardsloping nature of the demand curve hous ing stock would increase from h0 to ht the stock from h0 to ht would be the lihtc units and the lihtc could be said to have increased the stock of housing but the tax credit is not widely available instead the tax credit is awarded to few projects by state housing authorities httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33904crs8 in case 2 only few projects receive tax credits and thus only portion of the supply curve for the market shifts downward in this example the first few projects the inframarginal ones receive tax credits those up to ht and yet the total stock of housing is unchanged at h0 the units from ht to h0 are unsubsidized thus the tax credit has financed projects that would have been built even without the subsidy the applicability of the credit to these inframarginal projects can also be viewed as one variety of the crowding out pr ocess described in the next section where projects receiving the credit are not on the margin of production those investors claiming the credit do not have to offer reduced rents as in the first case at s1 and can instead lease the project at the prevailing market rental rates as long as the lihtc gross rent restriction is near the market rate investors have incentive to discount rents and pass the be nefits of the lihtc onto tenants if tax credits are awarded to projects that are marginal as in case 3 when the associated portion of the supply curve shifts there is an addition to the housing stock from h0 to ht while the stock of housing up to h0 is unsubsidized the additional stock of housing beyond h0 is subsidized in this case the federal tax revenue loss from the lihtc is associated with net gain in the housing stock and the subsidy may be passed on to tena nts as reduced rent do lihtc units crowd out other housing number of economic studies have examined the question of whether governmentsubsidized housing actually increases the supply of housing or simply crowds out unsubsidized production leaving net gain in units in the economy what some studies term crowding out can be viewed as an aspect of the marginality problem described previously the evidence suggests that some crowding out occurs but the extent and degree is unclearfigure 1 potential effects of lihtc on the supply of affordable housinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33904crs9 26 us

of economic research working paper 8709 january 2002 pp 2324a congressional budget office cbo study of the lihtc concluded that the credit was unlikely to increase substan tially the suppl of affordable housing26 subsidized housing cbo asserted displ aces other affordable housing that would have been available through the private unsubsidized housing market cbo surmised that the increased demand for lihtc units would cause decreased demand for nonlihtc or unsubsidized units resulting in decrease in the prices of those units the subsequent price decline would cause suppliers to remove unsubsidized units from the housing stock27 if crowding out occurs in this manner the residents of affordable housing units crowded out by lihtc units would lose out if those residents were not able to beco lihtc unit tenants in such case developers of lihtc units w ould benefit at the expense of owners of other lowcost housing malpezzi and va ndell found high rate of subs titution between current housing stock and lihtc units consistent with the cbo findings28 malpezzi and vandell asserted that if the supply of housing we re perfectly elastic responsive to price changes then the demand for lihtc units would cause price declines in the rest of the market as demand for such housing declined this decline would cause reduction in the supply of housing until the market price of housing prior to the change was restored the total stock of housing would ultimately remain the same but the new lihtc units would have crowded out an equivalent quantity of unsubsidized housing29 alternatively malpezzi nd vandell asserted that if housing supply prices were inelastic unresponsive to the presence of the lihtc then lihtc units would still cause price declines in the rest of the mark et as demand for housing in the rest of the market were to fall the authors theorized that price declines would make renters in the rest of the market better off while also providing new affordable housing to residents of the lihtc units30 however price declines could also cause housing suppliers to remove units from the housing stock sinai and waldfogel conclude d that if subsidized housing raised the quantity of occupied housing per capita either more people would be finding housing or people would be housed less densely31 alternatively if subsid ized housing merely crowded out

waldfogel found that governmentfinanced units raised the total number of units in an area although on average three governmentsubsidized units displaced two units that would otherwise have been provided by the private market the authors found there was less crowding out in more populous markets and more crowding out in places where there was less excess demand for public housing32 burman and mcfarlane determined that if the supply of lowincome housing is very elastic in the long run then production of limited amounts of subsidized housing replaces other housing that would have been provided by the private sector33 the authors concluded that housing subsidiz ed by the government could increase the average quality of housing available to poor people but would not have lasting effect on the quantity or price of housing available to poor people34 the impact of crowding out on tenants and developers depe nds on variety of factors if lihtc units crowd out othe r affordable housing units developers of lihtc units benefit at the expense of othe r developers additionally market forces may allow developers to charge the highest allowable rents under the lihtc program which could approximate market rates as illustrated in figure 2 with the lihtc contributing to reduction in costs th developer could afford to charge rents at p1 but demand is high enough such that th developer can continue to charge at p0 and not risk vacancies thus developers may retain more of the subsidy from the lihtc rather than pass it onto tenantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33904crs11 if tax credits are awarded to marginal projects and these projects do not crowd out other affordable housing then lihtc succeeds in solving the affordable housing problem the evidence is unclear as to whether marginal projects are being selected the evidence is also unclear as to whet her there are net gains in the affordable housing stock as result of the lihtc progra m in other words is the level of new housing stock created by lihtc units large enough to offset crowding out effects aside from the impact of the lihtc on th stock of housing the determination of whether the lihtc addresses the affo rdable housing problem also requires an assessment of the affordability of the tax credit units do lihtc units assist those most in need of affordable housing to be eligible for the lihtc

units the study also reported surplus of more than 6 million rental units for higherincome households40 given the program rules governing rents for lihtc units the affordable housing deficit for eli and vli households is unlikely to be remedied by the tax credit program is the lihtc efficient even if the lihtc does add to the affo rdable housing stock there are questions as to whether it is the most efficient system the lihtc involves complicated subsidy mechanism that adds to the cost of the program relative to its benefits this section examines three areas in which the program can be examined forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33904crs13 41 from 1986 through 2000 the initial credit allocation amount was 125 per capita the allocation was increased to 150 in 2001 to 175 in 2002 and 2003 and indexed for inflation annually thereafter the 2004 allocation was 180 and the 2005 allocation was 185 42 the initial minimum tax credit ceiling fo r small states was 2000000 and was indexed for inflation annually after 2003inefficiencies 1 the complicated system of distributing tax credits 2 the value of the credits themselves and 3 the cost effectiveness of the lihtc relative to other housing programs distribution of credits the process of allocating awarding and then claiming the lihtc is complex and lengthy the lihtc is allocated nnually to states according to federal law state housing agencies are requi red to allocate credits to velopers of rental housing according to federally required but statecreat ed allocation plans many states have two allocation periods per year developers apply for the credits by proposing plans to state agencies on average one project out of five may receive an allocation of tax credits upon receipt of lihtc allocation developers typically must exchange the tax credits for equity taxpayers claiming the tax credits are usually real estate investors not developers the tax credits cannot be claimed until the real estate development is complete and operable for example project may be allocated credits in june of 2005 but not completed until june of 2006 the tax credits may not begin to be claimed until th tax return filing period of april 2007 thus more than year or two could pass between the time of tax credit allocation and the time the credit is claimed housing finance agencies lihtcs are allocated to each state according to its population and are typically adminis tered by the states housing finance agency hfa in 2007 hfas receive annua l tax credit allocation authority in the amount of 195 multiplied times the population of the state41 the minimum tax credit ceiling for states with small populations is 2275000 in 200742 tax credits that are not awarded by states are added to national pool and then distributed to those states that apply for the excess credits to be eligible for those credits state must have allocated all of its previously allotted tax credits hfas award tax credits to developers according to qualified allocation plan qap that outlines the states affordable housing prioritie s and how to apply for tax credits federal law requires that the qap give priority to projects that serve the lowestincome households and that remain affordable fo r the longest period of time the types of projects eligible for the lihtc are apartment buildings single family dwellings duplexes or

to reduce their own tax bills or sell them nonprofit developers sell tax credits trading tax credits or selling them refers to the process of exchanging tax credits for equity investment in real estate projects developers recruit investors to provide equity to fund deve lopment projects and offer the tax credits to those investors in exchange for their commitment when credits are sold the sale is usually structured with limited partnership between the developer and the investor and sometimes administered by syndicators who must adhere to the complex provisions of the tax code43 as the general partner th developer has very small ownership percentage but maintains the au thority to build and run the project on daytoday basis the investor as limited partner has large ownership percentage with an otherwise passive role typically the investor does not expect the project to produce income instead i nvestors look to the credits which will be used to offset their income tax liabilities as their return on investment the investor can also receive tax benefits related to any tax losses generated through the projects operating costs interest on its debt and deductions such as depreciation and amortization for the investors providing quity to real estate projects in exchange for the credits there is primary investment in real estate and secondary set of tax benefits the tax credits and any depreciation and or interest expense investors can be either individuals or corporations currently most lihtc investors are corporations in the initial years after the enactment of the lihtc public partnerships were th primary source of equity investment in tax credit projects in recent years the vast majority of investment has come from corporations either investing direc tly or through private partnerships44 different types of investors have diffe rent motivations for investing in tax credits according to one study investors have reported that the rate of re turn on

and manufacturing firms httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33904crs15 figure 3 below outlines the flow of the tax credits the value of the credit the rate of the credit and its actual value to investors varies contributing to the credits complicated nature the variability in value received by investors depends upon factors specific to the investor and as such the lack of consistency both adds complexity and reduces equity the rate of the credit for any particular qualifying project the credit is claimed in annual installme nts over 10year period the rate of the credit is approximately 9 for new c onstruction or 4 for eith er rehabilitation projects or federally subsidized buildings the credit rate is multiplied by the amount of the eligible basis project cost to determine the annual amount of tax credit the taxpayer can claim the annual amount of the tax cr edit is then multiplied by 10 to determine the total value of the tax credits to the ta xpayer an example of this calculation is provided below in table 1 figure 3 flow of lowincome housing tax creditshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33904crs16 47 an illustration is useful in making clear how the us treasurys rate is calculated one appears in appendix 48 us department of the treasury internal revenue service revenue ruling 20079 table 4 appropriate percentages under section 42b2 for february 2007 internal revenue bulletin 20076

years 403560 source authors calculations note this example assumes 100 of the housing units are lihtc units one of the complexities of the tax credit is that the actual tax credit rates employed are not exactly 9 and 4 and vary on monthly basis the tax credit rate is determined so that the total expected present value of the subsidy over the 10 year period is equal to 70 of the projects eligible basis or cost in the case of the 9 credit and 30 in the case of the 4 credit47 the tax credit rates are calculated and released monthly by the us treasury department the rates values are deri ved by the treasury from the mid and long term applicable federal rates used by the treasury for variety of taxrelated purposes over the years the actual 9 rate has ranged from 790 to 865 and the current rate is 811 the 4 cred it has ranged from 333 to 368 and the current rate is 34848 when an lihtc property is placed in service ready for occupancy the rate published for that particular month is the ra used to calculate the credit amount for the project this aspect of the design of the credit can create disparity between what developers expect to receive when they win the credit award and what they may actually receive when the project is placed in service for instance if project won credit award in june 2005 the credit rate at that time was 800 by the time the project is placed in service say j une 2006 the rate rose to 821 in this example the rate change is advantageous to the developer and the final credit amount allocated to the project is higher th an the amount projected at the time of the award however it is quite possible that the reverse outcome can occur and when it does the amount of tax credits the project receives is less than was budgeted at the time of award

of 52455 over 10 years is 454849 at the 421 rate the present value falls to 421044 53 the discount rate of the investor is the nimum rate of return that must be offered to attract investment the discount rate used in this analysis was derived from series of equations that are explained in appendix b of this reportdevelopers to invest in more distressed areas areas where the need is greatest for affordable housing but areas that ar among the most difficult to develop49 ddas are locations designated by the secr etary of hud as places that have high construction land and u tility costs relative to the areas median gross income50 qcts are areas designated by the secretary of hud as having high poverty relative to the overall population in particular qcts have 50 or more of households in the tract with incomes of 60 of the area dian income or less or poverty rate of at least 25 in these distressed areas the lihtc can be claimed for 130 instead of the normal 100 of the projects total cost excluding land costs this also means that available credits can be increased by up to 30 for instance if the sample project in table 1 were located in dda the tax credits per year would grow from 40356 to 5245551 at the treasurys discounted rate the present value of the 10year stream of payments at 52455 yields 91 effective present value at the investors discount rate the paymen t stream yields an 84 effective value52 some policymakers have suggested fixing the annual lihtc rate amounts at 4 and 9 to simplify administration of the prog ram and investment document preparation as well as to eliminate the uncertainty and financial risk the current floating rate system creates for deve lopers and investors effective value of the lihtc the effective value of the credit differs from the statutory value of the credit further showcasing the complexity of the credit as described earlier for qualif ied project the lihtc provides an investor with stream of tax credits over 10year peri od whose present value is equal to 70 of the projects cost assuming particul ar discount rate prescribed by law53 based on the authors calculations the discount rate associated with credit rate of 807 as used in the example from table 1 is around 330 at this rate the 10year stream of credits has present value of 70 of the projects cost but an investor may have discount rate that differs from the applicable federal rates used by the us treasury and that discount rate may be higher than the us treasury rate this difference is attribut able among other things to the greater riskiness of privatesector investments thus the inve stors actual present value of the credit stream will usually differ from 70 of the eligible project cost to illustrate given prevailing bond yields equity returns nd inflation rates 421 ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33904crs18 54 an example that clarifies how the investo rs discount rate was obtained is provided in appendix b reasonable approximation of ty pical investors discount rate54 given this rate 10year stream of payments would be valued differently by the firm than as calculated using the department of the treasurys method th numerical example provided in table 1 is continued in table 2 and indicates that the effective value of the lihtc to investors can be different when the discount rate of the investor differs from the discount rate used

and from period to period depending on the investors real discount rate and how widely it diverges from the applicable federal rates used by the treasury department to calculate the statutory credit rate each month generally the higher the investors disc ount rate compared to the federal rate the lower the effective value of the credit this variance in value adds to the complexity of the credit further compounding the complexity of the credit is the equity price that is paid for tax credits when developers trade tax credits for equity to finance their projects the tax credit is sold at discounted rate to investors typically tax credits trade for around 095 per one tax credit dollar so in the example shown in table 1 equity investors would be willing to provi 383382 403560 x 095 in cash to the developer to become owners of the project is the value to investors too high the economic analysis of the lihtc in this section focuses on one question wh at is the size of the tax benefit and thus the tax incentive the credit delivers to eligible investors discussion follows the conclusion is that the lihtc delivers tax benefit that is quite large on perproject basis specifically the lihtc reduces the cost of capital of investors by nearly 80 the cost of capital economic theory provides an analytical tool the user cost of capital that is standard method of using economic analysis to measure thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33904crs19 impact of particular tax benefits on the attr activeness of new inve stment in general the user cost of capital is the rate of return new investment must earn that is high enough to attract funds from savers given the possible lternative uses of those funds the user cost of capital is the sta ndard yardstick against which every potential corporate investment is measured in order to ascertain its worthiness the investment is considered worthy when the rate of return it w ill generate exceeds the user cost of the investment since save rs could purchase stocks or bonds from other sectors of the economy the investment under analysis must earn at least as much as the alternatives the lihtc has the effect of reducing the cost of capital for the eligible investment as result the tax benefit enables eligible projects to attract more investment funds from alternative uses than would otherwise be possible the lower the cost of capital the more investment is undertaken in the taxfavored sector the user cost of capital can be used to calculate the value of the lihtc to investors and to gauge its ability to attract more capital specifically the lihtc acts to significantly reduce the cost of capital the mathematical details of the procedure are in appendix c given set of reasonable assu mptions the user cost of capital is estimated at 750 before the lihtc is applied when the 9 lihtc is added the user cost of capital declines to 157 reduction of 7910 when the investors discount rate rise s the effective value of th tax credit falls and the user cost of capital rises the decline in user cost of capital due to the lihtc is smaller relative to lower investor di scount rates similar results though not as dramatic in terms of declines in user cost of capital occur with the 4 lihtc to gauge the degree of benefit to investors from the lihtc comparison can be made to other tax credit programs such as the investment tax credit itc for rehabilitation of structures and the historic rehabilitation tax credit hrtc the itc is equal to 10 of the am ount of qualified reha bilitation expenses and is available for certain structures the hrtc is equal to 20 of th amount of qualified rehabilitation expenditures nd is only available in conn ection with certified historic structures generally the full amount of these rehabilitation tax credits is claimed in the year in which the qualified rehabilitation expenditures are pl aced in service while the user cost of capital is reduced 791 with the lihtc the reduction caused by the itc is 117 and the reduction caused by the hrtc is 24 the policy questions that remain unanswe red are is the size of the subsidy justified if so how is it justified if not what size if any is justifiable is it possible that the value offered to lihtc investors includes exce ssive profits and if so should the program be modified furt her if the program were to be modified how should that occur is the lihtc cost effective relative to other programs the cost effectiveness of the lihtc program is typically examined in the context of housingproducti on programs as compared to housingconsumption

rose compared to vouchers lihtc production co sts were 44 higher57 other studies have confirmed that the cost of production programs outweighs the cost of voucher programs one economist examined studies of housing assistance programs and found larger exce ss costs to be associated with housing production programs relativ to voucher programs58 in particular the author stated that in the absence of distortions that lead to too little housing construction subsidies that result in the construction of additional housing will inevitably produce dwellings whose construction costs exceed

comparisons of the costs of tax credit units to other programs the total costs of the lihtc pr ogram have been criticized because lihtc projects are dependent on additional subsidie s in order to be viable62 many lihtc projects rely on debt financing from private and governme nt lenders stateissued tax credits and other federal housing assistance programs additionally tenants of lihtc are often housing voucher recipients further subsidiz ing the lihtc project estimates of the average subsidy per lihtc unit have been as high as 96 of total development costs63 advocates of the lihtc program however argue that the program is cost effective and that deep subsidies for proj ects are required because of the demands of the affordable housing market not the lihtc program64 concluding observations this report has raised issues for policy makers to consider first it is unclear whether the lack of affordable housing is caused by market failure second it is difficult to assess the question given the problems with the existing definition of affordable housing as well as the lack of available information about the stock of lowcost housing third the question of whether the lihtc adds to the housing stock is an unresolve d empirical question httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33904crs22 65 filtering refers to the process of housin g conversion either marketrate units become older and are marketed as affordable housing or owneroccupied housing is converted to rental housing some of which becomes categorized as affordable housing final form of filtering includes housing that has been withdrawn from the market and then added back most often in the form of rehabilitationdetermine affordable housing market supply and demand one of the difficulties in public policy analysis concerning the issue of affordable housing is that measures of housing affordability are not uniform and data about the number of affordable housing units across the country are not readily available it would be very useful for policy makers to know th level of affordable housing stock on an annual basis additions to the affordable housing stock occur primarily in one of two ways new construction or filtering65 subtractions from the affordable housing stock occur thr ough abandonment and subsequent demolition or upgrades to marketrate housing questions include how many new units have been placed in service how many units have been withdrawn from service what is the net gain in the affordable housing stock from these additions and subtractions how do these data vary by state and over time what kind of financing was used to build the housing if the financing of the housing requi red the units to be affordable when will the affordability requirement expire some housing analysts use the excess demand for housing as evidence of the affordability problem most often the number of households on rental housing waiting lists is cited as evidence of the affo rdable housing problem it may be helpful to policy makers to have an inventory of demand for affo rdable housing knowledge of the number of households waiting for hous ing and the tenure of their wait would help in clarifying the nature of the affordable housing market examine lihtc applicant pool one approach to resolving the questi on of whether the lihtc adds to the housing stock would be to systematically examine the lihtc applicant pool the effectiveness of the lihtc relies on the ab ility of state housing authorities to select marginal projects those project s that if not for the lihtc would not be developed therefore it would be useful to know whet her states are indeed selecting marginal products currently state housing authoritie s publish data on applicants and award winners of tax credits examining the applicants who fail to win credit awards may provide important insights do these fa iled applicants subsequently build housing without the tax credit is that housing ffordable housing or not or do applicants wait until the next round of aw ard making to reapply how many times do they re apply after some number of reapplications do develope rs simply withdraw if some type of housing inventory along the lines discussed in the previous section were to be create d determining additions to the housing stock from thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33904crs23 lihtc could be more easily discernable as lihtc units are placed in service each year data on the number of other units placed in service and withdrawn from service would provide useful informati on on net gains or losses to the affordable housing stock possible policy options this report concludes with comments about selected policy options available to the congress congress may not alter the lihtc program as tax expenditure the program does not require an appropria tion or reauthorization if the program remains unaltered it would continue essentially as an entitlement program the only change under this option is that the allocation amount s to states may increase since they are adjusted for inflation annually alternatively congress might modify the lihtc program in the 109th congress there were severa l proposals for administrative change which included renaming the credit changing the income restrictions for tenants and increasing the amount of the credit available to states more recently some ttention has focused on the issue of examining the rules of the lihtc program to determine where its compatibility with other housingfinance pr ograms can be increased other policy suggestions have included eliminating floating tax credit rates and fixing them at the 9 and 4 amounts to eliminat investment uncertainty and to reduce administrative costs policymakers have also discu ssed whether the lihtc program could be modified to target affordable housin g production for households with verylow income another option is to repeal the liht c program the congressional budget office cbo examined this option early in 2005 suggesting that the program could be phased out by repealing tax credits fo r new projects and allowing existing credits to expire the cbo report estimated that the revenue gain from this option could be as much as 4 billion between 2006 and 2010 proponents of this option argue that since housing vouchers provide housing assistance to individuals at lower cost than the lihtc then the revenue gain from repealing the lihtc could be applied to the housing voucher program opponents of this option argue that the existing suppl of affordable housing is insufficient to satisfy the demands of those with housing vouchers and thus the lihtc is necessaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33904crs24 appendix calculation of the value of the lihtc as described in the body of the report the
