divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32140federal railroad rights of way summary during the drive to settle the western portion of the united states congress sought to encourage the expansion of railr oads at first through generous grants of rights of way and lands to the great transcontinental railroads between 1862 and 1871 and later through the enactment of general right of way statute the 1875 general railroad righ t of way act permitte d railroads to obtain 200foot federal right of way by running tracks across pub lic lands some railr oads also obtained rights of way by private purchase or throug h the exercise of state or federal powers of eminent domain therefore not all railr oad rights of way are on federal lands and the property interest of railroad in right of way may vary the courts have characterized the interest held by railroad pursuant to federally granted right of way variously as limited f ee in the case of land grant right of way or as an easement in the case of right of way under the 1875 act as railroads closed rail lines questions arose as to the disposition of the lands within the former rights of way many individual instances were resolved in separate legislation in 1922 congress enacted gene ral law to provide th at federal railroad rights of way on federal lands become the property of the adjacent landowner or municipality through which the right of way passed this law is unclear in several respects for example as to what procedures are sufficient to constitute an abandonment of right of way and on what authority congress could provide for the establishment of highways within the right of way after abandonment of the rail line in 1988 in what is popularly known as the rails to trails act congress opted to bank rail corridors keeping them available for possible future use as railroads and making them available for interim use as recreational trails some cases have held that rails to trails results in takings of private property when nonfederal easements were involved in the context of federal rights of way recent cases have held that the federal government did not retain any interest in federal railroad rights of wa when the underlying lands were conveyed into private ownership and therefore if an abandoned ra il corridor is held for interim trail use compensation is owed the adjacent landowne rs however congress has legislated numerous times over the years regarding fede ral railroad rights of way as though congress believed it d continuing authority over their ultimate disposition issues may continue to arise surrounding the dis position of federal railr oad rights of way possibly involving for example the authority of congress over the rights of way the nature of the interest held by the railroad the

ch xiv 1968federal railroad rights of way introduction congress facilitated the development of railroads especially railroads in the west through various forms of federal as sistance primary among this assistance was the granting of rights of way across the public lands not all of these grants were the same but some arguably contemplated retained interest in the united states as the continued operation of certain ra ilways became less practicable and portions of rail lines were sold or closed attention increasingly turned to title issues and the nature and scope of the author ity of congress to dispose of rail corridors this report discusses the history of the federal railroad rights of wa grants the various forms such grants have taken and the provi sions congress has enacted to govern disposition of railroad rights of way this report will be updated as circumstances warrant background the middle of the nineteenth century witnessed burst of federal legislation fostering the construction of railroads in america1 many factors contributed to this legislative initiative among them the discovery of gold in california the american civil war the absence after secession of opposing votes by southern states and desire to encourage the settlement and development of the vast new western territories thereby increasing tax revenue s opening markets and providing more adequately for the defense of the west it was also felt that transcontinental rail lines could not be built without substantial federal assistance the grants some times consisted only of right of way across public lands but sometimes also included greater subsidy in the form of additional grants of land financ ial pport or both some land grants were made to states to be conveyed by them to railroad company upon completion of specified segments of line other grants were made to railroad corporations directly usually this latte r course was followed if the route was to cross territories rather than states typically in this latter instance federally chartered corporation was created by the same legislation that established the land grantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32140crs2 2 act of

governmentretained lands with the intent that the railroads would sell their lands to settlers to fi nance the railroad and the presence of the railroad would make the reta ined government lands mo re valuable other non transcontinental railroads also received federal gr ants to begin operation by the time the fourth transcontinenta l line was authorized in 1871 vehement opposition was developing to th railroads that only few short years before had received enthusiastic support as one hist orian put it when the west saw evidence that railroads were not prompt in bringing their lands on the market and putting them into the hands of farm makers the west turned from warm friendship to outright hostility to railroads6 this hostility was reflected in cessation of congressional land grants to railroads7 congress did however wish to tinue to encourage the expansion of railroads across the western lands special acts continued to be passed that granted right of way through the public lands of the united states to designated railroads but this piecemeal approach was burdensom in 1875 congress enacted statute known as the general railway right of way act grrwa8 that granted right of way two hundred feet wide across public lands and as codified at 43 usc 934 states in pertinent part the right of way through the public lands of the united states is granted to any railroad company duly

the federal government none by contrast in those instances in which the right of way was obtained by an exercise of the federal power of eminent domain one would have to examine the partic ular authority for that exercise and also the particular condemnation pro ceedings to determine the scope and c onditions of the title the railroad obtained this report does not address privatel yowned railroad rights of way but discusses railroad rights of way granted by the federal g overnment either as part of land grant or under the 1875 right of way statute legal nature of rights of way the courts have interpreted the right of way interests conve yed to railroads in various ways and it has become increasin gly difficult to reconcile the sequence of congressional enactments and judicial holdi ngs into coherent body of law complete review of the extensive enactment s litigation and interp retations is beyond the scope of this report but some of the principal cas and issues are set out the supreme court has said that pre 1871 right of way granted to land grant railroad was limited fee9 while the right of way granted under the 1875 statute was an easement10 more recent cases seem to indicate that the terminology may not be of vital importance the significance of the terms used depends on the context in which an inquiry arises11 however the rail banking provisions of the rails to trails act discussed below have again resulted in focus on the exact nature of the right of way interest and the authority of congress over rail corridors to encourage settlement of the west congress not only enacted railroad rights of way grants but also statutes that authoriz ed the conveyance of lands to private citizens the railroads crossed these lands and whethe r the banking of the rail corridors once trains longer operate results in taking of private property for which compensation is owed under the 5th amendment to the constitution has been addressed in several recent cases discussed later in this report review of property law rms may be helpful usually when land is granted to another owner the conveyance is complete and final if th interest conveyed is complete and includes all rights associated with the property it is fee simple ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32140crs4 12 united states v northern paci fic railway co 256 us 51 1921is possible however to convey less than ll property rights or to convey title to grantee so that title may revert to the grantor in some circumstances if the interest conveyed is only the right to use the land of another for particular purpose such as the right to cross the land of another the interest is an easement there can be gradation of interests between fee title and an easement depending on the exclusivity of possession granted the duration of the interest granted and the completeness of the rights granted right of way intere st may be structured and conveyed in such manner that the grantor retains reversionary interest in the property which means that the property may in some circumstances revert to the grantor fee grant may be made so that it continues only so long as some use or circumstance continues and if that use or circumstance ceases then title reverts automatically to the grantor this is called determinable grant or fee grant may be interpreted as being made on the condition that if x occurs then the grantor may reenter the property and title may revert to the grantor this is called grant on condition subsequent both of these could be characterized as limited fees since they are less than full fee title the principal difference between these two types of grants is that in the former instance action on the part of the grantor is necessary to reassert title title reverts by action of law as soon as the envisioned use or circumstance ceas in contrast if the grant is deemed to be grant on condition subsequent the grantor must take some action to reassert title upon the breach or fulfillment of the condition depending on whether the grant and condition were worded positively or negatively this action usually takes the form of judicial proceeding to determine that the terms of the condition have in fact been met or breached if the right of way is mere easemen t at common law when the easement use ceases the easement simply disappears and the servient estate the land burdened by the easement longer is so burdened therefore it usually is not technically correct to speak of reversionary interest in connection with common law easement however art iv 3 cl 2 of the constitution gives congress the power to dispose of and make all needful rules nd regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the united states when congress grants property interest the grant is both grant of prope rty and law and congress is free to specify terms or elements different from those that otherwise woul d apply either by virtue of the common law or in other statut this fact seems to have been lost in some of the discussions of congressional railroad grants railroad grant may also be both grant of property interest and contractual agreement between the federal government and the railroad12 one of the earlier cases in which the supreme court considered the title taken by landgrant railroad was schulenberg v harriman in 1874 in which the court said

granted lands to the railroad in question the court found the interests grante d to the railroad to be fee on condition and that breach could only be asserted by the government as grantor in this respect the court clearly distinguished between wh at could happen at common law where the two private parties were involved from these congressionally created property interests where one party wa s the sovereign government and must enforce the terms of the property grant either by judicial proceedings or by legislative assertion that was the equivalent the mode of asserting or of resuming the forfeited grant is subject to the legislative authority of the government14 another early case interpreted land grant railroad right of way as limited fee made on an implied condition of reverter in the event that the company ceased to use the land for railroad purposes15 in this case the court also said express provision for forfeiture was required to fi x the rights of the government if an estate be granted upon condition subse quent express words of forfeiture or reinvestiture of title are necessary to aut horize the grantor to reenter in case of breach of such conditions16 it is important to note that this case involved private persons who had been patented lands over which the train tracks ran and the court voided those patents on the ground that they could not convey the block of lands they purported to convey due to the fact that th railroad held limited f ee title to the right of way strip of land in 1875 congress approved the general railroad right of way grant grrwa using the same language as in some of the landgrant rights of way grants the right of way through the public lands of the united states is hereby granted to any railroad company 17 the supreme court held in great northern railway co v united states that this language clearly granted only surface easement rather than the strip of land right of way18 in reaching this conclusi on the court looked to other language of grrwa to administrative interpretations and to subsequent enactments by congress that referred to th easements given by the 1875 act the court pointed to 4 of the act as especially persuasive in that it states that once each right of way is noted on plats in the local land office thereafte r all such lands over which such right of way sha ll pass shall be disposed of subject to the right of way emphasis added apter words to indicat the intent to convey an easement would be difficult to find19 as will be discussed however it is possible that congress did not intend by this language to relinquish its authority over the ultimate disposition of the rail corridorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32140crs6 20 id at 280 21 united states v union pacifi c railroad co 353 us 112

estate evidence of title in the united states was introduced but the court allowed the parties to stipulate that the united states has retained title to certain tracts of land over which petitioners right of way passes 20 this stipulation avoided resolution of issues involving the possible rights of adjacent landowners or the nature of possible retained authority of congress in another case in which the government sued to enjoin railroad company from drilling for oil and gas on the landgrant right of way granted it by the government the supreme court ruled that the right of way grant did not include mineral rights because of other language in the act that excepted out mineral lands language the court held applied to the entire statut and not just to grants of lands21 in reviewing the limited fee cases the court said that th most such cases decided was that the railroads received all surface rights to the right of way and all rights incident to use for railroad purposes this case has sometimes been regarded as holding that even landgrant rights of way were merely easements but in fact the court held only that the grant did not give the mineral rights to the owner of the right of way because nothing passed except what was conveyed in clear language the grants were construed favorably to the government with doubts resolved in favor of the government and oil and gas development was not within the railroad purposes of the right of way nevertheless the supreme c ourt did strongly sugge st that all railroad rights of way were easements although the courts have struggl ed at times to articulate the nature and scope of the interest held by railroad the cases are clear that the right of way interest whether limited fee or easement is conditi oned on the

property acquired from the united states neither full fee title nor any retained interest of the united states c ould be conveyed under such reasoning the railroad must continue to use the right of way for railroad purposes or if that use ceased the railroad could not convey the centr core in addition if the railroad were legally abandoned the public high way exception in section 912 would still

exactly paralleled some common law property interest such as an easement how can congress make an alternative disposition of the underlying lands other than that which w ould otherwise apply at common

examined whether the retention of nonoperating railroad rights of way for use as recreational trails constitutes taking entitling the landowners to just compensation under the 5th amendment to the constitution with respect to some privat ely granted rights of way the supreme court in preseault held that the law was constitu tional because the tucker act52 provided an avenue to obtain co mpensation if any were owed53 subsequent case involving the same plaintiffs held that compensable taking had occurred but that not every exercise of authority by the ited states under the rails to trails act would necessarily result in compensable takings the preseault cases involved private feetitle landowners whose predece ssors had sold an easement for railroad purposes to railroad

the 1988 statutory change concluded that despite the absence of an explicit reservation of interest the federal government di d retain an implied interest wh it patented conveyed title to lands crossed by federal ra ilroad easements into private ownership such that the retention of the rights of way for interim use as trails was not taking when public highway was established under state law55 more recent cases have held the opposite56 there has not yet been supreme c ourt ruling in the federal right of way context in the hash case57 landowners brought class ac tion challenging conversion of railroad right of way across their lands to recreational trail the federal district court for idaho found taking and plain tiffs appealed the lowercourt decision was vacated and remanded in light of an idaho supreme court decision the right of way in question was granted under th 1875 grrwa and the landowners argued that under the reasoning of preseault the application of the trails act after abandonment of railway use prevented the railroad easement from reverting to the owners of the servient and entitled them to compen sation this claim required the court to ascertain whether the federal right of way was an easement and the claimant landowners owned th underlying estate or whether the underlying estate never left ownership by the united states or whether the estate was deeded in fee to the railroad there were various categorie s of landowners but for purposes of this report we shall address only those who obtained title to their lands from the federal government after the establishment of the railroad right of way thereby raising the question of what 4 of the grrwa mean s when it states that subsequent land owners take subject to the right of way the court in hash noted the previous cases that had held that the 1875 statute granted only easements and further noted that the united states had failed to expressly reserve any interest to itself wh conveying lands to homesteaders except that settlers took lands subject to the railroa d right of way w have been directed to suggestion in any land patent deed st atute regulation or legislative history that can reasonably be construed to mean that the united states silently retained the fee to the land traversed by the rightofway when the united states granted that land to homesteaders58 similarly the court did not find that language directing the railroads to share their rights of way w ith highways under either 43 usc 912 or 913 mandated the conclusion th at the united states had retained the fee to the landhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32140crs15 59 265 neb 472 658 nw 2d 258 264 neb 2003 citing brown v state 924 p 2d at 917underlying the right of way after land pate nts including that land were granted to private persons similarly the court f ound that 913 that authorizes highways within the right of way for up to year after abandonment does not weaken the position of the landowners because it required that the rights of the united states be conveyed to the private owner however this reasoning arguably does not adequately take into account the fact that if the united states could validly legislate regarding the oneyear window for the blishment of the highways congress must have had some interest in the right of way as discussed above with respect to the statutes validating railroa d right of way conveyances congress has repeatedly enacted statutes premised on some legislative or proprietary interest over termination of the rights of way similarly the court stated that the stat ute requires the united states to convey any rights it has in the right of way and th at the statute does not indicate what rights the united states had however the statute actually directs that all right title and interest of the united states be conveyed except for highways within the year after abandonment all is not an equivocal wo rd as any is and arguably may indicate that congress believed there was such right or interest held by the united states the beres case also involved an 1875 right of way and the court of federal claims held that the right of way granted only an easement so that when the right of way was longer used for railroad purposes the easement was lifted and property interest reverted to the united states when the underlying lands were patented the court held the government gave up all its in terest in the land including any reversionary interest this case ag ain did not take into account the years of enactments by congress premised upon some re tained interest or authority over the rights of way nor the language of 913 that on its face makes disposition different from that which would pertain if the right of way were an easement at common law the government in beres again argued that the united states had retained some interest in the railroad rights of way quoting from whipps land cattle co v level 3 communications llc in which the nebraska supreme court stated that while the vocabulary of the common law of real property is often imported into the discussion of railroad rightsofway where those rightsofway have been created by federal law they are entirely creatures of federal statute and th eir scope and duration are determined not by common law princi ples but by the relevant statutory provisions59 the government argued that even if the 1875 act were an easement congress in the 1922 act had affirmed its understanding that the united states had reversionary interest in the rights of way even where the whole of the land traversed had subsequently been patented however the discussion by both the government attorneys and the court devolved into an attempt to fit the various congressional actions into some traditional property interest the court stated the i ssue as being whether the 1988 legislation can have retroactive effect on the transfer of land rights which occurred years earlier the 1875 act appeared to the court to have int entionally omitted anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32140crs16 60 the court in the preseault case before the federal circuit had reasoned that the private grant of the easement in that case had not contemplated recreational use of the narrow railroad right of way granted however in the ca of federal rights of way it is the grantor congress who later said that certain interim uses of the railroad corridor it had previously granted could be made an enactment that ar guably sheds light on the scope of the original interest granted 61 united states v union pacifi c railroad co 353 us 112 118 1957words to create reversionary right in the united states in grants of railroad rights of way especially in light of the clar ifying legislation in the 1922 act which specifically addressed the issue an argument can be made that all elements of the courts reasoning miss the mark in that what land rights might have been transf erred years earlier is part of the question it is possible that the 1875 ac t did not need to expressly create reversionary right in the united states and the 1922 act itself arguably reflects congress continuing belief th at it had the power to dispose of part of the right of way in manner different from wh at would pertain at common law60 under art iv 3 of the constitu tion congress has the authority to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belongin g to the united states perhaps an avenue by which the enactme nts to date can be reconciled is the possibility that congress actions were premised on its authority to legislate regarding the ultimate disposal of the rights of way and that this continuing authority over termination and disposition was an intrinsic part of both the railroad rights of way and the land titles homesteader s and others received when title was patented subject to the right of way this rete ntion of disposal authority makes sense of congress repeated and consistent actments and accompanying committee reports regarding its reversionary interest in the rights of way perhaps congress was using that term to indicate its reserved authority to articulate the disposition of the rights of way upon termination of rail service as one court said when commenting on congress imprecise choice of words re garding another aspect of railroad land grants yet it will not do for us to tell the congress we see what you were driving at but you did not use choice wo rds to describe your purpose61 perhaps many of the recurring difficulties could be resolved if the courts focused less on contradictory propertytitle words and more on the inte nt of congress evident from decades of congressional enactments including the 1922 act premised on congress continuing authority to specify disposition of terminating federal rights of way there is analogous precedent for this pproach in the navigational servitude context in which the government may sometimes take priv ate property without compensation being owed under the 5th amendment over the years the rationale for this result has been articulated either as an navigational easement of some sort implicitly reserved to the government ie property interest or as constitutional authority of the government that is always part of all property conveyances and hence compensation is owed when it is exercised

derives from the fact that the property damage results from the lawful ex ercise of power to which the property has always been subject62 most recently this concept might be worded that the power of the government to take prope rty for navigation purposes is background principle applicable to ll title and hence compensation is owed because the owner never had property in terest not subject to that limiting background principle of property law63 similarly the argument can be made that because congress has the plenary power under art iv of the constitution to provide for the regulation and disposal of the property of the united states the power to control the ultimate disposal of federal rights of way was part of the right of way title the railroads took and of the title homesteaders received to lands subject to the railroad right of way arguably if congress made an alternative disposition of the lands befo re the conditions were met that would have fully vested private title under the 1922 act compensation would be owed congress could of course gi ve up this authority but arguably it must be clear that it has done so again in the context of the navigational servitude such waiver will not be implied but instead must be surrendered in unmistakable terms64 and conferral by congress of title to streambed does not without more waive applicability of the navigational servitude65 whether the courts will consider such an argument of course is not yet clear however the cases to date do not seem to have adequately taken into account the numerous enactments by congress over the last 100 years in which congress has legislated regarding disposition of federal railroad ri ghts of way httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32140crs18 conclusion the legal status of land within any pa rticular right of way depends on the interest held by railroad or landowner the general and par ticular applicable statutes and the facts of particular sequence of conveyances although congress has on many occasions addressed th disposition of railroad righ ts of way controversies may be expected to continue to arise because of issues as to the nature and scope of congress authority over the rights of way th nature and scope of the interest of the railroad the validity of attempts by the railroa d to convey all or part of that interest ambiguities associated with dating ab andonment disputes between adjacent landowners over perceived entitle ments to lands within ri ght of way and assertions that compensation is owed congress s from time to time legitimized conveyances that otherwise would be invalid and in other legislation has permitted certain general types of conveyances in particular the conversion of federal rail corridors to recreational use under the rails to trails legislation ma occasion further litigation as to the interests held by the united states and those of adjacent landowners
