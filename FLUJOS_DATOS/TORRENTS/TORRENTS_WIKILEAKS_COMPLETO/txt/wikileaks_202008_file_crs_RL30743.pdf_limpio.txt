senators consider desirable committee assignments priority the key to securing favorable committee slots is often said to be targeting committee seats that match the legislators skills expertise and policy concerns after general elections are over one of the first orders of business for senate leaders is setting the sizes and ratios of committees although the size of each standing committee is set in senate rules changes in these sizes often result from interparty negotiations before each new congress senate party leaders also negotiate the party ratios on standing committees determinations of sizes and ratios usually are made before the process of assigning senators to committees once sizes and ratios of standing committees are determined panel for each party nominates colleagues for committee assignments senate republicans primarily use committee on committees for this purpose although the republi can leader nominates senators for assignment to some standing committees senate democrats use steering and outreach committee to nominate democrats for assignment to all standing committees the processes these panels use are distinct republicans rely on seniority formula to make nominations while democrats make nominations on seatbyseat basis considering variety of factors the processes also have many common features after the general election each panel solicits preferences for committee assignment from party colleagues then matches these preferences with vacancies on standing committees senate rules along with party rules and practices guide the work of the committee on committees and the steering and outreach committee senate rules for instance divide the standing and other senate committees into three groups the socalled b and c categories senators must serve on two committees and may serve on one b committee and any number of c committees exceptions to these restrictions are sometimes approved by the senate both parties place further limitations for example by generally prohibiting two senators from the same party and state from serving on the same committee the nominations of each of these panels require the approval of the pertinent full party conference and ultimately the senate approval at both stages usually is granted easily because of the debate and decisionmaking earlier in the process specific rules regarding senate membership on and appointments to nonstanding committees vary from committee to committee but party leaders usually are included in the process for more information on senate and party rules governing assignment

committees although the size of each committee is set in senate rules changes to these rules often result from interparty negotiations before each congress sena party leaders also negotiate the party ratio of each committee during the discussions of committee size senate rules call for the election of senators to standing committees by the entire membership of the chamber senate rule xxiv paragraph 1 states in the appointment of the standing committees or to fill vacancies thereon the senate unless otherwise ordered shall by resolution appoint the chairman of each such committee and the other members thereof1 these elections are based on nominations made by the parties but senators do not officially take seats on committees until they are elected by the entire senate while senate rules are fairly clear regarding how nominations are to be approved they do not address how the nominations of senators to committees are to be made in practice each party vests its conference with the authority to make nominations to standing committees senate republicans primarily use committee on committees for this purpose although the republican leader nominates senators for assignment to so standing committees senate democrats use steering and outreach committee to nominate democrats for assignment to all standing committees the processes these two panels use are distinct but the nominations of each panel require the approval of the full party conference and ultimately the senate senate approval of the committee nominations of its parties usually is pro forma because the senate respects the work of each party it has been customary for thirdparty and independent senators to caucus with one of the major parties at least for committee assignment purposes such senator is considered member of that conference and receives his or her committee assignments from that conference through its regular processes

list the jurisdiction of each committee within their jurisdictions the standing committees consider bills and issues recommend measures for consideration by the senate and conduct oversight of agencies programs and activities most standing committees recommend authorized levels of funds for government operations and for new and existing programs within their jurisdiction the term nonstanding committee is used here to describe joint committees and select special and other senate committees congress currently has four joint committees that are permanent and that conduct studies or perform housekeeping tasks rather than consider legislation members 1 us congress senate standing rules of the senate revised to april 27 2000 sdoc 10615 106th cong 2nd sess washington gpo 1999 p

assignment of senators to conference committees temporary joint committees formed to resolve differences in house and senatepassed versions of measure is not addressed by this report on occasion the senate has created select special and other committees sometimes such panels are created for short time to complete specific task as in the case of the special committee to investigate whitewater development corporation and related matters the committee was created on may 17 1995 and expired on june 17 1996 select special and other committees have sometimes existed for many years some like the special committee on aging conduct studies and investigations others such as the select committee on intelligence have legislative jurisdiction meaning they consider measures and recommend them for

standing committee sizes and ratios are set it then identifies the classification of committees the senate uses for assignment purposes and the chamber limitations on committee service it next describes the procedures that each party uses to recommend senators for assignment to standing committees and how the full chamber approves these recommendations finally it summarizes the processes used to appoint senators to nonstanding committees the report does not address how committee chairs and ranking minority members are selected or how subcommittee members and leaders are chosen

the senate is the setting of standing committee ratios and sizes committee ratios and sizes usually are set simultaneously because of their interrelationship these determinations usually are made before assigning senators to standing committees because the party organizations that make committee assignments need to know the numbers of seats available to each party on each committee the determination of ratios and sizes sometimes is made with an awareness of senators specific desires for seats on particular panels the ratio of republicans to democrats on each standing committee usually is determined at early organization meetings held in the interval between the general election and the beginning of congress since the rules of the chamber do not contain provisions regarding committee ratios generally the majority party possesses the potential to set them unilaterally in practice however ratios generally are set after negotiation between leaders of the two parties committee ratios usually parallel the overall party ratio in the senate with each party occupying percentage of seats on all committees consistent with the percentage of seats it has in the senate senate rule xxv sets out the number of senators allowed on each committee however these committee sizes typically are amended at the beginning of congress through senate approval of one or more resolutions under senate rules the majority and minority leaders may agree to adjust temporarily the size of one or more standing committees by up to two members to accord

membership of every standing committee working majority in many cases however amendments to committee sizes are made to accommodate the interests and needs of senators in serving on committees these amendments and therefore committee sizes are usually the product of consultation between the party leaders the sizes of standing committees normally differ in the 109th congress the senate standing committees ranged from 13 to 28 members committees with broader jurisdictions generally are larger than those whose jurisdiction is more narrowly defined committees considered more prestigious or otherwise soughtafter also tend to be larger the senate select committee on ethics has an equal party ratio pursuant to the resolution which created the panel

into categories for purposes of assigning all senators to committees in particular rule xxv paragraphs 2 and 3 establish the categories of committees popularly called the b and c committees the and b categories are as follows 2 committees agriculture nutrition and forestry appropriations armed services banking housing and urban affairs commerce science and transportation energy and natural resources environment and public works finance foreign relations health education labor and pensions homeland security and governmental affairs judiciary select committee on intelligence b committees

committee on ethics the committee on indian affairs and the joint committee on taxation3 the joint committee on the library and the joint committee on printing are not listed in any category but are treated as c committees for assignment purposes rule xxv paragraph 4 places restrictions on senators committee membership based on these categories the restrictions are intended to treat senators equitably in the assignment process essentially each senator is limited to service on two of the committees and one of the b committees service on c committees is unrestricted exceptions to the restrictions are recommended by the pertinent party conference and then officially authorized through senate approval of resolution affecting one or more senators sometimes these exceptions are authorized to accord the majority party working majority on committee whereas at other times exceptions are made to accommodate the preferences and needs of individual senators

and the republican leader nominate republican senators for committee assignments second these recommendations are submitted for approval to the republican conference the organization of all republican senators third the recommendations are incorporated into one or more senate resolutions and approved by the full senate

conference subject to confirmation by the republican conference the size of the committee on committees fluctuates from congress to congress in recent congresses it consisted of nine members including the majority leader who served on the committee exofficio and did not chair the panel the committee on committees is relatively small in part because it relies on seniority formula in assigning both returning and newly elected republican senators the formula makes the assignment process somewhat automatic the absence of significant debate and voting thus requires comparatively few members under republican conference rules the committee on committees nominates republicans for assignment to all category committees as well as to the committee on rules and administration according to conference rule v nominations for assignment to other committees are made by the republican leader unless otherwise specified by law in practice the republican leader also has nominated members to serve on the committee on rules and administration 3 the committee on indian affairs is not standing committee although the senate dropped the term select from its title in 1993

republican senators are asked to submit their committee assignment preferences to the committee on committees the committee prefers that these requests be listed in order of priority it is considered useful for new republican senators to consult with party leaders and the chairs or ranking members of desired committees to assess the likelihood of receiving desired assignment under the seniority system used by senate republicans for example freshman is likely to have more success if his or her first choice is not committee seat desired by an incumbent or more senior freshman informing party and committee leaders of ones committee preferences also acts to alert them to ones substantive policy interests in december or january following the general election the committee on committees first meets to nominate senators to committees senate rule xxv as described above sets out the rules and restrictions that guide the committee in distributing standing committee seats the republican conference has established additional rules and guidelines that govern the procedures of the committee on committees one such rule generally prohibits any republican from serving on more than one of the super or big four category committees appropriations armed services finance and foreign relations 4 conference rules also generally prohibit two republican senators from the same state from serving on the same panel5 republicans usually nominate senators to committees before filling vacancies on other committees the seniority formula used by the committee on committees in making assignment nominations is as follows first in order of seni ority in the chamber each incumbent chooses two committee assignments incumbents may decide to retain current committee seats or choose among existing vacancies however senator who has served on committee and lost seat due to change in the party ratio has priority over any and all senators to claim the first vacancy on the committee while such instances have been rare they have occurred when party control of the senate has changed second each newly elected senator chooses seats in order of seniority based on previous service in the senate previous service in the us house of representatives and length of service in the house and previous service as state governor 6 ties in seniority of freshmen are broken by draw in addition every newly elected senator rece ives one assignment before any newly elected senator receives second assignment the republican leader has the authority to appoint half of all vacancies on each committee if there is an odd number of vacancies the leader can appoint half plus one of all vacancies effective in the 108th congress all republican members ar offered two committee slots in order of seniority each member can retain only one b committee assignment from the previous congress following this process the republican leader makes any remaining committee assignments 4 senate republican

senators to choose among assignment options presented by the committee on committees if senator is presented with selection options before noon on given day the senator should notify the committee on committees of his or her decision by the close of business on that day if senator is presented with selection options after noon on particular day then decision should be made by noon on the next business day this provision is designed to expedite the assignment process by preventing senators from engaging in lengthy deliberation that could delay the assignment of senators with less seniority rank on each committee generally is determined by length of continuous service on the committee if senator leaves committee and returns in subsequent congress the senator likely would lose his or her previous seniority however the chair or ranking member of committee need not be the member with the longest committee service 7 while nominations for assignment to nona committees except officially rules and administration are at the discretion of the republican leader the leader generally follows the seniority formula used by the committee on committees moreover the leader usually works in close cooperation with the chair and other members of the committee on committees through this system the assignment process is relatively consensusoriented and automatic and formal votes on nominees usually are not necessary in assigning freshmen the committee on committees does not consider the multiple factors relied upon by the senate democrats party organization discussed below instead the most important factor appears to be senators requests personal efforts to compete for committee seats appear to be minimal though not unknown as compared with senate democrats

recommendations by unanimous consent presumably because they are based largely on seniority once accepted by the republican conference the assignment recommendations are packaged into one or more senate resolutions that are submitted to the full senate for approval usually by the republican leader because the resolutions are privileged they can be brought up at any time these resolutions are amendable and any senator may demand separate vote on the appointment of the chair or on the other members of standing committee however the resolutions usually are adopted without incident 8 nominations rarely are challenged on the floor 7 under republican conference rules at the beginning of each congress the republican members of each committee choose their chair or ranking member conference confirmation is then sought by separate secret written ballot 8 there are two techniques that senators might use to change committee assignments first they might offer an amendment to the resolution that strikes and inserts senators names from the committee roster second they might offer motion to amend the rules of the senate and expand the size of standing committee such motion to amend the rules requires notice in writing of one legislative day ie the motion cannot be brought up after the notice until an adjournment of the senate if the change is adopted then senators can amend the resolution containing assignment nominations to insert the preferred names both of these techniques were used occasionally in earlier times the continued

nominations for committee assignments the second consists of approval of the nominations by the democratic conference which comprises all democrats in the senate the final step is for the assignment

republicans g22g145g142g561g16g152g150g146g151g138g157g146g152g151g561g18g155g152g140g142g156g156g561 the size of the steering and outreach committee is set by the democratic conference the democratic

four regions the steering and outreach committee continues from congress to congress appointing democratic senators to vacancies as they arise in the 109th congress the steering and outreach committee had 18 members including the democratic leader the democratic whip the chief deputy democratic whip and deputy democratic whip while it is not composed exclusively of the most senior democrats the steering and outreach committee includes many committee ranking members once elected to the senate it is customary for new democratic senators to communicate committee preferences to the steering and outreach committee while the democratic leader and the steering and outreach committee chair generally solicit committee preferences from new senators incumbents desiring to switch committees usually initiate contact democrats are encouraged to submit their requests for assignment as early as possible senator who delays risks the potential of not securing primary or even secondary requests while the steering and outreach committee does not require senators to rank order their assignment preferences many have done so in the past to give the committee altern atives if it is unable to grant initial requests it appears to be important for senatorselect in formulating their preferences to consult with party leaders steering and outreach committee members and the chairs or ranking members of preferred committees this consultation acts bot h to notify senior senators of freshmans substantive interests and to inform the freshman senator of the likelihood that he or she will be assigned to preferred committees the steering and outreach committee organizes and begins the process of making committee assignments in november or december following the general election unlike its senate republican counterpart the committee nominates senators for assignment to every standing committee given that most returning senators choose to retain their assignments from the previous congress most of the committees work involves matching freshman democrats with vacancies created by retirement or electoral defeat as well as by adjustments in committee sizes and ratios in making nominations for committee assignments the steering and outreach committee is bound by the categories of committees and the limitations on committee assignments contained in senate rule xxv discussed earlier within the confines of these restrictions the democratic conference has formulated additional restricti ons for its own members one such restriction generally limits each senator to service on more than one of the super or big four committees appropriations armed services finance and foreign relations senate democrats also have an informal practice of prohibiting two democratic senators from the same state from serving on the same committee in addition to these chamber and party restrictions the steering and outreach committee considers many factors these include senators preferences state demographics length of time since the state was last represented on the committee perceived willingness to support the party policy views and personal and occupational backgrounds personal intervention by the requesting senator or another senator is sometimes helpful the steering and outreach committee usually fills vacancies on committees before slots on other panels because the steering and outreach committee does not rely on seniority formula in assigning senators its process is relatively less automatic than that of senate republicans for democrats there are rules guaranteeing priority in assignment to incumbents switching httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30743g5g152g150g150g146g157g157 g142g142g561g3g156g156g146g144g151g150g142g151g157g561g18g155g152g140 g142g156

assignments however senator who served on committee but lost the seat due to change in the party ratio generally receives priority in assignment to vacancy on that committee nominations for assignment are made on seatbyseat basis and steering and outreach members usually make nominations by consensus however if significant competition exists for particular seat then secret balloting usually is conducted and the majorityvote winner is granted the nomination senators who do not win election to their most preferred committee seat are protected by the johnson rule providing that all democrats are appointed to one committee before any senator receives second assignment 9 rank on each committee generally is determined by length of continuous service on the committee if senator leaves committee and returns to it in subsequent congress the senator likely would lose his or her previous seniority however the ranking member or chair need not be the member with the longest committee service the committee rankings of senators assigned to committee at the same time generally are determined by their seniority in their party in the senate when an incumbent and freshman are assigned to committee at the same time the incumbent ordinarily ranks higher than the freshman similarly when elected each freshman is given seniority ranking among senate democrats and his or her rank on committees is based on this overall chamber ranking
