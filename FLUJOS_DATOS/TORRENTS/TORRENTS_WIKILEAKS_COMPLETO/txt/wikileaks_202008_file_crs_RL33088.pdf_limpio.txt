katrina updated october 23 2006 jane g gravelle senior specialist in economic policy government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33088tax policy options after hurricane katrina summary the damage from hurricane katrina raised at least four issues that might be addressed by tax policy the first issue was that the effect of the disaster particularly given the potential impact on energy prices might contract the overall economy suggesting some need for fiscal stimulus the administrati on indicated that it would not propose tax cut but supports making the existing ta x cuts permanent congress acted by appropriating 623 billion in direct assistan ce followed by 62 billion in tax relief preliminary indications were that the effect of the hurricane on the national economy would be limited and in subsequent weeks the economy has resumed its growth path if congress determined that an immediate stimulus were needed timing would be an important factor relying solely on tax cuts rather than spending or monetary stimulus raises issues related to timely delivery and the spending of those funds making the tax cuts perman ent is unlikely to have much stimulative effect in the short term since the tax cu ts do not in general expire until 2011 and there would be immediate effect on disposable income second issue was whether the rise in energy prices should be addressed by some redistribution from energy producers to consumers or some general relief an initial proposal to suspend the gasoline tax w ould not have been expected to have an effect on prices in the short run due to the market mechanism allocating supply income tax rebates coul d be used to target benefits to poor people but this approach would also face administrative difficulties proposals have been made for windfall profits tax which has some historical precedence but the tax is difficult to administer third issue was whether tax measures mig ht be used to provide relief for the victims in general tax benefits cannot easily be targeted to lowerincome individuals who have little or tax liability there are some current tax provisions and administrative actions already provi ding some relief hr 3768 provided additional benefits to help with cash flow employme nt housing and tax compliance issues of the victims as well as incentives to increase charitable giving while some of these proposals would aid the victims or at least those who have tax liability the tax benefits for charitable giving in the senate bill would have been unlikely to do so the final legislation included more focused charitable provisions fourth issue is what role tax subsidies might play in the longerterm rebuilding of the area and such incentives are in hr 4440 and s 2020 this legislation was enacted in december of 2005 geographically targeted subsidies exist in the current tax law for economically depressed areas and were enacted for lower manhattan after the 2001 terrorist attacks empi rical evidence suggests that these incentives might not be very effective in speeding up or increasing the degree of rebuilding but they may be desirable as part of the means of compensating victims for catastrophic losses this report w ill be updated to re flect legislative developmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33088contents t x c u t s n d f i s c l p l i c i s s u s 1 p r v i d i n g r l i f f r m h i g h f u l

hurricane katrina relief by jennifer lake and ralph chite for discussiontax policy options after hurricane katrina the damage from hurricane katrina raised at least four issues that might be addressed by tax policy th is report provides an overvie w beginning with national issues and then addressing local issues the first issue was that the effect of the disaster particularly given the potential impact on energy prices might contract the overall economy suggesting some need for shortterm fiscal stimulus related nationwide fiscal policy concern was that the loss of income and the taxes on that income and the increased spending would increase the budget deficit and debt nd worsen pressures on the budget from variety of factors such as the iraq war and the need to address issues such as the alternative minimum tax second issue was whether the rise in energy prices should be addressed by some redistribution from energy producers to consumers or some general relief third was whethe r or not tax measures might be used to provide relief for the victims the last section of this report discusses the role that tax subsidies might play in the longerterm rebuilding of the area in the time that has passed since the disaster some of these issues have been resolved in part the economy has continue d to expand through the third quarter and forecasts are generally for 35 growth ra during the year gasoline prices which rose sharply have since moderated sign ificantly although winter fuel costs were high most of the legislative response to the di saster has been through spending in the region with 623 billion in s upplemental appropriations1 there has been fiscal stimulus bill directed at overall national economic performance congress passed tax relief bill hr 3768 of 61 billion over ten years and hr 4440 bill containing tax provisions to encourage rebuilding tax cuts and fiscal policy issues hurricane katrina had devastating effects in areas of louisiana mississippi and alabama it also had effects on the ove rall economy these effects arise from two sources from the direct losses in the ar ea and from possible supply effects for the economy as whole mainly fuel costs the extent to which hurricane katrina might adversely affect the overa ll national economy thus depe nded significantly on how energy issues were resolved the loss of property from the disaster per

econo mic contractions that might be addressed by fiscal stimulus many residents of the affected region are displaced from their jobs an option to address this problem would be to provide direct spending or regionally focused benefits in the area of impact and the area that is housing refugees to return these workers to their jobs lingering unemployment in the area will be offset in part by increased demand for workers due to the rebuilding efforts indeed current problem in new orleans is that labor shor tage has developed in part because of the lack of housing pressure on energy prices was concern an initial release by the congressional budget office cbo how ever indicated that the outlook was becoming somewhat more positive as the energy infrastructure was being restored2 this study estimated sma ll onetime reduction in economic output and temporary slowing of growth but not recession with growth projected to turn up in the first half of 2006 as rebuilding resumes thes losses are relatively small because the production in the affected area is small compared to the us economy and because of the expected resolution of the energy shock3 subsequent events support this outlook energy prices moderated the economy continued to grow and while the unemployment rate rose slightly in septem ber of 2005 it declined in october and has since fallen slightly more the internal revenue service irs initially had undertaken some administrative actions that might ease the fuel situation and some regulatory changes and release of oil from the strategic reserve have also occurred these administrative actions included allowing the sale of dyed diesel fuel for highway use normally reserved for offroad or tax ex empt use suspending the tax penalty on failure to meet sulphur content regulations if the epa waives the requirements and allowing highway vehicles to remove avia tion fuel from tax favored airport fueling terminals for certain airports in new or leans memphis dallas and houston the irs and treasury had also announced that transporting fuel from the strategic oil reserve will not disqualify shipping operations for exemption from us income tax under treaty agreements federal spending already authorized or proposed cons tituted regionally concentrated stimulus as for broader tax policy treasury secretary snow indicated on september 2 that the administration woul d not propose tax cut to stimulate the economy rather it continued to propos that congress make the 2001 tax cuts permanent arguing that this change would increase confidence in

see crs report rs21126 tax cuts and economic stimulus how effective are the alternatives by jane gravelle for further discussion of the savings and spending behavior of lower and higher income individua ls and references to empirical evidence on this point 6 see crs report rs21171 the rate reduction tax credit in the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 brief explanation by gregg esenwein and steven maguire for discussion of the 2001 rebate and the reasons for itnearterm spending extending or making permanent the tax cuts would generally take effect in 2011 when the rate reductions and other re visions expire the lower rates on dividends and capital gains expire in 2009 and therefore would not increase current disposable income although there are theories that incr eases in permanent income will affect current spending there is evidence that substantial amount of current spending is related to current in come in addition if individuals already believe the tax cuts will be permanent their behavior would not be affected and much of the benefit will go to higher income individuals who economic studies indicate are less likely to spend income especially the rate reductions the estate tax repeal and the lower taxes on dividends and capital gains extending the tax cuts so they would not expire in 2011 would not be expected in the short term to have much effect on demand because shortrun demand can only increase via fiscal policy if spending on goods and services increases the most effective way to stimulate the economy through fiscal measures is via those measures that translate most fully into actual spending dollar spent by the govern ment on goods and rvices will increase spending dollar for dollar and thus other thin gs equal would be mo re effective since dollar of tax cut may not be entirely spent for shortrun tax stimulus measures tax cuts directed at individuals who have low marginal propensity to save will be most effective these are likely to be lower and moderate income individuals5 monetary policy can also be used to stimulate th economy since the lowest income groups do not pay income taxes only measures directed at earned income tax credits or refundable child credits are likel to reach these individuals moreover even if the tax cut could be directed at taxpayers who are likely to spend it the tax system has number of constraints that prevent it from being an effective immediate fiscal stimulus tool there is lag in passing legislation and lag in getting money to individuals tax rules generally cover an entire year tax returns are filed with lag and the usual way to get tax cuts to individuals is through change in withholding the difficulty arising from this route to delivering tax benefit was illustrated by the 2001 tax cut which provided for new 10 rate bracket for 2001 because the tax cut was adopted towards the middle of the year reducing withholding in the normal way for the last half of the year would delay the stimulus until taxpayers filed returns the following year another option was providing double reduction in withholding but this approach would then require an increase in withholding at the beginning of 20026 the solution adopted was to pr ovide rebate checks which were issued from july to october there was however some concern among economists that lump sum amounts such as the rebate checks might not be spent because theyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33088crs4 7 this issue was discussed in congressional budget office study economic stimulus evaluating proposed changes in tax policy jan 2002 8 david s johnson jonathan parker and nicholas souleles household expenditure and the income tax rebates of 2001 nber working paper 10784 cambridge ma national bureau of economic research sept 2004would be viewed as one time effect on wealth7 one study of the rebate found that about 20 to 40 was spent on nondurable g oods in the three months in which the check was received and another third in the following three months8 these results suggest that significant amount was spent quickly although well under the 100 of spending that would occur with direct spending program this study also found that spending was greater for those house holds that had low levels of wealth consistent with other evidence that lowe r income and wealth individuals have higher propensity to spend on the whole therefore it was not clear that national stimulus was desirable and recent economic performance appears to support that reservation even if fiscal stimulus were desirable tax cuts may not be the chosen approach in part because of the administrative nd timing difficulties described above aside from shortrun spending issues tax cu ts of any type that are not offset by spending reductions can worsen the long run fiscal situation of the country by increasing the deficit they can also offs et or more than offset any potential growth effects from cutting marginal tax rates thus in assessing the permanent effects of the tax cuts on the economy the effects on the national debt are an important consideration providing relief from high fuel prices another issue is whether the tax system can be used to provide relief from high fuel prices proposals were made for gasoline tax reductions and windfall profits taxes the spike in gasoline prices was caused by contraction in supply which in the short run is unlikely to be responsive to tax reductions the higher prices were needed to equate supply and demand w ith more or less fixed supply any reduction in fuel taxes was likely to increase the profits of suppliers rather than bring down prices that is the amount of gaso line consumers want depends on the price they pay and only one price will equate that amount they wish to purchase to the fixed amount available to sell if given tax repeal sellers do not add on the tax effectively lowering the price consumers will want more than is available gas stations will run out of gasoline to sell and either raise the price again or demand more from their suppliers who will raise the supply price and so forth economic analysis suggests that any attempt to provide relief through lower prices is likely to fail relief can be provided in general to ease the circumstances of consumers especially low income consumers but not by price reduction therefore one type of proposal that would probably not be effective would have been to reduce current excise taxes such as the federal gasoline tax which is currently 184 cents per gallonhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33088crs5 9 see crs report rl33578 energy tax policy history and current issues by salvatore lazzari for history of the windfall profits taxand therefore could have had only partial offsetting effect even if the reduction was passed on in price transportation officials and lawmakers were also concerned about the loss in funding to federal highways if gasoline taxes were reduced another approach was to target general relief to lower income individuals the group that may be particular ly burdened by higher gasoline prices are low income workers who may need to drive to get to their jobs they might be reached through temporary increase in the earned income tax credit as in the case of any tax rebate the challenge would be to get money to these individuals quickly it might have been possible to provide the rebate if it were based on the earned income credit claimed on 2004 tax returns as was the case with the 2001 reba which depended on 2000 tax returns there were also proposals to impose wi ndfall profits tax that might be used to fund rebates windfa ll profits tax was imposed in the 1970s and was basically not tax on profits but an excise tax on oil it applied to crude oil prices in excess of base the tax was somewhat complicated to administer and was designed to impose the tax on existing oil supplies without discouraging new drilling or marginal production true excess profits tax that is based on prof it or other measures as percent of assets similar to taxes imposed in world war ii is extremely difficult to design and administer nd has not been proposed9 one administrative change that helped narrow group of people was the irss recent increase in the mileage rate for deduc ting costs of operating car for business purposes from 405 cents to 485 cents for the st four months of 2005 this rate is also used by the government and many bus inesses to reimburse employees in early november severa l new england senators indicated that they would offer an amendment to the reconciliation bill to impose temporary windfall profits tax on oil modeled after the provision in the 1970s and use the proceeds for the low income energy assistance program lih eap this provision was not adopted providing relief to the disaster victims the tax system is limited in the degree that it can provide direct assistance to all victims in disaster areas because ma ny low income people who may be the most needy do not pay taxes only provisions th at allow refundable ta x benefits would be of assistance to them as with other short term uses of the tax system enacting and distributing tax benefits is difficult and tax benefits that are limited by region present special administrative problems for these reasons direct aid may be more successful and most of the provisions cong ress enacted initially involved direct aidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33088crs6 10 see crs report rs22249 income tax relief in times of disaster by pamela jackson more detailed discussion can be found in irs publication 547 casualties disasters and thefts available at httpwwwirsgovsome provisions that already existed in the tax law can aid victims of the disaster although the benef its are more likely to be concentrated among higher income individuals there are also some administrative actions that irs took largely to extend tax filing requirements there were also number of proposals for tax provisions that are aimed at helping victims of katrina some of them directed not at the victims but at those assisting the victims which were adopted in hr 3768 preexisting tax provisions current tax law contains provisions llowing for the deduction of uninsured losses and has some special rules for losses in presidentially declared disaster areas casualty losses relevant to hurricane katr ina would include destruction due to wind and floods and also would include theft these losses also include property loss due to government ordered demo lition because the property is unsafe another provision of the law allows certain exclusions for disaster relief payments10 casualty losses fall into three categories that are treated differently business losses employee related losse s and personal losses business losses might include the loss of or damage to bus iness property or other busin ess assets such as tools automobiles etc and loss of inventory employeerelated losses might include an automobile used for business purposes personal losses include damage to homes furnishings and automobiles casualty losses for businesses are allowed in full and are deducted like any other costs including provisions that allo w carrybacks and carryforwards of losses employee and personal losses are itemized deductions employee related losses are reduced by 2 of adjusted gross income personal losses are reduced by 100 plus 10 of adjusted gross income there are complex rules which deal in part with the fact that gain on appreciated property has never been taxed so that the loss is limited to the cost basis of the property genera lly the acquisition cost less depreciation plus improvements there are provisions that allow the taxpayer to postpone gain when insurance payments are greater than the adjusted basis which are extended to four years for homes and two years for businesses in disaster area losses in areas that are presidentially declared disaster areas can be deducted in the tax year preceding the loss so that taxpayers with loss from hurricane katrina can file an amended 2004 ta x year return to claim refund if part of federal disaster loan is canceled it is reimbursement and reduces the casualty loss deduction disaster relief grants in general that reimburse property losses or medical expenses

disaster area businesses whose principal place of business is in the area relief workers from government or philant hropic organizations and businesses and estates or trusts with tax records in the disaster area the irs announced number of actions in response to the disaster it created toll free telephone number for taxpayer s in the disaster area 8665625227 and waived fees for taxpayers requesting copies of their tax returns it extended filing deadlines in the disaster area to january 3 2006 and expanded the areas eligible it also postponed certain filin g requirements for charities and tax exempt bond issuers and with other agencies extended the d eadline for making mandatory contributions to pension plans current law allows tax credits for wincome housing that taxpayers are eligible for if their properties are largely rented to qualified individuals the treasury department and irs announced new s release ir200592 that they would allow owners of lowincome housing anywhere in the united states to shelter victims who do not qualify as low income tempor arily suspending income limits and non transient requirements more recently the irs announced furt her extension of the filing date to february 28 and provided some relief for victims of hurricane rita new provisions and their development there were several legislative changes th at have been considered in the past one action that has been taken in the past relaxes the rules for mortgage revenue bonds under current law states can issue ta x exempt bonds to provide mortgages for low income renters who purchase homes below price ceiling and have not lived in their own home in the past three years to qualify 95 of the mortgages in bond issue must meet income price and the threeyear requirements the threeyear rule means that the benefit largely accrues to fi rsttime home buyers and this restriction is often referred to as firsttime hom buyer restriction the purchase price requirement limits the price to 90 of the average price of homes and the income limit restricts income to 115 of median in come with some adjustments for small families and areas where housing costs are hi gh relative to income these rules are waived for portion of loans in economically distressed areas in the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pr ovision was adopted to waive the three year rule for disaster areas allowing exis ting homeowners to qualify in addition thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33088crs8 rules for economically distressed areas were applied with respect to the price and income limits the provision was however made temporary nd expired after 1998 senate proposal senate finance committee chairman grassley and ranking democrat baucus proposed tax relief bill that passe d the senate s 1696 that included the mortgage revenue bond pr ovision and number of other provisions the package included housing assistance allowing personal exemption of 500 capped at 2000 for taxpayers who house di slocated individuals and provisions dealing with cash flow employment charitable giving casualty losses and administrative issues this bill was passed on september 15 two categories of provisions were aime d at providing increased cash flow to residents of the disaster area one provi sion would exempt the forgiveness of debt due to the hurricane damage forgiveness of debt is normally considered taxable income the remaining provisions would reduce barriers to access funds in retirement plans and indivi dual retirement accounts ira the penalty for early withdrawals from retirement plans such as iras and 401ks would be eliminated and the income tax on these amounts paid ove r three years rather than one these amounts could also be recontributed in the next three years and treated as rollovers loan limits would be increased and payments could be deferred employment related proposal s would qualify residents of the disaster area who became unemployed as result of the hurri cane for the work opportunity tax credit wotc which provides credit to employer s generally at 40 of wages of up to 2400 for hiri ng eligible workers the proposal would also provide credit for employers in the disaster area for 40 of wages paid until the end of the year the following tax benefits for charita ble donations would be allowed through the end of the year noncorporate busin esses producing food w ould be allowed the same rules as corporations they could deduct in additi on to cost of producing food onehalf of the value in excess of cost not to exceed twice the cost the restriction that the deduction can be more than twi ce the cost is retained donations of book inventory would be allowed full market value deduction provisions allowing rollover of iras into charities for indi viduals age 70½ and allowing rollovers of iras of those 59½ to charitable remainde r trust without including the proceeds in income this provision would benefit taxpayers who do not itemize and reduce income for purposes of determining when soci security payments are taxable the limit on cash contributions as share of income that can be deducted by individuals would be increased from 50 to 60 provision that would be allowed through the end of 2006 would increase the limit on ch aritable contributions of corporations from 10 to 15 of taxable income the proposals would also allow irs to disclose information to state officials about denying tax exemption status to organizations or other actions and woul d increase the mileage rate deduction for charitable volunteers other proposals included eliminating the 10 percent floor on deducting casualty losses and extending the replacement period for both business property and homes to five years for hu rricane katrina losses the proposal would also dedicate fees from certain letter rulings to irs for disaster relief extend the authority of irshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33088crs9 to post pone deadlines until february 28 2006 and clarify that the extension includes employment and excise taxes as well as income and estate and gift taxes house proposal also on sept ember 15 the hous passed hr 3768 sponsored by congressman mccrery this bill had number of provisions identical to or similar to the senate plan the bill lifts the threeyear requirement for mortgage revenue bonds allo ws families who provide housing for dislocated persons 500 deduction for each dislocated person exempts forgiveness of indebtedness from income and allows the ira and pe nsion benefits but with 100000 ceiling the wotc coverage was expanded but allo wed only to employers in the disaster area for individuals who lived in the disast er area before the hurricane the proposal eliminates both the 100 and 10 floors from the casualty loss deduction and extends the replacement period to five years the charitable provisions were more limited and targeted to hurricane relief cash donations related to hurricane katr ina are exempt from the 50 income limit and the phaseout of itemized deductions if made in 2005 similarly the corporate limit is waived for cas h donations related to the hu rricane the bill would also increase the mileage reimbursement rate for charity volunteers hr 3768 also contains provision that holds families harmless against the loss of tax benefits due to temporary relocations by allowing the option of calculating the earned income and child credit based on 2004 income the treasury department is also given the authority to ensure taxp ayers do not lose dependency exemptions or child credits because of relocations the joint committee on taxation has estimated the house bill to cost 52 billion over 10 years with the casualty ss deduction the single largest item at 24 billion estimates have been released for the senate bill but it will be more costly discussion of tax provisions for relief these tax proposals would have effects th at are different fro m direct spending measures because of both distributional effects and targeting some of the provisions relate to property relief as result these provisions tend to benefit higher income individuals lower income individuals are less likely to have iras and 401k and other retirement plans nd are less likely to itemize and have homes and thus benefit from expa nded casualty loss deductions or business property in addition lower income indivi duals have lower marginal tax rates and are less likely to have tax liability in general the proposals also differ in the degree to which they are targeted to the disaster area while many of these provisions are targeted the ones applying to charitable giving in general are not directed at the disaster area it is likely that only small fraction of this increased general giving will benefit the katrina victims businesses that donate f ood and books and cash are more likely for both transport cost reasons and pub lic relations to donate to causes within their own area the victims of katrina tend to be concentrated in mississippi louisiana and nearby states httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33088crs10 11 see elizabeth williamson charitable giving generous response tends to slow washington post sept 14 2005 p a25 this

charitable organizations in who benefits from the nonprofit sector edited by charles t clotfelter chicago university of chicago press 1992 for example data in the article re ligious organizations by

the impact of fundamental tax reform on nonprofit organizations in economic effects of fundamental tax reform ed henry j aaron and william g gale washington dc the brookings institution 1996 15 these issues are addressed in testimony by jane g gravelle before the senate finance committee on charities and charitable giving apr 5 2005while there has been increased giving to charities that are in the disaster area large fraction of individual giving norma lly goes to causes where little or none of the donations would help katrina victims data also indicate th at increased giving to charities that are aiding hurricane victims is already declining11 an expected outcome as people become less likely to res pond after the height of the crisis thus induced charitable giving is more likely to follow normal patterns about third of contributions are made to religious organiza tions probably close to half after dealing with double counting of private founda tions which are generally not final recipients12 and most of this spending tends to go for provision of sacramental services similar points c ould be made about the ot her important categories of spending13 very high income people who are more likely to reach the maximum share of giving may be especially likely to direct their giving to universities and colleges education is the next highest category of recipient after religion and accounts about 20 of the giving of the highest income classes14 higher income individuals are also likely to give to private foundations and the limited payout requirements of private founda tions mean that the money may not be spent for years even if the limit for giving to private foundations is not lif ted the general limit increase could permit more giving for those who give to private foundations wealthy donors are also now using ot her mechanisms such as supporting organizations and donor advised funds that act like private foundations as ways to contribute money now and spread out spending far into the future15 the provision allowing rollovers of iras into charitable remainder trusts would have virtually effects on ch aritable giving in this case since charitable remainder trust leaves residual amount to charity that gift is completed only after the beneficiary dies so except for the extremely small portion of people who die immediately after setting up the trust this provision is unlikely to help the victims of katrina in addition to this targeting issue there is some evidence that incentives for charitable giving induce less than dollar of giving for each dollar of revenue losshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33088crs11 16 see crs report rl31108 economic analysis of the c haritable contribution deduction for nonitemizers by jane g gravelle for discussion due to relatively low price elasticity16 temporary benefit may be more effective but it is likely largely to speed up planned gifts that are not likely to benefit the disaster victims for these reasons revenue lost from fina ncing charitable contribution subsidies for general giving is likely to have negligible effect on aiding victims compared to direct spending or to tax s ubsidies contingent on being rvivor of the disaster while more focused on hurricane relief these targeted benefits in the house bill may be more difficult to administer further legislative action after passage of both bills the sena passed an amendment to hr 3768 which was more similar to the house bill the main area in which revisions were made was in the charitable contributions provisions the ira rollover provisions were dropped and provision si milar to the house bill lifted the limit on contributions by corporations and individua ls for contributions directed at hurricane katrina the information sharing provisions with state and local officials were also dropped in other provisions the effective da tes were altered in some cases and the 100 floor for casualty losses was eliminated on september 21 both houses passed fi nal version of hr 3768 which was signed by the president on september 23 with cost of 61 billion whether measured over five years or 10 years for iras and retirement plans the bill includes penalty free withdrawal ca pped at 100000 income averaging for the distributions rollovers and the loan provisi ons this provision is small costing only 70 million over the years

incentives for rebuilding in the disaster area government assistance for rebuilding may involve two types of policies one is grant assistance to rebu ild the public infrastructure roads schools etc which might include port facilities that were formerly privately owned and might include reconstruction of low income housing another policy is to provide tax subsidies for private firms mortgage revenue bonds fall into slightly different category to provide private subsidies directed at homeowners rather than businesses in his address on september 15 the presid ents proposals included proposal for gulf opportunity zone that would provide tax subsid ies to businesses17 both the house and the senate consider ed tax cuts under ge neral reconciliation rules the house bill hr 4297 did not contain provisions relating to hurricane victims the house had however alread passed hr 4337 which allows for tax credit bonds advance refundings issuing new bonds for project prior to the maturing of existing bonds and providing federal guarantee the senate reconcilia tion bill s 2020 included t of provisions affecting rebuilding in the gulf amounting to 76 billion over the tenyear period 20062015 of that amount provisions costing 17 billi on would extend the relief provisions for katrina in hr 3768 to victims of rita nd wilma including an elimination of the size requirement in all three disaster areas for the employee retention credit the gulf zone provisions of the bill would have allowed bonus preciation deducting 50 of the cost of investment immediat ely for both equipment through 2007 and structures through 2008 it would have also increased the current amount of equipment that can be deducted immediat ely by small business from 100000 to the total of all property in the zone up to 200000 it would have expanded the amount of private activity bonds lowincome housing credits and newmarkets credits available in the region nd would have allowed an additional advance refunding issuing new bonds before the previous one s mature it woul d have extended the period that net operating losses can be carried back to offset prioryear income to five years and allowed extended carryback periods for public utilities and timber producers it would also have allo wed an increase in the amount of timberhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33088crs13 reforestation costs that could be deducted immediately 50 deduction for certain demolition and cleanup costs and an extended period for expensing of environmental remediation costs finally the bill expanded the tuition tax credits for students in the zone hr 4440 passed the house on december 7 and would have cost 81 billion for the period 200615 it had many provi sions similar to the senate proposal and included 15 billion for extending the relie f provisions to victims of rita and wilma but did not eliminate the size requirement for the employee retention credit it included provisions for bonus depreciati on increased small business expensing of equipment expansions of private activ ity bonds low income housing credits and advance refundings it also included the benefits for pub lic utilities timber reforestation expensing environmental remediation costs and expensing for demolition and clean up costs it included increased benefits for tax exempt bonds including special allocations of private activity bond financing advance refundings the expanded availability of tax exempt bonds for buildings business structures and rental housing public utility property housing reconstruction in general and municipal financing the bill also in troduced tax credits for certain bonds in addition to bond provisions the bill woul d increase the credit for rehabilitated buildings in the area from 10 to 13 and would increase the credit for certified historic structures from 20 to 26 tax benefits are limited for certain types of businesses primarily affecting the casino business an issue that has been subject to some controversy the senate proposal included these businesses the final version of hr 4440 enacted in to law included the provisions in the house bill which in turn included many senate provisions while new provisions such as the increase in the rehabilitation tax credit were retained the final legislation also lifted the ceiling for the employee retention tax credit provision contained in the senate bill prior geographically targeted subsidies the main examples of past legislation to address disasters we re the liberty zone provisions adopted in 2002 for the area in wer manhattan that was affected by the terrorist attacks these provisions in cluded expansion of the wotc for small employers accelerated depreciation for equipment investments and leasehold improvements increased private activity bonds which are generally limited by state cap and favorable treatment of capital gains realized from the replacement of property these provisions we re originally made available for few years varying by incentive but were extended in most cases through 2010 current tax law contains other geographi cally targeted provi sions often referred to as enterprise zones many states have enterprise zone programs as well they comprise 40 empowerment zones 30 urban and 10 rural 95 enterprise communities 65 urban and 30 rural and 40 renewal communities tax incentives for empowerment zones include 20 empl oyer wage credit for the first 15000 of wages for zone residents who work in the zone an add itional 35000 bove the 100000 generally allowed in expensing of equipment inves tments of qualified zone businesses and expanded tax exempt financing for certain zone facilities renewal communities are llowed 15 wage credit on the first 10000 of wageshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33088crs14 the additional 35 000 in capital expensing and partial expensing of qualified buildings enterprise communities receive tax exempt financ ing benefits schools in enterprise communities and empowerment zones are also eligible for qualified zone academy bonds where the federal govern ment effectively pays the interest on the bonds these areas are also eligible for special benefits for cleaning up environmentally contaminated areas brownfi elds there are also special provisions for indian reservations and the district of columbia there is also new markets tax credit for investors equal to 5 of the original investment and for the next two anniversary dates and 6 credit for th following four anniversary dates along with capital gains tax benefits for investors new orleans already had renewal community designated area the new orleansjefferson area on the mississippi river west of th french quarter but it is only part of the city there was also renewal community in mobile alabama the treasury announced that it will give add itional consideration to approving new markets coverage for organizations that target their investments to the disaster areas these measures indicate the types of geographically targeted tax incentives that have been and are now being allowed wage credits accelerated depreciation tax exempt bond expansion and tax subsidized bonds there are other options however that might include an expansion of the tax credit for rehabilitation of older buildings this type of provision might be more appropriate for city with significant tourism business like new orleans whereas lower manhattan was primarily financial center and it was ultimately enacted in hr 4440 justification for subsidies there is considerable economic literature discussing both the justifications for geographically targeted subsidies to privat business and assessing the effectiveness of these subsidies private rebuilding will occur in the absence of tax subsidies although government construction of essential public infrastructure such as roads is vital to any areas recovery the issue is what speed or magnitude of rebuilding is desirable normally the need for subsidies would occur either to achieve distributional objectives or because of market failures circumstances where an efficient allocation of investme nt does not occur because of unpriced costs the issue often addressed in the economics literature reflecting the normal goal of enterprise zones and simila r policies is not about rebu ilding devastated area but about encouraging development in areas th at are chronically depressed there are two efficiency reasons that are commonly given for this intervention one is that there is mismatch between available bor supply and the businesses that need employees an argument that in general would apply to urban areas not rural ones for example businesses in some areas outlying areas of the city may find it difficult to locate employees while unemployment in the inner city may be high this mismatch causes lower income in the city as whole and lower tax base if transportation costs or lack of knowledge cr eates barrier to mobility around the city one approach is to try to develop the inner c ity to create jobs for residents there are of course alternative policies such as providing job matching services andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33088crs15 subsidized mass transit for residents of low income areas or providing lowincome housing in areas of the city that are more prosperous for variety of reasons these alternatives may not be accepted by the city residents and so the option of trying to stimulate development in the depressed area may be chosen second efficiency argument is that depressed areas tend to breed more crime which imposes costs on society both from being victim of crime and from paying for the resources such as police and prisons needed to deal with crime this argument might apply to both ru ral and urban areas in either of these cases the objective is to provide jobs for residents of depressed areas that rationa suggests that tax subsidie s provided should be in the form of wage subsidies which are more likely than subsidies for investment to produce jobs in fact under certain circ umstances capital subsidies could actually decrease employment by encouraging labor sa ving investments yet many of the subsidies provided in these geographically targeted areas are subsidies for capital investment second objective is redistributional to help poor people the difficulty with this argument is that there is obvious reason to concentrate our help on poor people who live in the poorest neighborhoods and exclude equally poor people who do not there is also the issue of whether inte rvention should be provided by the federal government or the state government if the motive is efficiency then the source of funds might depend on who is bearing the cost s of that inefficiency and in the case of revenue base and crime may include both taxpayers in the states and localities and taxpayers across the national in general if the motive is distributional then there is more of case for national effort particularly in the case of hurricane katrina since the states and localities invol ved have lost much of th eir revenue base as well in the case of the rebuilding of areas devastated by hurricane katrina the question is whether the standard argument s for enterprise zones can be applied to rebuilding areas that are not at least in their entirety chronically depressed but have been destroyed by natural disaster it is not clear that they can be rather the principal justification for intervention may be largely distributional the desire to help people who have faced significant loss to reclaim their lives different efficiency objec tive may also be invoked aid to devastated areas by the federal government may be viewed as an implicit form of insurance the country as whole acts to spread the risk of the cost of natural disasters if there are imperfect markets for catastr ophic insurance then aid in rebuilding is needed to achieve an efficient allocation of resources in particular the cost to businesses in catastrophe exceeds the loss of property which can be covered by insurance because the business also loses its customer base and work force and it is difficult for private insurance markets to provide coverage for this type of loss until the rationale for the intervention is clear it is difficult to determine the optimal design or size of subsidies for rebuilding but if aid is viewed as nationwide catastrophic insurance program th it is appropriate for the federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33088crs16 18 for brief review see leslie papke enterprise zones in the encyclopedia of taxation and tax policy ed joseph j cordes robert w ebel and jane g gravelle washington dc the urban institute 1999 new edition is in press and will be available in 2005 19 see general accounting office community development federal revitalization programs are being implemented but data on the use of tax benefits are limited gao 04306 mar 2004government to intervene benefits need not be limited to lower income recipients and the measures should probably include range of subsidies including capital subsidies case may be made for limiting the benefits to preexisting businesses evidence on the effectiveness of subsidies is unclear there is significant body of empirical studies focused mainly on state enterprise zones in general most of these studies have not found evidence of effects on growth or employment18 these results do not necessarily mean that there are positive effects but rather that the effects are small and difficult to detect statistically specific evidence of the empirical effect of federal programs is virtually nonexistent and although some studies have found effects there are some reservations about their methodology19 these results however may not be very meaningful for measuring the potential effect of aid to rebuild the disaster area especially if the motive is not to address market failure but effectiv ely to be part of cat astrophic insurance package conclusion the use of tax policy to address problems in the aftermath of the hurricane is subject to many limitations fiscal stimulus may not be needed is difficult to implement in timely fashion and will add to longterm fiscal pressures relief from energy prices is also difficult to address through tax measures there are some narrowly targeted relief measures for victims that may be effective but general subsidies for charitable giving are not very ta rget efficient longer term benefits to help rebuild the area may be desirable not so much because they induce giving but because they constitute part of nati onal risk sharing activity to deal with catastrophes
