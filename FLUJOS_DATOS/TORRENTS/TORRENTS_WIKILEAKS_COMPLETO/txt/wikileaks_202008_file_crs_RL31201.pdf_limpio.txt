to the contrary notwithstanding ho wever this language encompasses only those areas where congress has authority to legislate see discussion of the enumerated powers clause infra 2 for example all

of uniformed laws such as uifsa uniform child custody jurisdiction act uccja and the uniform child custody jurisdiction and continuedfamily law congresss authority to legislate on domestic relations questions introduction under the united states constitution1 congress has little direct authority to legislate in the field of domestic relations generally state policy guides these decisions despite the lack of direct authority to legislate domestic relations issues congress continues to utilize number of indirect approaches to enact numerous federal laws which impact on family law questions the constitutions framers felt that states rather than the federal government should maintain jurisdiction over most family law questions thus the final document reflects that view as mmarized by the supreme court in hisquierdo v hisquierdo 439 us 572 581 1979 insofar as marriage is within temporal c ontrol the states lay on the guiding hand the whole subject of the domestic rela tions of husband and wife parent and child belongs to the laws of the states and not to the laws of the united states in re burrus 136 us 586 59394 1890 on the rare occasion when state family law has come into conflict with federal statute this court has limited review under the supremacy clause to determination whether congress has positively required by direct enactment that state law shall be preempted wetmore v markoe 196 us 68 77 1904 thus the individual states have the primary authority and responsibility to legislate in the domestic relations arena which includes incidents of marriage divorce and child welfare the rationale behind this pproach is the lack of overriding national considerations in the family law area therefore states generally have the freedom to legislate as they see fit on these questi ons however states freedom to legislate has led to substantial variation between the individual states on many of these topics although more uniformity now exists than at any time in the past2 thus similarlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31201crs2 2 continued enforcement act uccjea have aided in fost ering consistency and efficiency in the enforcement of interstate child support and custody

positively identifying an adopted adult birth mother or birth father ch as names addresses and dates contained in court records or submitted to the state department of vital statistics 5 nonidentifying information is generally rest ricted to details about the adopted adult and the adopted adults birth relatives informati on can include any of the following date and place of adopted adults birth age of the birth parents and description of their general physical appearances the race ethnicity religi on and medical history of the birth parents type of termination facts and

original birth certificates only in alaska kansas and in some cases oh io tennessee and montana depending upon which year the adoption was finalized 7 article v of the us constitution provides two ways to propose amendments to the document and two ways to ratify them amendments may be proposed either by the congress by twothirds vote of the house and the senate of those present and voting continuedsituated spouses parents and children may have different legal options depending on where they reside for example the comm unity property concept of marital property adopted by nine states3 is quite different from the common law property system in the other fortyone states while all states have some form of nofault divorce based either on grounds such as irreconcilable di fferences or some period of separation many authorize divorces based on fault or consider marital fault as factor when awarding spousal support or dividing mar ital property in addition states have varying rules regarding the who what when and where of marriages andor divorces adoption is another area in which stat have diverse regulations individual states have different statut regarding the rights of adopted adults birth parents adoptive parents birth siblings and birth relatives to gain access to identifying4 and nonidentifying5 information about the adoptee or bi rth relatives for example few states permit adoptees to gain access to their birth andor adoption records6 but most require court order issued for good cause usually medical crisis or some comparably serious situation before unsealing such information although many states use similar procedures the laws and processes surrounding access in any one state are unique during the first half of the twentieth century numerous constitutional amendments were proposed which if adopt ed would have authorized congress to enact uniform national marriag and divorce laws however none of these proposals received the requisite twothirds vote of each house of congress necessitating submission to the states for ratification7 this approach now appears disfavored8 inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31201crs3 7 continued provided quorum

other approaches all discussed infra have led or have the potential of leading toward the same result in those areas where uniformity is thought desirable for example the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws nccusl nongovernmental tity has proposed uniform laws on number of family law topics ma ny of which have been widely adopted by the states more expansive view of congressional power to legislate under its commerce clause authority has led to federal legi slation such as the parental kidnapping prevention act pkpa which authorizes fe deral intervention into certain custodial interference cases where applicable state law classifies such action as felony also congress has enacted legislation under the fu ll faith and credit clause legislation under this clause directs sister states to give full faith and credit to child custody child support and protection or ders of other states c ongress passed the defense of marriage act which permits sister states to give effect to the law of other states with respect to governing samesex marriages congress has also established number of funding programs whereby states must comply with detailed requirements in such areas as child abuse and the doption of hardtoplace children before they can receive federal money to help deal with these problems this report discusses the extent to which

right to minors married or unmarried in carey v population services international17 also in roe v wade 18 the supreme court substantially limited governmental authority to regulate abor tions holding that mothers personal privacy right prevented state from intervening at the first trimester of pregnancy and permitted interventi on during the second trimester only as needed to protect the mothers health the court reasoned that states interest fails to become compelling enough to justify extensive re gulation until fetus becomes viable at approximately the end of the second trimester this rulin g was clarified but retained in three companion cases decided in 1983 akron center for reproductive health inc v city of akron19 planned parenthood association of kansas city missouri inc v ashcroft20 and simopoulous v virginia21 in 1992 the supreme court reaffirmed roes essential holding that before viability of the fetus woman has the right to choose to have an abortion and has the right to obtain an abortion without undue interference from the state22 in planned parenthood of pa v casey the court held that statute requiring spous notification before woman could have an abortion constituted an undue burden thus violating the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment23 however the remaining four challenged aspects of the pennsylvania abortion control act of 1982 were found to be constitutional and not undue burdens the court he ld valid 1 the acts definition of medical emergency condition warranting exemption from the acts other limitations 2 record keeping and reporting requirements imposed on facilities that perform abortions 3 an informed consent and 24hour waiting period re quirement and 4 parental consent requirement with the possibility for judicial bypass24 right to marry has also been judicially accepted as guarantee of due process thus the court struck down miscegenation statutes in loving v virginia25 finding that the state lacked compelling interest in prohibiting persons from marrying based solely on their race httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31201crs6 26 the fourteenth amendment guarantees that state shall make or enforce any law which shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws while there is corresponding provision applicable to the federal government the fifth amendment due process clause applies

limitation on governmental entities authority to legislate on domestic relations issues when legislation or government policy discriminates between classes or deprives group of particular right the level of scrutiny pplied under an equal protection challenge turns on the nature of the group allegedly di scriminated against as general rule courts will uphold the challeng ed governmental action if the classification drawn by the statute is rationally related to legitimate state interest27 for example states can legislate to protect minors prevent close relatives from marrying require blood tests before marriage and impose othe r marriage restrictions so l ong as the restrictions are reasonably related to valid state interest where the statute targets quasisuspect class na mely those based upon gender or illegitimacy heightened level of scrutiny applies under this intermediate scrutiny test the statute is presumed invalid unless it is substantially related to sufficiently important governmental interest28 for example in orr v orr 29 the supreme court applied this standard and found statute which imposed alimony obligations on husbands but not on wives unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause however where statute targets suspect class including race alienage or national origin or burdens fundamental righ t the statute in question will only be sustained if it is narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interest under this standard the cour t has stuck down statutes in eisenstadt v baird30 and skinner v oklahoma31 as violative of the equal pr otection clause conversely in nguyen v ins 32 the supreme court found statut which provided different rules for attainment of citizensh ip depending upon whether the one citizen parent was

system parents might become reluctant to place children for adoption if they thought the children would later seek them out justify these laws34 however the supreme court has yet to rule on this question so the issue of closed records statutes remains unsettled the enumerated powers clause as opposed to the general constitutional restraints discusse d above article i section 8 of the constitution the enumer ated powers clause limits congressional authority to act by specifying general subject categories where federal action is permissible these categories encompass those topics the constitutions framers thought could best be handled on the nationa l level such as warmaking and defense interstate and foreign commerce coinage and currency the post office bankruptcies copyrights and the judicial system u nder this clause and the tenth amendment35 categories other than those enumerated are reserved for state action these enumerated powers do not readily encompass most family law questions as such federal legislation in this area is usually hinged on some other federal interest for example while states have the primary authority to legislate on adoption alien children less than sixteen ears of age adopted by unmarried united states citizens have been granted immigrant status36 legislation such as the indian child welfare act37 is based on congressi onal

supreme court examined number of related statutes and congressional documents before deciding in mccarty v mccarty 453 us 210 1981 that congress had not intended that military pensions be divisible in this context at the time of th is decision all of the community property states and number of equitable distri bution states were dividing m ilitary pensions but they could longer do so after it was issued the mccarty decision and subsequent legislative action to authorize such division is discussed in the next sectionto individual state judgments or 3 legislate somewhere between these two extremes congresss options can best be illustrated by looking at its handling of former spouses entitlements to pensions paid under federal retirement program under social security and the railroad retirement system39 former spouse who meets specified conditions is entitled to 50 of the covere d spouses benefit40 while federal civil service and military pensions are divisible at the option of the individual state hearing the matter ie states are authorized to treat civil service41 and military retirement42 payments the same way they treat ot her pensions for this purpose the acts governing foreign service and central intelligence agency pension division43 are hybrids between these two approaches as they suggest pro rata division formula predicated on length of marriagelength of service but permit deviation from this formula by court order or if the par ties agree to some other arrangement where congressional intent is unclear or ambiguous as was the case pertaining to the possible division of military pensions in divorce cases for some time44 or where congress fails to act in certain area when it has the authority to do so individual states are free to act andor interpret the applicable federal statutes as they see fit subject to the constitutional consid erations discussed bove however once congress acts to clarify its intent states are bound by this interpretation and are longer free to vary their approaches overview of federal domestic relations legislation areas in which congress has direct authority to legislate federal benefits congress has plenary legisl ative

system 48 42 usc 402b 49 in the vast majority of divorce cases the parties work out their financial arrangement without court assistance and the court routinely incorporates this agreement as part of the final decree unless it is on its face grossly unfair to either party thus there is reason why an annuitant spouse cannot voluntarily agree to divide his or her annuity with the other spouse presumably in return for some other consideration and such agreements once finalized by court order are binding on th parties however the rationale behind legislatively sanctioning such division is that it is unlikely many annuitants will voluntarily agree to split pension when there is legal requirement to do soprevented state division of military pensions in divorce cases that its interest in its residents wellbeing along with general state authority over divorce law was sufficient to confer upon its courts the aut hority to grant divorced wife share of her husbands military pension the suprem court disagreed citing congressional power under article i secti on 8 clause 14 of the constitution to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces the military system was enacted pursuant to this grant of constitutional authority and the court found that the application of state community pr operty law as envisioned by the lower court mccarty rulings which divided the pensi on could potentially frustrate the congressional objectives of providing for retired personnel and meeting the management needs of the active forces however the mccarty court recognized the serious plight of an exspouse of retired service member45 and invited congress to change the situation legislatively if so desired congress shortly thereafter enacted the uniformed services former spouses protection act fspa46 which authorized states to divide or not divide these pensions in accordance with applicable state laws and precedents as discussed in the preceding section c ongress has for the most part deferred to state judgments in thos divorce cases which involve pensions paid to federal employees of the pertinent statutes only the foreign service act and the cia retirement act contain suggested division formulas these optional formulas take into account the particular ly disadvantageous economic position of many of the wives whose husbands served in the foreig n service or with the cia under the social security program former spous who was married to an annuitant spouse with ten or more years of covered service47 is entitled to 50 of the annuitants pension at the time he or she reaches age 62 provided the former spouse has not remarried prior to that time48 this is separate entitlement which does not reduce or affect the annuitant spouses payment even in the absen ce of these statutes voluntary division of annuities was possible if the parties so agreed however as might be imagined such ac tion occurred infrequently49

deductible by th person making the payments and treated as taxable income to the recipient while child support payments are neither taxable income to the recipient nor deductible by the payer63 there are also number of tax laws which reference adoption for the most part these statutes provide th at adopted children are to be treated the same as natural born children for whatever purpose is involved64 bankruptcy article i section 8 clause 4 of the constitution authorizes congress to establish uniform laws on th subject of bankruptcies throughout the united states as with taxation the tire bankruptcy code codified as title 11 of the united states code can have an ffect on the family lives of those involved in personal or businessrelated bankruptcies however for family law purposes the most important provision prohibits individuals from discharging alimony andor child support payments65 other provisions may affect such situations as the timing of bankruptcy petition vis vis the

jurisdiction to hear interstate child support proceedings the uniform child custody jurisdiction act uccja105 or the uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act uccjea106 and the parental kidnapping prevention act pkpa107 govern jurisdiction to hear custody proceedings thus the forwarding of uifsa proceeding to state that would not normally have jurisdiction over custody issues108 does not subject the petitioner to custody claims the respondent might make further court properly hearing uifsa proceeding may not condition the payment of support order issued under uifsa upon compliance by party with provisions for visitation109 one would think that final domestic relations decree entered in one state should be uniformly recognized and enfor ced throughout the other states however this was frequently not the case because in many instances sec ond state would assert its own jurisdiction to modify the original decree or enter new decree which in its view supersedes the original one110 that is why for example the uccja as discussed above failed despite its widespread adoption by the states to result in the broad national recognition of child custody decrees its sponsors anticipated and desired rather noncustodial parents would take the child to another state and that state by virtue of its jurisdiction over th party seeking the m odification would enter new decree changing the custody arrangement because circumstances changed since the entering of the original decree111 this meant that the childs mother could have valid decree in one state granting her custody

unfortunate results to the child the parental kidnap ping prevention act of 1980 pkpa112 has now largely taken care of the problem however it must be noted that the pk pa does not confer jurisdiction on the federal courts this act merely delineates which jurisdiction may modify child support and custody orders as such the pk pa is inapplicable to instate disputes and only relevant in interstate disputes when the jurisdictions have conflicting laws under the supremacy clause the jurisdictional guidelines set forth in the pkpa supersede any conflicting state law as such parents are bound by state court decisions regarding custody visitation and support uniform acts such as uifsa uccja uccjea fail to specify what court orders must contain or what courts mu st consider when drafting them but deal exclusively with their enfo rcement once finalized othe r proposals such as the uniform marriage and divorce act umda and the uniform adoption act include specific guidelines for courts to fo llow in drafting these various orders even when domestic relations laws are drafted with great specificity they fail to yield comparable results in seemingly comparable cases each domestic relations case presents unique fact pattern which gives judges and hearing examiners wide discretion in determining an equitable ruling in each case thus it is difficult if not impossible to talk in terms of average alimony awards or predict with any degree of accuracy what custodial arrangement judge will order in particular divorce case generally party who receives an adverse ruling can only appeal on an abuse of discretion ground an extremely difficu lt standard to meet for this reason reported domestic relations cases113 have little precedential va lue except when cited for general policy

johnson v muelberger 340 us 5811951 that child could not collaterally attack her parents divorce wh ere both parties participated in the proceedingfederal recognition of samesex marriages and allows individual states to refuse to recognize such marriages performed or recognized in other states132 the full faith credit clause is applicable to divorces in two related cases known as williams i 133 and williams ii 134 the supreme court articulated the extent to which the full faith and credit clause pplies in divorce cases both cases arose out of the following scenario man and woman both domiciliaries permanent residents of north carolina and married to other people moved to nevada they lived there for six weeks to satisfy the ne vada durational reside ncy requirement for divorce at which time they obtained di vorces upon substituted service ie their spouses were notified by publication onl and failed to participate in the proceedings married each other and returned to north carolina north carolina then began prosecution under its bigamous cohabitation statute in williams i the supreme court held that in granting the divorce nevada was justified in assuming that the parties were bona fide neva da domiciliaries jurisdictional requirement thus the divorce was valid and warranted recognition as such by the other states including north carolina however in williams ii the court held that divorce decree issued in one state could be collaterally impeached in another by proof that th court which tendered the d ecree lacked jurisdiction in this particular case the fact that the new mr and mrs williams returned to north carolina immediately following their marriage was sufficient to justify the north carolina courts conclusion th at the couple was not domic iled in nevada at the time their divorce was granted as such the divorce was void because the issuing court lacked proper jurisdiction in williams ii the rule remains in effect toda as modified by the supreme courts holding in sherrer v sherrer 334 us 343 1948 that divorce cannot be subsequently attacked by spouse for lack of jurisdiction if the spouse participated in the divorce proceeding and the divorce court specifically ruled that it had jurisdiction135 under this ruling if both parties participate in divorce proceeding andor consent to the courts jurisdiction ie obtain bilateral divorce neither party can attack the decree for lack of jurisdiction136 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31201crs24 137 such divorces are commonly known as mexican divorces even though mexico tightened its residency requirements in 1971 so that few american now qualify for divorce in that country however several cari bbean countries continue this practice 138 state jurisdictional requirements ordinarily include some formal residency requirement usually six months or year and proper notice to the opposing party 139 rosenstiel v rosenstiel 209 ne2d 709 1965 140 s 1960 80th cong 2d sess 1948 s 3 81st cong 1st

quirements situations such as the ones mentioned above c ontinue to decrease these r easons reduce partys need to seek out what may be viewed as more favorable divorce jurisdiction while the situation has minimized with domestic divorce decrees comparable situation now exists regarding certain foreign divorce decrees eg those where only one party appears briefly in the issuing jurisdiction137 the full faith and credit clause does not govern the domestic validity of divorce judgments from foreign countries the rule of comity which generally provides for recognition of foreign decrees i ssued by courts of competent jurisdiction governs however the jurisdictional tests applied are usually those of the united states138 rather than the divorcing country as such divorce obtained in foreign country will be invalid in the united stat if neither spouse was domiciled in that country even if domicile is not required fo r jurisdiction under its law new york is the only state which recognizes bilatera l foreign divorces w here both parties participate even where its own jurisdictional requirements are not satisfied139 state recognizes such unilateral divor ces where only one party appears justice frankfurter in concurring opinion in williams i noted that congress had the authority under the full faith nd credit clause to require national recognition of divorce decrees but had not ye t chosen to exercise such authority it is clearly settled that if judgme nt is binding in the state where it was rendered it is equally binding in every stat this rule of law was not created by the federal courts it comes from the constitution and the act of may 26 1790 c 11 1 stat 122 congress has not exer cised its power under the full faith and credit clause to meet the special problems raised by divorce decrees there will be time enough to consider the scope of its power in this regard when congress chooses to exercise it 317 us at 306 in response to this dicta senator pat mccarran introduced bills in the 80th through the 83rd congresses140 which if enacted would ve required all states to recognize divorce decrees where 1 the d ecree was final as to the issue of divorce 2 the decree was valid in the state where rendered 3 the decree stated that the jurisdictional prerequisites of the issuing stated had been met and 4 the issuing state was the last state wh ere the spouses were domiciled together as husband and wife or the defendant was pers onally subject to jurisdiction in that state or appeared generally in the divorce proceedings the only exceptions included fraud

has been minimal indeed there are few clauses of the constitution the merely literal possibilities of which have been so little developed as the full faith and credit clause142 only on five occasions has congress enacted legislation to require states to give full faith and credit to certain types of acts records and proceedings three of the enactments pertain to family law concerns to date the major legislative initiativ in this area is 28 usc 1738a provision of the pkpa which requires states to give full faith and credit to child custody decrees entered in other states unless the state asked to modify the original order has jurisdiction to do so and the stat which issued the original order lacks jurisdiction to modify the order or declines to exercise its jurisdiction143 in addition under 42 usc 666a states must grant full faith and credit to each others child support orders to the extent of not modifying them retroactively144 in 1994 the 103rd congress passed the full faith and credit for child support orders act145 requiring each state to enforce child support orders issued by the childs home state if done in compliance with the acts provisions the law was designed so that person with valid ch ild support order in one state would not have to obtain second order in another state should the debtor parent move from the issuing courts jurisdiction rather the s econd state must recogn ize the first states order as valid but can modify it only when the child and the custodial parent have moved to the state where the modificati on is sought or have agreed to the modification retroactive modification is prohibited and prospective modification is authorized if the court finds that circumstances exist which justify change146 also in 1994 congress passed the sa

step in this direction was taken by the hawaii supreme court in baehr v levin 852 p2d 44 haw 1993 the baehr court held that while there is fundamental right for samesex couples to marry the state statut restricting marriage to oppositesex couples established sexbased classification subject to strict scrutiny for the purposes of an equal protection challenge the court held that the statute amounted to sex discrimination when analyzed under this standard following this decision the hawaii state legislature amended the state constitution in 1998 to bar recognition of samesex marriages and the state supreme court found that the marriage amendment validated the statute in question in baehr 151 see hr rep 104664 at 1011 1996discussing the interstate and federal implications of the legalization of samesex marriages in any jurisdiction in baker v vermont 744 a2d 864 vt 1999 the vermont suprem court held that it was violation of the state constitution to deny samesex c ouples the benefits and protections afforded oppositesex married couples the plaintiffs in baker were three samesex couples in committed relationships ranging from four to twentyfive years two of the couples had

full faith and credit enforcement power was necessitated by the failu re of sister state courts to give full faith and credit to orders not regarded as final judgments congress directed sister states to give full faith and credit to child custody child support and protection orders from other states in effect congress required each state to give the child custody child support and protection orders of other states the same faith and credit it gives its own such orders conversely in 1996 congress passed th defense of marriage act doma148 this act differs in one critical aspect from the other legislative enactments passed by congress under its full faith nd credit power the doma permits sister states to give effect to the law of other states149 congress enacted doma in response to claims by advocates of samesex marriage that if any state legalizes samesex marriage all states and federal agencies will have to recognize as valid all samesex marriages performed in that samesexmarriagepermitting state150 congress recognized that the legalization of samesex marriage in any jurisdiction would have farreaching potential effects upon all people and upon wide spectrum of laws in the jurisdiction ranging from marriage law to public school curricula from custody law to public finances from adoption to insurance issu from alimony and property division to employment regulations151 moreover these potential ffects involved policy issuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31201crs27 151 continued protection the vermont supreme court held that samesex couples must be afforded privileges and responsibilities under state law equal to those enjoyed by oppositesex couples that are married the holding does not mandate that samesex couples be allowed to marry instead the court

endments were proposed to give congress authority to legislate on marriage and divorce questions152 in addition 12 bills were introduced during this period to provide for uniform marriage and divorce laws throughout the united states presumably in anticipation that such constitutional amendment would be ratified153 eleven of the proposed constitutional amendments154 and all of the implementing bills introduced in the senate were sponsored by senator arthur caper the text of his proposed amendments uniformly stated the congress shall have power to make laws which shall be uniform throughout the united states on marriage and divorce the legitimization of children and the care and custody of children affected by annulment of marriage or by divorce however none of these proposed amendm ents ever received congressional action beginning in the 107th congress legislation has been introduced proposing constitutional amendment to define marriage as the union of man and woman155httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31201crs28 conclusion in the absence of constitutional amendment providing general authority for congress to legislate in the field of domestic relations its direct authority is limited to those areas specifically reserved for congressional ac tion under article i section 8 of the constitution however various indi rect approaches most notably those tied to congressional authority under the comme rce clause and cong resss appropriations powers have resulted in significant federal impact on myriad of family law questions currently there appears to be little sentiment in favor of national marriage and divorce law at least one which would be imposed involuntarily by congress on the states however it is probable that federal involvement will continue or be forthcoming in those areas where it is argued that federal resources can be utilized more efficiently and effectively than those available at the state or local level such as tracking down parental kidnappers or establishing and enforcing child support orders the spending power can be used to shape state approaches to given situation although this option involves expe nditures of federal f unds the higher the funding level the more likely state is to comply with the federal directive the nature of family law cases is such that an individualized approach to each particular case will undoubtedly continue however state domestic relations laws have become more uniform in recent years and even without federal intervention this trend is likely to continue thus it is possible that some of the national uniformity envisioned by proponents of adopting c onstitutional amendment for this purpose will be realized although stat retain primary authority to legislate in this area
