cycles of action lecture given on 13 october 1964 whats the date audience 13th of october thirteenth of october well thats good day youre very lucky the 13th fell on tuesday this week didnt fall on friday all right todays lecture is about cycles of action cycles of action and youll find this very fundamental material and its quite good for man and beast you can put it in tea or coffee take it without taste doesnt leave any aftereffects in an auditing session can be rubbed on horses dogs is only sixpence the bottle and you ought to buy some i think itd be terribly good idea its not that i am particularly cross on this particular subject of cycles of action nobody has been throwing their hands up in horror over the idea of completing one and its relaxed moment when it doesnt happen to be crisis so this is one lecture which is given when there is crisis to prompt it that makes it peculiar in the field of lectures the crisis by the way is getting your auditing question answered and then some of thesome of the wildest goofs ive heard in long time well how are you today uh i just got my car back thank you but this of course does too apply to some degree to cycle of action cycle of action cannot go on unless all the elements of the cycle of action being used are common to the cycle of action do you follow in other words you cant have cycle of action that goes from white to black you see to gray to black do you get the idea cycle of action would rather have to go from let us say black to gray to less gray to less gray to less gray to less gray to more white to more white to more white to white dont you see then possibly if you wanted complete cycle of action less white less white less white less white slightly gray grayer grayer grayer black now what do we mean by cycle of action this is probably one of the things that would be the most puzzling word here to collide with cycle because cycle is applied in many different directions there is one you ride theyalso theres types that have motors in them there are wheels that go round so that the cycle of wheel is the point that the point of wheel returns to in other words youve got wheel and youve got point at the top the wheel goes all the way around and when it has returned to the top why it has completed cycle do you see im just showing you theres various confusions about this word you didnt laugh at the right joke so thats all rightbut the upshot of this cycle of action is that it has many odd and peculiar connotations and is therefore rather difficult to understand or collide with you follow that you could have wheel that turns all the way around and comes back to the same place see now story cycle of action that began in the field of modern story writing and so on would be story something like this this is very modern story you see and theres bum standing on corner and he is totally degraded and he has just lost his job you see and his wife that he wasnt married to has run off with another man you see and hes standing there and he gets an idea that he might be able to pick himself up out of it and go have cup of coffee you see so he goes and has the cup of coffee and its cold and its very bad coffee and he reaches in his pocket and he finds out theres hole in his pocket and the nickel he had you see haslost and so he is ejected from the place but not even dramatically hes simply told to go with considerable contempt dont you see and we find him back on the same corner in the same position in the same mood worrying about the same thing that is modern story writing if anybody wants to steal that plot and sell it with their writing theyre perfectly welcome to do so now i remember when this modern school first started up by the way the modern school has now become very antique its so old now that lot of people have heard about it when it first started up they had story big brother and it wasnt even in english but they had tremendous fixation on the idea that story had to start and end at the same place in the same situation and they were trying to give an appearance of change so that was what they understood by cyclethat nothing changed and youll find now and then you go to some arty movie made by somebody down in france who didnt have any money and didnt have any film either and frankly theyd have been much better off if theyd shot it with an empty camera but youll occasionally see these things youll pick them up at foreign theater stands you know and itll be something like this and itll always begin and end at the exact same place so cycle has gotten into the field of art and cycle is in the field of mechanicsas different from engineeringas completed revolution cycle in the field of art meaning change of time or everything came back the same way dont you see and in mechanics it is total revolution now in engineering and physics it means something else again it means the motion between the ending of one wave and the beginning of the new wave and i think youll find out that that is probably better expressed definition than the usual engineering definition but that is it you take the end of the last wave which is the beginning of the next wave and it goes on through then to the end of that wave which is the beginning of the next wave and that would be cycle and you have that expressed in radio you see radio all discussions of wavelengths you have it in discussions of color and so on and thats really what theyre talking about theyre talking about sweep now there is an old old old old definition on this which by the way we are indebted to in scientology because theres philosophic aspect to the word cycle and they didnt directly call it cycle butand pardon if i seem to be bit lyrical on the subject but it is in the hymn to the dawn child in the unwritten veda which has been written and then therefore called type of veda but its in the oral tradition you might say to borrow musical term of india and its the hymn to the dawn child ive forgotten whether its the fourth or the tenth vedic hymn but it expresses that there is nothingness and then there is form gradually takes place and then this grows and this ages and then this decays and then this goes into nebulosity and winds up in new nothingness now that is not quote its just an effort to interpret that particular action for you its very short hymn by the way and its quite interesting and it is really part of your technology in scientology you see there have been billions of statements by philosophers and many of them aremore of them are wrong than right but in sorting out the field of philosophythis is sometimes what confuses people i remember explaining krishnamurti to somebody or other very dear old friend who said butbut krishnamurti said many of the things that youre saying in scientology i said give book by krishnamurti so she handed book by krishnamurti and i went down the line and there there was one about time it was direct statement that same statement that we use in scientology see it was right there and she showed that and she says look it there krishnamurti said that i said well where is the boldface and she said what thethe bold the italics the underscore and she said well there isnt any and i said all right lets count the number of statements on this page also about time which arent truenone of which have any emphasis any different emphasis than this one and we counted them up and there were 132 incorrect statements about time and one correct statement about time so i dont think krishnamurti said anything we said see and i taught her the lesson of the evaluation of importance importance assigned to datum is as important as the datum and youll find that in our logics in other words there can be many truths not comparing poor old krishnamurti krishnamurti is mad at us by the way because one of our boys went out to india one time or another and next confounded thing you know he had all of krishnamurtis group out in india studying scientology and i dont think krishnamurti has ever forgiven us but thatshappens to be the truth anyway you get the evaluation of importance here see the evaluation of importance of the datum can be as important as the datum and sometimes more important you could have fifty thousand monkeys writing on fifty thousand typewriters for long time and sooner or later one of them is going to write emcÂ² see and then somebody could come along and point out look those monkeys are as smart as einstein they couldnt be as smart as einstein for the excellent reason that when this was written it was not assigned relative importance to anything you see so its value was not estimated so therefore it wasnt peaked up and although there are great many truths in scientology some of these are peaked you see theyre in boldface you know and theyve got big underscores underneath them cycle of action is one of them it goes back to the early vedic hymns now out of this we get great deal of workable or applied or applicable wisdom in other words we can get very very full application out of this thing this thing will work all day and all night and the cycle of action is of course plot of incident against timeif you wanted to get definition herethe way we are using it you see its plot of consecutive incident against time plot against time now of course were in the advantageous position of knowing the source of time and knowing what time is since we got r6 we have known lot more things than we knew before and we know that time is commonly held consideration which is great big cracking enormous gpm which has got lot of root words with an end word connected to it called time therefore its an agreedupon progress and were all making this time and moving it forward and as result from person to person although the incidents plot against time you see ati better say plot against time at zero seconds the door is opened see at zero plus two seconds the door stands open at zero plus three seconds somebody enters the door at zero plus five seconds somebody is walking at zero plus six seconds somebody sees chair at zero plus seven seconds motion is made toward the chair at zero plus eight seconds the person sits down do you understand now when i say plotting incident against time you see in view of the fact that were all in present timesee of course couldnt be anyplace else because there isnt any you see everybody wonders how do we move along forward in time puzzled for long time well of course its very simple to move along forward in time because nobody is going anyplace you see thats the whole trick back of time see but the incident dont you see which is plotted forward appears to be plot against time and its the incident or consideration of the incident which plots the time and youll find that old people that is old humanoids very often have their days go by whizt whizt whizt you know they just more than get up in the morning and they go to bed at night you know and its just bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz this is commonly held consideration you go around and talk to some of them and they will tell you well you know there used to be lot of time in day but there isnt anymore you know in other words the incident or interest or future you see is goneto lead them forward in timeso therefore you see they have consideration of time the incident plots very bang you see well theres only couple of things happen in the day you know all right now we take little kid maybe five six years old and the day to him is absolutely interminable like little arthur the other day was telling he didnt have anything to do and that he wasnt doing anything and this was just for fun i think it was the other evening i rattled off to him what he was doing and what had happened in the last five minutes in his life and he didnt consider this very much you see his tolerance of incident was very high but he sort of laughed about it and then he still complained that he just didnt have anything to do i didnt make much of an impression on him but he had run in and out of the room three times the dog had taken off one of his shoes and hed put it back on again hed stolen the dogs bone the dog had gotten the bone back he had found one of his toys and thrown it down and then hed gone in the other room and inspected his rocks andin other words it was all this incident my lord man the incident which had taken place you see in those last few minutes and he still didnt think he was doing anything he was doing nothing you see what he meant to say was he was doing nothing in which he was interested in doing so therefore time was passing interminably to him you see under very heavy incident impact you could be more philosophic about it and reduce it down to tolerance of incidentnot tolerance of motion but just tolerance of incident how much incident does somebody want you find out after the warworld war ii amongst my friends and so forthi found out that life was suddenly moving very slowly for all of them life was very dull see they couldnt pick themselves up at all and so forth change of ace was so fantastic you see from hurryscurry hurryscurry bang thud crash bing zop bow dzz zrrp woo bee theer tha bul bung bang incident rur row boom bow crash all of sudden why they settled down to what had been just before the war normal existence to them you see and this normal existence of just this short span of years regardless of their own considerations seemed awfully slow see it just seemed like nothing was happening at all and therefore what had happened well their tolerance of incident had increased even though it was bad for them in numerous cases they still had gotten up to confronting rrrrrrr type of incident dont you see and then all of sudden they dont have that much incident so time oddly enough started to do funny things for them it either went terribly slowly or it went by very rapidly you see because if youd learned to plot your incident and time togetherin other words if you measured your time by the amount of incident occurring and then you didnt have any incidentsee figure it outwhy you obviously wouldnt have any time you follow that thats really what happens to old people they had the house full of people and theyre this and that and their responsibility to soandso and there was jackie coming back from school and there was this and that and then the other thing and all of sudden everybody goes off and gets married or does something and there isnt enough incident you see so therefore the day is going whsht whsht whsht whsht you got the idea amount of incident you cant say you see that the more incident there isyou see it doesnt come down to an engineering proposition of the more incident there is the more time there is or the less incident there is the less time there is nor can you say in reverse you see that the more incident there is the less time there is you see these things dont add up well why dont they just exactly add up and equate well youre dealing with false commodity in the first place see so its never going to add up but its the consideration of it its consideration now we did lot of this with randomity and that sort of thing but that is not as full an explanation as im giving you here today but its the consideration does lot of incident make lot of time or does lot of incident make time now youre going to have somebody around with lot of incident happening in his vicinity and he just suddenly starts sayinglike i do occasionally you knowthere isnt enough time for this incident to happen in see i start getting an emergency on five or six fronts simultaneously while i am doing my research while somebody is calling on for new bulletin dont you see and this is too much incident so i say well there isnt enough time you got the idea so i grab myself by the scruff of the neck you see andyou could get the consideration you are manufacturing the time all you have to do is well i could confront being that busy thats all you actually have to do my consideration for this well all right i can do something about it see and instantly youve suddenly got enough time if you say i cant do anything about these incidents because of the time of course you havent got enough time you got the idea and you can actually practically monitor the amount of time you had by simply changing any consideration you have about how busy you want to be or how much you can handle you sometimesyou can play tricks on yourself this way see you can say well i wanted to be busy busier than i was and i sure got my wish and the next thing you know why youve got enough time you see so its the consideration of how much incident makes how much time that gives or subtracts time from ones existence and thats pretty deep and pretty profound and im afraid that nobody has ever said it before in the field of philosophy but its quite shaking if you really take Ã¤ look at it its how much you decide you can tolerate see how much you decide you can confront or whether or not you are deciding the other way to now this is all compounded by thealso the very difficult situation that you can simply you can get up to point of where you can consider time long or short without measuring it against incident then you see by gradient higher tone you could get up to point and you say well this is going to be long day and itll be long day see well night will be here in time and itll be there in time you practically just turn around and blink and somebody is calling you to supper but were now talking ofin fairly hightoned action normally youre in position where incident is to marked degree monitoring your consideration of time but actually its quite the reverse as you get up its your consideration of incident which is monitoring time and then as you get up above that its simply consideration of how much time there is or isnt i dont know i think you could get high enough toned as thetan to consider that million years was time and find yourself million years up the line you follow this see or consider that evening was couple of years away and just sort of almost live couple of years before evening you get the idea see so there are three points here that we could consider three different attitudes where the person is the total effect of time and hes habituated to the incident monitoring his time but its certain speed of incident monitoring his time dont you see that hes just gotten used tojust habit you know hes always led busy life and therefore his time ishes the effect of that much time hes always led an easy and rather wasteful life so thats his consideration of time dont you see and when that pace changes and so forth hell get reverse consideration of the situation see but thats all in the field of being the effect of time you see one is just total effect one never does anything about the incidents one never lessens or increases the amount of incident one never changes his opinion about the incident one doesnt even know that incident has anything to do with time dont you see you got homo sap there he is all right now lets go upstairs little bit and lets get into level of release or something like this and one recognizes in some way or another thatwell if two different considerations take place one if i get busy time will go by faster and the other reverse consideration can also be held well if i dont do anything why time will go by faster you can also hold that reverse consideration just as easily as the other but the first one i mentioned is the commonest and you sort of get the idea that you could monitor the amount of doingness and you can get into point of how much incident you can confront and you can monitor your time by willingness to confront incident willingness to confront the amount of action in your vicinity youve been living in south peoria amongst the growing sycamores or whatever they have in peoria and life has been drifting by at an 1890 horseandcarriage pace and you all of sudden get on train or plane you go to new york city the taxicab drivers alone are sufficient to change your ideas of time you see well you see thats change of pace now homo sap would regard that you see as simply shocking you know hed just probably voice the fact that he had been affected that would be his total handling of the situation you see somebody whos upscale bit higher could make the consideration you see well hes willing to confront new york and when he goes back to peoria well hes willing to confront peoria see south peoria i wont malign peoria itself 7 you see hes willing to confront that amount of incident well im back home again here and this is the space in which i live and so forth and hed find his time would stay in much better balance now lets take him upstairs abovethe state i just mentioned would be someplace between release and clear now lets take him up someplace to where hes moving into r6 or something like that and hell start getting the spooky notion that he doesnt have to depend upon the exterior incident to measure his consideration of time see so hes simply up into point where hes saying theres lots of time see or there isnt any time see hes waiting for train time see time is elapsing so of course the train arrives almost at once you see andas far as his consideration is concerned you see and hes at big party and everybody is having marvelous time and hes having marvelous time and so forth so he just changes his consideration to the fact that its long party and it is do you see so there are actually these three stages of reaction of course there is reaction below that i should mention which is just unconscious but of course unconsciousness is not reaction its an isnt now we could probably go above that and we get up into ot and so forth and we probably could get pandetermined attitude toward time which would monitor the time of others now were talking prettywere talking pretty pretty swami see i mean this is little bit out of the range of reality so forth but it would be byinstead of selfdeterminism were moving over into pandeterminism and moving over to separately otherdetermining see doing an otherdeterminism see and you get up into that zone why telling what you could do see you have an example of it in fairy tales of the bloke that comes along and waves the magic wand over the sleeping princess and everybody sleeps for hundred years little child ever thinks to ask what happened to the armor and theso forth of the guards and the other people around in the castle dont you see that one sleeping beauty is almost perfect example of pandetermined time see he said theres going to be incident in this joint for hundred years see there wasnt when you get up that high you dont even have to give your postulates in correct english you know so then there is zone above that but of course thats done on the basis of communication and i dont care whether the communication has much distance in it or not youre now speaking in the realms of telepathy and youre speaking in the realms of telepathy powerful enough so that your consideration is able to induce reality in the other person and thats pretty highvoltage telepathy you can see this however you can see this in lower experimental phenomena in the field of hypnotism in the field of mesmerism early stuff back there when they were still experimenting with it hundred years or more ago they knew more about it than they do now theyve forgotten most of that technology but you could tell somebody you see you can tell an hypnotized subject that this has been the span of time dont you see or not been the span of time although i dont know that these blokes ever thought of doing that particularly but theyll get lot of incident and they will think lot of incident has happened and lot of things have gone by and that theyve been out lota long time and their considerations with regard to this would be entirely shifted dont you see but that of course is making somebody the total effect of direct communication it isnt pandetermined up on the upper stages im just showing you that it can be represented experimentally down in the very very low gutters of the scale you can cause incident to occur on projected basis in ways that the modern hypnotist has entirely forgotten i was quite appalled to find out how little is known in the west really about hypnotism i think charcot must have studied in india and mesmer and so forth but this experiment this experiment is fascinating experiment you put another being into rapport which is total bingbang you see with regard to it and it isnt just physical rapport because that other being feels and thinks the thought and feeling of the body of the person who has him mesmerized mesmerism is quite different than hypnotism later boys have mixed these two terms you see you can do this fantastic thing somebody can be put into mesmerized state and then put your hand behind your back when you really get out the bottom why people will say well do you believe in hypnotism you know it isnt anything you believe ini mean its just an experimental activity and you can pinch yourself in the back and the person whos mesmerized even though their eyes are closed and so forth will leap convulsively and if their back is examined your fingernail marks will appear on their back quite interesting in other words you can produce physical pandeterminism you see see youve determined their determinism and that is also in an experimental zone this of course is quite unethical to play around with amongst the poor bloke homo sap walking already up to his neck in muck and trouble dont you see and somebody mesmerizes him or hypnotizes him and upsets what little sense of value he has left because the only thing the poor bloke has got is his own selfdeterminism dont you see the only thing hes got left is that tiny tiny spark of power of choice dont you see well when you overcome that you just throw him into total effect then that mud just goes down right up over his head see but im just giving you an example just to communicate the idea that that is low harmonic on an upper state with regard to the telepathy of time and incident see so at very very high levelat very very high level not making anybody pushed into the mud or something like this you get somebody thinking its long day and everybody in the city begins to agree that its long day you see you get the idea you could also have this sort of thing going on it doesnt even have to do totally with time itd be the actions were engaged in are happinessproducing actions see that consideration could be added to the cycle of action you see its happinessproducing action and everybody working around there theyd think they were doing fine you see well you could produce the opposite effect of the actions in which we are engaged are miseryproducing actions you see and everybody would feel miserable and feel like they were forming overts by doing any action at all and weve got lot of that in this society in which we live which is changing peoples attitude toward time and the prime criminal in this is the newspaperthe press of fleet street its all scandal and its all bad and all the employers are bad and everybody is bad and theres nobody good and nothing happy has happened at all and your actions are not producing any happiness and the worker is totally walked on and stepped on and ought to be shot in hisought to shoot everybody in his tracks dont you see because hes being made to work you see you get the idea youre spreading then on pandeterminism basisbut on very finite lowgrade communication lines you seethe idea of worthless series of incidents so therefore this will do something to peoples time and the amount of doingness of society is tremendously dependent on whether or not they are being told that their cycle of actionor whether they believe or agree that their cycle of action should proceed or shouldnt proceed and so we move over into the field of the word action now action weve got cycle of action all right lets take upwe got cycle you know what that isall right lets take up action so an action is simply motion through space having certain speed its speed could be fast or it could be slow it could move across lot of space it could move across sixteenmillionth of millimeter see but it would be an action now theres lot of bad connotation to the word action in the field of literature action stories are supposed to be bad stories you see this word in the field of psychology has gotten to be nasty spitinthespittoon sort of word all these civildefense blokes in the united states are carefully trained that if anybody gets active during an atomic bombing they should instantly be incarcerated i know that sounds psychotic and it is and the psychological assistance of civil defense which has been organized in the united states at this particular time has been carefully trained to take any individual who is in action and put him out of action fast with cop or straitjacket or something see and thats what hes trained to do i asked the embarrassing question well what if the fellow was engaged in trying to put out fire well they say that would all be done by the local authorities so that doesnt come into the problem and i found out that local authority local authority youll have to cut that off the tapea local authority is not being which was quite interesting to but being is anybody who isnt local authority and if person isnt local authority and he is active or in action or is proposing action or any of these other things then the job of the psychological assistantof which theyre breeding lots of themand the psychiatrist and anybody else and the cop on the beat is supposed to turn over this person alsohes supposed to be instantly gotten out of the way and strapped down and bang see there must be action its sort of interesting to that this word action which is primarily and purely simply something which denotes motion and could be said to be perhaps volitional motion or intended motion could become bad thing you see so theres all sorts of conflict going on about this of course if fellow you know on soccer team or something like that who is supposed to stop the ball from going in some particular direction just stood there and didnt move over in front of the ball why hed be terribly booed dont you see but in some other part of the society you seethats inaction inaction there is bad you see but in some other part of the society action is bad you know and psychiatry has this so bad that they think person is cured when they become inactive and thats one thing which you as scientologist have never been able to understand about psychiatry you think im kidding you or something like that you know but thats merely misalignment of their intention theres something wrong there see if this fellow is active and hes got something wrong with himhes had label hung on his chest or something like that and hes activethen he is unwell and must be restrained and that is the real action behind an electric shock and prefrontal lobotomy its the action in which the person is engaged which is the criteria of what treatment he gets so well person is then catatonic schizophrenic very fancy word which means somebody just lies still stiff and never moves so in the fieldin the mental field this word action is very bad wordvery very bad word it fits along with agitated frenzied disturbed see these are all the samesame thing see so weve gotten this word pulled down here amongst bunch of brothers it doesnt go with and this has thrown the whole field of mental healing so called in the western world at this particular time for loop its whether or not you get the idea its not whether or not he went back to his job and did his job its whether or not he was active and you talking to psychiatrist wouldnt make any sense at all because hed say active meaning crazy and youd say active meaning constructive see so you wouldnt be talking the same vocabulary because of their abuse of this word action see so you must realizeyou must realizethat the prevention of motion is fairly prevalent particularly in mentalhealing circles the prevention of motion and therefore there is something marvelous about the state of inaction now we are not the only people to comment on the subject of action or inaction but certainlyalthough we follow far more traditional areas such as man is spirit hes not dog that sort of thingrealize that in the field of mysticism one of your main complaints about mysticism and one of the bad bugs that there is in mysticism is the image of the wise or totally elevated individual or the finely refined individual as totally inactive one see thats your little point of argument you say hey wait minute you see fireman putting out fire could be totally calm and collected he could go about it with completely apparent effortless efficiency you see well thats very hightoned but fireman who would sit and regard his navel would be crazy you see the difference so you as scientologists have seen this for long time now youve even coined word i didnt coin this word youve coined quite lot of words you know amongst you i hear you say them i see them in auditors reports they become prevalent and so forth so very often i start to use them and youve got one called mystic mystic you know mystical mystic ive heard this word bang around inside organizations and so forth the mystical mystic and its case its case type its commonly scientology agreedupon case type this person is mystical mystic and theyll process that person in accordance and by that they mean that the person will be totally reasonable about anything that happens in their vicinity but not do anything about it and see nothing but good in anything including murdering babies you see its this unreasonableness which youre protestingthe mystical mystic but thats borne out of the fact that running alongside of great deal of wise wisdom some awfully bad wisdom has been carrying forward on the basis that all you would do if you were really elevated is you would sit on mountaintop and regard your navel and not look at the world or not look at anything engage in nothing participate nowhere be effective nowhere at all engage in action of any kind be totally detached nothing to do with you be completely aloof and so forth and you ask lot of people what an ot is and theyll describe that see an ot is much more likely to be ball of fire but of course this is selfprotective mechanism people would like to believe this we have somebody in england who is absolutely frantic every time you mention the idea of ot and has even come up to and said please ron dont release these techniques please please please dont go in that direction my god itd be worse than the invention of the atom bomb you realize what is liable to happen if you set these people loose and so forth and hes really worried or he was maybe somebody got to him because its been few months ago and there have been lot of scientologists around you cant ever tell what will happen to somebodys character in that case but they probably got him talked out of it but there his fear is that somebody would become powerful or strong which is fear of somebody causing lot of action or somebody getting very active see which almost fits back against the psychiatrists definition his fear of action well whats somebody liable to do uhhuhhuh of course your best answer to that was well the best solution to that is for you to become ot too theres reasoning with such person just give themif everybodys gonna become wolves you better not remain rabbit its very good sales campaign but it has very little to do with the facts of the case because the level of responsibility rises and rises and rises dont you see along with it they lose sight of this sort of thing now the idea of action then is all sullied up and messed up whether or not things should go forward or not go forward you see whether or not time should advance or not advance whether or not incidents should take place or not take placejust as general principle not should some incidents take place and some incidents not take place well thats sane consideration but you get this insane attitude toward it which is simply incidents should take place or all kinds of incidents should take place and then person eventually pulls out of that into lower grade of well its all going on and it has nothing to do with and im afraid homo sap is walking into that particular category right now at very very fast rate of speed its all going on and it has nothing to do with i can do nothing about it and so forth you see declining society normally holds this and society which has bit of zip left in it society which is still rising and so forth well everything has to do with everybody you know theyll say ho ho ho and they take lot of responsibility for that sort of thing well you take early nineteenthcentury america i imagine somebody would have walked miles to convince joe down in dog hollow that he was dead wrong to vote for president fillmore you know you just really work at it you know it had to do with him and it had to do with them well the modern think well what can i do about it dont you see its life cant do very much about it you get hot roaring campaign issue whereby people really does feel challenged or attacked and so forth theyll get up and start saying well it does have something to do with they have to be pushed pretty far back before they begin to say that something like that is occurring right at the present moment in the united states and lot of people are just going to go along with the tide lot of people are starting to fight the end product of that lord knows what that will be it might not be in 1964 but certainly you will see the end product of it by 1968 driven too far see so even the fellow who says it has nothing to do with at last has to admit that it has something to do with him i remember i was trying to convince somebody that the atomic bomb had something to do with him i think ive told you this joke before but i finally moved it on down i got on down to his wallet and his social security card and all of sudden realized that that would be affected if bomb went off in his vicinity and he became very concerned about atomic fission see i just kept cutting the gradients down getting closer and closer to him until he finally got associated with it but even killing his children didnt have anything to do with him well your children are liable to be killed off dont you see oh i dont nothing to do with him so you can approach person closely enough with action and hell retreat retreat retreat and when he cant retreat any further you get the corneredrat effect you know hell turn around and go the other way politicians are always making this mistake they always misestimate the moment and theyll see this supine population that is taking everything that is shoveled out to it its being charged 110 percent of all of its income its being made to stand and bow every time policeman goes by you see all this and they see this totally docile population and they say well we can do anything we please you see and they do the anything you please and all of sudden they do one too many anythings you see and all of sudden they get the corneredrat effect see all of sudden it does have something to do with the population and then theres controlling it at all because these people are rather irresponsible and their control of action is so foreign to themtheyve forgotten how to control action dont you seethat their actions just go brow its like barroom brawl you really in barroom brawl you never really can identify who started the fight or whos against you or whos for you dont you see just everybody starts slugging everybody its very interesting to be in the middle of barroom brawl i have been in some of the less seemly places of the world and emerged with whole skin but its very interesting to see one blow up well this is amidst bunch of drunks and theyre all happy and cheerful whod care less and have another drink bill you see and all of sudden one says theres two heads on dime or something and the other one says there aint two heads on dime and yes there is two heads on dime ill show you you see well you cant show and all of sudden wham see all these people that have been sitting there supine and so forthbottles are flying through the air these two fellows start to fight these two these these these fellows fight thoseyoud never know whos friends of whose or anything of the sort youd say the best thing to do in case like that is to back up into corner and barricade yourself with table but let assure you that that is very unsafe tactics because somebody else will have the same idea and hell 13 fight with you for the table so action also gets the bad connotation and thoroughly bad connotation it can get because it can produce pain it can produce destructiveness pain and so forth so when somebody is overly concerned about being hurt theyre pretty nuts you know they think you only live once and they think theyve got to preserve the body to the ultimate degree they think pain is something that nobody can confront and they certainly cant confront it because they got so many overts on it something like that when people cannot confront pain of any kind and so forth you will find that they also are refusing to confront action and when they cease to confront action they cease to confront incident and they wont advance cycle of action and their sense of time goes completely bad i didnt say that psychiatry and psychology and so forth had backed themselvesand medicinehad backed themselves into this exact position because i didnt have to i think you could understand that clearly the only thing doctor can ever tell you is be quiet you know take it easy dont you see its rather bad advice hes given the patient longer time of illness whether the patient is in bed more weeks or not illness is now going to move along longer for the patient dont you see what if he said well you can lie there in bed if you want to but lets get some things that interest you and lets get some of this and that and so forth and you better have some people come in to see you and so forth and so on the guy would have an idea that time is passing very quickly and this has remarkable effect upon healing see it takes so long to heal and if youve got lot of time passed then youd heal quickly wouldnt you you get the various considerations how they entangle here so theres these various upsets then on the subject of action the avoidance of action and then there is of course pugnacity will set in where its all got to be action or its all got to be destructive action for instance hitler should have had some processing he had it all won up to the point where he had to have more action were not quite sure why he had to have more action but of course he went into faster level of action than he could confront or anybody else could confront and that was destruction so when you get more action than you can confront you normally get destruction and this also gives the cycle of action bad name because people think that cycle of action inevitably ends in decay and death and its at that point that we depart from the vedic hymn of the dawn child you see they assumed that it was all going to decay and die do you see how that doesnt necessarily represent cycle of action at allthat its all going to go on newly newly newly and then peel off and then die dont you see but were taught this on every hand every flower apparently is designed this way buildings are designed this way and so forth and you have so many examples of cycle of action ending in disaster and the completeness of disaster being the total end of the cycle of action that it makes people quite unwilling to complete cycle of action they say well if i completed cycle ill showgive you very direct application of this if i completed cycle of action on the preclear why hed be an old decayed corpse do you see what hes crossassociated here see so cycle of action philosophically and in the physical universe is very often looked on as something which goes from birth through growth to momentary stability through decay to death and that is so built into the physical universe that it is barrier to people completing cycle of action and somebody is worried about this sort of thing when they never seem to be able to complete cycle of action on pc never flatten process never really go through the auditing cycle and so forth they are up against something there which prevents their arrival they mustnt arrive they mustnt get to that final point theyre afraid to get to that final point so they will go bzoodle so something could be wrong with their concept of the idea of cycle and something could be wrong with their concept of the idea of action but certainly the cycle of action is not being completed with regard to what they are trying to do and you in supervising the case or in trying to handle this situation and so forth can actually beat your brain to fine feathered froth trying desperately to figure out how do i get this guy to complete this cycle of action you call in joe and you say now look on auditing this pcauditing this pcget your auditing question answered your auditing question answered i mean you got that now now what have i just said to you auditing question answered oh yes of course i know that yes yes whuhuh of course he also is saying back there it has nothing to do with see oh yes so you see this session the next time and you see well pete how have you been today uh the trees are pretty arent they thank you very much you say look look even on twoway comm for gods sakes get the pc to answer something that has some relation haoh of course yes i know that yes i know that but you see this cycle of action cycle out maybe action out maybe destruction and death being the end of all cycles of action we mustnt arrive so the best way not to arrive is never follow cycle of action see always just follow random action that has nothing to do with completing any cycle of action and when you run into that too much those are the things which you will find wrong with the auditor something wrong with cycle something wrong with action and the other thing which i mentioned earlier that the individualconfrontation of incident well for instance you know you know an easyrunning pc can very often upset some auditors because they change so rapidly and the auditor he more than gets grooved down into auditing whatever the command was and the process goes and gets flat and heres new incident see youve got two conditions then either the tone arm action has been run out of process and it is continued see because one cant confront the incident see of change in the pc to this degree or on the other hand one stops running the process when there is still lot of tone arm action going on because we know whatll happen if we complete the cycle of action well kill the pc obviously so we better not kill any pcs ron says not to kill pcs so anyway you see that very often you are trying in trying to get auditing accomplished and so forth you very often are trying to get it accomplished against this thing called cycle of action and we mustnt have cycle of action on the part of the person and yet auditing depends on the cycle of action so its all this rather long series of considerations which i have been giving you which complicate the auditing cycle and it can be avoided by not getting the auditing question answered it can be avoided by not acknowledging the pc see it can be avoided by well not asking any question at allthats also solution you see it can be avoided by never really getting the pc insession so that you start auditing the pc dont you see one could go to the extreme and decide that its all over anyway so that it doesnt matter what one does now you see whole bunch of considerations can occur around it using these various elements of which ive been talking to you considerations of cycle considerations of action and considerations of the whole cycle of action which is the fact that its liable to end up in death and destruction so all of these things will compound and will show up in an auditing session now where youve got somebody with these points very astray and adrift and who either has got to have too much motion from the pc or has got to have too little motion for the pc because his confrontation of the amount of incident see is offwhen these things are awry then you have trouble with this thing called the auditing cycle and the auditing cycle is simply nothing but the broad auditing cycle of session we sit down and we start session and you get the pc in session and we run the session and then we run it on through and we end the session and we continue series of sessions unto we finally have the process that were running flat dont you see or this pc has come to us to be audited for his lumbosis and we cure his lumbosis and thats the end of the situation see thats the broadthe big one but that really isnt an auditing cycle technically thats session cycle or an intensive cycle dont you see thats the cycle of the case and so forth what we mean very precisely when we say auditing cycle is simply your tr 0 to 4 that is very severely precisely an auditing cycle in the finest purest meaning of the word it is simply the petebill hello okay you know i mean he says do birds fly thank you see and the auditing cycle which goes on the bigger perimeter of do birds fly uh hm you know i used to watch flying birds when i was boy tsk yeah i used to have lot of fun watching flying birds boy oh yeah all right all right now do birds fly uh yeah yeah they sure do thank you see see thats really all there is to it but when you get to throw in the number of cognitions pc can get the number of changes pc can experience the complexities of various processes right up to r6what youve got to do in order to do thisthis auditing cycle is still very dominant but it is so overwhelmed and surrounded by the tremendous complications of the auditors action that if he hasnt got it down right he cant audit do you see that hes just going to be all thumbs whats missing is the auditing cycle and if he hasnt gotten an auditing cycle in by the time hes studied up the line pretty fair well theres just something wrong with these points ive taken up with you today in this lecture hes got some wild considerations with regard to this he cant confront incidents or hes got to confront too much incident or you know his concept of time is out or his cycle is out or his concept of the death and destruction of the situation is out hes got the wrong idea of action you see itll lie somewhere in that direction and if you then cleaned that up with the individual youd find all of sudden that he found these other processes very easy hes always having trouble let us say with complicated process hes saying he has trouble with complicated process whereas hes not having trouble with complicated process at all ive seen you use the most complicated processes anybody ever dreamed of dont you see and the only thing ive ever seen you have any trouble with is the cycle of action see that is the cornerstone on which all such actions take place itll be those various elements and itll be those various things now i havent answered one question in this lectureis although cycle means various things in various departments and so forth what does it mean in scientology and i havent said what it meant in scientology and it just means thefrom the beginning to the conclusion of an intentional action thats what cycle means in scientology as far as were concerned its the beginning to the conclusion of an intended action intended see has to be highertoned definition than your other definitions and you can consider it in these other departments too at the same time see its perfectly all right but it has something to do with the tone of the person who is using the definition cycle of action is the moment when my mother looks at to the moment she whips see thats an otherdetermined definition see as we move the definition on up its from the beginning to the end of the intended action thats very loose wide definition but it could be that the only other thing id leave up in the air is how could possibly one go about straightening up these various things with somebody well ill give you very complicated process and so forth that i would thoroughly recommend to take care of this and thats just itsa on these subjects and youll find out that within the limits of all levels would be the most embracive of these okay audience mmmm thank you very much
