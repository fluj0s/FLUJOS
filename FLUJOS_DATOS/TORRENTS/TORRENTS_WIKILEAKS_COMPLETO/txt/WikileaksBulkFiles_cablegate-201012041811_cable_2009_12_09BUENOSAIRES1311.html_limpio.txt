remark regarding business communitys concerns derived from dscg 051 b d 1 c summary the goa responded with heavy artillery to remark wha as valenzuela made during december 16 press roundtable immediately after the press roundtable argentine media started focusing almost exclusively on as valenzuelas remark that the american business community in argentina had conveyed to him concern about rule of law and management of the economy in argentina the press reported that valenzuela contrasted these concerns with the enthusiasm and investment intentions of the american business community in 1996 goa officials also expressed their dissatisfaction with the remarks the ambassador and other country team members used december 17 reception for journalists to stress our desire to work constructively with argentina and the ambassador has reached out to goa officials to urge prompt end to their criticisms government press is beginning to report softening tone but we think that it is too early to tell end summary 2 c immediately prior to departure from buenos aires on december 16 wha as valenzuela met at the embassy with about dozen argentine print journalists he followed 20 minutes of remarks by taking questions for another 20 minutes explaining his desire to introduce himself to his regional counterparts and undertake dialogue with them on regional developments media zero in on perceived criticism 3 c despite the broad range of issues addressed by as valenzuela argentine media started focusing immediately after the roundtable almost exclusively on as valenzuelas remark that the american business community in argentina had conveyed to him concern about rule of law and management of the economy in argentina the press also reported that valenzuela contrasted these concerns with the enthusiasm and investment intentions of the american business community in 1996 as valenzuelas first official meeting in buenos aires was with the executive board of the amcham as an example of the sensationalist nature of much of the reporting nacions banner frontpage headlines on december 17 read clash with the us over rule of law in argentina and on december 18 protest to us over obama envoys criticism kirchner allies take umbrage 4 c the goa response came swiftly that same night three goa ministries publicly commented in clearly coordinated fashion on the valenzuela remarks interior minister florencio randazzo said argentina is enjoying phase of complete institutional and legal guarantees the country has left behind the times when foreign official could come and say what needed to be done there is lack of rule of law the difference now is that the government protects the people and in the 1990s it protected the companies interests that took millions out 5 c following the randazzo statement the foreign ministry issued fourpoint communiquc saying that 1 the generalized nature of the assistant secretarys remarks about supposed concerns in the american business community made it impossible for the goa to address the alleged concerns 2 the mfa had already written ambassador martinez to clarify similar remarks that she had made the previous week in cordoba but had received reply 3 argentine authorities had received complaints from american companies operating in argentina and 4 the goa reiterates its disposition to analyze all aspects that allow us to promote reciprocal relations especially economic between the two countries open and consolidated channels are available to both governments for this dialogue 6 c the goas third statement on december 16 came from justice minister julio alak who called valenzuelas statements unusual and unjustified alak claimed that rule of law is fundamental asset in the country that has been protected and rescued from the more adverse conditions coming from the institutional and economic crisis in 2001 and 2002 7 c after the initial salvos the goa officials who met with valenzuela chimed in vice foreign minister victorio taccetti who received valenzuela december 15 at the mfa and hosted him for lunch said valenzuela is free to think as he wishes but the truth is that 1996 is the prelude of the most important crisis argentina faced it is possible that he felt glad in 1996 but that ended in the 2001 crisis that impacted many companies including some american ones argentina doesnt want to set off sparks sacarse chispas with the united states it is valenzuela who opines without basing his statements on reality 8 c cabinet chief ancbal ferncndez said we are not talking about statement that comes from american businessmen but of valenzuelas prejudices and that is much more sensitive and what worries most i was concerned to find out that he was critical of many latin american democracies and one of the supporters of the washington consensus 9 c argentine ambassador to the united states hcctor timerman appeared on television and in the press to claim that he had urged as valenzuela to meet with cgt labor leader hugo moyano and the opposition radical party ucr but that he met only with the political right narvcez macri and cobos he is sending message on who are in his views the people with whom he needs to have dialogue 10 c argentine press reported that fm jorge taiana who was in copenhagen for the cop15 meetings used brief pullaside with secretary clinton to complain about valenzuelas remarks taiana told the press that valenzuelas words were unfortunate and show his ignorance of the argentine reality his reference to the administration of menem as time of great growth when it was precisely the time when argentina was hurling headlong toward its worst crisis in history like train with brakes was even more unfortunate 11 c former president nestor kirchner said the statements by someone who should come with different policy for latin america are deplorable valenzuela belongs to the groups that participated in the washington consensus the neoliberal model that caused so much damage to the whole region kirchner ally deputy agustcn rossi leader of the fpv bloc in the chamber said valenzuelas visit was not encouraging we thought the time when foreign officials came to lecture us was over regarding valenzuelas comparison of the current reality with the one in the 1990s he said it is fallacy to say we were better with menems administration the cracks of the convertibility plan were evident and led argentina to bankruptcy the leader of the fpv bloc in the senate miguel pichetto said valenzuela keeps adding mistakes to the us relation to latin america because diplomat visiting country should be much more cautious when commenting on our domestic politics and the economic recovery our government achieved couple of days later at december 20 political rally nestor kirchner said disrespectful viceroys should first criticize what was happening in the united states he blamed argentinas loss of rule of law on the us crisis that left millions of americans without their jobs homes or savings opposition is divided 12 c reaction among the opposition was divided some such as santa fe governor hermes binner highly regarded moderate socialist and possible presidential candidate said that valenzuelas remarks tracked very closely with complaints that they too had heard from the business community others such as socialist senator ruben giustiniani who usually coincides with binner objected to any foreign official relaying any criticism of argentina while radical congressional deputy ricardo alfonscn took issue with what he interpreted as valenzuelas praise for menem policies in the 1990s we the argentines know that during those years there was looting of national assets for us it was disaster however the head of the radical party ucr senator ernesto sanz who joined valenzuelas december 16 lunch with vice president cobos said it seems it was necessary that foreigner come to say this we have been denouncing the lack of rule of law from congress for four or five years with each law the kirchnerists passed the country moved one step towards lack of rule of law another prominent opposition leader deputy margarita stolbizer gen said unfortunately valenzuela is right this government condemned us to isolation because of lack of rule of law and valenzuela only relayed how the world sees us leftist congressional deputy and film director pino solanas proyecto sur bloc leader said i strongly repudiate arturo valenzuelas statements he is the envoy of the empire whose government has legitimized the coup in honduras mr valenzuela represents the government that keeps thinking the disastrous and tragic 1990s for argentina are model to follow embassy works to smooth feathers 13 c the ambassador and other country team members used december 17 reception for journalists to stress our desire to work constructively with argentina stressing our common interests and extensive cooperation the ambassadors conciliatory remarks received broad press play the ambassador called vfm taccetti who offered her long explanation of why the goa in the wake of the 200102 crisis had been forced to pesify contracts that had been denominated in dollars at new exchange rate that was disadvantageous to foreign businesses note pesification has been common theme of many of the complaints that us investors took to the world banks international court for the settlement of investment disputes those pesified contracts nonetheless continued to be profitable taccetti claimed he said argentinas current challenge however was to maintain employment levels which explained the goa position regarding kraft and other labor disputes taccetti asked if washington could issue conciliatory statement the ambassador also requested meeting with cabinet chief anibal fernandez to urge prompt end to goa public complaining about as valenzuelas remarks press reported widely as valenzuelas clarification delivered at his next stop montevideo that he was merely relaying some concerns expressed to him by american businesses operating in argentina goa tones down its commentary 14 c the goas telam news service sent december 18 story that led with cabinet chief anibal fernandez sought today to lower the tone on the controversy generated by valenzuelas remarks the wire story quoted fernandez saying he had very good conversation with valenzuela on important topics and valenzuela never mentioned concerns about rule of law fernandez claimed that valenzuela had several years ago made similar claims about argentine rule of law suggesting predisposition to judge argentina but this man is not the united states matter how important he is the united states is the united states another wire service reported that vfm taccetti said this topic has already passed maybe valenzuela knows why he said it we think its absurd we are looking straight ahead i think the points of agreement between united states and argentina were aired in the meetings we had one else in the region has been more firm on iran we are working in haiti the agreements are notable in general us policies and ours on international matters are in agreement amcham pleased with press coverage 15 c amcham told posts commercial counselor that it was taking positive response to press inquiries talking up the positive contributions their members make to argentinas economy and their desire for dialogue with the goa on the business and investment climate subsequently some amcham members told us privately that they were pleased highranking us diplomat publicly relayed their concerns the amcham president said he intended to take advantage of the opening offered by the mfas request for specific concerns about the business climate by sending the mfa letter requesting meeting to review concerns in detail comment 16 c once again the kirchner government has shown itself to be extremely thinskinned and intolerant of perceived criticism concerns about the weakness of argentinas institutions and the rule of law in particular are dime dozen in the argentine press voiced by academics business leaders judges opposition politicians pundits and ngos argentines are well aware that argentina is not attracting as much investment as are brazil chile and others in the region the business communitys anxiety about arbitrary and capricious rule changes is well known to the argentine public and the government only diehard kirchneristas will agree with randazzos assertion that argentina enjoys full institutional and juridical guarantees or the mfas contention that it is unaware of any dissatisfaction on the part of any american company for most argentines those are laugh lines or cynically disingenuous statements that said we hope that this contretemps will soon peter out as has happened in similar such episodes in the past 17 u this cable was cleared by wha as valenquela martinez
