analyze and develop recom mendations regarding joint urban and coin operations they were characterized by 1 their focus being primarily the operational and strategic levels of war 2 their coverage encompass ing the full spectrum of conflict and 3 the nations of afghanistan and iraq serving as the primary though not exclusive sources of material the first in the earlier trio people make the city joint urban operations observations and insights from afghanistan and iraq 1 was broad based general study of the topics and theaters in question the second tale of three cities 2 sought instead to investigate three urban operations in detail and draw material of interest to potential users by finding commonalities and comparing operations conducted in iraq by the us army in mosul us marine corps fallujah and british army basrah and amara continuing counterinsurgency challenges 3 was the third such offering it took differ ent approach one similar to that used in this effort continuing counterinsurgency challenges focused on selected key issues identified during interviews and literature searches as being particularly difficult the research underlying this report took on two additional areas that are notable both for the consistency of difficulties they present and the complexity of solutions related to those problems intel operations chapter two and metrics chapter three are the stars in the pages to follow more general look at various coin and urbanrelated issues accompanies them in chapter four as did its predecessors this work draws on the insights and suggestions offered by the many interviewed in support of its underlying research in addition to material from appli cable written sources and previous work in the urban operations and coin realms it does not seek to be comprehensive evaluation of the current state of affairs regarding intel met rics or coin issues but rather seeks to identify key insights pertinent to the three areas and make recommendations based on interviewee inputs and the authors previous research into these and other topics some of the material will be familiar to those knowledgeable about the subjects addressed other insights will be new to many the inclusion of what might seem to 1 glenn paul and helmus 2007 2 glenn and helmus 2007 3 glenn 2007cunclassifiedfor official use only rel to usaausnzlisrnato

with counter insurgency capacity building or irregular conflictall of which underlie the work here knows that lessons are far more often relearned than newly discovered as this report seeks to serve both those currently confronting the tasks associated with such undertakings and any in future years having to do so we think it better to cover both the sometimesknown and origi nal material additionally benefit of interviewing so many insightful individuals is the access the sessions offer to innovative thinking molded by one persons intellect in light of his or her experiences we therefore seek to offer the reader these insights so that they might be adapted to meet the demands of challenges elsewhere in place and time when appropriate the following overarching question guided our work what challenges and best practices pertaining to intel metrics andon byexception basiscounterinsurgency are worthy of analysis given the current state of field knowledge the nature of ongoing operations and likely future demands on us and coalition partner organizations the results of this years effort provide more than 150 individual idr entries see the appendixes there are in addition 12 synthesis recommendations these are briefly summa rized below and along with others of lesser scope or impact receive considerably fuller discus sion in their respective chapters synthesis observations and insights the civilian population is key source of intel and may well be the friendlyforce center of gravity protect it against attack by both the enemy and your own forces despite wide acceptance of the populations importance to coin success too little attention is given to protecting members of the noncombatant community threats in this regard include insurgent criminal and other malevolent groups too often the friendly force is also perceived as threat negatively influencing civilian willingness to cooperate with coalition intel collec tion and other initiatives recognizing that treating civilians and detainees with respect can have great benefits is an inherent extension of this recommendation both cases will pose ongoing challenges given deliberate insurgent efforts to inspire coalitionmember hatred of local nationals and frustra tions arising due to the indirect methods that threat forces use to inflict casualties on friendly forces consider giving selected companies 24hour intelanalysis capability while investigating providing battalions more robust intel section coin operations and in particular coin operations in urban areas rely on human intel humint much of the most valuable humint comes from the lowest tactical echelons the full value of these inputs can be lost when they are forwarded to higher echelons for analy sis

informants combine longer rotations with policies that 1 bring families in closer proximity to deployed personnel 2 allow for more frequent breaks of equitable duration and 3 result in staffing levels and leader selection allowing reasonable periods of daily and weekly rest personnel turnover hinders intel operations in number of ways in addition to the inefficien cies associated with recent arrivals learning curve limitedduration tours mean that those in analysis and other critical billets have less time to familiarize themselves 1 with the theater and their areas of operation aos in general sense and 2 more intimately such that pat terns become apparent anomalies are readily detected and they become completely familiar with databases additionally members of the indigenous population form personal relation ships meaning that departure of coalition representatives severs or degrades the quality of coalition contacts with them improve database development through better sharing and insistence on compatible technologies and software transition intel communities from their needtoknow default to needtoshare mentality creating and maintaining databases of key members of the population infrastructure threat and other relevant elements have proven fundamental to successful lawenforcement and intel operations during past coin operations there is call for better guidance regarding database development improved theater and broader accessibility and enhanced datamanipulation tools as one observer noted the ability of market trackers to store and quickly recall historical data should be mim icked by the us government so that commanders and diplomats possess relevant records that enable them to make decisions that take into account the economic historical cul tural political anthropological and environmental aspects of the region they are operating within 4 properly programmed such efficient data handlers could automatically crosscheck the varied spellings of personal and place names so common to arabic thereby reducing confusion and allowing for uniformity on maps documents and other materials5 organizational structures and procedures are part of current datasharing shortfalls in the immediate term forces should find ways to improve sharing and eliminate intel stovepipes collocating intel sections encouraging the presence of liaison personnel in intelfusion centers and taking the time to find ways to share rather than automatically restrict access can all be part of the process in the longer term they should improve sharing via removal of

structural barriers to timely exchange of relevant intel material including those that limit distribution to agencies other than defense and intel agencies develop sourceidentification and datatagging procedures that permit collecting organizations to compare humint sources while retaining the sources anonymity more than 40 years have passed since the us buildup in vietnam yet the same problem of single individual selling information to multiple indigenous and coalition intel agencies tinues to plague analysis and corroboration of information employing retinal scans or other means of tagging intel from sources who need protection would allow comparison of sources without compromising them given properly designed software it would have the additional benefit of allowing agencies to 1 identify those selling identical or similar information to several organizations thus precluding seemingly separate sources from acting to confirm each other and 2 curtail multiple agencies paying the same source for comparable input consider the appointment of intel supremos both in theaters and at the strategic level to oversee facilitate and monitor more effective sharing of intel and general improvement in field effectiveness such managers would have the authority to manage service and interservice communications and intelsystem acquisitions they would further be responsible for maintaining theater and strategic databases eliminating intel stovepipes facilitating intel exchange between nations agencies and other organizations generally enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of intel operations introduce the creation use and employment of effectbased metrics into all echelons of leader and staff training training must include understanding of the link between causality or correlation and outcomes the importance of incorporating local conditions in metric development and assessment and the use of qualitative and quantitative metrics to form compound metrics for aggregation and interpretation at higher levels of command forces should capture best metricdevelopment practices from ongoing operations in par ticular with respect to those that measure effects rather than effort or performance they should improve understanding of the role of qualitative metrics effective presentation of quali tative data development of compound metrics and essentiality of maintaining unbroken links between measures of progress and operational and strategic objectives they should establish set of nested metrics to facilitate translation to useful measures of progress at higher levels however realizing that some metrics may be unique to given locations and situations forces should not discard them because they do not fit the nesting effortunclassifiedfor official use only rel to usaausnzlisrnato unclassifiedfor official use only rel to usaausnzlisrnatosummary xvii conduct periodic systematic reassessment and refinement of metrics review metric baselines to ensure that they remain relevant operational conditions change especially in the dynamic environments found in major urban areas metrics must maintain alignment with operations meaning that measures have to undergo routine systematic review for their applicability in light of changed situations and evolving objectives establish doctrinal metric framework that promotes objective definition from the top and identification of input measures from the bottom with effects as the common linkage there is an outstanding need for improved formal guidance regarding the roles development and application of metrics in operational environments measuring progress toward objectives or lack thereof is impossible unless those at higher echelons define the objectives sought lead ers at lower echelons are most familiar with what metrics will best demonstrate whether there is movement toward these objectives definition of metrics must therefore be cooperative undertaking one that shares the common link of seeking to measure the effects of actions on realizing objectives rather than reporting only expenditure of effort use redteam approach to assist metric development and evolution the linkage of metrics with plan phases operational effects and mission objectives argues for their development and validation becoming part of the orderdevelopment and planning processes testing and validating metric viability should be incorporated in wargaming and similar processes seeking to refine proposed metrics and optimize the quality of decisions portray metrics by using simple easytounderstand tools that facilitate commander decisions challenges in presenting options and supporting data to commanders have increased in junction with similar rise in the complexity of modern operations current data presenta tions often seek to present more information per unit space and time less attention is given to determining what information to present and what is less important development of training and commandandcontrol c2 systems should give greater emphasis to informationselection techniques and processes develop truly interagency campaign plans and put the organizational structures in place to manage the campaign in accordance with plan guidance overarching orchestration of activities in afghanistan and iraq still lacks true interagency character aid expenditures overlap in some instances and undermine operational objectives in others personnel and organization rotations lack consistency as each leader attempts to put his or her mark on tour in theater lessons learned assist training and analysis as never before but remain constrained primarily to military issues there is an urgent need for accelerated movement toward substantive

operations and metrics in iraq and afghanistan hole difficulties there compress in time and space to present dense mass of tribulations for any seeking peace and stability whereas conventional warriors both figuratively and literally set their sights on the enemy the person serving in counterinsurgency coin coalition can afford to grant the foe only limited attention the adversary may be less the primary concern of each days activities than distraction that interferes with moreimportant tasks related to capacity building and estab lishing the foundation for longterm security the causes that initially gave rise to insurgent and criminal activity would remain even if the threat disappeared overnightcorruption sectarian prejudice and its related violence incompetent administration crippled physical infrastructure degraded essential services and hobbled economy often among them yet the threat is far from disappearing in either afghanistan or iraq at the time of this writing quite the contrary the many overlapping insurgent terrorist criminal and other foes that together comprise the heterogeneous enemy in iraqand an only somewhat less varied one in afghanistancontinue to feed on their damaged societies what appear to be random bombings kidnappings and other atrocities sometimes constitute wellconceived insurgent campaign of exhaustion the coalition is rarely the primary focus of such actions coalition personnel present the various enemies an alleged justification for violence and threat but the international forces strength means that they are best removed by eroding the soil from beneath them rather than via direct assault the pages that follow concentrate on two specific areas of consideration before delving into more general coverage of coin issues that emerged as worthy of selection during our readings and the 92 interviews conducted in support of this effort chapter two contemplates intelligence intel operations during counterinsurgency chapter three ponders issues associ ated with the definition development and use of metrics in the same environment both were selected for attention because they were repeatedly evident in our previous years work in writ ings on ongoing us deployments and in many of the more than 300 interviews in support of this ongoing series of studies between october 2003 and september 2006 we did not limit our investigations during the 12 months following that threeyear period to intel and metric issues alone chapter four addresses additional issues the aforementioned coin topics not falling into either of the two previous categories yet deemed sufficiently important to merit their presentation for reader consideration the fifth and final chapter summarizes the poten tial impact of recommendations made in earlier pages and considers them in light of tasks that our men and women in uniform will likely face during future deployments the resulting analysis makes claim to being comprehensive evaluation of the current state of affairs regarding intel metrics or coin issues rather it seeks to identify selected key insights regarding the three areas and make derivative

light of his or her experiences we frequently offer the reader these innovative thoughts so that they might be sculpted to meet the demands of challenges elsewhere in place and time given these

environmentswhat approaches are particularly successful in meeting those challenges what methods or capabilities merit development on metric issues what means are effective for measuring progressor lack thereoftoward operational objectives during coin operations what better ways of measuring progress merit consideration on other coin issues what guidance is appropriate to give commander regarding the manner in which he or she should influence social change in an area of operation ao eg addressing social norms such as providing education to females revenge killings and corruptionarguably one key to eventual success in the 18991902 philippine war was the us dis tribution of its forces in more than 500 small garrisons that sought both to support the local population

all about metrics which seemed to reflect peculiarly american fixation with quantifying results in terms of for instance the number of schools refurbished kilo meters of roads resurfaced pipelines repaired and the like these were the figures that our governments like to publicise but they conveyed nothing of the reality it proved impossible to discover rationale for the choice and prioritization of projects i was always glad to hear that particular towns generator had been repaired but i also wanted to hear whether there were any plans to sort out the problems of another town and if not why not hilary synnott bad days in basra 6 western baghdad in september 2007 provides us window on how some insurgents ply strategy of exhaustion at the tactical level one that challenges coalition leaders in both the intel and metrics realms shia militia groups often one or another form of jaish mahdi jam would find sunni mosque within or near mixed shia and sunni neighborhood7 jam forces would attack the mosque to draw fire from sunni defenders thereafter making an anonymous report of the shooting to nearby iraqi army ia forces in conjunction with request for action to subdue the alleged sunni instigators army forces comprised primar ily of shia personnel would respond and declare the mosque troublesome the imam would be removed and the mosque closed having eliminated vital community resource for sunni 6 synnott 2008 p 211 7 jam has several forms in the eyes of the local population or coalition representatives these were described in several ways most more or less agreeing with the following description provided by cpt nicholas d kron 2007 loyal jam representatives from the office of martyr sadr oms loyal jam members are also referred to as sadrists or golden jam real jam makhtab khidamat mak special groups that carry out the attacks for sadr they are real because they directly follow the orders of moqtada sadrcriminal jam effectively mafiaextremists not affiliated with sadr note that members can overlap two or more groups eg real jam member may also participate in criminal jam activi ties for personal gain that have nothing to do with orders from moqtada sadr there are members of the iraqi security forces in each of the four groups further shiite who moves into vacated sunni house either under instructions to do so or because he or she simply seeks place to live may be considered jam by those under pressure to leave neighborhoodunclassifiedfor official use only rel to usaausnzlisrnato unclassifiedfor official use only rel to

denying the neighborhood public services threatening individuals eg putting bullet in someones mailbox with note that the receiving family will be killed if it does not depart within 24 hours moving shia families into homes abandoned by sunnis establishing local shia prayer sites 8 those familiar with efforts at ethnic cleansing or efforts to purge an area of an undesired group will find the tactics similar to those in kosovo afghanistan rwanda and elsewhere government officials may or may not be complicit in further pressuring the targeted segment of the community eg via selective denial of public services9 colonel j b burtons soldiers of the 2nd brigade combat team bct 1st infantry division noted that some sunni neighborhoods in their ao received considerably less support in this regard than did adjoining shia residential and commercial areas 10 in yet another instance the bcts soldiers determined that sunni residents were so intimidated that they drove miles out of the way when medical attention was needed residents in the sunni community of yarmuk see figure 11 location 67 perceived that the supposedly public hospital less than mile distant was facto off limits to them due to the dangers posed by jam rather than risking murder in the shia dominated medical establishment sunnis drove south and west skirting the boundaries of baghdad international airport figure 11

undertakings in afghanistan and iraq begin to take on brutal clarity when we consider the many other problems confronting coalition members the coherent shiainsurgent approach to clearing sunni areas just described demonstrates some degree of sophistication the greater jam circumspection was necessary of course given the inplace presence of coalition forces the explicit and implicit demands inherent in an effective coalition response to such challenges are myriad what is needed is wellresourced fully orchestrated substantively interagency campaign plan backed by effective intel and truly

metrics are to serve coalition objectives effectively two will suffice to demonstrate here dutch brig gen theo vleugels recalled his 2006 command experience in southern afghanistan noting that the guidelines he received from higher level were very broad that did not allow to see what my end state would be we didnt have campaign plan when we started but we later got one from my higher headquarters that was close to ours which is not surprising as they told us to do what we told them we would do 13 colonel burton similarly found himself frustrated by the lack of overarching coordina tion of capabilities that affected his baghdad ao i was paying millions of dollars for sewerage but where was the money going i checked it out and made sure pipes were being repaired and the work was being done to remove sewage from our area but the plant beyond there was broken and it was going directly into the tigris for all i knew our efforts were not synchronized with the greater system 14 the challenges due to lack of comprehensive management and guidance were exacerbated by responsibilities that the services are struggling to include in schoolhouse curricula we werent trained for this we were trained to cause behavioral change through the application of violence15 it is easy to see how the experiences of general vleugels and colonel burton relate to intel and metric demands vleugels having to create his own campaign plan provided his com mand great flexibility in meeting local needs colonel burtons example demonstrates that without the benefit of broader context however subordinate headquarters may optimize their actions only to find that the full potential at the macro level is squandered through fault of their own colonel burtons efforts to refurbish his areas sewagetreatment capabilities were undertaken in the likely unavoidable absence of knowledge about the overall condition of baghdads system an intel shortfall or how city engineers were planning to bring it online the fine work done by his soldiers recordable in metric had positive effect in western bagh dad but reduced broader impact due to the absence of coordination by higher echelons good subordinate leaders will define their own intel requirements irs and design suitable metrics when they find themselves operating without effective overarching coordination and when operational success in their aos calls for bold action it should surprise one that the result is less efficient than would have been the case had there been master orchestration of resources to guide these lower echelons

training leaders policing streets molding security forces protecting borders providing succor to those in need and yes fight ing insurgents yet the issue is only partly whether progress is being made or whether the situ ation has improved since 2003 it is additionally one of how the coalition can be more efficient and effective now and how future undertakings can improve on those past effective intel and metrics will be fundamental to success as will savvy with respect to counterinsurgency in general how these areas affect the pursuit of this effectiveness and how coalition forces might improve their approaches to current operations in this regard is the focus of the remainder of this report not the typical report the three chapters that follow are each standalone discus sions of their respective topics rather than being linked by common themes other than their relevance to counterinsurgency each first seeks to identify issues of notable import as identified by interviewees and relevant authors then proposes observations and recommendations where such are worthy of consideration the chapters focus on intel metrics and general coin mat ters in turn some reinforce recommendations made earlier in the series eg that suggesting consideration of extending intel personnels intheater tours the better to achieve continuity and indepth understanding others expand on actions already being taken in the field that might not be known to wider audiences the provision of an intel capability at company level in some organizations to improve unit responsiveness and distribution of timesensitive mate rial to other organizations stands as an example in this case of more revolutionary character changing the basic intelcommunity operating presumption of releasing information only to those with need to know to one dictating priority for the need to share also receives atten tion in chapter two observations and recommendations regarding metrics span similar spectrum the necessity to consider metrics in dynamic context one in which measures are frequently checked for their continued applicability accompanies basic guidance regarding the initial design of such measures eg the benefits of simplicity in that development and need to validate metrics during the wargaming process when writing plan these and other aspects of our intel and metric analysis have two complements in chapter four the first returns to the necessity for the elusive truly interagency campaign plan the second reminds readers of truth at once seemingly obvious yet too often overlooked in the field the need to capitalize on habitual relationships less during irregular conflicts than during conventional warunclassifiedfor official use only rel to usaausnzlisrnato

center of gravity cog during coin operation5 even the few question ing this assertion almost without exception agree that the population inevitably has dramatic effect on ultimate success as general kiszely so eloquently stated one of the reasons this is the case is that civilians are often vital sources of information it is therefore striking that so little attention has been given to this crucial component in the planning and execution of friendly force operations too often operations include unfortunate episodeseg unit demonstrat ing too little fire discipline when traversing an urban area soldiers failing to grant residents demonstration of basic courtesies during home searchesthat overlook the essentiality of giving priority to 1 preserving the peoples good will and 2 convincing them that the coali tion will persevere in its struggle with insurgents doctrine tells us that destruction or neutralization of the enemy center of gravity is the most direct path to victory and that commanders not only consider the enemy cogs but also identify and protect their own cogs 6 granted it is impossible to deny foe occa sional success in attacking cog so broad in character as population its will or even the critical leadership thereof yet those interviewed in support of this research noted with little frustration that coalition forces themselves too frequently neglect to treat local community members properly whether cog or merely vital component of friendlyforce success such neglect not only fails to protect this important operational factor it works to increase the ben efits that an adversary draws from it though certainly an oversimplification there is value in considering popular support zerosum game any amount gained by one side deprives foes of an equal quantity of good will and intel conversely an activity that turns community mem bers away from the counterinsurgent cause benefits adversaries equal to those lost the importance of the noncombatant population potentially lends increased significance to nonmilitary organizations with capacity to improve civilians lot ongoing operations in afghanistan and iraq bring renewed attention to organizations that at

how to deal with the 3rd shock army lcol shane b schreiber canadian land forces command 10 previous studies in this series have identified the need to consider far more than the enemy and terrain when conducting urban and coin intel operations given the significant role of the population determining what information is needed on civil societies should take on an importance at least on par with seeking intel on threats the implications of this straight forward observation are dramatic previous us experiences with coin operations demon strate how difficult it is to obtain information on even single insurgent threat consider the situation confronted in southeast asia in the 1960s and 1970s in that case single coherent entity dominated threat analysis from the macro perspective though it might have several interacting components eg the north vietnamese army and vietcong or vc in iraq the number of insurgent organizations alone makes intel collection and analysis several orders of magnitude more problematic add criminal terrorist supposedly legitimate political rogue military and police or other threats and the task is yet further quantum levels more difficult and this addresses only the analysis of threats understanding who the key personalities are in the civilian population what the interactions are between these notable influence nodes and how they influence common folk introduces further challenges that increase the amount of material the intel analyst must access and assess groups traditionally of limited interest to military operators not only become part of the cast they may take center stage this means that much of the equipment and many of the techniques familiar to the intel community may be less applicable personnel training software and technology demands above and beyond previous norms can quickly overwhelm table of organization and equipment toe alloca tions fortunately some recently introduced toes begin to address these expanded needs the introduction of tactical humanintel teams or thts in stryker brigades for example but these tend to be tweaks to organizations not far removed from coldwar predecessors rather than purposebuilt initiatives that truly address the character of current challenges the need for further adaptation or fromscratch design is evident in number of recent events us army corps of engineers

years of neglect and decay confronted him with far more difficult problems the misorienta tion of information provided him demonstrates the need for considering new perspectives when confronting

pertinence of such information at lower tactical levels as well 12 the message is clear collectors and analysts at every level must be capable of addressing the civilian spectrum of irs in addition to the more traditional threatcentric databases and the collection procedures that feed them likewise still have predominantly threat and terrainrelated foci this means that units have hard time both in

of giving companies this greater intel horsepower there is intelligence capability at company level and that is absurd intelligence in this type of counterinsurgency is not coming from above we at corps would have to go down to battalion level to get information on targets we had about 150 people in the intel shop at corps we could have taken half of them and pushed them down to every company in the country and increased the quality of information we got and helped them at the same time it would have greater impact and effect 21 given that there are plans for the us army to increase the strength of its militaryintel branch by more than 7000 personnel by 2013 providing companylevel analysis capability may be within the realm of the possible22 whether retaining that capability at company level is desirable during conventional operations would have to be part of the examination backing consideration of this restructuring it may be that corps and other higherlevel intel sections maintain shadow positions that in times of conventional conflict would be staffed by those assigned to companies during other contingencies battalion commanders and staff have likewise found that the

rotations his observations are consistent with comments made by many others during the several years of research backing this and previous analyses of ongoing operations as any police officer agent runner or intel collec tor will likely agree it takes time to establish the personal trust essential for providers to feel comfortable passing on information and for collectors to accept it transitioning between indi viduals departing and entering theater is not simply matter of introducing ones successor to an established information source lives are often at stake relationships are likely based on individual trustnot ideology commitment to one side over another or money alone addi tionally accurately interpreting the information provided is skill that grows with familiarity greater duration on station makes collectors and analysts more savvy another argument for having some intel personnel remain in assignments longer there are many legitimate counterarguments individuals exhaust themselves working the long hours that active operations often demand family relationships suffer career pro gression can be undermined leaders must find reasonable balance between retention of critical personnel in theater and unit cohesion yet these challenges are rarely insurmountable many are the result of flawed staffing procedures lessthanoptimal promotion systems or

know that thatll be his girlfriends father who owns scrap yard and thats where hes going to store the bloody thing lets get out there now to have look at that and see where they could put rifle perhaps if it firms up then theyll be in position to go put in an observation post so get them out early to have look at it before the weapon is there get all the photography done the aerial photographs get the right people to look at how they might get in and get out of the place without attracting attention and so on but you can do that only if you have this local knowledge 27 counterinsurgencies are marathons not sprints they are measured in years if not decades in all but the most exceptional cases assignment and other personnel policies not designed to support the long run threaten mission success just as campaign plan is vital to effective use of resources and staying on course so too are wise personnel policies requisite part of ensuring that intel processes sustain high level of efficacy the british assigned military personnel to malaya for long stints during their postworld war ii counterinsurgency in that colony they provided for families to live in nearby singapore and accompanied this with regular breaks from field duty similarly wellconceived adjustments for those personnel staffing key intel positions are within the realm of the feasible for todays coalitions it would be wise to extend the tours of some and to lengthen overlaps when rotations do take place thereby increasing the likelihood that informers will transfer their trust to incoming persons and analysts will have more time to learn nuances of import from their predecessors databases one key to unlocking the door to knowledge key piece is the whole cultural awareness

that always centered on the lack of information and the need for databank orrin deforest slow burn the rise and fall of american intelligence in vietnam29 in this type of environment its not how much you collect but how well you collect as you can be overwhelmed basically its targeting your collections over time to what you need to know col jay bruder usmc 30 counterinsurgency and urban counterinsurgency in particular challenges the intel collector and analyst because he or she must focus on the civilian population as well as more traditional aspects of the environment and enemy we have noted that the analysts challenge is notably keen in iraq where both population demographics and the threat are more varied than those in vietnam chechnya or afghanistan it is generally said that time favors the insurgents they need not defeat the counterinsurgent but rather simply outwait their foe yet intel is case in which time holds benefits for the counterinsurgent as well the greater the duration of campaign the longer the collector and analyst have to develop an understanding of the enemy and population several units have begun compilation of databases in afghanistan and iraq to take advantage of coalition commitment this section considers best practices in this regard and aspects that draw our attention for other reasons police have long relied on databases if cop in anytown usa pulls over suspect he checks the persons identification remotely from the squad car hes linked to databases filled with whos who in the world of crime killing and mayhem in iraq there is nothing like that when our troops and the iraqi army enter town village or street what they know about the local bad guys is pretty much in their heads at best solution give our troops what our cops have the troops now write down suspects names and addresses some like marine maj owen west in anbar have created their own spreadsheets and powerpoint programs or use digital cameras to input the details of suspected insurgents but iraqwide software architecture exists daniel henninger the snake eater 31 tactical information and intel of all types remains spread across myriad hardcopy and elec tronic

arriving in afghanistan sometimes found that they had to rely on dated russian maps operations were hindered because location names did not initially coincide with information received from other

them to make decisions that take into account the economic historical cultural political anthropological and environmental aspects of the region within which they are operating 34 properly programmed such efficient data handlers could automatically crosscheck the varied spellings of personal and place names so common to arabic thereby reducing confu sion and allowing for uniformity on maps documents and other materials35 such capability would have wide range of applications in supporting the rule of law and meeting evidentiary standards for dealing with insurgents criminals or other undesirables applications of value during daytoday tactical operations would include improved identification of highvalue tar gets hvts eg key taliban or military leaders consistency in location names

2006 for example aman agaf hamodiin israels intel section or director ate of intelligence issued document titled hezbollahs war conception the 130page report offered detailed information about the organizations ground deployment and the way it had camouflaged its underground facilities but since the document received the highest level of classification limited violet only few outside amans research department were granted access to its findings thus the intelligence officer of the 91st galilee divisionthe main idf israel defense forces that faced hezbollahwas allowed to read it but the division commander brigadier general gal hirsh was not aman ranked the distribution of high quality documents to limited number of clients as higher priority than in providing its actual clients with the relevant information they needed for similar reasons aman refrained from distributing critical information to the combat forces before the war started instead it was kept in locked metal boxes the intelligence kits were supposed to be distributed to the combat units once war started but at least in part due to bureaucratic competition they were belatedly distributed two weeks after fighting commenced and even then the intelligence was not used effectively the end result as described by major ilan the intelligence officer of the golani brigade one of the idfs best infantry forces was that the classified material was not provided to use due to compartmentalization and we found out about it only postfactum we had knowl edge about the deployment of hezbollah and its order of battle when

you we never knew if that was the answer because the company commander really couldnt tell usor because the company commander really didnt know because the battalion commander couldnt tell him even worse we were never sure what the first lieutenant couldnt tell the battalion commander who then would not tell the company commander since he didnt actually knowso that we lieutenants and sergeants

devices we had some very fine men lose their lives from ambushes and friendly fire inci dents that could have been avoided we had some very good attitudes forever affected by this dynamic my approach was to strive to be the clean first lieutenant who knew everything and then to improve on that by telling everyone affected by what i knew what they should know when going in harms way and to go in harms way with them whenever possible thats when i decided to branch transfer to military intelligenceto see if i couldnt do better job than the mess i found myself and my soldiers in down in the

25 vious changes in policy and guidance that expanded uk access to classified web sites43 the preceding quotation regarding dutch pilots reflects that much more remains to be done in terms of both the extent of information shared and the parties with whom that sharing should occur writing in early 2006 on the situation regarding intel exchanges derek reveron cor rectly noted while need to share has become the mantra since the 911 attacks translating this slogan into core function faces significant cultural and technological barriers44 reveron might in fact have been too optimistic need to share might be understood as policy by those within washingtons beltway much remains before it is similarly accepted in the broader intel community there are of course instances involving us as well as allied nations personnel where there is legitimate need to assume risk to protect sources however too many cases of denying vital intel for what seem to be less critical reasons encourage recommendation to 1 recon sider the nearly automatic default of classifying or otherwise restricting distribution of mate rials and 2 provide formal intheater and lowerechelon authority to review external and higherlevel handling guidance in light of the local intel authorities better understanding of operational and security conditions on the ground such granting of authority could require positive confirmation by the classifying headquarters prior to downgrading classifications or expanding distribution however timeliness of release should not be allowed to suffer unduly sharing becomes more difficult when the prospective recipient is an ngo igo or com mercial enterprise members of united nations mission in 2007 baghdad wanted to expand their operations via field office on coalition installation elsewhere in the country it might have been expected that us authorities would do whatever was possible to assist in this regard given the legitimacy and other benefits accruing from association with coali tion efforts to assist in rebuilding the troubled nation instead requests from person nel regarding the number of indirectfire attacks that struck the installation in question were denied allegedly for security reasons 45 there might have been concerns that releasing details about the number of successful rocket artillery or mortar attacks could have given an enemy information regarding the accuracy of its targeting yet had the rejecting officer thought in terms of need to share versus need to know he or she would likely have found it possible to both preserve opsec operational security and provide the information needed for example 43 as noted in previous footnote both british and australian access to siprnet was expanded in the aftermath of the cold war see reveron 2006 p 8 reveron also quoted the 911 commission report s observation that current security requirements nurture overclassification and excessive compartmentalization of information among

quoted former under secretary of defense for intelligence stephen cambone describing how such challenges impinge on sharing with international partners incorrect use of the noforn caveat on dod

sigint signal intel asset to tap telephones we ended up not physically sending anyone information about where the two were meeting the one that we wanted ended up getting arrested for pass port violation while he was at the meeting but we did not know that and he was set free it turns out that for lack of sigint asset we lost this guy he was arrested and he was held for 48 hours for lack of

effective intel sharing though there are initia tives to address some of those challenges such initiatives have rich history of successful prec edents ones that can serve as examples for others yet to come deborah g bargers toward revolution in intelligence affairs cited the memoirs of richard bissell whom she called the cias driving force in reconnaissance systems in the 1950s as an example of previous intel technological innovation and longsightedness bissell wrote of the atmosphere of creativity and innovation driven by the need to address the soviet threat and of the speed with which such breakthroughs occurred the goahead for the u2 project was given to clarence kelly johnson of lockheed aircraft by telephone on december 1 1954 according to bissell the first overflight of the ussr took place on july 4 1956 two months after the first overflight of the soviet union col jack gibbs and i started defining successor to the u2 in march 1955 general operational requirement for photoreconnaissance satellite was issued thereby initiating different technical approach to overhead reconnaissance bissell notes that although there were scat tered failures thereafter there has never been major lapse in the flow of intelligence from satellite reconnaissance since then it is exaggeration to say that what was accomplished in this period of less than ten years was revolution in intelligence collection the desperate rivalry of the cold war of course provided the major stimulus for our activities bissells 46 anonymous source 34 47 jany 2006unclassifiedfor official use only rel

effort and action that leads to breakthroughs48 one might well argue that ongoing operations to combat worldwide terrorism and those fronting insurgencies in afghanistan and iraq should provide stimulus akin to that posed by the soviet union in the era about which bissell was writing in many ways the challenge is even more difficult not only are new technologies in demand the abundance of inuse technologi cal systems demands leaps forward in policy procedures and interorganizational cooperation less revolutionary than the development of the u2 or reconnaissance satellite barger was somewhat less optimistic with regard to us capabilities to meet this expanded set of chal lenges noting today new technology applications are developed in insular organizational stovepipes and are not necessarily shared with others who could make use of them or worse are duplicated when duplication is unnecessary49 yet forum exists for guiding disparate organizations initiatives and potentially linking them to coherent longrange capabilities organizations like the intelligence technology integration center will play very impor tant role in the revolution in intelligence affairs because they not only scan the horizon for new technological opportunities but also can provide forum for technologists to interact with analysts linguists case officers line managers and others50 there is demonstrated progress at the operational and tactical levels as well the preda tor unmanned aerial vehicle uav has repeatedly demonstrated its utility both as missile launch platform and as valuable

prime example of support and supported personnel developing procedures for new system in the interest of operational success blueforce tracking bft was similarly success largely due to its being commonly adopted by army air force and to lesser extent marine forces 51 the system allowed com manders to monitor not only their own locations but those of units in other services bft in sense

practicable only in higherlevel headquarters dissemination to brigadelevel or lower marine and army orga nizations is feasible only via voice email or other indirect means of passage52 second john vines found his challenges in the many separate databases his unit had to access in order to extract needed information vines recalled his 18th airborne corps operation iraqi freedom oif tour during which we had more than 300 different databases tracking friendly and enemy event data across all the warfighter functions much of the data available could not be shared resulting in an incomplete picture of the battlespace and little shared situational awareness most of the bcss battlecommand systems in iraq were accredited for us classifieddata net works ie siprnet and not coalition networks thus there were limited tools to sup port information processing in joint interagency intergovernmental and multinational environment in many cases the systems complexity created high learning curves resulting in training shortfalls and rapid decay of user skills although there were multiple pro grams of record for battle tracking mcs maneuver control system c2pc command and control personal computer adocs automated deep operations coordination system falconview mapping software gccs global command and control system etc none was able to create combined view of enemy and friendly events on map 53 this shortfall akin and related to similar problems with communication systems in gen eral is the result of many factors lack of single allembracing authoritative oversight mech anism for intel and communicationsystem acquisitions is part of the issue such an authority would ideally be responsible for reviewing and approving or disapproving service and com batant command programs with the idea of improving joint operational effectiveness such authority is critical element previous joint dictates that services improve communication compatibility have at times been ignored control of purse strings and the power to cancel programs outright would assist such manager in enforcing compatibility guidelines intel organizations and procedures third hurdle between the present and

straight from the tactical level to the highest strategic levels with little sharing along the way raw data are seldom passed backjust agreedon intelligence agreedon intelligence is homogenized product from which dissenting views and contradicting evidence has been removed or discounted so the community can have common view if intelligence does come back down the stovepipe it often arrives too late lester w grau something old something new guerrillas terrorists and intelligence analysts 55 intelligence stovepipes have been cited as problem so often that the term has become cliché such operating in isolation is in part explained by issues described in the previous two sections internal organizational policies and incompatible technologies can all work against free exchange and timely sharing organizations objectives also differ some police military and department of foreign affairs and trade dfat representatives in the 10nation regional assistance mission to solomon islands ramsi initially found little reason to concern them selves with each others intel the military concerned itself with the threat posed by the various militias police focused on daytoday criminal activities and governmental corruption while dfat interest was primarily on broader national and international strategic issues 56 yet sub ordinates found much that complemented and clarified their own efforts when the leaders of these three major parties required their intel sections to collocate and cooperate ramsi benefited from its limited size the mission numbered more than some 2000 personnel at its early peak it nevertheless offers number of lessons worth noting colloca tion can be beneficial coalition forces in western baghdad also benefited from the presence of us iraqi and sometimes british security forces in joint security station jss it is practical for units to physically collocate intel assets when many are in proximity as is often the case in urban areas in other cases however dispersion of units may mean that collocation will have to be virtual eg via cyberlinks while facetoface communication is preferable the desired end of effective and timely intel sharing need not be dictated by the ability to physically come together in the same location another benefit of better linking intel assets at lower echelons is reduced vulnerability to scam artists canadian charles barlow could have been describing operations in vietnam 40 years before with his recollection of operations in afghanistan during which sharing source registry amongst humint human intel agencies is another problem in kabul there are sources who sell the same junk info to everyone knowing that there is way anyone can check 57 employing retinal scans or other means of tagging intel

intelligence operations and metrics in iraq and afghanistan designed software such capabilities would have the additional benefit of allowing agencies to identify those selling the same information to several of them thus precluding seemingly sepa rate sources from acting to confirm each other and curtailing multiple organizations paying the same source for identical input bringing intel assets together will present challenges along with benefits some allies or coalition members are more trustworthy than others there will be ngos igos and com mercial interests that need to access only very limited amount of intel segmentation tear lines on documents and other means of compartmentalizing information will be necessary just as current intel sections have their sensitive compartmented information facilities scifs information can be compartmentalized though those establishing such facilities will have to resist emplacing such stringent access restrictions that they lose sight of the initial objective of facilitating sharing usmc col kevin m trepa looked back on early operations in iraq remembering oif 1 was interesting because we had lot of sovietbloc countries that were in the coali tion and therefore lot of security and intelligence issues we realized that not all coalition members are equal we built three forms of centrixs combined enterprise regional information exchange system one that was for arabskuwaitis and gulf statesone of former sovietbloc states and one for more traditional relationships58 the greatest obstacle to effective intel operations is mindset you will never completely get the intelligence wing of an agency such as the army or the police to relinquish its independence after number of mistakes we did get people to agree that we were all on the same side and we therefore would share intelligence chris albiston formerly of royal ulster constabulary special branch 59 one of our latest assistant chief counsels things got real bad once and he said ill tell you what were going to do when we get piece of intelligence instead of sitting down and saying right who needs to know this piece of intelligence we will look at it and we will say ok well start from the position that everybody needs to know this intelligence and then well cross off those who dont need to know it it led to more efficient dis semination and more efficient usage of that intelligence there are number of crimes you can commit in intelligence i believe the deliberate invention of intelligence is heinous crime the deliberate subjective interpretation of intelligence

interagency operations requires reassessment of intelsharing policies unwillingness to share information under the auspices of opsec some times works against mission success and is the easy way out rather than the right deci sion the time has come to transition from the traditional needtoknow approach to one of needtoshare during counterinsurgencies and selected other undertakings this will require opsec and intel personnel to have legitimate reason for denying information or intel to allies coalition members and others with legitimate concerns rather than relying on denial as the default mode establishing standard of sharing will bring new requirements for designing and acquiring sufficient numbers of some equipment types eg radios counteried systems such that coalition organizations can sell them to or share them with other organizations albeit sharing guided by policies to minimize the likelihood of opsec violations there will similarly be need to 1 establish intelsharing agreements with these organizations prior to deployments when feasible eg as part of interagency campaign planning and rehearsals and 2 make future bcss more conducive to information

position of guideline developer but also that it should look at how it might better facilitate multinational and inter agency cooperation we noted that the first dutch unit to deploy in support of

smaller informationdense environments eg major cities such as baghdad such managers could provide both the means and impetus for making many of these changes finally it is ever important to remember

to exploitation the former example of the clever information seller who peddles his product to multiple agencies each ignorant of the others sources is an exam ple it is one of the least damaging

have been used in one form or another to measure progress or lack of progress toward achieving objectives throughout the history of armed conflict however metrics have never before received the attention seen today with multiple blueribbon panels the us govern ment accountability office and most notably ambassador ryan crocker and gen david h petraeuss iraq progress reports all using their own internally developed performance metrics to evaluate progress the selection and use of specific metrics have taken on exceptional signifi cance add to this the role of such measurements in influencing the charting of future strategy and that significance is further magnified increased data collection and the availability of the products to the media have also resulted in greater scrutiny and increased numbers of inter pretations of available information the ultimate choice of metrics can mean the difference 1 herrington 1982 p 37 2 schwerzel undatedunclassifiedfor official use only rel to usaausnzlisrnato unclassifiedfor official use only rel to usaausnzlisrnato38 intelligence operations and metrics in iraq and afghanistan between publicly perceived success or failure the choice of metrics has in short become one of national importance3 simply put metrics are yardsticks for measuring progress toward achieving operational objectives or desired end state4 some differences arise in how practitioners and researchers apply the concept of metrics for the purposes of this report we adopt definition from recent rand work this concept starts by establishing desired end state in operational terms three elements are necessary to measure progress against this end state indicators observable quantitative or qualitative data inputs that are relevant for mea 1 suring progress toward the end statea criterion of success the method by which progress will be charted against the desired 2 end state data sources where the data for the indicators will be collected in terms of both source 3 and operational level 5 despite its apparent simplicity even this definition of metrics requires detailed plan ning often complex application and tremendous flexibility in order to maintain pertinence and stay ahead of the enemy in the actionreactioncounterreaction process prevalent during operations commanders directed to plan and engage in combat operations do so with sense of urgency that is tempered only by their desire to effectively translate guidance from civilian leaders into achievable military objectives in traditional major combat operation mco envi ronments the order to conduct combat operations is likely to be accompanied by set of clearly defined objectives that drive planning commanders start with these objectives and use process of backward planning that ideally includes developing metrics to enable both internal and external assessment of progress in achieving stated goals this pattern is replicated down to the smallest units with objectives and metrics at each echelon designed to support those at upper stratums operations desert shield and desert storm and more recently the first phase of oif are examples of the militarys ability to use clearly defined objectives to plan operations and employ predetermined metrics to assess achievement of these ends despite the increased focus on metrics selecting the right measures at each level of war has never been more difficult the military must increasingly balance the desire to maintain simple easily assessed comprehensible metrics that provide adequate measures of effectiveness with the kitchensink approach in which increased data collection and subsequent analysis attempt to satisfy all prospective users requirements the organization that chooses to use 3 that

that collects and analyzes too much data risks insufficient focus on mission tasks and potentially falling prey to false indicators the nature of counterinsurgency complicates matters in both the quantity of data and their correlation to soughtafter objectives measur ing progress during counterinsurgency is hampered by lack of specificity when it comes to determining the relationship between actions and outcomes francis fukuyama describes the concept as follows specificity refers to the ability to monitor service output the example of highly spe cific service is jet aircraft maintenance complex skill that is hard to fake if mechanic is incompetent there will be immediate consequences by contrast high school guidance counseling is service with very low specificity the counselor may advise student to change career directions the advice may not be taken immediately and even if it is its impact on the students later life may not be known for years if at all 6 the ability to collect and synthesize increasing amounts of data will tend to further expand the scope of metric applications in the future understanding how they are developed as part of the military planning process and how metrics are currently used to assess performance is critical first step toward better integration of this assessment tool this chapter considers metrics by looking at 1 the link between political leaderdesired outcomes and metrics 2 detailed analysis of how metrics are developed and linked to desired outcomes and 3 the use of metrics in support of coin operations we first explore metrics by drawing from base of literature that is burgeoning as result of ongoing operations in afghanistan and iraq the chapter begins by briefly exploring the link between political leaderdesired outcomes higher commanders logical lines of operations llos subordinate commanders specific objectives and the selection of metrics that support mission success after reviewing the links between objectives and metrics detailed analysis follows that looks at the types of metrics available to commanders the difficulties in collecting data to support them and their historical evolution this second section closes with list of desirable metric characteristics the third section highlights five overarching observations concerning metrics in support of coin operations as gleaned from interviews with veterans of the conflicts in afghanistan and iraq these respondents ranged from junior soldiers and civilians to flag offi cers and diplomats the closing section looks at metric

complexities fill volumes and constitute fields of study we seek to familiarize readers with relevant challenges and some of the thinking that backs ongoing efforts to meet these difficulties that

against objectives not drive objective selection or be chosen based on ease of collection its huge problem they approach it as what can we measure rather than what do we want to illuminate stephanie miley us department of state7 an obvious concern in this dynamic process is whether metrics are being developed that truly support the desired objectives or whether these metrics sometimes selected by default because of their ease of measurement may be inadvertently shaping commanders objectives in unproductive ways as an illustration if commander can easily measure the number of weapon caches found he or she may decide that the number found is proxy for the objec tive of increased security even less helpful are metrics that measure effort without linking it to results eg reporting the number of leaflets dropped as reflection of psychological operations psyop campaigns success 8 the result could be prioritizing weapon searches at the expense of other less quantifiable but more beneficial tasks selecting effective metrics measures that accurately capture effects rather than inputsis one of commanders most complex and critical tasks poorly selected measures can lead to wasted effort and unnecessary risks better measures can increase the likelihood of mission success understanding how to develop effective metrics for coin operations is notably challenging given the many relevant parties and scope of tasks confronting coalition understanding the link between political guidance and metrics civilian control of the military has been cornerstone of the united states

development economic development support economic viability through financial infrastructure estab lishment local economic development and creation of supporting procedures such llos allow commanders to focus efforts on designated priorities such as estab lishing security through combat operations and increased competence of indigenous security forces and improving the quality of life for the indigenous population through improvements in essential services governance and economic conditions measuring llos directly is problematic progress is not something you measure with stopwatch it takes place over much longer period of time when you pan back and look at it from the perspective of two or three years the number of significant insurgent events shows gently upward sloping line in other words nothing has changed the enemy still has the initiative you need to look at shortterm mediumterm and longterm measures anonymous 11 ideally commanders would directly measure the improvement in each one of the llos to assess their overall progress toward meeting their desired outcomes unfortunately assessing improvements in broad categorical areas with any degree of accuracy is precisely the

and quantitative data rather than straightforward collection of quantitative data metrics can measure inputs outputs or effects organizations seek the set of metrics that best matches their datacollection capabilities and assessment needs commanders and staffs consider the number of data collectors and analysts and the amount of time the command can devote to this activity there is single set of right metrics that will perfectly assess performance commander can draw on at least three types of metrics each with strengths and weaknesses one or more will be of value depending on the circumstances in which an organization finds itself 12 the british and american governments have taken to publicising factsheets and met rics listing for example kilometers of water pipes laid completed electricity projects schools that have been refurbished and even the planting of date palms such statistics indeed indicate activity but without being presented in the context of the economy as whole they convey little meaning hilary synnott bad days in basra13 measures of effort measures of effort moes for which doctrinal definition exists are used here as measure of organization activities accomplished col gregory fontenot us army retired used the term when describing the limited utility of reporting the number of mines neutralized in bosnia and herzegovina during his brigade command tour in 19951996 discussed further later 14 such data represent the most rudimentary approach that orga nizations use to assess their progress use of moe relies on gauging organizational inputs counting activities such as the number of patrols conducted ied caches captured miles of electrical lines strung or quantity of sewermain breaks repaired without regard for the cir cumstances or influence the activities have employing moe requires the least amount of data collection analysis effort or expertise simply relying on the numerical counts of event occur rences serves as the basis for inference this method is often employed by lowerlevel units pos sessing less advanced datacollection and analysis networks and is primary feeder of baseline data to higher organizations general trends in these counts can help inform other metrics but by themselves they do little to answer the question are we moving closer to achieving our objectives and thus have limited intrinsic utility alone 12 the february 2008 edition of the us armys fm 30 operations us department of the army 2008 p d4 replaces the previously employed criteria of success with the joint doctrinal terms

performance mops are measure of efficiency criterion used to assess friendly actions that is tied to measuring task accomplishment 15 as noted in the february 2008 us army fm 30 measures of performance answer the question was the task or action performed as the commander intended measure of per formance confirms or denies that task has been properly performed16 an example of this would be efficiencies gained by transitioning to webbased contracting process from local ized facetoface process the webbased process could better facilitate competitive bidding that results in reductions in average contract prices and increased quality allowing additional reconstruction projects to be made available within the same fixed budget to support recon struction operations thereby meeting stated objective of accomplishing or exceeding specific goals within stated resource constraints measures of effectiveness measures of effectiveness are measures of outcomes or effects criterion used to assess changes in system behavior capability or operational environment that is tied to measuring the attainment of an end state achievement of an objective or creation of an effect 17 again from fm 30 measures of effectiveness focus on the results or consequences of actions taken they answer the question is the force doing the right things or are additional or alternative actions required measure of effectiveness provides benchmark against which the commander assesses progress toward accomplishing the mission 18 this metric is the most difficult to assess since it often requires subjective assessment by either the provider or consumer of these services it often cannot be done directly using strictly quantifiable assessments as an example the outcome that we desire is not an increased or unlimited number of patrols as measure of safety and security in an area but rather outward demonstrations by the local population that indicate an increased confidence in their safety and security in the area these could manifest themselves as an increased willingness to invest in local homebuilding or business startups increased buying and selling of goods in local markets more children playing in soccer games the return of families who had fled the neigh borhood increased quality or quantity in intel tips or even more thumbsup gestures during patrol on the streets it is important to have metrics that reflect lack of progress toward objec tive accomplishment as well these might be measures that demonstrate stagnation or regres sion just as some signals indicate only

and metrics in iraq and afghanistan as overt as increased acts of violence against the officers but rather because gardens around police posts were being vandalized19 simply counting the number of patrols conducted moe or the increased percent age of neighborhoods patrolled this week versus previous weeks mop would not provide an organization any indication of the movement toward achieving its ultimate objective of an increased perception of security by the local population however indirect or subjective metrics associated with assessing increased commerce on the streets the ratio of positive hand gestures and the nature of behavior at soccer matches may all be measures that when com bined reflect on the outcome or effect sought an increased perception of safety and security by the population any one of these metrics may show progress however more frequently metrics are combined and distilled to make an assessment continuing with the soccermatch example larger attendance figures greater representation by minority groups previously per secuted increased wearing of jewelry and the presence of children together would represent mutually reinforcing signals of comfort regarding public safety improvements in some of these factors combined with consistency or degradation of others would instead provide ambigu ous or negative feedback about movement toward soughtafter goals this report refers to the products of such combining as compound metrics the important distinction among the three types of metrics is that moes and mops are inward looking they reflect units own performance and efficiency at delivering service or good measures of effectiveness get at the heart of the issue they measure not what the provid ers provided but rather whether the impact

pile of unread papers that someone used as fuel for bonfires john crawford the last true story ill ever tell 20 four considerations regarding metric applicability to counterinsurgency merit particular discussion coin operations require metrics adapted to specific environmental circumstances the army is not newcomer to using metrics to assess progress in meeting objectives the unit status report usr is an example in which explicit metrics are used to assess units person nel equipment maintenance and training status on monthly basis to determine readiness to perform its combat mission commanders

training qualification and host of other commanderdeemed essential tasks for prioritiz ing unit training what differentiates these objectives from those in support of coin opera tions is the static versus dynamic nature of the two scenarios the objectives in the usr and qtb processes are static they rely on universal metrics applicable to every sametype unit in the us army without need for adaptation what is different about metrics for afghanistan and iraq is that objectives and associated metrics in these contingency areas must be adapted to account for the specific location people and resources availablethey cannot be onesizefitsall universal metrics like those for the usr or qtb coin operations necessitate that metrics ultimately be comparable over time and across geographic locations special care must be taken to ensure consistency across objec tives and their metrics at each echelon one of my frustrations when it came to metrics was with rc regional command south in afghanistan rc said provide the number of enemy killed in action and give the number of prt provincial reconstruction team activities we asked them about defining prt activity they never gave us an answer so we gave them definition but all they wanted was sheet with lots of big numbers so the data coming were useless because one was using the same definition for prt activity was it medical event one coun trys rtfs reconstruction task forces were putting new operation name to each time they went outside the gate we didnt do that so it looked like we were lazy anonymous 21 each organization at every echelon must have objectives and supporting metrics that support those above it units may well suboptimize in the grander scheme without such consistency ie their performance might be flawless from the perspective of their echelon but less effective or even harmful from others there is second type of consistency essential for metrics to be effective consistency also means that metrics must share definitions have common meaning in the minds of those using them and be exploitable by higher headquarters metrics are the method by which organiza tions develop common standard to assess their progress toward meeting objectives both lon gitudinally compared with other organizations at that location and intratemporally within an organization over time all organizations using metric must therefore understand it to mean the same thing subordinateorganization metrics must also fit consolidated measure ment processes at higher headquarters in other words the higher headquarters must be able to use lowerechelon metricseither in raw or tailored formto support those at the higher level 22 21 anonymous source 7 22 this concept of adapting measurement processes at lower echelons to requirements at higher levels to ensure compat ibility and consistency is an extension of the nested llos construct discussed in us department of the army and us marine corps 2006 p 53 this same nested concept is also described in larson et forthcoming the discussion in these references is restricted to nesting objectives it does not address the point made in this text about ensuring compat ibility of the metrics associated with the objectivesunclassifiedfor official use only rel to usaausnzlisrnato unclassifiedfor official use only rel to usaausnzlisrnato46 intelligence operations and metrics in iraq and afghanistan quantitative metrics allow for relatively uncomplicated comparisons however the infer ences from these comparisons can be misleading if the metrics assess inputs alone moes or mops because decisionmakers often give more credence to quantitative metrics than to qualitative ones improperly selecting metrics can be more damaging than similarly misidenti fying qualitative metrics qualitative metrics are not easily compared in their raw form qualitative data often lack common trait that allows for meaningful scalar comparison simple and generally informa tive aggregation can often be achieved by using stoplight charts it can be challenging to aggregate these qualitative and quantitative metrics from lower levels and draw inferences from the combined data at successively higher echelons the devel opment of the resulting compound metrics can in turn influence what is needed of data col lectors leaders must strive to develop compound metrics that provide the measures needed at their and higher echelons without overburdening those on the ground who collect the data ideally even the most complex compound metrics can rely on data that are simple to collect as very simple example of this we can look at situation that one of the authors faced in 2005 sadr city considerable resources and effort had been expended to refurbish 15 sewerpump stations in sadr city to get the raw sewage off the streets it was very easy to collect quantita tive data on the hours the pump stations were operational the number of operational spare generators and amount of fuel available to run them if the dedicated power went down and the number of resulting sewage backups within the pump stations vicinity 23 however none of these quantitative measures alone provided any understanding of the effects of these initia tives on local citizens or associated outcomes we could assume that individuals were better off with less sewage on the streets however there was definitive understanding of how the improved service affected their willingness to favor coalition forces and reject insurgent influ ences in the service of improving security thereby serving the ultimate goal of establishing legitimate iraqi government acceptable to the people it was clear that qualitative assessment of local atmospherics combined with quantitative assessment of the progress in ridding the streets of sewage was the metric desired data supporting this compound metric were rela tively easily collected forces needed to gauge the relative amount of sewage on the streets while determining the extent of public support for coalition and indigenous security forces thereby allowing them to determine correlation or lack thereof between coalition actions and local population perceptions atmospherics was term that our unit used to describe qualitative measure regarding neighborhood or other area it encompassed elements like the prevalence of waves and smiles from children and adults during patrol in relation to the extent of rock throwing and negative gesturing as well as other reflections of attitudes regarding coalition forces iraqi security personnel and the general quality of life as expressed by local citizens during interactions while there were many factors other than the amount of sewage that 23 all sewerpump stations in sadr city were provided dedicated 24hour electricaldistribution lines that were not subject to the rolling blackouts of local citizens despite concerns that there might be some animosity about this the local

correlation was within the realm of the feasible this is relatively simple example depicting qualitative and quantitative inputs that are rather easily collectible and combinable into compound metrics for use at higher echelons there is need to avoid defining metrics based on overly complex or difficulttocollect data it is to this challenge that we now turn coin operations necessitate ease of measurement for metricdata collection orga nizations should explore and develop the metrics that they think will best assess progress in achieving objectives however metric should be adopted only if it can be reasonably mea sured using available assets often the best and sometimes the only sources of data are the individual soldiers and marines conducting patrols on the street their tasks are many and varied with responsibilities that routinely put them in harms way this necessitates minimiz ing the difficulty of data collection so these men and women can quickly and accurately per form this task without unduly endangering themselves or impinging on other work simplicity also helps to ensure consistency in the quality of data collected increasing the complexity of collection requirements and the number of collectors greatly increases the potential for mea surement error col gregory fontenot recognized both the value of simplicity and the need to dis tinguish between moes and measures reflecting the beneficial effects of his 1st brigade 1st infantry division mechanized activities during its 19951996 deployment to bosnia and herzegovina at one point his unit had removed or otherwise neutralized 3000 mines in its ao the figure seemed impressive until one realized that those 3000 were but tiny fraction of the estimated 180000 mines within the brigades boundaries the moethe removal or destruction of 3000 mineswas easy to gauge but not particularly helpful colonel fon tenots moe met both standards the neutralization of those 3000 mines opened 45 routes to traffic 24 it had the additional benefit of providing metric that would be of consistent value regardless of the echelon employing it coin operations require the use of preplanned metrics and others developed as familiarity with the theater of operation increases the metrics that an organization uses to assess its progress are often derived in two very different ways some metrics are developed during the initial planning process specific quantitative or qualitative measures are matched against established tasks and missions to facilitate measuring progress later units also develop metrics that rely on more subjective assessment taking into account prevailing conditions these metrics associated with the operational environment tend to consist of many compo nents both qualitative and quantitative as

captured and killed number of weapon caches found number of health clinics constructed and number of business permits approved are examples of the types of simple quantifiable metrics that were initially used to reflect progress these metrics generally measured levels of inputs moes or coalition efficiency mops as the insurgency continued it became appar ent that these inputbased metrics were not necessarily moving in sync with desired outcomes gradually shift in focus from single countbased objective measures to more complex effect based measures began organizations experimented with the use of compound metrics that combined quantitative and qualitative data to allow staffs to develop holistic assessments in hopes of better linking the measurements to desired outcomes the shift to an effectbased approach relying on compound metrics significantly expanded both the datacollection and analysis burdens on units longer could patrol just make single count of some factor to satisfy its contribution to the metric puzzle instead it was expected to record subjective assess ments regarding an increasing number of measures eg the number of progovernment posters remaining on walls the demeanor of townspeople as the soldiers walked the streets and the willingness of those approached to talk to interpreters those at battalion level and above real ized corresponding additional burden on the resources needed to compile and analyze the incoming data commanders continue to develop increasingly complex metrics in hopes that they will better measure progress toward objectives despite pace that challenges the ability of doctrine developers and lessonslearned collectors authoritative sources are beginning to expand beyond the simple count metrics and are offering observations

metrics the bct staff would translate the division commanders intent into effects we wanted to achieve then identify metrics that could measure degrees of success or failure of the effects we wanted 32 this paradigm reflects the logical nesting that fm 324 counterinsurgency exhorts getting it right initially does not mean that the process of metric definition is complete continuous review and refinement of objectives and related metrics are ongoing processes ones that seeks to minimize unnecessary risk to soldiers while maximizing the value of resources expended in the service of strategic objectives lt gen sir john kiszely of the british army very clearly summarized the dangers inherent in suboptimizing at the tactical level all operations that are carried out should be evaluated as to whether they take you closer to or further away from your strategic goals thus they should be gauged at the operational level the level that links the tactical to the strategic too often this does not happen too often people look at their operation just in terms of tactical success for example there were some operations taking place in iraq where the success of the operationsay raidwas judged solely against whether tactical success had been achieved tactical suc cess in terms of attrition of enemy forces numbers killed or captured numbers of weapons seized amounts of explosives captured extent of area controlled by these criteriathese metricsa given operation would be judged success regardless of the fact that it had seri ously alienated the local population and the fact that within few months other insur gents had reinfiltrated and regained control but gauged at the operational level such an operation would have been judged fail ure because despite the tactical triumphs it had seriously alienated the local population thereby undermining the operationallevel center of gravity and taking us not closer to but further away from our strategic goal the operation had thus been actively counterproduc tive in considering the operation beforehand planners should have asked themselves not just will this operation be tactical success but will this operation be stepping stone on the path to achieving the operational level center of gravityand thus on the path to our strategic goal if the answer to the latter was the operation should have been dropped like hot stone 33 32

afghanistan although we would hope that this was the exception rather than the rule leaders at every level must constantly reassess objectives and metrics of subordinate units to ensure that all are aligned within the hierarchical organization it is the responsibility of senior command ers to ensure that subordinate commanders choice of actions to optimize outcomes at his or her level is not detrimental for the higher organization absent assessment and feedback from senior headquarters one can only expect subordinate commanders to seek maximum progress toward their local objectives linking metrics to objectives does not mean that all such measures pertain directly to the end state there will be metrics that apply only to some phases of campaign plan metrics must be adapted as operations progress to ensure that they remain aligned with intermediate as well as ultimate objectives metrics therefore have to be nested not only from echelon to ech elon to the extent possible but also from phase to phase within given echelon metrics must measure progress toward meeting objectives my team said something in report that differed from the report by the brigade call came from camp victory asking why are you differing you shouldnt be differing and i said if you ask local leader are the police trained he could truthfully answer yes so they have all green lights up on the chart but i might have red light because yes they are trained but they are going around intimidating the people in our rush to brevity we sacrifice accuracy and then the poor general thinks he is informed but he is not stephanie miley us department of state 34 we have observed that metrics must adapt in part because objectives at various echelons change david sanger in new york times article supports this point by highlighting how president george w bush changed strategies four or five times in iraq and that bushs new gauge for measuring progress evolved from focus on the maturation of the iraqi government which had been key metric leading up to the surge testimony in september 2007 to one regarding us alliances with tribes and local groups 35 junior leaders with daily interaction with local iraqis seem to understand the impor tance of measuring effects in lieu of inputs however this understanding does not ensure that higherlevel commanders will coordinate the establishment of metrics

objective is his concern regarding the metrics he was asked to report the metrics i use to measure it are something that might not even be meaningful the number of people playing dominoes on the street and the hours of electricity every day there used to be big pile of garbage there and now theres little pile 37 his anxi ety seems justified at first glance the data he and his unit were collecting seemed little more than measures of inputs simple counts of the number of individuals playing dominoes hours of electricity available and amount of trash however closer look reflects that what appear to be input measures of little import areat least in some casesmetrics reflective of effects increasing numbers of individuals playing dominoes could represent an increased perception of security increased hours of power might represent an improvement in conditions necessary for economic development and decrease in the amount of trash on the street could suggest increased security quality of life and improved potential for economic development any of these measures might be one of several components of compound metrics employed by higher echelons yet captain brooks is right to inquire whether the chosen measures in fact represent effects his unease demonstrates the importance of explaining the purpose of the data being collected to those performing the task in other instances quantitative measures are clearly more dubious as moes an observer of operations in afghanistan expressed frustration in finding that operational commanders also continue to indulge in the fallacy of body counts and month in which more taliban are killed than in the previous month is seen as progress this is actually more likely merely to reflect the fact that there are more enemy on the battlefield than there were before 38 several officers voiced concerns that the focus during predeployment exercises such as those conducted in conjunction with fort leavenworths battle command training program bctp remains primarily on the collection and analysis of lessmeaningful quantitative data while the current trend in theater is on capturing and assessing qualitative data one maj john pirog battalion s3 in baghdad summed up his frustration after having had to make adjustments following false start in theater i wish someone had told us to collect nonkinetic data in the beginning we were young battalion 39 the units predeployment training emphasized deliberate model in which quantitative data were the means for mea suring progress the instruction had in effect made them resistant to using more qualitative metrics or more rapidly adapting their metrics to meet operational needs ltc michael johnson squadron commander in the us armys 3rd infantry division shared

metrics at various echelons and constantly reevaluating chosen measures to gauge whether revision or abandonment is called for leaders need to have an opportunity to determine the balance between too much measurement and the desired good enough addressing this issue lieutenant colonel johnson noted metrics can sume lower level unit there is little time to get formal with metrics developing too many metrics and developing them too soon can cause unit to unknowingly go in the wrong direc tion all metrics must have system to frequently adjust and determine whether they are useful and are measuring the right thing 40 the undertone here is that units can become so consumed with collecting the data needed to assess their progress that they are expending more energy on that collection than conducting operations that actually achieve the desired effects additionally units can become so comfort able with assessment procedures that they lose sight of whether the metrics continue to accu rately measure progress others with experience in afghanistan and iraq also echoed the observation that mea suring effects is considerably more challenging than simply gauging inputs effect metrics can make some people uncomfortable when asked how he determined that security was improv ing in afghanistan brigadier theo vleugels of the royal netherlands army responded that that task required us to make contact with the village mayor and the police chief it was not the case that we asked the population whether we had achieved security because they tell you what you want to hear i agree it is not very effective in sense but it is the best we could do at the moment 41 ltc kevin farrell commander of 164 armor 3rd infantry division aptly articulated this evolution in metrics like general vleugels he realized that just because something is measurable does not make it important and not all important information is quantifiable i see this as the distinction between the art and science of war42 ambassador hilary synnott drew on his lengthy career as diplomat to similarly observe much could be learned or intuited from the souks markets the state of economic activ ity could be assessed from the selection of products on ale their price and source of origin the wellbeing of the population could be judged by the appearance of the shopkeepers 40 m johnson 2007a 41 vleugels 2007

and their customers did they look healthy were they cheery or gloomy how were they dressed the quality of local government could be seen from the state of the streets and infrastructure 43 one method of measuring effects rather than inputs that our interviewees commonly cited is to use some form of polling to capture the perceptions of the local population the concern with polling however is that because of the oftendangerous environment the poll ing organizations may not be able to ensure the rigor necessary to validate the randomness of respondent samples general vleugels observation regarding afghans propensity to provide the answers they think coalition soldiers want to hear validates the need to use local pollsters and even then to be cautious regarding use of results commanders in the field seem to be aware of these potential biases and use polls as references to gauge changes rather than absolute values colonel disalvo was one who concurred in this regard polls are good as reference but the degree of bias is usually profound 44 wise to treat polling results as only one of several decision aids leaders should nevertheless not overlook ways to improve the quality of those results charles barlow the former head of the canadian forces afghanistan intelligence response team opined polling generally showed reasonably high level of popular support but we overlooked the fact that we are not working in democracywhatever we may wish to call itand that the opinions of only few people actually matter polling should be done that identifies what tribal leaders and religious leaders believe such polling should ask them what they want in return for their support and conversely what would cause them to with draw that support surprisingly they will tell us when we bother to ask 45 the common viewpoint of those raised in democracy is that polling leads to an under standing of popular opinion and hence can help leaders best match available resources to the wants and needs of the people however though general vleugels recognized the desirability to accurately poll views of the population at large he also realized that in country where the population is subservient to the desires of its leaders soliciting the needs of the individuals at the apex of social hierarchies is helpful despite not being optimal another key to enhancing the value of polling results therefore is to ensure that the socialnode influencers are solicited for their input in order to understand the impacts of potential policy and resource changes on the attitudes of the influencers and hence the remainder of the population 43 synnott 2008 p 110 44 disalvo 2007 45 barlow 2007unclassifiedfor official use only rel to usaausnzlisrnato unclassifiedfor official use only

correlation does not necessarily imply causation meaning that just because two things happen at the same time one does not necessarily cause the other the classic example illustrating this principle is that you may eat carrots at dawn and two hours later see more clearly but it does not necessarily follow that the carrots cause improved eye sight in the case of reduced need for kinetic operations causes for that over the past year might have included bad weather poor crops good intel ligence bad intelligence new commanders switch in taliban strategy switch in ameri can strategy etc etc the point being that just because the number of kinetic operations declined it does not follow that it was caused by hts humanterrain system the odd thing is that in pilot program such as hts natural experiment is easy to develop the question to ask is did that number of kinetic operations decline any quicker in the area controlled by the brigade than it did in areas controlled by brigades that did not have hts this would presumably be easy to do in afghanistan where not only are there more than one american brigades but other countries also have military presence such other sectors act as control and then draw conclusions about hts effectiveness such data are also open to the perils of interpretation but using it is far better than relying on vague feelings and anecdote tony waters message to hts anthropologists 46 finding causal relationship between actions taken by unit in combat zone and the effects or outcomes observed in relation to the population is the ideal albeit extremely unlikely situ ation to establish causality essentially action occurs resulting in outcome b requires that very specific conditions be met the unit would have to be able to control for isolate all vari ables that could be influencing the outcomes other than the one it believes causes the desired result commanders expressed significant concerns about the ability to both determine that these outcomes existed and identify causal relationships between them and units actions ltc jeff peterson commander of 214 cavalry observed even if we can successfully measure an outcome its extremely hard to know what caused the outcome there are so many things happening at once that causal relationships are next to impossible to identify there is certain amount of guessing and

useful if you know that they are giving you the correct indicators in complicated environment this can be really hard decrease in violence by means indicates necessarily that anything you are doing is causing it 48 cpt jon brooks company commander in tf 212 cavalry in iraq was more succinct he argued that higher headquarters asking for metrics assumes linear progression that doesnt exist49 similarly maj dan rouse xo for 212 cavalry realized so much is inter related that measuring one thing does not reflect the relationships50 his comment highlights the interrelatedness of the factors that influence activities in an operational area urban areas are particularly dense with possible influencing factors making establishment of causality even more difficult than elsewhere however an experiment in the typical sense being impossible in combat does not mean that commanders should give up on attempting to establish what actions influence outcomes in their aos 51 field experiments what are referred to as natural experiments in the quotation at the opening of this sectionthose with lesser standards than those one would accept in laboratory where conditions can be controlled and variables completely isolatedmay be both feasible and helpful though the tempo of operations may require that the individuals conducting the experiment are from otherthanoperational units understanding the diffi culty of establishing causality commanders may instead be able to establish the less demand ing though still problematic state of correlation ie when action occurs activity b also occurs because of the everevolving nature of coin operations correlation is probably the strongest possible relationship that the commander can hope to establish yet even this deter mination may well have limited utility operational environments are dynamic relationships between variables seldom remain the same for long other variables of previous importance will assume role while others of previous significance may longer affect relationships while correlation certainly should help to guide leaders resource commitment at given point in time commanders will have to be ever mindful that yesterdays truths may have little valid ity today like objectives and metrics assumptions regarding relationships will have to be stantly monitored 48 m johnson 2007a 49 brooks 2007 50 rouse 2007 51

iraq and afghanistan metrics must reflect local conditions higher headquarters is using how much tip money is being spent as metric but in our area it doesnt work that way ltc james d nickolas us army52 this observation is most easily accepted by reviewing the converse which would absurdly imply that once the llos and objectives had been established for the theater metrics could be universally adopted that would apply to all units regardless of location or circumstances accepting this logic would result in assignment of metrics before entry into an ao since specific factors there would be of consequence this approach would allow higher headquarters to define one set of metrics applicable to an entire theater resulting in the convenient situation in which simply aggregating localized metrics would permit assessing overall progress situa tion akin to our heretofore discussed usr the reality of course is much more complex any measures established or interpreted by higher headquarters that do not reflect local conditions are at best suspect and will almost inevitably precipitate inappropriate conclusions resulting in inefficient or counterproductive actions ltc gian gentile was using the number of dead bodies found on his iraqi aos streets as metric for the reduction in sectarian violence while the measure might have been appropri ate elsewhere colonel gentile soon realized that such was not the case in his ao i increased the number of patrols in the area gained the confidence of the local sheiks and imams picked up garbage off of the streets to improve the lives of the locals and ducted more raids to capture insurgents whom we thought were taking part in sectarian killings early perceived results of my units efforts appeared encouraging the number of dead bodies on the streets declined significantly initially i thought my squadrons military actions had produced the decline however as i learned more about my area i came to realize that the reduction of bodies on the streets was due not so much to my units military actions but to the simple fact that most of the minority shia who had lived in ameriyah had either been killed or fled the area fewer shia bodies were showing up on the streets because there were fewer shia for the local sunnis to kill 53 colonel gentiles initial misconception resulted in his reaching conclusion that was counter to the reality on the ground this may have resulted in less effective allocation of resources than had he originally been aware that purging the community of shia was the actual cause of fewer corpses therein commander can take several steps to reduce the chances that his or her metrics will be misleading the following are but sample good units are sure to develop others first specifically

assumptions behind the establishment of those metrics and whether they have been validated adapted or otherwise challenged over time second as once mentioned wargame metrics just as one would any

unsuitable metrics altogether third create pirs and other informationcollection and analysis tools in conjunction with metric definition identify the sources of information that will best support metric validation adaptation or replacement or disposal fourth work in conjunction with adjacent and higher units exchanging intel and feedback that will assist in capitalizing on commonalities across unit boundaries and between echelons fifth encourage all unit members to challenge metrics or propose alternatives per haps rewarding those whose inputs prove the most insightful or valuable lastly fully explain every metric in writing for use in both briefing unit members and informing higher head quarters that will receive these measures as reflections of conditions within the unit ao this last step obviously implies willingness to work with those at higher echelons to find metrics that reflect both local realities and need to make them germane to objectives at all relevant levels understanding the dynamics of local area is not nicetohave proposition it is musthave essential to developing metrics that assist in allocating resources and in turn pro vide meaningful progress toward meeting desired objectives despite our commanders on the ground beginning to acknowledge this need for localized metrics that reflect the dynamics of their area at times higher commanders continue to believe that they can aggregate this data into compound metrics without recognizing local differences compound metrics are increasingly being used at all levels an increasing need for compound metrics is the result of the necessity to transition from reliance on measuring inputs to measuring effects the key to the success of these compound metrics is the ability to aggregate these lowerlevel metrics in such way as to allow higherlevel commanders the ability to draw inferences across larger portions of the population without compromising the metrics ability to measure progress in each lower commanders ao commanders interviewed alluded to this need for metrics that offered these characteris tics but only peripherally addressed them general vleugels was an exception he believes that taking lot of qualitative subjective inputs makes the analysis more objective 54 the need to meld metrics provided by subordinate organizations is requirement that must be considered when designing those metrics aggregation to allow higher commanders to draw inferences will take place whether appropriate or not an outstanding challenge is to determine how to find the appropriate

to interpret metrics and accurately gauge the progress that is being made in achieving objectives it is also important to realize that how question is asked can dictate the response those gathering information from population must ensure their questions do not prejudice answers asking how much better are living conditions in your neighborhood now than when 1st brigade was here is flawed from at least two perspectives first the questioner is inherently assuming that conditions have improved how much better this may well be inter preted as not allowing response that suggests otherwise second many of those asked may be new to the community or otherwise not know when the 1st brigade was responsible for the area question design must include consideration of the respondents perspective depending on the society involved this can require considerable imagination anthropologist marcus griffin noted that it is critical to use 1 chronological reference points that respondents can readily grasp and 2 measuring system that they can understand one that will be consistent across all who take the survey or are being interviewed you have to know what counting system they use knowing what the common usage is would be essential comparatively it has to be the same from one person to the next for example use time period as follows how much confidence do you have in the govern ment now compared to what you had during the last full moon 59 griffin also identified the need to use scoring scale that is readily understood telling respondent rank your confidence on scale of one to five where five means very confident or asking him or her to use percentages might not be understood it is crucial to figure out way to introduce an comprehensible system that is uniformly understood across the sample of individuals griffin provided this alternative if one rock means the government doesnt provide you much help three means they pro vide you support that is pretty good and five rocks means they provide all the support you think they should what level of support did they provide at the point of the last full moon how about the level of support now this is similar to the way doctors ask people to gauge their level of pain from 0 doesnt bother at all to 10 unbearable60 major trevetts observation regarding the time periods metric should cover touches on critical point what span is appropriate will vary by what is being measured the tempo of operations the rate of environmental change eg the speed with which an enemy or other entity is capable of responding to

often in need of indicators of progressor danger signsto guide their actions i believe that the insurgencies in north vietnam malaya and south vietnam have produced four such reliable indicators of

live and operate third is the flow of information from the people the fourth is the rate of surrender of genuine guerrillas brigadier richard l clutterbuck the long long war 62 it should be very clear at this point that metrics are rapidly becoming one of the focal points of coin operations the selection of specific metrics influences not only the actions and opera tions of those conducting operations but also the standards by which their progress will be evaluated by commanders political leaders national and international media representatives and subsequently the populations of the united states and world this reinforces the urgency with which leaders must be trained to understand theory and practice regarding metrics in closing we offer few observations and recommendations that will hopefully help maintain the momentum toward better understanding of metric development and the creation 61 anonymous source 11 62 clutterbuck 1966 p 177unclassifiedfor official use only rel to

are not meant to be comprehensive rather they are those derived from interviewee and writers concerns about what continues to provide the paramount challenges in the field and those sources thoughts on how to address these issues provide objectives from the top and input measures from the bottom with effectbased metrics as the common link clear and concise operational and strategic objectives are invaluable in providing guidance to subordinate echelons these objectives must be nested at each level so that all organizations understand their missions and commanders intents from several layers of hierarchy above them the conventionalwar wisdom of referring to the commanders intent two levels up during planning will often longer be sufficient counterinsurgency and the strategic cor porals 63 who conduct its operations require an understanding of national and coalition objec tives even at the lowest tactical levels the critical link that bridges the gap between objectives coming from higher and metric measurements coming from lower is effects using effects in this way is like translating between different languages that are being used by the different levels of command effects are the common links that enable the tactical operational and strategic levels of command to interface units on the ground must be trusted to translate physical events and activities they see into effectbased metrics that are the vehicles for transferring information to higher levels higher levels of command must be able to take these effectbased metrics and aggregate them into groupings that allow them to measure progress in reaching designated objectives these outcomes can then be used to inform political leaders and the public thereby substantiat ing requests for the resources necessary to sustain operations or leave the fight there are still significant growing pains confusion and misunderstanding about the development of effectbased metrics junior and senior leaders alike will struggle with developing and employing the complex effectbased metrics that are necessary to form the critical link to higherlevel unit objectives until the training and inculcation of these skills are institutionalized combine qualitative and quantitative metrics to form compound metrics when necessary complete review of existing and proposed metrics must be undertaken when unit enters new coin environment the purpose of the review is twofold leaders must first ensure that the link between higher headquarters objectives and subordinates metrics maintains an effect focus second they must review any existing measures to ensure that they are applicable to the new environment and its unique conditions these dual demands will likely make it neces sary to combine quantitative and qualitative measures to achieve the effectbased compound metrics desired as an example measuring the number of hours that sewerpump station in sadr city operates on daily basis is quantitative moe

city combined they provide potentially informative measure regarding improvement in the quality of life and the level of confidence one should place in the provision of government services routine reassessment and refinement of metrics are absolutely essential earlier we discussed how metrics must be developed and adapted to take into account the specific locations people and periods in which unit is conducting operations all of these factors change over time based on myriad events including economic ethnic tribal and reli gious activities among others in addition units conducting patrols and collecting metric data often develop routines that in some ways facilitate the collection of data but in others reduce the likelihood that they will collect additional and potentially revealing information avoiding such metric complacency is another reason to consistently review and as necessary revise both the character of the measures being taken and the means used to collect relevant data several unit commanders discussed the importance of conducting azimuth checks on their metrics 64 whether they are conducted weekly biweekly monthly or otherwise the time must be built into the battle rhythm to conduct holistic review of existing and proposed metrics these reviews serve several purposes first they provide an opportunity for staffs and com manders to assess how well the existing metrics are measuring progress against objectives from higher any shortfalls can be addressed and metrics can be added modified or deleted to better address the needs of the higher organization this streamlines the collection process and ensures that all efforts by collectors are necessaryminimizing exposure and risk to soldiers by collecting only that which adds value to the process second reassessment provides the forum to similarly reassess baseline standards fundamental but toooften overlooked component of metric employment metric without baseline is virtually meaningless finding that the murder rate in an ao is 15000 members of the population tells commanders little unless pre vious eg prefall of saddam hussein rates are available yet knowledge of previous condi tions is only part of establishing baseline that community receives 12 hours of electricity day is of limited utility in constructing compound metric even if the previous average was four hours daily when political announcements established expectations of constant power each metric requires establishment of related baseline as colonel gentiles example regard ing the number of dead found in his ao suggests these baselines also require revalidation or modification as conditions dictate use redteam approach to evaluate existing metrics the development of metrics can generate champions who argue for the adaptation or reten tion of their measure losing their objective perspective this propensity is an acknowledged 64 several commanders mentioned reviews or azimuth checks during their interviews as

of the reasons that military decisionmaking processes assign the s2 the responsibility of assuming the enemy perspective during planning processes theirs is the responsibility to look for weaknesses in the draft plan that an adversary could exploit similar wargaming methodology should be extended to metric development devils advocates would seek how proposed or existing metrics might not be measuring what is intended how the metric might be misleading or misunderstood how collection of support ing data might be unnecessarily risky or how results could be deliberately misconstrued and

accomplished through the military decisionmaking process of which in reality it should be part present metrics using simple easytounderstand tools that help commanders make decisions metrics must be

experience from previous tours conduct ing coin operations professional education needs to continue to evolve to teach all levels of commanders and staffs the fundamentals of developing effectbased metrics these effect based metric courses should provide current information on real locations and real situations to student staffs to allow them to develop metrics that they think would best measure prog ress at achieving the higher commanders echeloned objectives there is better training than using realworld data to develop product that deploying commander could review to enhance his or her metric plan these courses should also develop students understanding of the difference between causality and correlation to the extent that it will enable the students to determine the relative importance of specific inputs and the likelihood that they are affect ing the desired outcome and therefore the importance that should be placed on sustaining these actions in the face of the enemys adaptations additionally students must be trained to understand the importance of the local environment and customs in developing effectbased metrics metrics that are appropriate for one location may

realized that the enemy was not mass of uniformed automatons 26 they sought to separate the less committed from the fanatical via means that reduced the risk of friendlyforce casualties while increasing the likelihood of obtaining valuable intel the similarity to colonel suggits compliance model is obvious counterinsurgency is many things simple and straightforward are not among them

center for excellence taji iraq 29 brigades with longstanding habitual taskorganization relationships are frequently broken apart when deployed to iraq the authors of this report found that on more than one occa sion multiple tfs were taken from the brigades with which they trained only to be replaced by unfamiliar units of like size and capability the primary reason for the disruption seems to have been deployment schedules rather than unit capabilities reflecting that the decisions were made at the strategic and operational levels rather than being driven by tactical considerations good commanders recognize that todays operational environment strains unit readiness in ways that preparing for conventional warfare never did col j b burton knowing that his 2nd bct would soon deploy to iraq recognized that the men and women in his command had to be ready for what the streets of baghdad had to offer but at the same time your tankers have to operate tank your gunners need to fire their guns we went to the us army garrison at grafenwöhr early i was not going to put people in range tower i had people moving around the range environment with their weapons uploaded in red status so that they were aware of their environment we clothed the tar gets in typical arab garb we equipped some with weapons some with hidden weapons we put them in buildings so that they would pop up in

supplies as they would during operations in iraq there were ammo pads its the exercise of the totality of the environment in iraq 30 the rotation at the grafenwöhr training area was not the brigades only opportunity to simultaneously prepare for counterinsurgency and conventional warfare while strengthening the whole as team the brigade intel officer maj guy wetzel recalled we realized that humint was going to be huge thing we gave up our thts to our battalions early on so they could go through all the training we did while preparing for deployment the downside was that we had three

permit ted to go out into baghdad but was encouraged to do so repeatedly both during the day and at night there was much that reminded one of the authors of his visit to iraq in early 2004 children thronged and begged to have photographs taken adults were more reticent but there were also striking differences having learned much regarding counterinsurgency and the critical role of the population in intervening years those leading the patrols did far more than demonstrate the presence of coalition forces they sought to make interactions with city residents sometimes brief and superficial in 2004 longer and more substantive adults were still hesitant to join in conversation at times but leaders demonstrated patience in drawing unclassifiedfor official use only rel to usaausnzlisrnato

members entered stores and inquired as to the pace of business previously troublesome militia members were in uniform as directed by us officers meaning that community members would immediately recognize and could report any untoward behaviors by those representing the group in ques tion granted these are the observations of but one person yet the changes in conditions on the ground were also reflected by far better understanding of counterinsurgencys nuances during the many interviews conducted in support of this study this understanding is evident in evolutions in the approaches taken by coalition person nel the outpost platoon house and jss are now the norm rather than units being restricted to huge fobs vehicles are for moving to neighborhoods thereafter to assume backup role to the primary mode of patrolling soldiers on foot noncommissioned and commissioned officers are providing vital assistance to communities playing the part of mayor city manager police chief and communityassociation head to greater or lesser extent depending on the willing ness of local leaders to assume those roles local leaders are increasingly willing to do so yet there remains considerable frustration after looking over the pages of research in the three books preceding this one it is not that the authors expect every recommendation to be heralded as paving stone for the road ahead but several have been subsequently recognized in multiple forums as having value in promoting coalition success unfortunately the gap between recognition and substantive action too often remains considerable one shortterm perspectives and political ambitions sometimes make one question whether the united states political system is capable of sustaining support for an extended major counterinsurgency the question is disturbing one given that most 20thcentury insurgencies had durations that exceeded decade on more positive note ongoing operations in the southern philip pines suggest that sustaining support may be possible if the number of americans committed to deployment and media visibility are limited 3 it appears that limelight withers support for counterinsurgencies akin to this issue of maintaining domestic and political support that of addressing inter agency inconsistencies is only somewhat within the bounds of the us militarys influence the inherent inertia that characterizes virtually any large bureaucracy surely accounts for the limited progress thus far made in managing the many agencies working together in afghani stan and iraq much less those representing other nations ngos and igos real improve ment in this regard is likely many years distant yet delay need not mean that leaders continue to tolerate counterproductive episodes such as the failure to agree on whether aid should be cut off to recalcitrant baghdad neighborhood the development of comprehensive truly interagency campaign plans accompanied by clear lines of authority and responsibility are both overdue and essential 4 3 for more on us operations in the southern philippines see glenn 2008 4 for more discussion of issues directly and indirectly related to interagency

this report intel and metrics both formal changes to orga nization structures such as introducing thts and adaptations on the ground eg creating morerobust tf intel sections demonstrate the importance assigned to the intel realm by those most directly influenced by it the soldiers sailors marines and airmen at the tactical level it is also at these levels that leaders show great initiative in developing procedures and infor mal agreements with other government agencies that overcome hurdles to sharing intel these efforts represent real groundtruth calls for change that merit attention at higher echelons of particular note is the breadth of the call for companylevel intel capability accompanied by complementary buildup at battalion tf echelon planned expansions of intel staffing in coming years provide opportunities to address such recently recognized requirements ones perhaps not envisioned when those numbers were originally approved and thus suggesting reconsideration is in order perhaps the recommendation made herein that will be most challenging is that suggest ing reorientation of intelcommunity thinking from needtoknow mentality to one basing release of material on needtoshare basis its impactwere it to be adoptedwould to considerable extent turn current procedures on their heads access to classified or sensitive information is at present denied to anyone without demonstrated necessity to see it intro ducing needtoshare standard would mean that access is granted to individuals and groups unless there is demonstrable reason not to provide that access this would not imply release of information or other materials to those seeking to harm the united states or its allies however it would hopefully redress absurd situations such as that of dutch f16 pilots being denied access to bda for their missions metrics are at once quagmire and an area of considerable promise the negative aspect has nothing to do with the considerable potential benefits that metrics offer the armed services and other agencies it instead applies to the complexity of the topic the more one investigates metrics the deeper and murkier their waters seem that the contingencies on which we focus here are in considerable part coin ones helps to explain the challenge whereas conven tional war lends itself to quantification of results counterinsurgency is less amenable in that regard qualitative evaluations are at least as important to measuring the effects of organiza tions actions as are those countable translating these softer metrics into something of value can be difficult doing so when they are reported to higher echelons and as part of but one of many units submittals magnifies the difficulties several fold in some cases the unique ness of conditions in particular ao means that melding such inputs with others is simply impossible or worse doing so would lead to misleading results occasionally the familiar can help stoplight charts are one way of visualizing qualitative data in some instances but in general there is need for more study of metrics and training of those whose responsibilities involve their development collection

ecommendations and implications for the future 85 future implications it is hoped that the discussions and recommendations in the preceding pages will have value not only to ongoing contingencies but also to others yet to come they are part of grow ing literature seeking to assist future leaders in that regard that such resources are available is heartening less inspiring is the persistence of mistakes in confronting insurgencies the worlds armed forces never solved all the riddles associated with the postworld war ii occu pations and counterinsurgencies in the philippines malaya algeria vietnam and elsewhere but those and other events offer many lessons with application to the 21stcentury contingen cies confronting coalitions today major mistakes such as disbanding the ia consolidating units on large fobs in lieu of dispersing them amongst the population in smaller installations and being insufficiently careful with aerial bombardment in afghanistan suggest that leaders at all echelons were less educated with respect to counterinsurgency than was warranted that too many military curricula still involve exercises with sovietstyle formations raging across terrain more reminiscent of northwest europe than baghdad kandahar or helmand prov ince is equally discouraging col j b burtons imaginative training at grafenwöhr suggests that the choice need not be between conventionalwar preparedness and readiness to assume irregularconflict responsibilities much of the time spent in the schoolhouse on the range or in the field can serve both what is called for is greater commitment to taking advantage of these opportunities units and individuals will certainly need to brush up on certain skills as the mission changes but assuming that being prepared for one or the other alternative is the only choice is an unaffordable luxury pointing the finger at military training at installations alone is to miss vital component of preparedness that so many leaders at every level were less familiar with counterinsurgency than they should have been means that they failed to educate themselves far more of mili tary leaders time is spent out of schools than in even when on exercise or deployment there are moments of respite with the status of military professional comes the responsibility to have particular expertise that others do not samuel huntington

block 2 and fighting an armed foe in forceonforce combat block 3 further these events could occur simultaneously and on contiguous blocks the metaphor was found to be valid one by those in the field marine and soldier us and uk service representatives alike recalled general krulaks model and declared that it accurately depicted the scope of challenges force finds itself confronting in villages towns and cities during combat operations the difficulty is that military forces are not staffed or equipped to concurrently handle the myriad tasks encompassed by the three blocks the threeblock war therefore not only presents planning challenge but also constitutes resourceallocation nightmare orchestrating urban military and civil activities in support of strategic objectives is fundamental to national and coalition success given that these modern ground forces are allocated personnel and materiel sufficient only for combat or supporting forces conducting fight the activities of other agencies capable of bringing further elements of national power to bear should be well orchestrated with those in dod this was not the case during early opera tions in 2003 iraq the delineation of responsibilities and orchestration of capabilities between dod and other federal nongovernmental or private volunteer organizations was unsatisfac tory improvement on the part of all participants is called for urban operations increasingly characterize us and coalition undertakings world urbanization approximately half of the worlds population now resides in urban areas and the forceprojection character of the us armed forces increasingly means that virtually any military action will involve activities in builtup areas ports and airfields are fundamental to force projection urban operations are almost inevitable because these are often adjacent to or embedded in larger urban areas and in fact are inherently urban in character themselves further the importance of cities as social economic diplomatic cultural transportation and other types of hubs means that coalition objectives will generally require military forces to conduct operations in these areas the complexity of such undertakingsdealing with het erogeneous demographic groups maintaining infrastructure support and coordinating media requirements to name but threeis far greater in densely packed urban environs this density of demands will therefore also come to be the norm for military and other leaders there is good news amidst these challenges however such density and complexity are rarely found in any other type of environment therefore force qualified to meet such demands is likely able to apply its expertise and accomplish its missions virtually anywhere further the observations insights and related recommendations on these pages will similarly often have applicability to environments beyond those urban observations and insights from people make the city understand at minimum transition to civil authority not actions on the objective should be the point from which to initiate backward planning it will often be necessary to look even deeper in time military forces of all services tend to define desired end state as the start ing point for planning and then work backward to the present to best determine the resources and timings of events necessary to achieve that desired end too often

official use only rel to usaausnzlisrnatoa compilation of observations and insights from t his r eport and the t hree p revious books 93 objectives beyond those military the appropriate end state from which to plan is not the defeat of the enemy or actions on an objective it is the handover of responsibility to an indigenous government or transition governing body to focus on the military end alone means that such targets as communication towers and power plants may be destroyed given the benefits they offer the armed foe however longerterm perspective reveals this such assets are crucial to the indigenous society recovering rapidly and successfully which makes sparing such resources or finding alternatives that are less damaging than total destruction more attractive it is essential to consider the second and higherorder effects of actions taken during urban operations those effects can be counterintuitive second and higherorder effects often have more immediate and wider impact in urban areas than in other environments plan ners and commanders need to consider consequences of their decisions and actions beyond those of the first order to avoid negative repercussions that can undermine mission success studies of former urban operations most notably oef and oif demonstrate that there is need to modify us joint and service intel processes acquisition training support proce dures and doctrine us armed forces retain too much of their coldwar character in the way they do business for example those who determine weapon systems armaments and ammu nition requirements too rarely incorporate urban considerations in their thinking despite the inevitability of urban operations the lack of readily available way for dismounted personnel to talk to crews in buttonedup armored vehicles is but one of many examples similarly the greater reliance on humint that characterizes urban operations suggests that fundamental changes to intelstaffing and informationprocessing policies may be in order irregular warfare like urban operations is very much influenced by noncombatants lessons from the former can be of value in addressing the latter the urban insurgent requires the support of sea civilian population just as did maos guerrillas in china vc in viet nam or irregulars elsewhere during the many uprisings and rebellions that took place in the latter half of the 20th century that sea is in fact far denser when it is an urban one there are more individuals to provide support to insurgents but more are also likely to know of the activities of such groups depriving the urban foe of support or capitalizing on the greater den sity of potential intel collectors are but two ways of taking advantage of this density increase 5 considered from the perspective of urban areas unique characteristics the many studies of irregular warfare conducted halfcentury ago offer similar lessons very pertinent today decentralization and therefore good junior leadership are essential to urban operation mission accomplishment however decentralization can make it more difficult to gain compliance within ones own force especially in the normally highly heterogeneous urban environment the heterogeneity inherent in many urban environments means that subordinate commanders will often be better acquainted with local demands than leaders at higher echelons such local knowledge argues for decentralized decisionmaking at the same time junior leaders must be trained and disciplined such that they respond appropriately when 5 for further discussion of removing support

metrics in iraq and afghanistan centralized control is necessary or uniform standards must be enforced throughout an urban population urban combat operations confront commanders with dilemma of force todays mili tary commanders regardless of service find that urban combat operations challenge them with an inherent tension between the need to 1 defeat their enemy while minimizing casual ties in their own force and 2 keeping noncombatant casualties and infrastructure damage to minimum the dilemmas are many the soldier or marine who hesitates to pull the trigger because the foe is using civilians as shield the pilot concerned about the hospital next to which the enemy has positioned air defense systems and the commander forgoing tactical advantage because the opposition is firing from mosque all require the exercise of extraordi nary restraint the actions are commendable they serve the ends of achieving coalition strategic objectives and maintaining degree of humanitarian compassion in keeping with civilized standards in the oftuncivilized environment of combat war however is the realm of destruction there will be instances in which these men and women will have to put innocents and their property at risk in such cases there may be good outcome alternative that promises to benefit all desired ends but rather one only less undesirable than its alternatives pilot might select the alternative of engaging only few rooms instead of destroying an entire building with the appropriate airframe and munitions being called on for the task in lieu of devastating town groundforce commander could find that limited number of enemy concentrations provides the opportunity to wreak destruc tion over only few blocks there are times when minimizing unfortunate loss still demands considerable destruction the difficult decisions in this regard will be influenced by the mission strategic objectives moral implications and other factors that are situationdependent leaders making the difficult decisions must find an appropriate balance between restraint and devasta tion and train their subordinates to do the same observations and insights from people make the city shape shaping of noncombatant enemy and other urban perceptions should be designed war gamed and conducted as campaign while progress has been made in coordinating psyop and civilaffairs activities in the support of military and civil objectives too often other aspects of military operations are poorly synchronized with those efforts to win indigenous trust and confidence there is need to orchestrate all aspects of military operations to sistently address desired ends this requires creating shapingcampaign plan that establishes guidance for consistent shaping seizing opportunities as they present themselves and adapting to minimize the effects of negative events managing expectations is critical to successful shaping many iraqis heard western leaders claims that life in iraq would be better

personnel from combat duties to stability tasks if widespread looting will undermine the restoration of order and cause significant long term infrastructure damage the decision to do so early when the

tasks for which com mander needs educated guidance use of funds to abet success in these many areas requires skill beyond those taught in military institutions fiscal policies need to be developed

regime representatives may take violent action to consolidate their position as an influential party in post transition society though it may not be feasible due to political constraints urban stability operations should be driven by an end state not an end date it is difficult to determine how long it will take to attain national objectives during the consolidation and transition periods it is therefore desirable to tie when feasible transition milestones to accomplishment of those or support ing objectives rather than points in time beware the insurgenttocriminal evolution given some evidence that iraqi urban resi dents are tiring of insurgent violence it is necessary to consider how the insurgent forces are likely to adapt to possible reduced level of support or tolerance in the

behind to become fullfledged players among international organized crime syndicates the situations in afghanistan and iraq are unclear in this regard as of this writing in siderable part due to the heterogeneity and number of such groups especially in iraq former criminal elements are among the insurgent ranks but some insurgent groups have punished criminal activities by other factions such as

individual rotation offers extraordinary training opportunities that are as of yet not being fully recognized in contrast to vietnam war policies the us military rotates units rather than individuals in meeting the obligations of continuing operations in afghanistan and iraq an advantage of so doing is the ability to train units for pending responsibilities before deployment establishing close ties between intheater leaders and those designated to replace them enables the passage of vital information on an individual basis linking deployed units to their replacements has proven tremendous boon to organizations readying to assume responsibility for the complex urban operations that characterize the challenges for so many units such links unusual at present should become the norm tourlength policy would benefit from comprehensive study unit tour lengths differ significantly between services and nations individuals in the us military generally rotate with their unit regardless of whether their responsibilities are such that longer period of overseas assignment might better serve coalition objectives an initial polling of leaders serving or with recent tours in iraq reveals

more foes than they had at the initiation of opera tions scrutinizing concepts courses of action and plans from the perspective of preserving noncombatant support and protecting civilian welfare would introduce significantly different character to operations putting predominant priority on the same issues while patrolling city streets or when otherwise in the field would do likewise the challenges are very significant as are the risks inherent in relying on lesser volume of firepower when receiving incoming fire restraint in force application is not the only way in which such warfare differs from that traditional intel now has broader focus it must consider not only an enemys capabilities and intentions but also the motivations means of influencing and likely responses of individuals and

the guys girlfriend but all his previous girlfriends and where their parents lived and where they lived and what they worked at and the result was you only had to get snippet of some information fed

the secret internet protocol router network and not coalition networks thus there were limited tools to support information processing in joint interagency intergovernmental and multinational

sitting on intelligence and not telling those who need to know is also heinous crime because it leads to great inefficiencies and ultimately to the loss of objective 19 us hesitation to share vital intel has repeatedly put coalitionpartner personnel at mortal risk in afghanistan and iraq that some members of organizations frequently given access to sensitive information present greater security risk than other individuals and organizations denied it further emphasizes the questionable wisdom of such situations as those described here members of mission wanted to locate field office on or near coalition installa tion inquiries about the number of indirectfire attacks that struck the installation in question were denied allegedly for opsec reasons 20 while details of the number of successful rocket or other attacks might give the enemy information regarding the accuracy of its targeting thus justifying the denial had the rejecting officer thought in terms of need to share versus need to know it would likely have been possible to both preserve opsec and provide the information needed eg by reporting the number of attacks in the vicinity of the installation in question

most importantly protect the sources at the same time tacticallevel commander could contact that call center with question and because the center operates outside the chain of command it can answer

that applying measures of effectiveness to counterinsurgency operations becomes useful without framework pile of statistics can be made to fit almost any position third measures must be important not just convenient counting heads at graduation parade is far easier than measuring public opinion in war zone or tracking insurgent financing but it is poorer measure of effectiveness as frederick w kagan notes in the armed forces journal such tallies of casualties attacks and trained locals are measures of convenience reflecting the ease with which data can be collected and presented rather than its inherent importance honest assessment begins with honest data even if it is difficult or dangerous to collect fourth outputs are more important than inputs measuring inputs like total dollars spent or the number of bases constructed gauges effort not effectiveness as craig cohen notes progress should not be judged in large part on the basis of international resources expended or programs implemented rather than on the basis of actual results produced in some ways this is related to the problem of convenience analysts can track coalition actions much more readily than they can track their effects but it is the effectsnot effortsthat ultimately matter most fifthand perhaps most importantis the recognition that the strategy must determine the metrics the two must be tied 161 recommendations train personnel at all echelons on the development use and design of metric systems explain the need to nest measures between echelons and link metrics to objectives at each echelon refine understanding of how qualitative and quantitative metrics can be better employed blended and presented establish nested set of metrics to facilitate translation to useful measures at higher

made aware of the incompatibility train to develop and employ metrics that accurately measure progress or effectiveness in addressing objectives measures that reflect simply the amount of effort expended will rarely of themselves provide this information understand that very few outcomes are influenced by only single factor avoid wishful thinking believing that coalition actions are

discussion an anthropologist and military consultant told us that when providing ways for those to be interviewed or surveyed for measurement purposes one should treat the situation as if the respondents are students providing course feedback at the end of semester they should be asked to evaluate the issue in question eg feelings regarding the legitimacy of the govern ment using 1 chronological reference points they can readily grasp and 2 measuring system that they can understand one that will be consistent across all respondents you have to know what counting system they use knowing what the common usage is would be essential comparatively it has to be the same from one person to the next for example question like how much confidence do you have in the government now compared to what it was during the last full moon may be more effective than scores eg rank your confi dence on scale of 1 to 5 where 5 means very confident or percentages since respondents might not understand those measures the forces will need to figure out way to introduce an understandable system that has uniformity of understandingperhaps if one rock means the government doesnt provide you much help three means they provide you support that is pretty good and five rocks means they provide all the support you think they should what level of support did they provide at the point of the last full moon how about the level of sup port now this is similar to the way doctors ask people to gauge their level of pain from 0 which means that the symptoms do not bother the patient at all to

discussion the guidelines i received from higher level were very broad that did not allow to see what my end state would be we didnt have campaign plan when we started but we later got one from my

achieve every six weeks then every week we got together at the lower level to make sure the activities were working toward the goals identified in the sixweek plan at this synchronization meeting we looked at what the requirements were and what adjustments had to be made to get to those objectives so you had plans for six months six weeks and each day and when four months was up battle groups were rotating in and out as their tours were four months in duration we went back and let them look at how they wanted to achieve their objectives we asked this dutch general whether he used operations orders yes we did but we always linked them to the effects after about three months the government in the hague started asking hey how about results so we took line for each activity and rated from 1 to 10 where we were for each effect with 10 being that you were done and could go home for example did you bring security to village and then you rated it for each of the 23 effects though of course you werent working all 23 effects at the same time because you didnt have the assets to do so measuring whether security was better required us to make contact with the village mayor

that troops need to understand the afghan they are taught to always consider how the afghan considers them they say things like afghans stink so we ask them what if you had washing machine what if you lived on dirt floor afghan houses are as clean inside as they can make them most soldiers in the battle group never see the inside of an afghan house the battlegroup commander saw that some of the soldiers were feeling negatively about muslim culture due to the controversial nature of the subject in the netherlands and thats why he asked to develop the cultural training thats why i added the mosque visit i am presently talking to the chaplain service to talk about this with its soldiers i am also proposing repetition training for battlegroup soldiers once they are in theater and immersion training for specific groups of soldiers such as the humint and operational mentor and liaison team where they live with afghans for three or four days where they sleep eat and everything else with afghans i recently made trip to afghanistan and made point of talking to soldiers i have 100 pages of notes they were obsessed with tics how many theyve had it very much depends on the soldier and whether they are working with prt or battle group 246 the big thing is how you keep company together you have to keep them human in an extreme environment like that it is especially difficult for the american army which stays for 12 months we were talking about extending tours and i think thats bad idea we tend to dehumanize killing to some extent and you want to do that but in counterinsurgency it is so important to maintain your humanity you cant allow soldiers to go too far to become too dehumanized with respect to their attitudes toward civilians inevitably its your most junior soldier who will have to make the deci sion whether to engage target or not there should never be any talk of body counts you cant measure success by body counts 247 i think that people can begin to get resentful i remember that one day my soldiers showed dvd of some of our camp workers whod been captured and had their throats slit and i shouldnt have watched it but i did after that we just wanted to go out and patrol and find any insurgents that we could and we were angry and we were resentful of the locals we couldnt understand how people could do that to another person and we kind of lumped everybody in as one even though it was insurgents who were doing it i think whats required is regular reminding of all of usespecially the junior ranksof why were there what were trying to achieve and the good things about the culture and history of the people that were there to help and protect because sometimes in that environment you cant help it but your attitude will get worse and worse it

to build bridge for these people and were only going to lose the conflict if we are disrespectful and rude towards them or angry towards them we need constant reminding of that i had idea that i would encounter that sort of barbarity 248 recommendation develop predeployment deployment and postdeployment educational sessions to assist per sonnel who have significant contact with members of the population to retain an appropriate perspective on the indigenous population substantive predeployment contacts with mem bers of the indigenous society can help in this regard as might similar contacts at intheater training facilities regardless of the procedure employed leaders should take steps to human ize the indigenous public in the eyes of their personnel unlike in conventional war during which dehumanization of the enemy has been norm counterinsurgency demands not only an understanding of the noncombatant but also realization that compassion offered the insurgent can at times provide significant payoffs there are numerous historical examples of compassionate treatment being promised to insurgents who surrender and benefits being reaped by following through on those promises examples in malaya dhofar oman and elsewhere have complements from the us experience in vietnam 249 coin45 dtlistabsptgovern issue there is danger in giving in to the temptation to hold

and undermining morale discussion one of the things that i think hurt the irish republican army in particular was the fact that when people were caught on the mainland in england they would tend to get much heavier sentences than theyd get here in northern ireland they would get 25year and 30year sentences and they would be sentenced to serve in variety of prisons in england they would be moved every three years from somewhere up in the north to somewhere in the south that had big effect on the families because the families could afford to come over and see them maybe only twice year and it was very heartwrenching for the families and very heartwrenching for the prisoners although some people would say well it didnt stop them bombing england thats true but i know it did on occasion make it much more difficult for them to get topquality operatives to go to england because guys were saying hang on i have wife and family here ive got three young children if i get caught and spend 25 years in jail im not going to see my kids growing up whereas even here in northern ireland they knew the maximum they were going to serve was 10 12 years maximum if im life prisoner ill get released

roadside bomb it was the humili ation of his mother who was kept waiting 20 minutes in the rain by an army patrol outside her car while her car was searched and checked but yet another guy came to us and worked for us because an army patrol pulled his mothers vehicle out of ditch cleaned the mud off bent the fender out so she could drive and got her home safely one guy i know ofwhen asked why he agreed to work for ussaid that for many years hed been thinking that terrorism was wrong and killing people was wrong but he believed what he had been taught about the british and protestants and was working with the irish republican army one day he and some comrades were approaching vehicle checkpoint that the police were manning and this guy said the other boys in the car were saying look at these fing bas tards but when they got to the vehicle checkpoint the constable was very fair very firm he said good evening gentlemen even though he knew the guys were terrorists he knew they wouldnt have anything on them unless they were incredibly stupid but he said good evening guys would you mind getting out and opening your trunk while i do quick search he was very civil he satisfied himself they had nothing incriminating and he let them go as they drove off one of the terrorists said theyre bastards arent they and that guy said well that guy actually was very civil about the whole thing he was very reasonable just doing his job and that was one of the three or four things that turned that guya simple bit of firm but fair policing throw that in with bit of kindness here or there and

i think that not interfering would be interfering with our mission we dealt with training the police and then sent them out to the community if they werent paid then they were extorting money at roadblocks as the police are seen as coming out of our gates eventu ally the extortion is going to reflect on us the average afghan citizen is not able to discern that it is kabul that is at fault the taliban is capitalizing on this very fact because it is regression to the situation like it was back before 1994 police extortion is one way the taliban is winning over the population 253 when i got

resulted in minor damage to civilian homes soldiers attempted to compensate noncombatants as soon as possible discussion they used to operate almost exclusively from the roofs we were on foot we had only four armored vehicles warriors as quickreaction force the best thing to do anytime we had contact was to kick in the door and get to the roof ourselves and once we started that we started taking it to them because we were using their own tactics initially the troops would call for the warriors on any contact but we adapted after several weeks and that changed the approach completely they didnt rely on warrior any more and we also always went back and paid for what we damaged we went back the next day sometimes it would be week because the fighting wouldnt allow us to get back before then 268 another interviewee noted that such tactics risk alienating members of the population as those engaging from roofs often have affiliation with those residing in the building the efforts
