congress will likely consider when reviewing the district s appropriations for fy2004 the controversy surrounding funding needle exchange program touc hes on issues of home rule public health policy and government sanctioning and facilitating the use of illegal drugs proponents of needle exchange program contend that such programs reduce the spread of hiv among illegal drug users by reducing the incidence of shared needles opponents of these efforts contend that such programs amount to the government sanctioning illegal drugs by supplying drug addicted persons with the tools to use them in addition they contend that public health concerns raised about the spread of aids and hiv through shared contamin ated needles should be addressed through drug treatment and rehabilitation programs
