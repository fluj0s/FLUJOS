close military installations to meet the changing military requirements facing the united states and to reduce the costs of maintaining excess military infrastructure dod compiles list of recommended base realignment and closure brac actions that is then submitted to an independent brac commission to review the commission subsequently submits its list of recommended actions to the president the most recent brac commission submitted its recommendations for base closures and realignment to the president on september 8 2005 after agreeing with the recommendations the president sent the commission report to congress on september 15 2005 congress had 45 days to enact joint resolution of disapproval otherwise the recommendations become law on october 27 2005 the house voted 32485 against joint resolution to end the brac process thus the brac recommendations are required to be implemented the 2005 brac recommendations include the closure of 22 major military installations and

parents are in the armed forces as well as children whose parents are employed on federal property such as military installation educating federally connected children imposes service burden revenue burden or both on an lea as the lea may not receive the benefit of tax revenues to support their education leas losing or gaining federally connected students as result of the brac recommendations may experience substantial challenges these challenges may be created by the significant changes required by the brac recommendations but may also stem from the structure of the impact aid program for leas experiencing decline in enrollment the leas may need to release staff or consolidate students into smaller number of facilities the structure of the impact aid program will provide these leas with relatively brief period of time to make necessary adjustments without loss of funding for leas gaining federally connected students as result of the brac recommendations the structure of the

installation leas losing or receiving federally connected students as result of the brac recommendations may experience substantial challenges these challenges may be created by the significant changes required by the brac recommendations but may also stem from the structure of the impact aid program the first part of this report provides brief overview of the impact aid program including the calculation of impact aid payments to leas and an overview of the brac recommendations this is followed by discussion of the potential effects of the brac recommendations on leas that will both lose and gain students as result of the changes following brief discussion of dod appropriations and other actions focused specifically on students affected by brac and other rebasing initiatives the report concludes with brief discussion of actions that have been taken by leas in anticipation of large influxes of federally connected students overview of the impact aid program the impact aid program was established in 1950 by pl 81874 and pl 81 815 pl 81874 authorized financial assistance for maintenance and operations to leas adversely affected by the activities of the federal government the improving americas school act of 1994 iasa pl 103382 which reauthorized the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 esea repealed pl 81874 and pl 81815 and included the impact aid program in esea title viii the impact aid program was most recently reauthorized by the child left behind act of 2001 pl 107110 extending the program authorization through 20073 the impact aid program supports various types of payments including compensation to leas for the federal ownership of certain property section 8002 funds for school construction and facilities upgrades section 8007 and compensation to leas enrolling federally connected children section 8003 the latter is the most relevant payment for the purposes of this report as it provides compensation to districts enrolling military students living on or off base more specifically federally connected children are children who reside with parent who is member of the armed forces living on or off federal property reside with parent who is an accredited foreign military officer living on federal property reside on indian lands reside in lowrent public housing or reside with parent who is civilian working andor living on federal property from the inception of the impact aid program federally connected children have been placed in different categories that are assigned corresponding weights based on the burden they impose on leas the burden imposed by federally 3 for additional information about the types of payments made under the impact aid program see crs report rl31885 impact aid for public k12 education general overview and current status by rebecca r skinner and richard n apling crs3 connected children results from service burden revenue burden or both the service burden is result of leas having to educate federally connected children without receiving the benefit of tax revenues to support their education the revenue burden stems from the existence of federal property within the lea that is not subject to property taxes the burdens imposed by various categories of federally connected children are reflected in the weights assigned to each type of child table 1 contains the current weights for each category of federally connected children table 1 types of federally connected children and relevant weights children attending school in the lea who weight shorthand designation reside on federal property with parent 10 children employed on federal property situated in whole or in part within the boundaries of the lea section 8003 a1ai reside on federal property with parent who is 10 children an official of and accredited by foreign government and is foreign military officer section 8003 a1 aii reside on federal property and have parent on 10 children active duty in the uniformed services section 8003 a1b reside on indian lands section 8003 a1c 125 children have parent on active duty in the uniformed 02 b children services but do not reside on federal property section 8003 a1di have parent who is an official of and has been 02 b children accredited by foreign government and is foreign military officer but does not reside on federal property section 8003 a1dii reside in lowrent

children property situated i in whole or in part in the county in which such lea is located or in whole or in part in such lea if such lea is located in more than one county or ii if not in such county in whole or in part in the same state as such lea section 8003 a1g note and b children refer to designations used for various eligibility categories of federally connected children while they longer appear in current legislation federally connected children continue to be referred to as or b children as the table indicates children are those with higher weights crs4 thus federally connected children whose parents are members of the armed forces and live on federal property whose parents live and work on federal property whose parents are officials of foreign government that serve as foreign military officers and live on federal property or who reside on indian lands carry the highest weight in the impact aid payments for federally connected children lesser weights are attributed to federally connected children whose parents are members of the armed forces but do not live on federal property currently to calculate an impact aid payment to an lea the district first identifies the number of students served in each category identified in table 1 the number of students in each category is then multiplied by the appropriate weight and summed to create the school districts weighted student count this count is then used to calculate the leas maximum basic support payment and actual basic support payment4 overview of base realignment and closure recommendations the first brac commission was authorized by the defense authorization amendments and base realignment and closure act of 1988 pl 100256 leading to the first round of brac in 1988 this was followed by the defense based closure and realignment act of 1990 which provided the authorization for subsequent brac rounds in 1991 1993 and 1995 the first four rounds of brac resulted in the closure or realignment of 97 bases the current brac round was authorized by the national defense authorization act of 2002 pl 107107 the current brac commission received list of recommended actions from the secretary of defense on may 13 2005 it subsequently submitted its recommendations to the administration on september 8 2005 after agreeing with the commissions recommendations the president sent the report to congress on september 15 2005 for approval congress had 45 days to enact joint resolution of disapproval otherwise the recommendations become law on october 27 2005 the house voted 32485 against joint resolution to end the military base closure and realignment process sponsored by representative lahood il thus the brac recommendations are required to be implemented under the current brac recommendations 22 major military installations would be closed and 33 others would be realigned5 expected savings over the next 20 years resulting from the commissions recommendations are estimated at 356 billion the timeline for implementing the commissions recommendations is six 4 when appropriations are insufficient to provide maximum basic support payments to districts section 8003b specifies how payments are to be reduced to correspond with appropriations 5 brac commission report executive summary crs5 years beginning in 2006 communities will have until 2011 to adjust to

the number of new positions includes net job gains for direct military civilian and mission support contractor positions the number of positions gained at single location may exceed the number of new positions for an economic area or region of influence due to decreases in positions at other installations in the same area thus for example san antonio texas will gain 2813 positions overall but fort

impact of the recommendations crs7 possible effects of base closure and realignment on school districts serving federally connected students while it is not clear at what point in the sixyear period available to implement the recommended changes military and civilian staff will move when they do leave leas losing or receiving families as result of the brac commissions recommendations may experience substantial changes7 this section discusses possible effects of the loss of military children on leas followed by discussion of the challenges leas receiving large numbers of students may face leas losing federally connected students as result of brac in calculating payments to leas the us department of education ed uses student enrollment data from the prior school year section 8003a18 therefore leas that experience decline in enrollment as result of brac will continue to receive impact aid funding for students leaving the lea for the school year following their departure essentially this provides the lea with one year to adjust to the decrease in enrollment allowing time for the district to make decisions related to changes in student enrollment9 for example the decline in student enrollment may necessitate releasing staff or consolidating students into smaller number of facilities beyond this oneyear hold harmless period leas losing federally connected students as result of brac will not receive impact aid payments for the students longer enrolled in the district in some instances the loss of military facility may be translated into new economic development opportunities for the surrounding community as communities explore base redevelopment potential10 depending on the ultimate use of the facility such as an airport port facility or educational facility new families may be attracted to the area increasing student enrollment and potentially generating the need for more teachers and possibly school facilities these changes may take 7 for example the army estimates that 55000 army children in kindergarten through grade 12 will be relocated due to global restationing base closures and realignments and other actions by 2013 army times october 2 2006 dod databank to ease kids school transition 8 for heavily affected leas ed uses data from the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the lea is applying for assistance section 8003b2f 9 for some leas the decline in enrollment may be more gradual depending on the timeline for implementing the commissions recommendations for the associated military base 10 department of defense office of economic adjustment community reaction guide 2005 military base closure recommendations available online at httpwwwoeagovoeawebnsffa61549067cad9da85256ed1005221e7file5_ 620reacttb120updatepdf crs8 several years to materialize thus potentially failing to generate new student enrollment quickly enough to replace the loss of students to the brac process11 leas gaining federally connected students as result of brac since basic support payments to leas are based on prioryear student enrollment data leas that gain students as result of brac will not receive impact aid funding for those new students until they have been enrolled in the district for at least part of school year that is the lea will not immediately receive additional impact aid funding as result of the increase in enrollment while receiving leas have been provided with some advance notice of potential changes through the brac process leas receiving large numbers of students may experience substantial financial burden for the first school year in which the students are enrolled in addition decisions that the lea needs to make that are dependent on impact aid payments such as staffing decisions may be complicated by the timing of the data collection process used to determine subsequent payments and the timing of actual payments leas experiencing large increases in the number of students as result of the brac recommendations may also need to hire several new teachers to meet the educational needs of these students leas may experience problems in finding enough highly qualified teachers as required under the child left behind act12 hiring them to coincide with the shift in student population and finding funds for their salaries as previously mentioned impact aid funding for students arriving in the lea as result of the brac will not be available until the following school year at the earliest13 this puts the burden of supporting new staff on the lea for at least the short term it should be noted that pl 81874 included provisions for sudden and substantial increases in attendance that are not included in current law under section 4 of pl 81874 leas that experienced at least 5 increase in student enrollment from one school year to the next as direct result of activities of the 11 several communities surrounding military facilities slated for closure such as fort monroe virginia fort monmouth new jersey and fort gillem georgia which have already begun to plan local redevelopment authorities lra to start the reuse process as quickly as possible the department of defenses office of economic adjustment will not recognize the lras however until the brac recommendations become law national association of installation developersassociation of defense communities brac communities launch redevelopment efforts october 13 2005 available online at httpwwwdefensecommunitiesorg 12 see section 1119 of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 as amended by the child left behind act of 2001 for the qualifications of highqualified teachers for more information also see crs report rl30834 k12 teacher quality issues and legislative action by jeffrey j kuenzi 13 as discussed later in this report the availability of impact aid funding for the following school year for these students is dependent upon when in the school year they arrive relative to student count dates for the impact aid program crs9 united states and met certain other requirements would have been eligible to receive compensation for serving these new students the increase in enrollment had to result in substantial and continuing financial burden on the lea and the lea had to be making reasonable tax effort and exercising due diligence in availing itself of state and other financial assistance but be unable to meet the increased educational costs involved section 4a if these conditions were met leas were eligible to receive funding for the fiscal year in which the increase in enrollment occurred equal to the product of the number of new children enrolled in the lea that the commissioner of education14 commissioner determined to be the direct result of the activities of the united states multiplied by the amount determined by the commissioner to constitute the current expenditure level required to provide free public education minus the amount determined by the commissioner to be available from state local and federal sources for the purpose of providing free public education in the subsequent fiscal year leas were still entitled to receive extra support for any of these students for whom the lea would not receive compensation under an impact aid payment for federally connected children these provisions are not included in current impact aid statutory language another potential problem facing leas receiving large influxes of new students as result of brac may be related to facilities some leas may receive more students than can be accommodated in existing facilities the impact aid program provides payments related to school construction and repair under section 8007 these funds are used to make formula grants and competitive grants for the construction program15 of the total funds appropriated for this section 40 are distributed to leas that receive funds through section 8003 and meet specific criteria the remaining funds are used to award competitive grants for emergency repairs and modernization emergency repair grants may be used to repair or renovate facility due to health or safety hazards modernization grants may be used to alter facility to alleviate overcrowding or to provide more modern services eg telecommunications statutory language currently gives higher priority to emergency repair grants than to modernization grants and requires emergency repair grants to be awarded based on the severity of the emergency construction grants may only be awarded to leas that are eligible to receive support under section 8003 leas experiencing large increases in student enrollment as result of brac may consider applying for section 8007 grant if they can demonstrate they meet the criteria to receive funding however there will potentially be delay between when the students arrive and when major adjustments to facilities can be made in addition the total section 8007 appropriation for fy2008 175 million for example might not be sufficient to adequately assist all of the leas experiencing large influx of new students with facility issues other federal program would currently provide 14 pl 81874 was signed into law prior to the establishment of the us department of education at the time there was commissioner of education who was subsequently replaced by the secretary of education when education was elevated to cabinetlevel position the reference to the commissioner in pl 81874 was not updated 15 the fy2008 laborhealth and human serviceseducation appropriations act pl 110 161 restricts the allocation of section 8007 funds to competitive grants only crs10 dedicated source of funding to address facilityspecific issues requiring immediate or near term attention as result of an increase in student enrollment due to brac another issue that may affect leas receiving students as result of brac is the student count process student counts for the impact aid program are due to the ed by january 31 each school year the counts must be taken earlier than the 4th day of the regular school year and before january 31 of that school year if students transfer into the lea after january 31 these students will not be included in the student count used to calculate impact aid programs for the subsequent school year based on instructions provided to leas by ed for fy2009 impact aid payments leas were permitted to conduct second student count after january 31 2008 but before may 14 200816 leas conducting second counts were also required to resubmit their impact aid applications by september 30 2008 fy2009 payments will be based on an average of the two counts leas that receive students after january 31 will need to take steps to ensure that this second count occurs while they may not receive full compensation during the next school year for any additional federally connected students received as result of the brac due to the averaging of the first and second counts failure to conduct the second count and the associated paperwork could result in leas receiving impact aid payments for federally connected students enrolling after the january 31 count date finally unlike other federal education programs the impact aid program is not forwardfunded meaning that the earliest that appropriations could be made available to leas is the first day of the fiscal year17 for example the earliest fy2009 appropriations could be provided to leas would be october 1 2008 thus even leas that enrolled large numbers of federally connected students as result of the brac recommendations and were able to submit enrollment data to ed that included those pupils would not have impact aid payments for those students on the first day of the new school year in practice impact aid payments are often not made as single payment with leas receiving multiple payments throughout the school year in addition depending on the budget appropriations process in congress payments could be further delayed if congress does not pass the laborhealth and human serviceseducation appropriations bill that funds the impact aid program by the start of the new fiscal year support available from the department of defense historically dod appropriations have provided additional funding for leas serving significant numbers of military dependent students at least 20 of students 16 us department of education office of elementary and secondary education section 8003 instructions available online at httpwwwedgovprograms8003applicanthtml 17 education programs that are forwardfunded generally have funds made available for 15month period starting nine months into fiscal year for example for forwardfunded programs fy2007 funds became available on july 1 2007 and will remain available through september 30 2008 on the other hand current funded programs including impact aid have funds available for the 12month fiscal year that is funds become available on october 1 of given year and remain available through september 30 of the following year crs11 in average daily attendance and have provided additional impact aid funding for children with severe disabilities18 for fy2006 30 million and 5 million were appropriated respectively for these activities for fy2007 35 million was appropriated to assist leas serving significant numbers of military dependent students and 5 million was appropriated for children with severe disabilities for fy2008 30 million and 5 million were appropriated respectively for these activities19 the dod fy2006 appropriations also included funding for assistance to schools with enrollment changes due to base closures force structure changes or force relocations these funds are available to leas that experienced an overall increase or reduction in student enrollment of not less than 5 of military dependent students or not less than 250 military dependent students in daily attendance eligible leas have to meet two additional criteria 1 military dependent students constituted at least 20 of the average daily attendance or would have if not for the reduction in students and 2 the change in military student enrollment was due to dods global rebasing plan the official creation or activation of one or more new military units the realignment of forces as result of brac or change in the number of housing units on military installation lea is permitted to receive more than 1 million in assistance in fiscal year under this provision for fy2006 10 million was provided for this purpose fy2007 and fy2008 appropriations also included 10 million for this purpose the dod fy2007 authorization act pl 109364 included additional provisions related to military dependent student relocations the secretary of defense was required to submit report by january 1 2007 to the congressional defense committees outlining plan to provide assistance to leas that experience increased student enrollment as result of force structure changes the relocation of military unit or the closure or realignment of military installations as result of the brac process the report must identify the number of military dependent students who are expected to be relocated the specific military installations affected by these departures and arrivals an estimate of the number of students departing or arriving at each installation and the anticipated schedule of these departures and arrivals it must also include recommendations made by the office of economic adjustment of the dod related to providing assistance to leas affected by increases in student enrollment and an outreach plan involving affected leas commanders of military 18 an lea may receive funding for this purpose if it serves at least two students who are military dependent students esea section 8003b or di or who have parent who is foreign military officer esea section 8003aii or dii 19 each fiscal year congress generally passes dod appropriations act and an authorization act the dod appropriations acts generally authorize funding for additional funding to leas serving military children additional impact aid for children with severe disabilities and special assistance to leas in broad statutory language that provides funding for operation and maintenance expenses defensewide the dod authorization acts provide substantially more information about funding requirements for more information about dod fy2006 appropriations and authorizations see pl 109148 and pl 109163 respectively for more information about dod fy2007 appropriations and authorizations see pl 109289 and pl 109364 respectively for more information about dod fy2008 appropriations and authorizations see pl 110116 and pl 110181 respectively crs12 installations and members of the armed forces and civilian personnel an updated report is required to be submitted by march 1 2008 and annually thereafter to coincide with the submission of the presidents budget request the fy2007 dod authorization act also requires the secretary of defense to work collaboratively with the secretary of education through september 30 2011 to ease the transition of military dependent students from attendance in department of defense dependent schools to attendance in lea schools funds may be used from the dod education activity dodea to share information related to easing these transitions including transitions resulting from the brac process global rebasing and force restructuring dod is currently building databank for schools that will be affected by base closures and realignments20 while the databank will contain estimates of how many students will be arriving at military installations each year it will not provide specific information on where students will live21 this may limit the usefulness of the databank particularly when multiple leas serve single military installation as enrollment changes in specific lea will depend on where the military dependent students families reside school districts responses to troop increases little information is readily available about how leas have adjusted to sudden increases in federally connected student enrollment as result of brac or how leas are planning for brac 200522 as this is the fifth round of brac since 1988 leas may be able to seek guidance from leas that have already experienced large student increases resulting from previous brac rounds while few examples of activities undertaken by leas are presented below it should be noted that there are dedicated funds such as impact aid funds to assist with the transition process one relevant example of an lea response to sudden influx of military children though not related to brac occurred as result of 850 additional soldiers being stationed at fort campbell in kentucky located near the tennessee border23 20 dod has also developed tool kits for schools parents and commanders to assist with student relocations the toolkits can be ordered online at httpwwwmilitaryonesource com army times october 2 2006 dod databank to ease kids school transition in addition dod has compiled list of useful information and websites for service members and their families affected by brac the information is available online at httpwwwdefenselinkmilbracpdffamilyresourcespdf 21 army times october 2 2006 dod databank to ease kids school transition 22 dod is asking school officials to provide information on strategies they have implemented to help students through the transition process such as taking prerequisite courses to help ensure timely high school graduation army times october 2 2006 dod databank to ease kids school transition 23 national association of installation developersassociation of defense communities continued crs13 in response to the shift in troops the clarksvillemontgomery school system which is located in tennessee expected to receive an additional 1000 students the school system received 4 million earmark in the fy2005 defense appropriations bill to help defray the costs of educating these children some information is also available about actions being taken by school systems in communities expecting to receive large influx of students as result of the 2005 brac recommendations24 for example fort riley in kansas was expecting 3400 troops to arrive in early 2006 school districts in the surrounding area have already hired additional teachers to handle the anticipated increase in student enrollment school districts located near fort benning in georgia have also
