was passed by the senate on august 3 by vote of 935 and was signed into law by the president as pl 109280 on august 17 2006 the pension protection act ppa reforms the funding rules for defined benefit pensions requires employers to disclose more informa tion about pension funding restricts benefit payments and accruals in underfunde d plans and clarifies prospectively that cash balance pension pl ans do not violate legal prohibitions on age discrimination in employee benefits the bill imposes fee of 1250 per participant per year on bankrupt employers that termin ate their pension plans and turn their pensions over to the pension benefit guaran ty corporation the fee applies for three years after firm emerges from bankruptcy shutdown benefits may be paid only from pensions that are at least 60 funded and treated as benefit increases for purposes of applying pbgc insurance guarant ees this report will not be updated funding requirements for single employer pension plans the pension protection act increases fundi ng requirements for defined benefit pension plans and shortens the period over which funding shortfalls must be eliminated in general it requires plans to fund 100 of their funding target which under pr ior law was referred to as the plans current liability the funding target is the presen t value of all benefits including early retirement benefits that plan participants ve earned as of the beginning of the plan year the plan must amortize any funding shortfalls over seven years under prior law plans unfunded lia bility could be amortiz ed over periods of 5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22179crs2 2 actuaries estimate that each percentage point in crease in the discount rate reduces the present value of pension plan liabilities by 10 to 15to 30 years under the ppa plans funding requirement is the present value of the benefits expected to be earned during the year by active participants the plans normal cost plus payments to amortize over seve n years any preexistin g unfunded liability less any permissible credit balance for prior cont ributions the 100 funding target will be phased in at 92 in 2008 94 in 2009 96 in 2010 and 100 in 2011 and later years the phasein will not apply to plans that ar underfunded to the extent that they are subject to the deficit reduction contributi on rules in 2007 those firms will have 100 funding target beginning in 2008 plans considered atrisk of default will be required to use specific actuarial assumptions in determining plan liability plan will be deemed atrisk if it is unable to pass either of two tests under the first test plan is deemed to be atrisk if it is less than 70 funded under the worstcase scenar io assumptions that the employer is not permitted to use credit balances to reduce its cash contribution and that employees will take the most expensive form of benefit and retire at the ear liest possible date if plan does not pass this test it will be deemed to be atrisk unless it is at least 80 funded under standard actuarial assumptions this latter test will be phased in over four years starting at 65 in 2008 and rising to 70 in 2009 75 in 2010 and 80 in 2011 if plan passes either of these two tests it will not be deemed to be atrisk however it will still be required to make up its funding shortfall over more than seven years atrisk plans will be charged loading factor of 4 of the plans liabilities pl us 700 per participant which will be added to the plan sponsors re quired contribution to the plan the loading factor of 4 of plan liability plus 700 pe r participant will apply for atrisk plans that were also atrisk for two of the previous four years plan years prior to 2008 will not count for this determination treatment of commercial airline pension plans firms that are experiencing financial difficulties sometimes freeze their pension plans to reduce expenses under hard freeze the plan is closed to new participants and current participants cease to accrue dditional benefits under the pla n under soft freeze the plan is closed to new participants but current participants continue to accrue benefits for each additional year of service under the plan under the ppa airlines that have put their pension plans under hard fr eeze are allowed 17 years to fund their initial pension liabilities rather than the sevenyear period allowed non airline plan sponsors in addition such airlines will be allowed to us discount rate of 885 in calculating plan liabilities which is higher than current market interest rates and therefore would reduce plan liabilities2 the law allows other airlines including those that opt for soft freeze of their plans total of 10 years rather than seven years to fund their initial unfunded liabilities in either case plan termina tion premium of 2500 per plan participant per year will be charged to the airline for three years if it terminates its pension plan during bankruptcy the plan sponsor would pay th premium after emerging from bankruptcy valuation of assets and liabilities under prior law plan sponsor could determine the value of plans assets usin g actuarial valuations which can differ from the current market value of those assets for example in an actuari valuation the plans investment returns could be smoothed averaged ove r fiveyear period and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22179crs3 3 yield curve is graph that shows interest rates on fixed income securities bonds plotted against the maturity date of the security rmally longterm bonds have higher yields than shortterm bonds because both credit risk and inflation risk rise as the maturity dates extend further into the future conse quently the yield curve usually slopes upward from left to rightaverage asset value could range from 80 to 120 of the fair market value smoothing is permitted because pension plans are considered longterm commitments and smoothing reduces volatility in the measurement of plan liabilities and assets that can be caused by yeartoyear fluctuati ons in interest rates and the rate of return on investments smoothing of interest rates and asset values therefore reduces the yeartoyear volatility in the plan sponsors required minimum contri butions to defined benefit pension plan the ppa narrows the range for actuarial valu ations from 90 to 110 of the fair market value of assets and reduces the ma ximum smoothing period to two years pension plan liabilities extend many years into the future determining whether the plan is adequately funded re quires converting longterm stream of pension payments into the amount that would be needed today to pay off those liabilities all at once this amount the present value of the plans lia bilities is then compared with the value of the plans assets an underfunded plan is one in which the value of the plans assets falls short of the present valu of its liabilities by more than the percentage allowed under law converting future stream of payments or income into present value requires the future payments or income to be discounted using an appropriate in terest rate other things being equal the higher the interest rate the smaller the present value of the future payments or income and vice versa under the ppa plan sponsors must determin the funding target using three interest rates which will be based on when the benefits are projected to be paid in less than five years in five to 15 years or in more than 15 years the secretary of the treasury will determine these rates which will be derived from yield curve of investmentgrade corporate bonds3 interest rates will be averaged over threeyear period under formula using 50 of the rate from the most recent plan year 35 of the rate from the previous plan year and 15 from the plan year before that the use of the yield curve will be phased in at 33 in 2008 66 in 2009 and 100 thereafter this methodology will permanently replace the fouryear average of corporate bond rates established under pl 108218 which expired december 31 2005 contribution limits and credit balances the ppa will allow plan sponsors to contribute more to their pension plans than they could under prior law it sets the maximum taxdeductible contribution at 180 of the pl ans current liability within certain limits sponsors will be able to offset required current contributions with previous contributions however these socalled cr edit balances can be used to reduce the plan sponsors minimum required contribution to the pl an only if the plans assets are at least 80 of the funding target not counting prefundi ng balances that have arisen since the new law became effective existing credit balances and new pref unding balances must both be subtracted from assets in determining the adjuste d funding target attainment percentage that is used to determine whethe r certain benefits can be paid and whether benefit increases are allowed credit balances also have to be adjusted for investment gains and losses since the date of the original contribution that created the credit balancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22179crs4 lumpsum distributions federal law requires define d benefit pensions to offer participants the option to receive their accrue d benefits in the form of an annuity series of monthly payments guaranteed for lif some defined bene fit plans also offer participants the option to take their accrued benefit as sing lump sum at the time they separate from the employer the amount of lumpsum distribution from defined benefit pension is inversely related to the interest used to calculate the present value of the benefit that has been accrued under the plan the higher the interest rate the smaller the lumpsum and vice versa under prior w lumpsum distributions were calculated using the average interest rate on 30year tr easury bonds the interest rate on longterm treasury securities has historically been lower than the average interest rate on longterm investmentgrade corporate bonds because bond markets generally consider us treasury securities to be free of the risk of default the ppa requires plan sponsors to calcula lumpsum distributions using three interest rates based on investmentgrade corporate bonds as result participants of different ages will have their lumpsum distributions calculated using different interest rates other things being equal lumpsum distributions paid to workers nearer to retirement will be calculated us ing lower interest rate than would be used for younger workers as result all else being equal an older worker will receive larger lumpsum than similarly situated younger worker the interest rates used to calculate lump sums will be based on current bond rates rather than the threeyear weighted average rate used to calculate the plans funding target th new rules for calculating lump sums will be phased in over five years plans that are funded at less than 60 will be prohibited from paying lumpsum distributions plans funde d at 60 to 80 can pay more than half of an accrued benefit as lumpsum distribution pbgc premiums for singleemployer plans the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc was established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa to insure pens ion benefits under privatesect or defined be nefit pension plans the pbgc is funded by premiums pa id by plan sponsors and investment returns on the assets held in its trust fund it receives appropriations from congress the pbgc does not have the legal authority to set its own premiums which are set in law by congress the pbgc receives two type s of premiums from plans sponsored by individual employers percapita premium that is charged to all singleemployer defined benefit plans and variable premium equal to 9 per 1000 of underfunding 09 charged to underfunded plans the ficit reduction act of 2005 p l 109171 increased the per capita premium from 19 pe r year to 30 per year beginning in 2006 future premiums will be indexed to average national wage growth under prior law plan was exempted from the variablera premium of 9 pe r 1000 of underfunding if it was not underf unded in any two c onsecutive years out of the previous three years under the ppa the variable premium will be assessed on all underfunded plans regardless of the plans funding status in earlier years limits on benefits in underfunded plans the ppa will limit certain forms of benefit payments and the accrual of new benefits in unde rfunded plans plans funded at less than 60 will not be permitted pay lumpsum distributions and the law prohibits further benefit accruals in plans funded at less than 60 once plan is funded bove 60 the employer and the union in collectively bargained plans will then decide how to credit past service accruals shutdow n benefits are pension payments made to employees when plant is shut down they typically are negotiated between employershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22179crs5 4 in 2004 the 6th us circuit court of appeals ruled that the pbgc could set plan termination date that would prevent the agency from being liable for shutdown benefits in march 2005 the us supreme court declined to hear the case leaving the circuit courts decision in place 5 multiemployer plans are common among workers covered by collective bargaining agreementsand labor unions and usually are not prefunded the ppa pr ohibits shutdown benefits in plans that are funded at less than 60 of full funding4 the law prohibits any increase in benefits under plan that is less than 80 funded unless the benef its are funded by the employer immediately in plans considered to be at risk of default assets set aside in trust funds to prefund deferred compensation fo r highlycompensated employees will be taxable as income to those employees disclosure requirements the ppa requires plan administrators to provide an annual funding notice within 120 days of the cl ose of the plan year to each participant and beneficiary and to any labor organizati on representing participants plan sponsors also will have to include mo re information on the form 5500 that they file annually with the internal revenue service including an explanation of the actuarial assumptions used to project future retirements and asset allocations section 4010 of erisa provides that plans underfunded by 50 million or more must file report with the pbgc the pbgc is prohibited by law from releasing this information to the plan participants or th public the ppa will require any plan sponsor with funding ratio under 80 to file form 4010 with the pbgc the plan sponsor will be required to notify partic ipants that form 4010 has been filed with the pbgc rules for multiemployer plans5 under the ppa multie mployer plans will have to amortize unfunded prior service liability over 15 years rather than over 30 years as under prior law the new law increases the maximum taxdeductible contribution for multiemployer plans to 140 of current liability it will require plan trustees to improve the funding of the plan by onethird within 10 years if plan is less than 80 funded or if it will experience funding deficiency within seven years it prohibits benefit increases if the increase would cause plan funding to fall below 65 and it imposes benefit restrictions on multiemployer plan s that are less than 60 funded investment advice the ppa permits qualified fiduciary advisers to offer investment advice to participan ts in defined contribution plan s such as those authorized under 401k of the internal reve nue code eligible plans w ill be exempted from certain rules governing prohibited transac tions under erisa and the internal revenue code the adviser may be aff iliated with the investment f unds offered in 401k plan but he or she must meet disclosure and qua lification requirements nd must provide notice of fees material affiliations any limitation on the scope of advice and services provided with respect to the advice the ppa requi res fiduciary advisers for employersponsored plans such as 401ks to base their recomme ndations on computer model that has been certified and audited by an i ndependent party and it requi res fiduciary advisers for nonemployer plans such as iras to charge flat rate fee for one year with computer model the department of labor in consultation with the treasury department will study whether computer model exists to tailor professional inve stment advice to an individuals needs based on their financial and family circumstances and taking into account the full range of investment options av ailable if they cannot certify that such ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22179crs6 model exists then advisers will be free to provide advice free from the prohibited transaction exemption as long as they cer tify in writing that the company has adopted written policies and procedures that ensure that the investment advice provided is in the individuals best interest cash balance plans and other hybrid pensions the ppa establishes principles for testing defined benefit plans for age discrimin ation and clarifies that cash balanceplans do not ordinar ily discriminate against olde r employees under federal law it describes how cash balance pl ans and other hybrid pensi ons that have characteristics of both defined bene fit and defined contribution pl ans should be tested for age discrimination and clarif ies that defined benefit plan does not discriminate on the basis of age if participants entir accrued benefit as defined unde r the plans benefit formula is less than the accrued benefit of any work er similarly situated in every respect except for age preretirement indexing for example periodic adjustments that protect the economic value of the benefit against inflati on prior to distribution can be disregarded in making this determinati on the law also provides that in the case of cash balance plans paying lump sum equal to the pa rticipants account balance is sufficient to prevent prohibited forfeiture of an accrued bene fit provided that the plan credits interest at rate greater than market rate of interest these provisions will apply to cash balance plans only prospectively that is to plans created after enactment of the ppa other defined contribut ion plan provisions the ppa makes permanent the higher annual contribution limits for iras and qualified retirement plans enacted in 2001 under pl 10716 it blishes safe harbor from nondiscrimination testing for employers who offer automatic enrollment in defined contribution retirement plans it also allows taxpayers to direct the internal revenue service deposit part of tax refund directly into an ira it makes permanent and indexes to inflation the savers credit nonrefundable tax credit for low and middl eincome families created by congress in 2001 which was scheduled to expire after 2006 it waives the 10 earlydistribution penalty for public safety employees who par ticipate in pension plans with deferred retirement option plan feature and also for military reservists and national guardsmen who are called to active duty for at least 180 days it will allow taxfree rollovers from the ira or pension of deceased individual to an ira or employersponsored plan of designated beneficiary other th an spouse and it will allow disabled persons to contribute to an ira even if they have earned income the ppa prohibits companies from forcing employees to invest any of their own retirement savings contributions in the stock of the employer and allows workers to sell their company stock three years after receiving it in 401k plan the law clarifies that companies have fiduciary responsib ility for workers savings during blackout periods when workers are temporarily barred from ma king changes to their 401k investments and it requires companies to give workers quarterly benefit statements that must include information about their accounts including th value of their assets their rights to diversify out of company stock and informa tion about the importance of maintaining diversified inves tment portfolio
