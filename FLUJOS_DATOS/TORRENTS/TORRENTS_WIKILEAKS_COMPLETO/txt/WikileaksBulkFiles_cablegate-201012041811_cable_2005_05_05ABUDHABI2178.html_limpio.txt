pakistan it was important to support musharraf as he battled the terrorists he emphasized while the indians had and would continue to balk at the decision the region needed musharraf to stay strong there was alternative leader in sight mbz opined besides he continued the f16 decision would not tip the military balance between india and pakistan even if it had indias strength as stable democracy
