particularly as the united states currently is negotiating new agricultural trade rules in the world trade organization wto httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31581crs2 selected policy issues some critics be lieve that the availability of expanded farm s upport under the commodity title increases the possibility that the united states will exceed its subsidy limits 191 billion per year in tradedistortin g subsidies set fort h in the multilateral 1994 uruguay round agreement on agriculture uraa to allay such concerns the bills drafters included in title i requirement that the secretary of agriculture to the maximum extent practicable make adjustments in domestic farm support to ensure that subsidies do not exceed the limits some have stioned the feasibility of implementing this provision the so called circuit breaker and how it could be applied equitably among programs and producers also the expansion of domestic farm support has caused some critics here and abroad to question the sincerity of the u s proposal in the current global trade negotiations to further reduce all countries tradedistorting farm policies defenders counter that the united states has remain ed within its uraa limits and is not likely to exceed them in the future and furthermor that so long as the european union and others heavily subsidize their farmer s the united states should not unilaterally cut back on aid see crs report rl30612 farm support programs and world trade commitments in renewing the food aid and ex port assistance programs the 107th congress again was confronted with questions of policy direction and funding levels of spending and volumes of product subsidiz ed under eep and deip are subject to limitations under the multilateral 1994 uru guay round agreement on agriculture uraa in practice eep has been used little in recent years deip has been used to the limits of the uraa market prom otion programs like map the food aid programs and export credits gsm are not considered to be trade distorting under the current uraa and therefore are not s ubject to spending disciplines however foreign trading partners argue that the ited states has utilized food aid and export credits as ways to dispose of heavily subsidized farm surpluses thereby distorting trade and want such programs to be di sciplined in the new round of negotiations the united states says it is willing to discuss export credits during the negotiations some have questioned whether export subsidy and promotion activities actually increase overseas sales or simply displace co mmercial sales even if sales increase do they translate into higher farm prices and incomes or might direct farm subsidies be more costeffective some critics claim that these programs benefit primarily large food and ex port companies who can afford to pay for promotion activities themselves or foreign buyers more than us producers defenders cite studies claiming positive outcomes from such spending similar questions arise with regard to foreign food aidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31581crs3 projected costs the congressional budget office cbo in march 2002 projected that under the trade title of the new farm bill manda tory spending over six years fy20022007 would increase by 532 million new budget authority over the baseline of 1572 billion for total mandatory spending of 2104 billion actual spending is expected to be higher
