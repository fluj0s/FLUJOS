opening with community officials in attendance we have been virtually blanketing our city with source getting lrh materials into the hands of opinion leaders community leaders libraries universities and high schools we even did special mailing to chiropractors two doctors walked in right after receiving their ron letters and journals the dianetics letters magazines and requested more data on the assist tech and dianetics auditing i have always been firm believer in getting source out to the world and strongly support broad dissemination campaigns this is really the perfect dissemination program how could you not win if you got source placed in every corner pocket of your city neighborhoods like lrh saysbooks make personal contact all by themselves if they can be put in the right places the success of any neighborhood depends on getting books into circulation in that neighborhood if we are really going to take this planet each scientologist needs to win over their own territory think bigtake on your city get source distributed with the correct order of magnitude speed and urgency to get the job done that is why i became citywide disseminator and you can too robert cornish district disseminator since getting into scientologyjust under year agoive had many wins personally and in business although i am only 24 i have had lot of success already just after beginning my second course the success through communication course business partner of mine whom i found out was an sp got into an argument with business associate that resulted in fullblown legal battle i ended up being pulled into this battle myself the situation continued to get worse and i could clearly see it was not going to resolve anytime soon i grabbed the scientology handbook off my shelf and read the part on how to resolve conflicts i then picked up the phone and called the opposition whom i hadnt spoke with since this began and applied the tech the third party was my business partner so i ended up resolving and settling the case and severing my relationship with my partner my actions in applying the tech right out of the scientology handbook that simple solution on how to resolve conflicts actually resulted in resolution for everyone involved since then ive had strong urge to see that others get the tech too that is why i helped to contribute to getting lrhs materials broadly disseminated in my neighborhood and abroad i personally helped to get 100 scientology handbooks to the kings of ghana i firmly support this source campaign because i want to see others have the chance to find the tech get the truth and expand as i have since day one in scientology listen im just newcomer to this whole game but i can tell you without doubtgetting source out there is the sanest
