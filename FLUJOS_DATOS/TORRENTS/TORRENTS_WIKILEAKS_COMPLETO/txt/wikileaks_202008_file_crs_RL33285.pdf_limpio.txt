capital gains the president has proposed greatly expanding preferences for individual savings accounts as well some current proposals including congressional proposals propose fundamental change by moving to consumption base these consumption base proposals include s 1040 shelby and s 1081 specter which propose ﬂat tax tax on wages at the individual level and cash ﬂow of businesses hr 25 linder

change the tax base as well as the rate structure both affect the distribution of the tax burden across individuals and across income classes while relief for lowerincome i ndividuals can be achieved by exemptions and credits the choice of tax base has consequences for the distribution of the tax burden between middle and uppe rincome taxpayers even for cases where rates are graduated the most significant tax reform in r ecent history the tax reform act of 1986 moved in the direction of expanding the individual income ta x base in part by reducing preferences for capital income ma ny of these preferences have since been restored and in some cases expanded m oving further towards wage base and there are proposals for further expansi on some current proposals including congressional proposals would move instead to consumption base hr 25 hr 1040 s 1025 and s 1040 and s 1081 s 1111 however would move towards broader income base the presidents advisory panel on tax reform presented two proposals one moving toward consump tion tax base and th other reducing the coverage of capital income and moving towards wage base the consequences of choice of tax ba for distribution depend on the source of income in different income classes according to tax data over 80 of income in the middle class came from wage income while only third to half of income in the very high income levels was derived from wages some forms of income do not fit clearly into the wage or capital in come categories when adjustments are made to allocate these forms of income ch as pension income and proprietorship income the concentration of labor income increases in the middle classes when all income is assigned to either capital income or labor income over 90 of income earned in the middle classes rives from labor while half or less of income in the highest brackets derives from labor the more heavily that tax revision m oves towards wage base which also occurs with consumption taxation in the long run the more difficult it is to avoid shifting the tax from higherincome families to the middle class this report will not be updated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33285contents s u r c s f i n

for cases where rates are graduated the most significant tax reform in r ecent history the tax reform act of 1986 moved in the direction of expanding the individual income ta x base in part by reducing preferences for capital income ma ny of these preferences have since been restored and in some cases expanded among other individual provisions the 1986 law taxed capital gains at ordinary rates restricted fully taxfavored individual retirement accounts to those not covered by employer pension plans and provided significant restrictions on tax shelter operations in 1997 capital gains rates were reduced and the general availability of fully taxfavored iras restored but with income limits dollar limits on contributions to iras were increased in 2001 and rates were lowered furthe r on capital gains and on dividends in 2003 the 2001 and 2003 changes absent new legislation expire after 2010 and 2008 respectively there are proposals to maintain or extend the r ecently enacted tax cuts including the benefit for iras and divide nds and capital gains the president has proposed greatly expanding preferences for individual savings accounts as well some current proposals including congressional proposals propose fundamental change by moving to consumption base1 these consumption base proposals include s 1040 shelby and s 1081 specter which propose flat tax tax on wages at the

s 1111 wyden would broaden the income ba in part by reducing preferences for capital income the presidents advisory panel also has an income base reform plan which they were instructed to provide as at least one option the proposal however reduces the coverage of capital income by exempting dividends and capital gains as well as expanding taxexempt savings plans the advisory panel proposal therefore moves towards wage tax base whereas s 1111 m oves towards broade r income tax base the consumption tax is equivalent to tax on wages and tax on old capital the flat tax approach collects the tax on old capital at the business level and the tax on wages directly from individuals while the retail sales tax collects all taxes at the retail stage vat collects the tax at each stage of production thus while current owners of capital would pay the ta x on consumption out of existing savings in the long run the consumption tax is essentially tax on wages the economic standards for evaluating tax reform proposals usually include effects on economic efficiency administrativ simplicity and distribution the first and second are often stressed with respect to proposals for consumption or wage tax bases although the efficiency and simpli city benefits are not without dispute3 distributional issues are less easy to evalua because there are subjective judgements about what type of system is fair however an issue that can be addressed is the consequences of tax base choice for the distribution of the tax burden this report examines the shares of income attributable to capital and labor income across the income brackets and discusses the impli cations of choice of tax base on the distribution of alternative tax systems sources of income wages and capital income income falls into two broad types capital income and labor income table 1 uses data from the internal revenue service statistics of income to examine the sources of income by income brackets4 this table reports the four major sources of income the first three are wages financial capital income interest divide nds and capital gains and pensions and distributions from individual retirement accounts iras the remainder of the income other is derived largely from unincorporated business activities includinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33285crs3 proprietorships partnerships subcha pter s small

for close to 80 or more of total adjusted gross income for those in the top 1 of the population wage income is less than half of income and for those with income of 1 million or more wage income is only third of income the importance of interest dividends nd capital gains is reversed for those with incomes under 100000 and for the middle three fifths of the distribution this income accounts for

returns with negative adjusted gross income note rows may not add to 100 because of rounding the relative concentration of wage income as source of income in the middle brackets and reliance on capital income at the higher levels is increased if we consider pensions and iras to be forms of deferred wage income the tax treatment of these items allows the deduction or excl usion of contributions with tax due on benefits this treatment effectively exempts income from capital from tax and thus is capital income preference not wage income preference5 we would obtain the same economic result if contributions we re not deductible but earnings were not taxed as is the case for roth iras if th at method of providing benefit were used wage income would be larger because contributions would not be excluded from income and pensions w ould not be included depending on the growth rate versus the rate of return of these provisions the pension and ira income may overstate or understate the value of wage income in steady state with the real rate of return 5 and the growth rate 3 typical of the past economy and assuming an average g of 15 years between contribution and benefit wage inclusions woul d be about 75 of benefits6 assigning most of the pension and ira benefits to wage income would move the share of wage income tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33285crs5 7 the distribution of assets was taken from jane g gravelle the economic effects of taxing capital income cambridge mit press 1994 p 300close to 90 for middle income groups wh ile having little eff ect on higherincome individuals most of the remainder of the income is from selfemployment and some income that is largely capital income rents royalties and estate and trust income self employment income is combination of the return to labor and the return to capital and particularly in the lower and middle classes much of it is labor income unincorporated businesses are divided into proprietorship or earnings from business or profession and th combination of partnershi p and subchapter s income table 3 shows the distribution of this unincorporated business activity by income class note that the sums do not strictly match because of loss deduction restrictions proprietorship income dominates at the lower income levels while partnership and subchapter s income is more impor tant at higher levels typical rule of thumb in the econom is that capital income accounts for around 25 of total income but this share can vary across types of businesses and in particular proprietorships tend to be smaller and the owners labor income likely to be larger relative to capital income allocating labor income for unincorporated businesses is hampered by lack of da ta on capital assets for proprietorships accordingly we used data on deprecia tion deductions based on the assumption that the real rate of return is about 5 then using estimates of the distribution of asset types and the average depreciation ra tes of equipment and structures7 we estimated the depreciation rate this rate actually turned out to be almost identical this suggests that depreciation deductions as percentage of net income from trade or business is good proxy for the share of capital income these data taken respectively from the statistics of income data for proprieto rship returns 2003 partnership returns 2003 and subchapter s returns 2002 indicate that capital income is about 18 for proprietors and 53 for partnerships and subchapter s firmshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33285crs6 table 3

to labor and capital is based on 2002 data but the aggregate amounts of subchapter s income are from 2003 using these data we then summarize the labor income share in table 4 which involves reducing the denominator by 25 of pension and ira income and counting as labor income wages 75 of pe nsions and ira distributions 82 of proprietorship income and 47 of income of partnerships and sole proprietorships we also report in that table the overall share of returns that fall into each income classhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33285crs7 8 pension and ira distribution also reflect corporate

the share drops and is only 45 for those earning more than million overall the labor share of income is 87 these calculations do not take account of the fact that some income is subject to tax at the corporate level which means that labor income is smaller than that reported in table 4 there are two types of inco reported on tax returns that reflect corporate income dividends and capital gains8 as shown in table 5 which reports the distribution of financial income by type of income capital gains are much more concentrated in higher income levels than are dividends for example although capital gains in the aggregat is 36 times dividends in the 1 million income class gains is 76 times dividends that greater concentration is likely due to two effects the first being that some capital gains are earned on assets other than corporate stock and the second that high erincome individuals are more likely to hold riskier stocks and stocks that tend to pay out less income in dividends

about 60 implications for the distributional effects of tax reform proposals there are important implications in the choice of tax base in tax reform proposals for the distribution of the tax bur den across income classes for example under tax base that is confined to wage income only significant increase in the progressivity of the rate structure woul d prevent the burden in revenue neutral change from being shifted away from highincome individuals while lowincome individuals can be protected through tax re lief provisions absent change in the rate structure the middle class would pay higher taxes keeping roughly the same relative progressivity of the current rate st ructure moving towards wage base would shift the burden from high to middleincome taxpayers whereas moving towards an income base that includes more comprehensive measure of capital income would shift the burden from middle to highincome taxpayers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33285crs10 9 the presidents advisory panel on federal tax reform simple fair and progrowth proposals to fix americas tax system november 2005 p 136 this discrepancy also means that the proposed tax reform is not fully revenue neutral in the long run 10 see crs report rl32228 proposed savings accounts ec onomic and budgetary effects by jane g gravelle and maxim shvedov fo r an explanation of this budget effect 11 the presidents advisory panel on federal tax reform simple fair and progrowth proposals to fix americas tax system op cit p 175proposals to reduce taxes on capital inco through for example reducing or eliminating taxes on dividends capital gains and interest income as in the case in one of the tax options by the presidents advisory commission would likely shift the burden other things equal away from high income individuals to the middle class the commission report shows dist ributionally neutral system9 but it is likely that is temporary artifact of the shift into backloaded savings accounts which raise revenue on owners of assets in the short run but lower it dramatically in the long run10 proposals such as s 1111 which expa nd the base towards an income base would shift the burden away from the middle class and towards highincome individuals as noted earlier consumption tax base is in the long run roughly tax on wages for those individua ls who leave significant bequests some part of wage income is also exempted consumption taxes are more likely to shift the burden in the long run away from highincome individuals not only because highincome individuals over their lifetime tend to consume less of their earnings but also because some forms of consumption ta xes necessarily have flat rate eg nati onal sales tax and the flat tax the presidents advisory panel had par tially graduated consumption tax x tax with supplementary lowerrate tax on passive financial in come and reported distributional neutrality for that proposal as well11 that outcome however is due to two reasons the first is the effect of savings accounts that also contributed to higher rates on owners of capital in the s hort run while allowing increased sheltering of passive financial income in the l ong run second reason is the method of distributing tax consumption tax is tax on wage income and lump sum tax on old capital that is effectively collected over time as the assets are consumed for veryhighincome individuals who indefinitely pass on assets in estates that consumption may never occur if one distributed the tax on the basis of consumption the tax would decline as income rises despite the rate structure the tax was however distributed as if it were an income tax and thus the cash flow tax at the firm level which is really lump sum tax on old capital that may or may not be translated into an effective tax on cons umption is treated as if it is tax on income to illustrate the importance of these pproaches consider recent study that compared the distributional effects of an x tax with 15 and 30 rate and demogrant rebate to lowerincome indi viduals to offset the tax under bothhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33285crs11 12 see leonard burman jane gravelle and jeff rohaly towards more consistent distributional analysis proceedings of the 2005 conference national tax association washington dc 2006approaches12 this plan is similar in many respects to the panels proposal if distributed according to consumption the ddle quintile has ta x rate of 233 the top quintile tax rate of 121 and the top 1 tax rate of 61 if distributed according to income the tax rate is 114 for the middle quintile 225 for the top quintile and 220 for the top 1 distributing consumptionbased tax in th short run is tricky and there is perfect answer because the cash flow tax is tax that causes asset values or their purchasing power to fall but does not bur den new saving which can be purchased at discount however in the long run th consumption tax base tends to be similar to wage tax base except that it also favors higherincome people even in the long run because they are less likely to consume all of their lifetime income
