manufacturing industry em ploys about 1 million workers or about 75 of the entire us manufacturing workforce including those who work in manufacturing parts and bodies as well as those who assemble motor vehicles since 2000 the industry has eliminated about 300000 manufacturing jobs but the employment level is still almost as high as in 1990 by comparison manufacturing in general has suffered much higher rate of job loss the detroitbased usowned manufacturers general motors ford and chrysler collectively known as the big three all of which are orga nized by the united auto workers union uaw have cut back domestic production by 3 million units since 2000 accounting for all the net employment losses the shift in consumer preferences from trucks and suvs to smaller vehicles has accelerated loss of market share by the big three producers and gains for foreignowned domestic manufacturers and imports big three employment losses were partially offset by new investments by foreignowned manufacturers in the united states today companies owned by foreign investors produce 28 of all usmade light motor vehicles up from 11 in 1990 the patterns of job loss and creation have not been evenly distributed around the country forty four percent of all persons in the industry work in heartland auto belt of three states michigan ohio and indiana each of which has more than 100000 persons in the industry michigan alone has accounted for more than third of the net job loss in the industry since 2000 losses in ohio and indiana have been less severe offset somewhat by foreign investment alabama has been the big recent job gainer adding 15000 jobs since 2000 tennessee and kentucky now the fourth and fifth largest producing states have added the most jobs since 1990 and south carolina has also seen big net gain these jobs mostly nonunion have stretched the auto belt more to the south new fuel economy standards for automobiles and light trucks as approved by congress and signed into law pl 110140 may encourage greater development of small fuel efficient cars but the number of such us plants even for foreignowned companies has declined in recent years s 2191 approved at committee level in the senate in december 2007 would use funds from the auction of emission allowances to support domestic manufacture of fuelefficient vehicles and components congress may also c onsider the proposed koreaus free trade agreement which addresses the current imbalance in automotive trade the employee free choice act hr 800 approved by the house but on which cloture vote failed in the senate could help the uaw organize foreignowned companies in seeking to improve the competitiveness of big three assembly operations against both non union domestic

new fuel economy standards for automobiles and light trucks pl 110140 plus consideration of legislation that may be used to help promote the manufacturing of future generatio ns of fuelefficient vehicles s 2191 also it includes the proposed koreaus free trade agreement because korea is major supplier of cars and trucks to the us market in the field of industrial relations the employee free choice act hr 800 approved by the house but on whic h cloture vote failed in the senate could be significant in an industry in which all assembly plants owned by us domestic corporations are unionorganized while virtually none operated by foreignowned companies are2 any legislative action by congress that affects us motor vehicle production and sales will have major impact on us manufacturing employment the share of us manufacturing employment directly employed in manufacturing motor vehicles and parts in 2006 was 75 or about 1 million workers3 there are also many industries whose output is sold in large measure to the automotive industry for example 14 of the output of the us steel industry in 2006 was shipped to the motor vehicle industry which is the secondlargest sectoral user4 within congress and throughout the country there have been many concerns expressed about lost jobs in the automotive industry indeed according to the us labor departments quarterly census of employment and wages automotive manufacturing employment declined by about quarter between 2000 and 2006 however over the l onger term automotive manufacturing employment has held up much better than overall manufacturing employment while the united states has seen overall manufacturing employment decline by about 35 million jobs since 1990 employment in the auto industry declined only marginally over this longer period but the detroitbased big three us auto manufacturers general motors ford and chrysler are still in the middle of restructuring efforts which could imply further employment reductions in the near future and the total level of employment could decline further by contrast employment has increased at foreignowned motor vehicle assembly and parts plants this change has offset at least partially the decline in employment at the detroit big three and their suppliers as foreignowned manufacturers have increased us motor vehicle sales market share production and employment the pe rception has grown that contract agreements 1 john williamson of the crs knowledge services group assisted in the preparation of the data for this report especially for tables 24

to their competitiveness in the autumn of 2007 the united auto workers5 uaw union negotiated new collective bargaining agreements with each of the detroit big three these new agreements seek to reduce or remove the perceived structural issues in union contracts this leads to further major aspect of the issue which will be explored in this report changes in automotive employment have not been geographically balanced the decline overall has had the strongest impact by far on michigan and to lesser extent on ohio and indiana the other two leading midwest auto manufacturing states other states outside this region such as new york new jersey maryland georgia virginia and oklahoma have lost their big three assembly plants since 1990 but are generally less reliant on auto manufacturing employment meanwhile foreignowned nameplate manufacturers origina l equipment manufacturers or oems in the industry have established new plants largely though not exclusively in the south during this period as assembly plants tend to draw parts supp ly plants in their direction there is evidence that what automotive news labels the new american manufacturers have extended the traditional midwest auto belt more into corridor that includes the midsouth 6 this report looks at four sets of issues that have received attention in congress or among the public more widely with respect to employmen t in the us motor manufacturing industry national employment trends is there an employment crisis in the us automotive manufacturing industry state and regional developments what is the impact of automotive manufacturing trends on states and regions as michigan has apparently borne the brunt of automotive employment cutbacks and by 2007 was suffering from the nations highest unemployment rate is this onestate recession as some have said or is the impact broader fuel economy and small vehicle manufacturing in view of the congressional debate over fuel economy rules where are smaller fuelefficient vehicles made in the united states and who makes them new uaw labor contracts with the detroit big three how do these new agreements address some of the competitiveness issues raised by the domestically owned industry impact of federal legislative proposals finally and in conclusion the report will briefly review the status of legislative issues that may have major impact on us

g5g155g146g156g146g156g501g561 is the national auto manufacturing base in crisis one answer might be in perceptions but perceptions especially in this case shape reality the reality is that many americans identify american industrial competitiveness with the competitiveness in the marketplace and on the factory floor of the traditional detroitbased big three7 the economic health of the big three is not good the public perception of this circumstance is influenced by confluence of recent major developments first there were widely publicized bankruptcies and financial distress in the auto supplier sector associated with the big th ree notably this included the largest industrial bankruptcy of all time the declaration of chapter 11 by delphi corporation formerly the parts manufacturing arm of general motors in october 2005 since 2005 the big three including chrysler which for most of this period was subsidiary of germanowned daimlerchrysler ag each have reported losses cumulating in the billions of dollars moreover there have been widely reported buyouts by the big three of unionized production employees to get their contracts off the company books and midcontract givebacks on health care coverage requested by each of the big three and negotiated by the uaw with ford and gm but denied to chrysler as oil has climbed near the 100perbarrel level as gasoline prices increased by 50 in an unstable global security environment and as policy concerns with climate change issues increased sales of pickup trucks and suvs the big threes most popular and profitable vehicles stagnated or declined in 200607 congress approved in 2007 and the president signed into law new fuel economy rules as part of pl 110140 an energy legislation package notwithstanding some concerns by the big three and the uaw that their employment levels could be hurt 8 although toyota for example publicly sided with the big three position the success of its prius hybrid vehicle reinforced public impression that the japanese companies are the leaders in fuel economy 9 7 this perspective may have been reinforced by seminal and critical work on big three auto production methods authored by the mit international motor vehicle project in the machine that changed the world new york rawson associates 1990 8 discussion of this legislation is in crs report rl33982 corporate average fuel economy cafe comparison of selected legislation in the 110th congress by brent d yacobucci and robert bamberger 9 voter survey taken by the pew campaign for fuel effi ciency and the national environmental

and the one following focus primarily on us sales and production as the main north american trend driver11 us and north american sales generally follow the us business cycle thus us sales fell from about 14 million cars and light trucks after the 1990 peak to just over 12 million during the 1991 recession they recovered slowly in the early 1990s reaching 15 million units in 1996 then escalated to over 17 million units annually in 19992001 after the recession of that year and fed by concerns about the economic impact of the 911 terror incidents the big three led wave of discounting and other sales measures to keep production levels up such as gms keep america rolling 0 interest sales campaign through 2005 domestic sales continued to average almost 17 million units per year but with higher gasoline prices in 2006 and the housing slump of 2007 sales slipped to 166 million in the former year and an annual rate closer to 160 million in 2007 many forecasters question whether 2008 domestic us sales will even reach that level 12 perhaps more significant than total sales volume is the composition of sales as shown in figure 1 light truck sales were less than half car sales in the us market in 1990 46 million versus 93 million but then the minivan introduced by chrysler in the mid1980s and the sports utility vehicle suv pioneered by amcs jeep and popularized by the ford explorer revolutionized the market in the 1990s us car sales have never regained the 1990 level while light trucks overtook cars in sales volume in 2002 and by 2004 had opened margin of 15 million units 92 million to 77 million for 54 of the market the importance for employment of this market shift is that while foreignbased competitors had even become dominant in some classes in the domestic car market the big three with their uaworganized assembly plants remained dominant in the light truck market for example an earlier crs report showed that by 2003 about 75 of the light trucks sold were big three products but less than half of all cars 13 truckbased vehicles had become the redoubt of the unionized domestically owned motor industry14 thus big three employment and production would be disproportionately and negatively affected not only by the total fall in sales less than million units between the 17 million total of 2005 and the annual rate of 163 million through october 2007 but by the decline of trucks as share of the total from its peak of 92 million in 2004 truck sales declined by almost million to 84 11 the uaw formerly organized plants in canada as well but the separate

to make up for the loss but they did increase somewhatand cars remain the strongest suit of the foreignbased manufacturers another trend illustrated in figure 1 that has an adverse effect on big three

figure 2 illustrates the impact of the market changes on us big three and foreign oem manufacturers output totals total us motor vehicle production excluding other north american production regardless of ownership stood at less than 10 million units at the beginning of the 1990s17 however of this output in 1990 89 was produced by the detroit big three81 million units directly and another halfmillion in three joint venture plants operated by japaneseowned firms in association with the big three and also organized by the uaw18 about 1 million units in that year were produced by foreign oems in the united states all were japaneseowned v olkswagen having closed its plant in pennsylvania and hyundais north american plant at that time located in quebec us production surpassed 12 million units by middecade and reached peak of 13 million by 1999 of that figure more than 10 million were directly built by the big three adding in 700000 vehicles built by their jointventure affiliates uawbuilt vehicles accounted for 83 of us production with expansion by the japanese oems and new plants opened in south carolina and alabama by bmw and mercedes benz respectively the nonuaw total units of production had doubled to about 2 million by the end of the decade since then total us output has declined by 2 million units domestic big three output has fallen by third while foreign oems have continued to increase output the annual rate of us big three production in 2006 and 2007 was less than 7 million units their jointventure affiliates maintained their contribution primarily because the toyota corolla popular compact is built at jointventure plant with gm in california and the ford mustang is built at the fordmazda plant in michigan adding all the uaw plants together as in figure 2 yields total 2007 annual rate production of 74 million units meanwhile foreign oems have built new plants in new locations honda and hyundai in alabama nissan in mississippi and new toyota pickup truck plant in texas as well as expanding existing pl ants their annualrate 2007 us output is up to 34 million units or on combined basis more than 50 of the output from just the big three uaworganized plants the total output of foreignowned nonuaw oem plants in the united states in 2007 has reached 28 of total us motor vehicle production moreover foreign oems have announced the building of more assembly plants in 20062007 toyota in mississippi honda in indiana and kia in georgia the economics consulting firm global insight predicts continued declining share of north american production from the detroit big three from forecast 2007 production base of just under 15 million light vehicles in 2007 they estimate that 2008 output will decline to 144 million vehicles they then forecast slow recovery in both car and light truck production not exceeding the 2006 level until 2011 or 2012 however they further predict that transplants will represent all the growth in north american production big three north american output which they estimate at 95 million units in 2007 would fall to 88 million units in 2008 in their forecast and possibly not reach 9 million units again before 2012 foreign oem output after stagnating 17 totals for figure 2 include medium and heavy trucks but these are less than halfmillion units annually and do not alter the trends in the

figure 3 and figure 4 illustrate how these trends have impacted overall employment in the us motor vehicle manufacturing industry figure 3 presents the total level of such employment since 1990 as well as employment levels in each of the three subsectors that constitute this manufacturing sector under the new north american industry classification system naics these major components are motor vehicle assembly naics 3361 motor vehicle bodies and trailers naics 3362 and au tomotive parts naics 3363 20 one advantage of using naics categorizations is that all automotive equipment is clearly shown as associated with the motor vehicle industry and not other product groups naics 3362 does include such products as truck trailers recreational vehicles and motor homes but using all three naics categories insures comprehensive coverage of the motor industry and more than 90 of employment in the three classes is associated with the manufacture of cars and light trucks another advantage of using the naicsbasis data is that it is indifferent to ownership so that we can measure employment for example at the same parts manufacturing plant whether it was owned by gm spun off by gm to delphi or owned by thirdparty supplier at any time between 1990 and the present it still counts as parts plant and not motor vehicle assembly plant figure 3 illustrates that total us employment in automotive manufacturing rose from about 1 million persons in 1990 to peak of 13 million in 19992000 before falling back to about the 1 million level in 20062007 if one disaggregates the total number for the three subcategories one can see that the overwhelming number of jobs as well as gains and losses in the industry have been in the parts sectorabout 840000 at the industrys 19992000 peak by 2007 that number had fallen to near the 600000 level which was actually 50000 below the 1990 level the workforce in motor vehicle assembly operations naics 3361 has varied by much smaller amountgrowing from 271000 in 1990 to 291000 at the 19992000 peak then falling to 222000 by 2007 the decline however in this category has been steeper than the rise reflecting number of trends and crosspressures that will be discussed further below the third and smallest subcategory bodies trailers etc naics 3362 has been less sensitive to the rise and decline of demand for cars and light vehicles employment has fallen little from the 2000 high of about 180000 but is still much higher than the level of 130000 recorded in 1990 many commentators have emphasized the loss of jobs in this sector since 2000 for example frontpage caption in the trade news paper automotive news highlighted the fact that the us auto industry employs nearly 25 fewer factory workers today than it did in 2000 21 however that is typical of peaktotrough accounting in cyclical industry such as motor vehicle manufacturing there is reason to believe that employment hours worked will not move up and down with the business cycle 19

g7g150g153g149g152g162g150g142g151g157g561 when employment in automotive manufacturing is compared to manufacturing employment in general as in figure 4 one can see that motor vehicle manufacturing has actually sustained its employment numbers over time much better than us manufacturing in general if one normalizes 1990 as the base employment level motor vehicle manufacturing increased employment by 25 through 2000 while despite an economic boom for most of the decade total manufacturing employment did not actually ever regain the 1990 level since motor vehicle manufacturing is significant share of total manufacturing one can calculate that for all other types of manufacturing employment fell by more than 1 million jobs between 1990 and 2000 motor vehicle manufacturing employment has statistically speaking returned to its 1990 base level while manufacturing employment in general has declined by 37 million jobs since then

employees of chrysler then subsidiary of german company 22 this number has continued to grow despite the overall automotive employment decline since 2000 strong detroit big three sales in the 1990s supported employment growth throughout the motor vehicle manufacturing sector independent of foreign companies us expansion then as demand for big three usbuilt vehicles declined since 2000 the big three and their suppliers have been reducing employment to reflect reduced production and market share levels for every job created by the international companies in the us the big 3 have shed 61 jobs 23 current and future big three restructuring implies further job losses in the industry job declines are directly related to production cuts by the big three and consequent reduction in orders for parts from their suppliers however large share of the employment reduction is also due to improving productivity adjustments in union contracts with the industry allow more flexibility in 22 crs

buyout arrangements accepted by labor for example gm since 2002 has reduced the average hours needed to assemble vehicle by 15 but has reduced its us workforce by 40 one industry analyst has commented in the past job losses have been cyclical but the decline since 2000 is permanent because its structural those jobs are not coming back and all autodependent areas are sharing the loss 24 while the overall decline in manufacturing employment has slowed since 2003 the decline in big three employment and that of their suppliers may continue at the current pace or accelerate to answer the question at the beginning of this section there is not general jobs crisis in us automotive manufacturing sector but there is crisis in major part of that sector unionized big three plants and supplier companies that rely on big three production for major shares of their output this crisis may be viewed as the belated response of the traditional detroitbased automotive manufacturing model to international competition including foreign manufacturers setting up shop in the united states the rest of us industry has already been undergoing this downsizing or rightsizing depending on the observers perspective through both the growth period of the 1990s and the manufacturing recession that occurred after 2001 but only since this latter date have the uaw and the big three been able to reach agreements culminating in the 2007 collective bargaining agreements that allow this sector of the motor industry to implement labor cost savings and to take fuller advantage of productivity improvements the uaw in the 1980s had negotiated agreements with the big three to allow more rapid introduction of technology and greater employment flexibility but founded on the principle that there should be effort to increase profits by reducing the unionorganized employment base in the industry conditions prevailing since 2000 as production levels stagnated then fell and profits turned into losses in the billions of dollars labor has accepted buyouts and other early retirement offers by the big three which has cut or will eliminate the number of jobs in the united states plus canada by total of 150000 between 2005 and 2009 with buyouts or early retirement offers expected at all three detroit automakers in the wake of new uaw contracts that allow new hires to get less in pay or benefits the number is sure to grow soon 25 the new contract agreements will be summarized in the last part of this report but first the report will review the latest data on auto industry employment by state the impact of restructuring to date has been far from even across the country while it may be ongoing there has already been measurable impact on the location of the us motor vehicle industry

described in the earlier crs report on the us motor industry the domestic big three manufacturers have followed strategy of reconcentrating automotive assembly operations in the traditional midwestern

virtually all the big three assembly plants on the east coast have been or are being closed as well as in disparate locations such as atlanta both ford and gm maryland virginia oklahoma and california the new big three model consists of centralized locations each producing one family of crossbadged vehicles which can be conveniently supplied by parts makers and from which product can be shipped to customers nationwide26 sean mcalinden of the center for automotive research has described this as the retreat to the core michigan as the alamo27 at the same time the new american manufacture rs have extended the traditional us auto belt farther to the south bringing with them an increasing number of auto parts suppliers this has created more of an auto corridor focused on the i65i75 interstate highways not all foreignowned oems have invested exclusively in southern plants and the detroit big three produce some vehicles in the south despite the nowshuttered plants in georgia gm continues to build product in texas louisiana tennessee and kentucky and ford also builds trucks in louisville but the three largest japanese manufacturers plus bmw mercedes benz and hyundai have all built plants south and west of the traditional midwest auto belt and more new plants and expansions are being built by these companies this upsurge in southern investment continues to bring with it substantial number of new automotive supplier plants 28 the map in figure 5 illustrates the geographic distribution of employment in the us motor vehicle industry defined here as 2006 employment re ported by the

these states have at least one light vehicle assembly plant in most cases more and at least 30000 automotive industry workers they include some traditional midwestern auto manufacturing states illinois and missouri they also include some states with both big three and foreign oem assembly plants california and texas but which mainly make the list because of large supplier industries three other leading states have mainly risen through heavy investments by foreignowned companies in the past 20 years tennessee kentucky and alabama the remaining states in the national map are classed according to the number of employees in the automotive manufacturing sector some of them still have major light motor vehicle assembly plants some formerly had such plants but now are primarily equipment suppliers such as new york and others like north carolina have never had light vehicle manufacturing plant but are important suppliers to the industry in table 1 the report provides some

manufacturing compared to 22 in indiana and 16 in ohio in terms of its intensity quotient shown in table 1 the percentage of employment in the motor industry compared to the national average michigan ranked 44 times more reliant on the industry than the national average while indiana was about three times above the national average and ohio about twice that level but unlike the other two heartland auto states michigan has experienced investment in motor vehicle assembly operations by foreign companies in the past 20 years excluding the daimler acquisition of the entire chrysler group meaning that essentially the relative decline of the detroit big threes role in us motor vehicle manufacturing during this period has been an unalloyed negative development for michigan30 between 2000 and 2006 michigan lost 351000 jobs overall241000 of this net job loss was in manufacturing and the net loss in motor manufacturing was 116000 jobs about half of the total according to bls data that meant loss of 35 of all motor industry jobs while there had been some gain in motor vehicle manufacturing employment there in the 1990s the net gains have all been wiped out since then in all three of the industrys subsectors more than quarter of all jobs in us motor vehicle manufacturing in 1990 were in michigan by 2006 the share was down to onefifth about 40 of the net national decline in motor industry manufacturing jobs in 200006 was accounted for by the net loss of jobs in michigan 31 30 toyota and hyundai have established technical centers in michigan and volkswagen has had its us

comparison with michigan ohio the secondleading motor vehicle manufacturing state has seen much more moderate decline in employment as shown in table 1 since 2000 it has lost 37000 motor manufacturing jobs 2211000 of them in motor vehicle assembly and 21000 in parts which in 2006 employed about three times as many people in the state manufacturing overall saw net decline of 228000 jobs in ohio in 20002006 so unlike michigan the motor vehicle industry directly accounted for only about 16 of the net loss ohios unemployment rate at 58 is higher than the national average but is thus not primarily due to auto industry job losses note that unlike michigan ohio has seen major investment in foreignowned assembly plants in the state with two honda facilities in indiana the state has actually gained motor vehicle assembly and body and trailerbuilding jobs over both 1990 and 2006 nai cs 3362 accounts for much higher share of motor vehicle employment in indiana than in either michigan or ohio however the state has lost about 23000 parts manufacturing jobs since 2000 many of them in plants owned by the big three or their major suppliers this led to an overall net decline of 15000 in motor industry jobs in the state as in ohio this was only fraction of the states overall net manufacturing job loss 15 moreover as of 2006 indiana actually had recorded small increase in automotive employment over 1990 and its overall unemployment rate in october 2007 was about equal to the national average future job losses owing to big three downsizing may be offset to some degree by new honda assembly plant announced in 2007 the overall statistics for loss of auto industry jobs since 2000 in the heartland auto belt do not necessarily suggest that the motor vehicle industry is dying in this region almost half of the nations employees in motor vehicle manufacturing 44 still work there both the big three and foreign investors have been aggressive in developing new facilities in these states each of the detroit big three has made major investments in rebuilding or renovating assembly plants in michigan chrysler has created new modularized campus for building jeeps in ohio besides

was closed in 2007 but while motor vehicle industryrelated employment has been rela tively stable in north carolina and virginia it has declined by 18000 jobs or 42 in new york since 1990 higher rate of loss over that time even than in michigan the only state in this group showing major overall gain in automotive employment since 1990 is south carolina bmws north american plant was established there in the 1990s and further expansion of that facility was announced in 2007 south carolina has recorded net gain of 12000 auto industry jobs since 1990 and the sector in 2006 accounted for almost

legislation and automotive fuel economy standards in both houses of congress the issue was raised as to whether proposed bills would damage or even cause the disappearance of the manufacturing of small fuelefficient motor vehicles in the united states it was stated by the uaw for example that there are in the united states 67000 workers who assemble or make parts for these vehicles 33 therefore it was argued that statutory antibacksliding provision was requir ed to prevent companies from meeting new fuel economy rules by importing more vehicles from abroad to the detriment of their continued manufacture at domestic plants 34 if it is difficult to produce smaller vehicles at profit in the domestic market as is sometimes alleged it was feared that these jobs would be in danger of being outsourced overseas if stringent new fuel economy rules were adopted crs report cited earlier illustrates how surge in imports of motor vehicles from japan in 2006 was linked to increase in sales of small cars owing to sharp increases in gasoline prices35 data for 2007 indicate that subcompact vehicles all imported to the united states are the fastestgrowing segment of the us car market through november 2007 sales of such vehicles were up about 22 over the previous year they may have taken sales away from the next larger cl ass compact cars whose sales were down 33 during the same period while all of the detroit big three manufacture compacts domestically see table 4 below subcompacts are produced in the united states and in the auto industry it is widely believed that it

produces the toyota corolla and the pontiac vibe the share of nonuaw plants all foreignowned producing small cars peaked at half the total four out of eight in 1990 by 2007 the share was 11 two out of 18 one may infer from this that although foreignowned manufacturers especially from japan and korea have perceived comparative advantage in designing and producing small fuelefficient vehicles the

with foreign ownedoems that manufactured both in the united states and abroad some of these issues included nearly free lifetime health care coverage for employees retirees and dependentsa cost that was estimated by 2005 to cost the companies as much as 1500 per vehicle produced foreign oems do not pay such costs to any similar degree because of younger workforce and few retirees in the united

contract necessitated by multibillion dollar losses reported by each of the big three companies the 2007 contract negotiations saw substantial effort by both management and labor at the uawrepresented companies to establish comprehensive new labor agreement cognizant of the big threes competitive problems as has been traditional in previous uawindustry contracts the collective bargaining agreement was reached through process of pattern bargaining the union selected one of the big three oems with which to bargain and in keeping with the uaws general policy of not allowing domestic producers to seek competitive advantages through differences in labor contracts to impose that pattern on the other companies once an agreement was reached however owing to some major differences in both the financial conditions and organizational structures among the big three significant differences emerged among the collective bargaining agreements that were reached with the three companies in the

ford announces that it will keep open five plants it had planned to close november 14 uaw contract with ford ratified by an 81 positive vote completing the negotiation process 39 the uaw first negotiated all elements of the issues with gm to establish pattern with the company that was then considered financially the st rongest of the three and the farthest along in terms of restructuring having established this pattern the uaw then moved on to chrysler company whose management was in transition with respect to both structure and personnel40 the agreement negotiated with chrysler was the most controversial both among the uaw negotiating committee and its membership as revealed in the relatively close margin of ratification further uncertainty was added by th chrysler job cuts announced immediately after ratification but when ford agreed in its negotiation with the uaw to rescind five planned factory closings the result was the highest level of ratification approval of any of the agreements this was despite fords smaller contribution to the new unionrun retirement health care plan than gm and fords greater leeway than th other two big three oems in replacing hourly workers under the current contract with new employees under lowertier wage structure and different benefits format part of the rationale for this differentiation of treatment was the perception by the uaw that ford may be the financially weakest of the big three and that maintaining current production facilities insofar as possible was the key union goal 41

negotiations was the protection of retiree benefits already guaranteed by previous contracts given the real possibility that one or more of the big three could face bankruptcy at some time in the future the uaw was amenable to consideration of transferring an openended commitment to retiree health care to an independent entity managed by the uaw v oluntary employees beneficiary association or veba43 the cost of this to each of the big three varies gm will contribute 318 billion including 44 billion in note convertible to gm stock and pledge to back up the veba for up to 2 billion if inflation is higher than expected 44 ford and chrysler had fewer retirees affected the upfront contributions for ford and chrysler to the vebas were 132 billion and 88 billion respectively because of legal and organizational issues the vebas will not be set up until 2010 but the automakers might be able financially to recognize savings earlier the major benefit of this change for the big three is that for defined upfront contribution they largely eliminate the uncertainties of future retiree health care costs and the legal obligation to provide health care to retirees

big three oems to provide pay and benefits on differential structure to workers in the same plants as opposed to more than 28 in base wages for current production workers the new hourly starting wage for new hires will be about 14 rising to 1516 after an initial period in the first agreement with gm the lower tier wages for new hires was limited to hourly pay for noncore activities such as machinists line workers on drivetrain parts and subassemblies inspectors stampings material handlers and drivers the definition was so broadly defined that it could include as many as 23000 positions covering almost third of gms current uawrepresented employees similar definition was used in the chrysler contract again covering nearly third of present positions or 13000 employees noncore would receive seniority when vacancies arose in core production jobs and they could move into those positions at the full firsttier contract rate of pay with ford the distinction between core and noncore which preserves the principle that all uawcovered workers receive the same rate of pay for the same job was eliminated ford received the right to hire any new workers including line production jobs up to level of 20 of the total hourly workforce the percentage cap excludes new hires at facilities ford had agreed to close or at plants ford had taken back from its former partsmaking affiliate visteon in addition while gm agreed to move production workers currently employed on temporary basis into permanent positions neither ford nor chrysler accepted this obligation the new twotier structure also applies to employee benefits current hourly employees covered by the firsttier traditional union contract will receive the full pension for which they remain eligible on retirement they will also receive full retiree health care benefits though these will be provided after 2010 by the uawadministered veba not by the companies thus the uaw will be responsible for any adjustments in coverage necessitated by any future shortfalls in veba resources 43 for details on the legislative background of vebas see crs report rl33505 tax benefits for he alth insurance and expenses overview of current

will never be eligible for traditional pension or the current retiree health care coverage as active employees they participate in health plan with 300 to 600 in annual deductibles plus they receive flexible health care spending account from which to purchase customized coverage with respect to retirement they will accumulate cash balance pension while the company contributes to 401k account that the employee can use for health care expenses after retirement car analyst sean mcalinden also defines third class of employees which he defines as tier 15 or the new traditionals these are permanent workers who move from tier 2 noncore job into job included at the tier 1 pay level these workers will not have retiree health benefits ever they will not receive defined pension benefit 45

starting in 2006 the union continued to maintain the principle that currently employed uaw workers cannot be terminated unconditionally through corporate downsizing however going forward the ru for staying in the jobs bank indefinitely were significantly tightened at all three companies participation in the jobs bank is now basically limited to period of two years with limits placed on the number of refusals an employee can make when offered new position either within or outside their area of residence

of the discrepancy in hourly cost levels pay and benefits estimated at 30000 per year against non union producers in the us market may be eliminated with respect to new hires the big three may be paying even less than the competition mcalinden reports that the total cost per hour of uaw labor currently under tier 1 contracts at 78 per hour today at gm the tier 2 labor cost would drop to 2565 per hour and even the tier 15 new traditionals would only cost total of 3847 per hour nor are these numbers purely hypotheticalthe average hourly gm employee is nearly 49 years old with 225 years of rvice and 635 are eligible to retire in five years for ford and chrysler average age and service levels are lower but about 30 can retire in five years under the traditional uaw 30 and out guarantee

about 500000 vehicles per year by 2011 he projects savings of 981 per car in labor costs and 676 in retiree health cost savings 46

declined from high of 15 million to less than 500000 in 2007 each of the big three is continuing aggressive buyout campaigns aimed at current employees and one source states the unions auto company membership is expected to drop to 150000 by 201047 thus it was important for the uaw as an organization as well as its current workforce to secure such guarantees going forward48 gm made the most extensive new product guarantees it laid out plans for continued production and replacement models for all of its assembly plants at least through 2011 and beyond the only exception is doraville georgia atlanta still scheduled to close in 2008 plus three parts operations some products do remain businesscase dependent on the list or as with the chevrolet v olt plugin hybrid planned for the detroit hamtramck plant may be technologically speculative49 global insight predicts two additional gm plant closings that have not been announced the plant in moraine ohio that produces the chevy trail blazergmc envoy is not listed in uaws report the wilmington delaware plant is listed as continuing to produce twoseat sports cars through 2012 but is assigned new products global insight believes that gm must take out 400000 units of capacity by the end of the decade to achieve 90 capacity utilization rate and suggests these are the two plants most likely to be shut50 uaw opponents of the chrysler agreement complained that the deal lacked the specific future product guarantees found in the gm deal the uaw argued that chrysler had promised to keep operating all but few facilities and has identified more than 15 billion in potential investments 51 the listing released by the uaw mostly includes commitments to continue production through the current product life cycle with two assembly plants newark delaware and small detroitarea plant slated for closure after that 52 in more favorable analysis mcalinden states chrysler promised to continue andor expand production at 6 assembly 4 stamping and 8 powertrain plants and reversed 4 closures53 with ford the big news for the uaw was the reprieve of five plants from the list of planned closures including avon lake ohio and two other assembly plants chicago and detroitarea truck plant for which closure plans had not yet been publicly announced the uaw also highlighted new investment and modernization plans at ford plants the previously announced closure at twin cities st paul was confirmed though year later than originally announced along with the closure of casting plant and transmission plant 54 47 business week

report on the motor vehicle industry the detroit big three have longstanding commitment to building motor vehicles in canada in twoway sectoral free trade system that goes back to 1965 this deal has ensured canadas role as the largest us export market for motor vehicles and parts the largest twoway trade partner and virtually permanent large canadian automotive trade surplus 56 under this agreement ontario has overtaken michigan as the largest autoproducing state or provincial jurisdiction in north america but one reason the big three have made significant investments in canada has been savings derived from the canadian health care system as opposed to expensive companyprovided health care in the united states another advantage has been the currency exchange rate with the canadian dollar falling as low as 65us in the past decade the canadian auto workers have reportedly used these cost differentials to leverage contract gains not enjoyed by their uaw counterparts in recent years but with canadas dollar reaching parity with the american dollar in 2007 and with the big three offloading retiree health care costs and making other health care gains in the new uaw contracts canadian production is less attractive now to the big three one source forecasts that ontario production capacity will decline by 600000 units by 2012 while michigan will gain 100000 units

as to whether the new uaw labor contracts will renew the competitiveness of the big three and stop their erosion of us market share labor relations specialist harley shaiken summed up the view of many analysts the contract allows the three automakers to be more competitive but it doesnt remotely ensure successthat requires the right models and the right strategic vision 59 it is clear that the uaw has accepted that different labor model is required or the union will end up with the reputation of organizing only losers among the oems the deal may be viewed 55 mcalinden the big leave p 49 56 see

respond to competitive challenges at the national level the prospects for employment growth in the industry as whole are not strong during the remaining years of this decade foreignowned manufacturers continue to invest in the united states however insofar as the new labor deals allow uaworganized manufacturers to operate more flexibly predic tions of continued slowdown in us motor vehicle sales may mean that employment created by these new investments is more than offset by big three efforts to reduce labor overhead through increased production efficiencies this will be especially true if their output is downscaled to demand from the state perspective big three cutbacks and plant closures have been widespread but the negative effects have been felt disproportionately by one state michigan it has suffered about 40 of the total net job loss in automotive manufacturing between 2000 and 2006 although buyouts will continue most michigan big three plants will apparently survive using the new uaw tier 2 labor contracts but as the older class of highly compensated workers retires the new contract means clear cut in the pay rate for the new hires who join the industry other states have not been so negatively affected in the 2000s within the heartland auto belt ohio and indiana have lost jobs on net basis unlike michigan however their big three losses have been somewhat offset by foreign oems new york major parts manufacturing state has perhaps suffered job loss in the industry that is proportionally as large as michigans but the automotive sector is relatively small there as share of total manufacturing employment southern states have not seen the large overall gains that one might expect to have seen except for alabama which has gained 15000 net new jobs since

but then on december 13 2007 approved by 868 different version with an identical section on automotive fuel economy61 to assure passage the senate removed most of the tax provisions however the senate did leave in sufficient tax provisions to offset the federal revenue that would be lost from the auto fuel economy measures62 the house on december 18 2007 then approved the version of the bill as
