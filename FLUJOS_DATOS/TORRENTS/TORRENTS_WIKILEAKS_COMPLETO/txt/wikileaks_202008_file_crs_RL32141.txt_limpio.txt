military and peacekeeping operations recent history and precedents summary congress recently completed action on the bush administrations fy2004 supplemental budget request to fund continuing military operations and reconstruction in iraq and afghanistan it was signed into law pl 108106 on november 6 2003 major issue in the congressional debate on this and other such supplementals of the past is whether military and peacekeeping operations should be funded with supplemental requests or via the regular defense appropriations process some members of congress have urged the president to include the costs of current and future operations in iraq and afghanistan in the department of defenses dods regular appropriations arguing that these are now ongoing operations that should be planned for and funded in the annual defense budget others prefer supplementals due to the unpredictability of military and peacekeeping circumstances in iraq and afghanistan this unpredictability they argue makes it extremely difficult to estimate the costs of either type of operation in advance this report examines 46 cases since fy1990 in which congress approved funding for combat or peacekeeping operations using regular appropriations supplemental appropriations or combination of the two the report shows that since 1990 congress generally has funded combat operations with supplemental appropriations in initial stages of postcombat peacekeeping operations however congress has tended to rely on combination of supplemental and regular appropriations as peacekeeping operations have

initial postcombat peacekeeping operations however congress has tended to rely on combination of supplemental and regular appropriations as peacekeeping operations have become ongoing congress has switched to using regular appropriations initial appropriations usually supplementals examining the funding patterns for combat operations in the first gulf war somalia haiti kosovo afghanistan and operation iraqi freedom shows they were all funded initially with supplemental appropriations in each case the president requested supplemental funding shortly after operations were underway and congress approved the requests within months 1 president bush signed pl 108106 emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense and for the reconstruction of iraq and afghanistan into law on november 6 2003 for more information on the supplemental see crs report rl32090 fy2004 supplemental appropriations for iraq afghanistan and the global war on terrorism military operations and reconstruction assistance by stephen daggett crs2 the only exception to this pattern is bosnia where united states involvement began in 1993 with humanitarian airlift dod funded this airlift using resources previously appropriated by congress in fy1993 regular appropriations2 in fy1995 when the united states first launched airstrikes in support of peacekeepers dod used combination of supplemental appropriations and fy1995 regular appropriations to fund combat operations thus although supplemental appropriations were not used to fund the united states initial involvement in bosnia congress did turn to supplemental appropriations to fund combat and later peacekeeping operations after the initial humanitarian airlift the transition to regular appropriations table 1 suggests that in the past decade congress generally has funded combat operations with supplemental appropriations and ongoing peacekeeping operations with regular appropriations each operation however has gone through an interim period of initial postcombat peacekeeping in which congress has used different combinations of supplemental and regular appropriations haiti and kosovo congress funded combat operations in haiti and kosovo with supplemental appropriations in fy1994 and fy1999 respectively in both cases congress also used supplemental appropriations to fund initial postcombat peacekeeping in haiti congress funded peacekeeping through the remainder of fy1994 and all of fy1995 with supplemental appropriations and switched to regular appropriations in fy1996 similarly congress funded fy1999 postcombat peacekeeping in kosovo with supplemental appropriations and continued to fund peacekeeping in kosovo with supplemental appropriations in fy2000 in fy2001 however congress switched to using regular appropriations to fund operations in kosovo regular appropriations have also been used in fy2002 and fy2003 as peacekeeping has remained ongoing bosnia fy1995 combat operations in bosnia were funded mostly with supplemental appropriations and since fy1999 ongoing peacekeeping operations have been funded with regular appropriations from fy1995 to fy1998 however mixture of supplemental and regular appropriations was used to fund peacekeeping operations in fy1995 and fy1996 this mixture consisted of supplemental funding and the use of previously appropriated funds in fy1997 and fy1998 both supplemental and regular appropriations were used 2 for detailed explanation of how dod absorbs and transfers previously appropriated funds see crs report 98823 f military contingency funding for bosnia southwest asia and other operations questions and answers by nina serafino crs3 the first gulf war and the nofly zones funding for the first gulf war and the nofly zones established in southwest asia after the war underwent transition from supplemental to regular appropriations but it was over the course of 11 years the long duration of the operations and the use of some regular appropriations to fund combat during the first gulf war distinguish these operations from bosnia kosovo and haiti operation desert shield for the first gulf war was initially funded with supplemental appropriations that were included in the fy1991 continuing resolution the next funding for operation desert shield consisting of 1 billion was included in the fy1991 regular defense appropriations act from amounts contributed by allies this use of regular appropriations early in the gulf war was contrary to the use of supplemental appropriations to fund combat operations in bosnia kosovo haiti afghanistan and operation iraqi freedom however it may reflect congressional use of the funding vehicle that was immediately available to cover the initial costs of the operation the next and largest appropriations for the first gulf war were included in the fy1991 desert shielddesert storm supplemental which was signed into law on march 22 1991 the size of this supplemental appropriation 426 billion suggests that the 1 billion included in fy1991 regular appropriations was indeed an exception rather than significant change to the practice of funding combat operations with supplemental appropriations the nofly zones southwest asia operations following the first gulf war were funded at least partially with supplemental appropriations for 7 years the longest use of supplemental appropriations in any of the cases examined unlike kosovo and haiti the nofly zones did not progress directly from supplemental to regular appropriations as they became ongoing operations instead they were funded partially with supplemental appropriations in fy1992 and fy1993 and fully with supplemental appropriations in fy1994 and fy1995 in fy1996 congress used regular appropriations to fund the nofly zones at this point rather than continuing to use regular appropriations congress returned to combination of regular and supplemental appropriations from fy1997 through fy1999 in fy2000 and fy2001 regular appropriations were used again thus although desert shielddesert storm and the nofly zones began with supplemental appropriations and ended with regular appropriations the 7year interim between those points differed from the interim between combat operations and ongoing peacekeeping operations in bosnia kosovo and haiti not only was this interim longer in the case of the nofly zones but it also provided two instances where congress returned to either partial or full supplemental funding after having used only regular appropriations during the prior fiscal year crs4 recent operations in afghanistan and iraq according to the president the united states concluded major military operations in afghanistan in december 2001 and in iraq on may 1 20033 except for funds appropriated for afghanistan in the fy2003 consolidated appropriations resolution both operations have been funded to date using supplemental appropriations including the recently enacted fy2004 supplemental although the president has declared the end of major combat in both operations low intensity conflict is still prevalent making it unclear whether iraq and afghanistan can yet be referred to as ongoing peacekeeping operations going forward congress might designate point at which an operation becomes ongoing and thus merits funding in the regular appropriations process 3 president bush
