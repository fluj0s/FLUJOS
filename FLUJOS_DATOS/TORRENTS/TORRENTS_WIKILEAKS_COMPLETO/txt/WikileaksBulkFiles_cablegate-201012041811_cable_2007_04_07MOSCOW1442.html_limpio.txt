pgov rs subject russian corporate statism watch this space ref 06 moscow 1306 classified by ambassador william j burns for reasons 15 bd 1 c summary the rise of corporate statism in russia has been significant since 2004 the government has taken over the worlds largest titanium business consolidated its position in gazprom merged 10 aviation businesses into stateowned conglomerate and taken controlling positions in other firms less fascinating has been the mix of greed politics and business behind the expansion of the state into the economy looking ahead our contacts are strongly divided some see troubling signs of continued state ambition others believe the process is essentially plateauing and will stabilize at lower levels of state ownership in the economy after twothree years in our view the current trendline may quickly approach some rather natural limits and the kremlin will eventually have to bow to the market in the meantime we should reinforce marketdriven approaches and the cadre of russian policymakers who doggedly keep these ideas in play end summary 2 sbu this cable is based on dozens of conversations with contacts in industry and banking over the past six weeks supplemented by embassybased research the breadth of state ownership 3 sbu the march of the state into parts of the russian economy over the past few years has been significant with control of swaths of the natural resource defense and select other sectors consolidated in state hands annual revenues of russias ten largest stateowned or controlled companies reached an estimated 20 percent of gdp in 2006 stateowned or controlled companies account for onethird of the russian stock markets capitalization and in just the last year the value of these equity holdings has almost doubled to an estimated usd 369 billion and the process continues rosoboronexport is rumored to be in line to buy russias fifth largest steel producer mechel further consolidation in the energy sector favoring gazprom and rosneft is likely new shipbuilding national champion is in the works and diamond giant alrosa has its eye on norilsk nickel usd 30 billion company with more than the half the worlds palladium and onefifth of global nickel output looking behind this latest great grab 4 c the grab for russias resources is an old story but contacts agree that traditional motives greed power have been supplemented in this round with nationalistic brand of commercial considerations greed in russia shocks one but the rising value of russia inc on the back of high energy prices has made the current grab particularly profitable for some power considerations both geopolitical as in the case of gazprom and in the context of russias domestic succession process are evident as well new to this paradigm is the surprisingly strong role business considerations seem to be playing as the russian government tries to salvage select few decrepit remains of soviet industrial prowess before it is too late our contacts have lot to say about all three motives we summarize what weve heard here 5 c greed the kremlin leadership in the economy is in small part about money and the sibneft takeover by gazprom is perhaps the most blatant example of this only about quarter of the 12b selling price for the firm is said to have actually gone to owner abramovich in general the insider offtake from ma deal flows is said to be so large now that swiss banks have told kremlin cutouts like gastrader timchenko that they cannot accept further deposits without knowing the source of the money the most lucrative transfers to the state usually involving natural resources may be wrapped in patriotic rhetoric but include healthy dose of financial opportunism yet as ugly as it looks our contacts remind it is not so different than what happened in indonesia and south korea and mexico too as one contact points out the bureaucrats got rich there too moscow 00001442 002 of 004 6 c power creating national champions and projecting strong image for russia abroad has been leading factor in many stateconnected takeovers and consolidations including the removal of the gazprom ring fence the rosoboronexport makeover the rusalsual deal and the anticipated takeover of norilsk nickel by alrosa some of what we are seeing is also is part of the ongoing succession process putting individuals into deal flows and thus providing campaign finance and enhancing their public profile the decision to put military hardware exports under rosoboronexport is seen in some quarters as buttressing dark horse presidential hopeful and rosoboronexport chairman sergey chemezov recent portfolio changes are seen by some as giving first deputy prime minister sergey ivanov cashladen institutional base like that enjoyed by his chief rival for the presidency first deputy head of the presidential administration and gazprom chairman of the board of directors dmitriy medvedev 7 c nationalisticdriven commercial considerations many believe that putin and those around him are also driven by sincere desire to right the excesses of the 1990s or oligarchic plundering of onceproud though ruinously inefficient soviet companies the examples here are truly varied in the case of avtovaz rosoboronexports move to take over the firm last year may be the only thing saving the cargiant from complete collapse in the face of global competition the emerging norilsk nickel story is said to be as much about saving alrosa which experts say will run out of diamonds in ten years time as it is about keeping norilsks palladium and nickel output in russian hands and as driven by national security concerns as the formation of the united aircraft company might be also at play is longoverdue consolidation of an industry largely on the verge of collapse these examples are more about saving jobs and communities and creating viable competitive companies than personal enrichment although making money is not precluded here both avtovaz and uac not to mention plans to create new shipbuilding national champion sound more like cash sinks than cash cows what next 8 c looking ahead our contacts are divided about what to expect next statist believers argue that there are troubling signs that the trend is far from contained stateowned companies are straying farther from their core business eyeing the telecom and it sectors and expanding beyond traditional financial services they point to gazproms movement into electricity svyazinvests significant stake in privatelyheld telecom provider comstar and vneshtorgbanks overtures to brokerage house troika dialog ultimately rebuffed while one is predicting another yukosstyle approach there is sense that the authorities can and will come up with new pretexts for control 9 c in contrast others argue the states reach is plateauing and the current mix of stateprivate ownership could start to reverse itself before long they say national champions in the sectors that make sense have been created and industries such as telecom and it do not lend themselves to overcentralization in gas and electricity given supply shortfalls the gor has to promote private investment to meet demand and introduce efficiencies shrinking current account balance on the back of lower oil prices and the drive to diversify the economy only heighten the need for private capital and better corporate governance which implies move away from state ownership and control the kremlin will also find it increasingly difficult to control emerging interest groups from the consumer sector to regional governments integration into the wto and other western economic institutions will require greater transparency better and more equal market access and lower protectionist barriers which will temper the states ambition 10 c some take this latter argument one dark step further they say that current gor leadership its successors and supporters will need to find outlets for their accumulated wealth much of which is said to be held in liquid assets abroad the theory goes that these funds will start making their way back to russia over the next twothree years and that the target of the return flows will most likely be the moscow 00001442 003 of 004 same assets that have been carefully squirreled away in state hands over the past few years thus spurring share offerings by rosneft spin offs at gazprom etc these assets are profitable and equity ownership in russia carries less risk for this particular group of investors than the prying eyes of regulatory authorities abroad likewise coming into russia from an european investment platform as one contact cynically noted may make it less likely that zealous lawenforcement officials abroad would pursue criminal or civil cases for fear us or european firm could get tangled up in the investigation where we come out 11 c looking at the three motives most obviously at play two of them greed and nationalistic commercial considerations suggest equally valid reasons why we might see the state pulling back from its commanding heights over the next few years greed will tend to push those who have accumulated shares in state companies towards share cashouts just as it will push those who have accumulated private cash abroad to buy back into russias safest investments rosneft is perfect example we are watching to see who in the government argues the loudest for rosnefts further privatization they more than likely stand to benefit from either the sell or the buy opportunity for industries that are less obvious moneymakers exemplified by avtovaz and uac the state is even more likely to divest wholly in the case of avtovaz as the firms become commercially viable and need investment capital and strategic partners and as they become less social land mines and resemble more the typical daytoday slog of the business world 12 c but pulling back does not mean exiting the field xxxxxxxxxxxx does not expect the state ever to relinquish its control of xxxxxxxxxxxx nor will the gor allow its stake in gazprom to drop again below 50 although many predict it will shed noncore assets in the coming years nor will the diamond trade or trade in metals likely see repeat of the halcyon days of private ownership in the wake of loansforshares uac will likely never be more than 30 privatelyowned 13 c but even if every firm in the natural resources sector ends up in state hands as significant as that would be it would account for around 12 of the russian economy add in state monopolies in the transport and communications sector defense industries and space and state control over the economy rings in around 25 of gdp as disturbing as this figure might seem it is not wildly out of line with other market economies rich in natural resources as recently as two years ago the norwegian state owned approximately 32 of the companies listed on the oslo stock exchange and still holds shares in 1015 percent of norwegian industry including controlling shares in oil telecoms and the national airline in mexico the state fully controls the oil gas and nuclear power industries and has reserved for the state in whole or part the telecommunications air travel and postal sectors 14 c and these back of the envelope estimates ignore important counter trends to the movement toward greater state control whole swaths of the economy our interlocutors again and again confirm lie fully outside the ambitions of the state and are thriving one seasoned businessman who has had his hat handed to him on more than one occasion over the past 15 years is back in russia and growing fast and he chalks up his current success to the booming service and retail sector place where he says he never comes in contact with the designs of the kremlin there are also instances like with xxxxxxxxxxxx where despite the new ownership structure the state has left the firm to run the business without rosoboronexport grabbing off profits or instructing where production should go lastly it would be irresponsible to ignore the progress being made toward the breakup and privatization of both the electricity and rail sectors when all is said and done these massive reforms will move some 23 percent of gdp from state to private hands 15 c there is another reason why more of this economy will likely move into the private sector economic modernizers as they have come to call themselves here may still moscow 00001442 004 of 004 ultimately get the upper hand xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx and others recognize that only through greater private sector participation in the economy will russia be able to attract the capital needed to sustain growth over the long run this is also where working to bring russia into international institutions will help drive policy here in the direction we favor locking the russian government into such institutions and exposing russian companies to the discipline of the global market will reinforce the trends we seek to encourage doing so this year before the election process starts to create new winners and losers is bet on the modernizers worth taking
