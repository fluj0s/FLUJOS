resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33430the safety of air ambulances summary the estimated rate of air ambulance accident s has been steadily rising since the early 1990s and has increased at rapid rate since 1998 when the industry began to expand more rapidly and shift toward model of more inde pendent private air ambulance services that cover larger geographic areas statistics indicate that the large majority of air ambulance accidents are attributable to operational factors related to pilot situation awareness and decision making when faced with adverse environmental conditions such as darkness deterioratin g weather rugged terrain or some combination of these factors initiatives to improve air ambulance safety to date have consequently focused on additional pilot training implementing risk management practices to improve the safety of flight operations and using various technologies to improve pilot situation awareness in restricted visibility conditi ons however implementation of these safety measures has strictly been volunt ary the national transporation safety board ntsb and other aviation safety ex perts are advocating the mandatory use of formal flight dispatch procedures nd risk management practices among air ambulance operators as well as mandatory installation of terrain warning systems on air ambulance aircraft the ntsb also found that many ai r ambulance accidents occur when patients are not on board such as route to an accident scene present regulations allow air ambulances to operate under less stringent set of rules with regards to weather minimums and pilot duty times when not carrying patients however the ntsb believes that air ambulance flights should operate under more stringent commercial operatin g rules at all times that medical personnel are carried on board although maintenan ce issues have been identified in about 20 percent of all air ambulance accidents neither the federal aviation administration faa nor the ntsb has placed any specific emphasis on oversight of operators or repair stations that maintain air ambulance aircraft the present emphasis on air ambulance safety has instead been dominated by c oncerns over flight crew performance and weatherrelated factors variety of options are available to improve safety among air ambulance operators these options include intensifie d oversight of air ambulance operators and regulatory changes to bring all phases of air ambulance operations under the same set of operational rules regarding weather minimums and pilot duty times possible regulatory changes to provide for sharing and analysis of safetyrelated data and observations with some degree of impunity possible aircraft sign considerations to improve crash survivability expanded application of system safety and formal risk management principles to mission planning and flight operations enhanced training for both pilots and support pers onnel and operational pr ocedures to improve coordination and situation awareness among the entire air ambulance crew and ground support team and the use of various technologies to impr ove pilot situation awareness and augment pilot vision in low visibility conditions this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33430contents n n l s i s f i r m b u l n c s f t d t 1 t h r l f i r m b u l n c s 5state of

air ambulance companies lost helicopters 90 airliners would crash each year3 because there is centralized database of flight records for the air ambulance industry one knows for sure if safety is eroding or if this increase in accidents can be explained by the large growth in the use of helicopters and airplanes for medical evacuation and patient transport the ntsb notes that while industry estimates suggest that the number of hours flown by air ambulances has increased by about 85 over the past 15 years the estimated accident rate for he licopter air ambulances has also risen from 352 accidents pe r 100000 flight hours between 1992 and 2001 to 456 accidents per 100000 flight hours between 1997 and 20014 the ntsb however did not provide its own estimates of accident rates or more recent figures on the annual accident rate s for air ambulances available accident statistics and analyses reviewed by crs have focused on helicopter air ambulance operations which make up more than 80 of the air ambulance fleet consequently this report concentrates on safe ty data and finding related to helicopter air am bulances although many of the issues and observations may be more broadly

hours flown by helicopter air ambulance operators cited in comprehensive safety review and risk an alysis of air ambul ance accidents published by the air medical physician association ampa5 this analysis estimated that the overall accident rate among air ambulan ce operators from 1991 to 2004 to be 350 accidents per 100000 flight hours and the fata l accident rate to be 113 accidents per 100000 flight hours looking only at the data since 1998 when notable spike in accidents was first observed the estimated ove rall accident rate rose to an average of 475 accidents per 100000 flight

referenced year and the two prior years so for example the data points for 1993 are based on accidents and flight hour estimates for 1991 1992 and 1993 this is done to provide more stable metric for analyzing trends among accident rates that may fluctuate significantly from year to yearbased on available flight time estimates and are shown in figure 1 6 the trend in the threeyear moving average accident rates suggests steady increase in the accident rate from 1991 through 2003 with slight re versal of this trend in 2004 the data also show slight rise in the fatal accident rate over the past

than many other commercial aviation sectors in particular over the same period from 19912005 non scheduled air taxi opera tors which fly under the same rules as air ambulance operators carrying patients experienced an overall accident rate of 252 accidents per 100000 flig ht hours and fatal accident rate of 067 fatal accidents per 100000 flight hours7 while air ambulance operations particularly helicopter air ambulance opera tions by their nature may arguably be inherently more risky than other commercial aviation operations the relatively higher estimated accident rates coupled with the observed trend of increasing accidents and estimated accident rates suggests that th causes of these accidents and possible options to reduce these numbers is an appropriate topic for policy analysis when the ntsb previously examined commercial emergency medical service helicopter operations in 1988 it estimated that the overall accident rate between 1980 and 1985 was 1234 per 100000 flight hours almost twice the estimated accident rate experienced by nonscheduled helicopter air taxis during that period8 moreover the fatal accident rate of 540 per 100000 f light hour for helicopter air ambulances between 1980 and 1985 was estima ted to be about 3 Â½ time s the fatal accident rate for nonscheduled helicopter air taxis and all turbinepowered helicopters9 while more recent accident rate estimates among helicopter air ambulance operators have been climbing steadily they still appear to be much lower than estimates for the early 1980s however the lower observed accident rates in the early 1990s suggest that safety improvements can be made in ai r ambulance operations to reduce the overall and fatal accident rates compared to recently observed levels specifically between 1991 and 1995 the helicopter air ambulance industry had an estimated 181 accidents and 091 fatal accidents for every 100000 flig ht hours accident rates that closely resemble those of other commercial aviation operations such as the previously cited statistics for nonscheduled ai r taxi operators arguably based on these data the helicopter air ambulance indus try has already demonstrated that it can achieve better safety record than what it has experienced since 1998 although air ambulance operations can be i nherently riskier than other aviation operations because the environment in which they operate is more dynamic and unpredictable some experts ve raised concerns that the air ambulance industry and the faa are simply accepting higher accident rate than other areas of the aviation industry rather than taking step s to reduce the number of accidents10 while the faa and the air ambulance industry have acknow ledged that ongoing safety

inadequate to further assess the root causes of air ambulance accidents and assess possible policy changes to improve sa fety in the air ambulance industry it may be beneficial to examine the operational role of air ambulances as well as the current state of the air ambulance i ndustry and management prac tices in the air ambulance industry the role of air ambulances when most people think of an air ambul ance operation they are likely to first consider helicopter transports of trauma patients such as car accident victims this has historically been the predominant form of air ambulance service since its beginnings in the early 1970s large scal use of air evacuation of wounded troops was demonstrated to be an effective means of reducing combat mortality both in the korean and vietnam conflicts based on this experience civilian air ambulance use in the united states began on small scal starting in the early 1970s and has grown significantly since lthough so studies have found little or benefit from helicopter evacuations of civilian trauma patients numerous studies point to improved chances for recovery and significant reductions in mortality rates when air ambulance services are made available to trauma patients11 medical theory and practice holds that providing critically injured patients with surgical intervention within the first hour after injury the socalled golden hour can significantly improve the chances for survival and recovery12 in practice air ambulances particularly helicopters can pl ay an important role in this intervention by providing rapid patient transport to trauma centers where they can be effectively treated and in some cases providing advanced life s upport capabilities route the availability of this service provides an important role especially in rural communities that lack readily accessible advanced care f acilities and medical specialists more recently there has been increas ed utilization of air ambulances both helicopters and airplanes for both onscen response and interfacility transport of critical cardiac patients and stroke victims both helicopters and fixedwing aircraft are also utilized for other interfacility tr ansfers to give patie nts access to specialty care facilities and medical sp ecialists while the onscene response of helicopter at traffic accident is probably what first comes to mind when the term air ambulance is used today about 54 of all air medical transports are from hospital to hospital while onscene responses make up 33 the remaining 13 include organ and medical supply and speci ality medical team transports13 air ambulances can also play an important role in emergency evacuation of critical care patients andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33430crs6 14 ibid note unlike

ambulance transports are being over utilized15 there is generally widespread acceptance of the benefit provided by both the general public and the medical community th air ambulance community acknowledges that utilization of air ambulances in some cases may in retrospect prove to have been unnecessary this they argue is to be expected if the medical community is to assure that the maximum number of patients who could pot entially benefit from air ambulance services are provided with this service over the past 15 years guidelines for air medical dispatch have been refined by the air ambulance community and emergency room physicians these various guidelines set forth circumstancespecific and patientspecific criteria for decision makers assessing whether to dispatch flight as well as for analysts reviewing and modeling utilization and refining resource allocation acr oss particular geographic area16 the industry also argues that while air ambulance rvices are comparatively costly when examined on singlecase basis appropriately used air medical transport is cost effective on systemwide basis largely due to more efficient coverage of large geographic areas reduced patient transport times and more rapid intervention that can reduce overall patient care costs17 in general air ambulance services have garnered wide community support and ndorsement from the medical community as being beneficial and costeffective serv ice for improving access to critical health care and increasing the chances of survival and recovery for trauma victims and critically ill patients particularly in areas where acce ss to specialized health care is limited consequen tly air ambulance utilization is likely to continue its steady growth throughout the united states particul arly in rural areas this expectation of continued growth for the industry draws pa rticular attention to the ongoing safety concerns because continued growth without any improvement to sa fety could trigger widespread public concern over the safety of these operations which has already been evidenced to some degree based on recent media coverage of the issue18 state of the air ambulance industry the

helicopter emerge ncy services flying 400 helicopters by 200019 variety of factors including increases in medicare reimbursement rates for air ambulance services and recent declines in available emergency medical and advanced patient care services in rural areas have resulted in significant growth in the air ambulance industry over the past five years in 2005 there were 272 helicopter emergency services flying 753 helicopter s in the united states roughly an 88 increase in the number of helicopter air ambulances compared to the size of the industry in 2000 in 2005 there were also an estimated 150 fixedwing airplanes dedicated to air ambulance operations used mostly for interhospital transfers20 based on industry flight hour estimates growth in the us of air ambulances has been increasing at rate of about 45 per year over the past 15 years and most observers believe that this steady growth in both th size of the dedicated air ambulance fleet in the united states and the utilization of air ambulances will continue over the next several years while some states and municipalities nd other public agencies operate air ambulances as public aircraft most air am bulance services are privately owned and operated either directly by hospital or hospital consor tium or by private aviation medical service providers the maryland st ate highway patrol has comprehensive

hospitals over large geographic region in the late 1990s regulatory changes requiring ambulance services including air ambulances to bill patients separately from hospital charges as well as increases in medicare reimbursement fo r air ambulance flights in some regions brought about significant changes to the industry23 most helicopter emergency medical services in the 1980s and early 1990s were either r directly by hospitals and emergency facilities or more commonl operated under hospital managed contracts with aviation companies that provide d the helicopters and pilots24 today many of these services are now operated by standalone private entities with hospital affiliations and in many locations there is direct competition between air ambulance service providers within region while some states and local government s provide air ambulance services as public good or quasipublic good privatelyrun operations are far more common the maryland state police aviation command as an example of staterun system derives about twothirds of its funding from automobile registration fees and the remainder from general state treasury fundi ng for the state police patients are consequently not required to pay for tran sport and medical costs provided by this service in the privatelyoperated air ambul ance model by contrast patients or their insurers are directly billed for charges incu rred for air ambulance transport although privatelyoperated air ambulance services provide an important function in the communities they serve critics argue that the financial pressures associated with operating these services as well as insufficient regulatory requirements and oversight may be significant factors that could ne gatively affect flight safety across the industry although competition and associated pre ssures to conduct missions was already present when the ntsb examined air ambulance helicopter safety in 1988 it was generally concluded that helicopter patient transport at that time was not profitable on the basis of transportation alone in fact 1986 survey cited by the ntsb found that patients were on average only charged for about 75 of the direct cost of air ambulance transport25 hospitals made up for these losses through charges for other advanced care services provided at the hospital thus the competition that existedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33430crs9 26 barry meier crashes start debate on safety of sky ambulances 27 ibidin the 1980s was largely between hospita ls from business perspective air ambulances at that time were largely seen as marketing tool to increase public recognition of the hospital within the community and attract patients in the current environment however the competition appears to be more directly related to the flight mission as the business model for most privatesector air ambulance services has been shifting toward standalone operators that market their services to local hospitals emergency officials and even to the general public26 one example of marketing to the general public is the sales of yearly memberships that will cover any gaps not paid by insuran ce for air ambulance transports27 various competitive pressures including direct competition among services and the desire to satisfy hospital and emergency medical service administrators that oversee air ambulance contracts can potentially affect flight safety if they factor into decisions regarding whether to accept or continue flight ssion operating air am bulances as private businesses may also create fi nancial pressures that could lead some operators to forego safety improvements or enhancements that are not specifically required in order to keep operational costs at minimu m these various operational pressures that exist in the air ambulance industry and their potential impact on safety will be considered in greater detail along with ot her possible causal and contributing factors in air ambulance crashes causes of air ambulance crashes the large majority of air ambulance accidents occur due to chain of circumstances involving pilot decisi onmaking and performance and flight conditions such as weather and terrain in particular darkness reduced visibility and rising terrain present significant challenges and risks to air ambulance operators particularly helicopter

the air ambulance industry to encourage voluntary implementation of systems safety and risk management concepts in air ambulance operations pilot situation awareness of weather conditions in its most recent review of air ambulance safety the ntsb found that situation awareness can often be lacking in air ambulance operations fo r variety of reasons but was chiefly concerned with the lack of formal flight dispatch procedures among operators air ambulance pilots lack the benefit of c onsistent comprehensive flight dispatch procedures and often rely on emergency 911 dispatchers referred to in the industry as communications specialists or emerge ncy medical personnel that typically have formal training in flight dispatch procedures in 11 of the 55 accidents reviewed by the ntsb in their 2006 special study incomplete or missing information regarding weather route of flight and coordination with ons cene rescue personnel factored into the causal chain of the accident the ntsb consequently recommended that the faa require air ambulance operators to use formalized dispatch and flightfollowing procedures th at include uptodate weather information and assistance in flight risk assessment decisions29 in response to this recommendation policymakers might opt to assess the benefits and costs of implementing formal flight dispatch pro cedures and specific training in these procedures to both flight crews and ground communication specialists in the emergency medical field th at coordinate and dispat ch air ambulance missions mission pressures aviation safety experts have also pointed to pressures to complete the mission as factors that can lead to poor judgment among air ambulance pilots and contri bute to accidents in 1988 the ntsb found that mission pressures could be exacerbated by lack of onsite supervision among operators particularly those operators that service broad geographic area in many of these instances the ntsb found that pilots imme diate supervisor was not located at the pilots base station or hospital and in some cases was located in distant city the ntsb concluded that isolati on from management forces pilots to look for structure and guidance from other sources partic ularly hospital emergency service administrators and personnel this arrangement can result in pilots placing greater importance on the medical mission and potentially may compromise sound judgment with regard to flight safety the ntsb noted thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33430crs12 30 national transportation safety board commercial emergency medical service helicopter

personnel and the dispatchers can all intentionally or unintentionally put pressu re on the pilots to take flight in marginal weather conditions the reasons for these pressures include

or continue mission pilots ma feel pressured to accept or continue missions in marginal weather conditions in order to satisfy hospital administrators and maintain good business re lations with them in pr ivatelyoperated air ambulance services the hospital is in essence customer of the air ambulance service and pilots may feel compelled to satisfy their customer by accepting and completing maximum number of missions these pressure s may be even greater at hospitals and in regions where there is direct competition among air ambulance providers survey of helicopter air ambulance pilo ts found that while pressure to accept or continue missions is significant cern pilots more freque ntly cited pressure to speed up response time as the most sign ificant pressure fact or affecting

training materials and resources on aeronautical decision making th at are both general in nature as well as specific to unique considerations for helicopter and air ambulance operations decision making and various external pressu res that may effect pilot judgment on air ambulance missions is often not covered in depth during initial and recurrent pilot training therefore policymakers may cons ider more formal training and testing of aeronautical decision making concepts specific to air ambulance operations as possible option for mitigating accidents re lated to poor judgment and decision making errors besides training in aeronautical d ecision making formal techniques for evaluating the operational risks associated with each flight assignment may benefit pilots in the

addition to flight operational factor s and conditions of flight significant proportion about 22 of the helicopter air ambulance accidents examined were found to be attributable at least in part to

controls these findings suggest that maintenance of air ambulances poses significant safety risk however neither the faa nor the ntsb has identified maintenance practices among air ambulance aircraft as specific area for concern consequently present efforts to prevent air ambulance crashes are focused instead on risk factors associated with flight ope rations and pilot performance available data suggests that policymakers might so choose to consider more indepth examination of maintenance practices in the air ambulan ce industry to identify ways to reduce maintenancerelated accidents options for improving safety based on available data summarized above suggesting that flight operational factors are the central cause of the large majority of air ambulance accidents options for improving safety have focused on po ssible changes to flight operations and practices among air ambulance operators these various options have been framed in terms of possible alternatives for chan ging

among air ambulance operators the ntsb noted that while the faa has taken positive step toward improving air ambulance safety by creating task force in august 2004 to look into helicopter air am

board must be operated under regulations contained in title 14 cfr part 135 for the purposes of this discussion the principal differen ces between these two sets of regulations are that under part 91

fall 2005 the faa initiated special emphasis inspection program targeting helicopter air ambulance operators the inspection program is desi gned to focus on policies procedures training communications and management of flight operations and the development of safety culture among operators with the goal of identifying and correcting factors known to contribute to accidents among helicopter air ambulances39 the faa has also issued special bulletin for devel oping and critiquing air ambulance operator training programs and operatin g procedures that are specifically designed to prevent loss

assessments of obstacles and terrain considerations along the route of flight and the use of approved technologies to aid in flight situation awareness in an effort to curtail accidents applying consistent regulatory requirements during all phases of operation the ntsb also noted that when patients are not on board for example during positioning flights or route to an accident scene air ambulance operators may operate under less stringen t set of regulations because the faa regards medical personnel on board as essential crew members42 when operating under these less stringent regulations ai r ambulance operators have set minimum requirements for inflight visibility nor do any regulations pertaining to flight and duty time for pilots apply the ntsb found that of the 55 air ambulance accidents studied 35 occurred while operating under th less stringent regulations without patients on board in 10 of these accident s the flights were being conducted in weather conditions that would not have met the minimum requirements for operation under the more stringent set of commercia l regulations required for flights with patients on board the ntsb concluded that in its opinion medical personnel onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33430crs16 43 see title 14 code of federal regulations 135271 44 national transportation safety board commercial emergency medical service helicopter operations 45 ibidboard do not meet the definition of requi red crew members for flight operational purposes and therefore recommended that the faa require air ambulance operators to comply with more stringent commercial flight regulations whenever medical personnel are on board as they cu rrently do when carrying patients the fact that air ambul ance operations without pa tients are conducted under separate regulatory guidelines also has potential impact on those operations conducted with patient s on board this is because without any specific duty time regulations being applied to flights conducted without pa tients such flights are not counted in pilots duty time totals th erefore lengthy flig ht operations without patients on board could contribute to pilot fa tigue and affect safe ty during subsequent flights with patients on boar d while regulations curren tly include industry specific flight time and rest time requirements for helicopter air ambulance pilots43 flights flown without patients are not required to be considered in complying with these regulations therefore notwithstanding the ntsbs recommendation to conduct all flights with medical personnel on board as commercial operations subject to specific duty time limitations policy make rs may consider alterna tive approaches to account for and limit pilot duty times in air ambulance operations in manner that more accurately reflects actual flight time logge d regardless of whether patients are on board or not addressing concerns over pilot fatigue addressing the specific issue of pilot fatigue and duty time regulations among air ambulance operators is regarded by many aviation safety experts as being very important because the combination of stress rotating shift work and operating at or near the minimal flight crew staffing levels needed to maintain 247 opera tions is common across the industry and predisposes pilots to acute and chronic fatigue44 while fatigue has not been identified as causal or contributing factor in very many air ambulance accidents this may largely be due to the difficulty in substantiating the presence of fatigue following an accident in 1988 the ntsb noted that while pilot fatigue had only been identified in one of the accidents it reviewed pilot fatigue was suggested by some in the ems helicopter industry to be the primary cause of accidents45 since that time because notable changes have taken place with regard to regulations or practices pertaining to pilot duty times acr oss the industry preventing pilot fatigue would appear to still be significant objective for improving safety in air ambulance operations therefore in ddition to addressing the broa der question of whether air ambulance flights should adhere to commerc ial flight regulati ons during all phases of mission including times when patie nts are not on board policymakers may consider possible changes in pilot duty time and flight time regulations to address concerns over the potential role of fatigue in the safety of flight operations to fully address the issue of pilot fatigue specific regulations pertaining to flight time and rest requirements may need to be examined separately from the issuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33430crs17 46 graham warwick medical alert flight international february 2127 2006 pp 7273 47 based on data presented in ira j blumen md and the university of chicago aeromedical safety committee safety review and risk ssessment in air medical transport 2002of requiring air ambulance operators to conform to other commercial operating regulations in particular those regulations pertaini ng to weather minimums and weather reporting requirements when c onducting flights with medical personnel on board may need to be examined as separate issue specifically air ambulance operators have voiced concerns that appl ying existing commercial flight regulations to patient pickup flights may significantly limit the ability of air ambulances to accept missions in reduced visibility this according to an industry trade group is due to the fact that commercial regulations as currently written require approved weather reporting at the intende d destination in order to fly solely by reference to instruments46 this could significantly limit opera tors to visual flight conditions only working around this issue may require specific exemptions or separate set of requirements for air ambulance operato rs although regulations and policies pertaining to weather and flight duty time standards for air ambulance operations are both important issues for considerati on uniformly applying commercial flight regulations designed primarily for other purposes to all facets of air ambulance operations may be an imperfect solution policy makers ma consider tailoring these regulations to the specific safety concerns and operational needs of the air ambulance industry by dealing with those regulations pertaining to weather minimums and those regulations pertaining to pilot duty times as distinct policy issues increasing maintenance oversight as previously mentioned little attention has been given to the oversight of maintenance practices at facilities that maintain and repair air ambulance aircraft however consistent with this reports findings an indepth study of mainte nancerelated accident s found that about 23 of helicopter air ambulance accidents may be attributed in part to mechanical or maintenance issues about onethird of th accidents were regarded as being the result of inadequate or improper maintenance47 given that aviation safety experts have devoted considerable attention to airline maintenance practices the lack of any specific focus on maintenance of air ambulance operations is somewhat surprising but this is likely attributable to the fact that these maintenance safety issues are largely eclipsed by concerns over flight operational safety issu which account for the large majority of air ambulance crashes nevertheless policymakers may consider whether additional oversight nd scrutiny of air ambulance maintenance practice may be able to provide additional insight into specific maintenance practices that compromise safety and available options for preventing maintenancerelated incidents and accidents improving aircraft crashworthiness aircraft

and other helicopters were not as noticeable this finding could have important implications if the service model for he licopter air ambulance operations continues to shift toward more autonomous private operators who may be more likely to use smaller lighterweight helicopters to keep aircraft acquisition and operating costs low the study concluded that the use of energyabsorbing seats that can handle greater crash forces in combination with lap and doubleshoulder fivepoint harnesses along with greater attention to crashworthiness in designing cabin modifications for air ambul ance operations could signif icantly improve occupant survivability and reduce the severity of crashrelated injuries based on an analysis of military helicopter crash data the study also concluded that the use of helmets by flight crews and medical crews could signifi cantly reduce the risk of serious and fatal head injuries in crash policymakers may consider whether specific design guidance or standards for seats seatbelts and interior design modifications as well as operational requirements for equipmen t such as shoulder harnesses and helmets could reduce fatalities and mitigate injury risks in air ambulance crashes equipment and design standards and re quirements would likely have to strike balance between providing flight and medical crews with ad equate protective measures while ensuring that these safety measures do not unduly pr event or interfere with patient care and other critical mission functions implementing system safety and risk management principles the degree to which safety principles are trained and practiced as matter of routine within the air ambulance industry is matter of considerab interest while the faa and trade organizations within the industry have

positive steps to improve safety some including the ntsb argue that voluntary measures to improve safety such as this are insufficient and certain safetyrelated changes such as formal disp atch procedures and risk management practices should require mandatory industrywide compliance policymakers either at the faa or in congress will ultimately have to weigh the merits of this argument and determine whether the safety benefits of these initiatives outweigh the costs associated with implementing them in its special study examining air ambulance accidents occurring between january 2002 and january 2005 the ntsb found th at formal risk evaluation of the mission may have prevented 13 of the 55 accidents reviewed51 however the ntsb found that most operators have not impleme nted formal risk evaluation process even though guidelines for setting up such process has been made available by the faa while the faa has issued guidelines for implementing risk assessment programs for helicopter air ambulance operati ons this material is only advisory in nature and is not requi red to be implemented52 therefore the ntsb formally recommended that the faa require all ai r ambulance operators to develop and implement flight risk evaluation progra ms and train all employees involved in decisionmaking and support of flight ope rations on participating in these risk evaluation processes53 in the airline industry several initiatives to improve the collection and analysis of safetyrelated opera tional data have taken root and are now common practice for example air carrier flight operational quality assurance foqa programs collect extensive flight operational data using data mining techniques operations that fall outside the defined paramete rs of safe operations are identified and subsequently investigated to determine the circumstan ces surrounding the incident with the goal of reducing or eliminating events that compromise safety and could lead to an accident

her similar approaches to information sharing and safety data analysis regarding critical safety issues could be feasibly implemented across the air ambulance industry training and procedures for flight and medical crews it has been reported that in 2000 representatives from the air ambulance industry approached the faa with proposal to require that air ambulance pilots and crew members receive training in crew resource management crm this type of training is mandatory for airline cr ews and focuses on how to effectively communicate risk information and use av ailable resources to assess and manage operational risks55 however this proposal s not yet resulted in any faa recommendations or regulatory proposals presently there are specific training requirement for pilots on topics such as crm risk management and aeronautical decision making beyond the general understandi ng of these topics required to obtain commercial pilot certification and appropriate ratings required for employment such as helicopter and instrument ratings these general requirements are considered relatively minimal and many safety experts argue that they do not receive adequate coverage in general flight training and p ilot testing moreover training received on these topics in the course of general flight training is not tailored to the specific operational conditions and pre ssures that pilot or crew member might experience in air ambulance operations thus any speci fic training in dealing with operational risks unique to the flight environment of air ambulances is provided solely at the discretion of the operator while some operators provide this training in various forms there is industry standard for c ourse content or objectives for these types of training programs in the ntsbs 1988 study of helicopter air ambulance safety it found that among the 14 instrumentrated pilots invol ved in the crashes it examined only one was current to fly solely by instruments56 similarly later analysis of pilot qualifications among air ambulance operators concluded that while greater percentage of air ambulance operators were instrument rated lack of instrument currency or proficiency could be detrime nt because instrumentrated pilots may overestimate their instrument training skills and press on in deteriorating conditions despite not having adequate recent experience and practice with instrument flight procedures57 examining training practices in the medical helicopter industry the ntsb found wide range of approaches to training and noted that while many operators had welldefined

that can ssist pilots in assessing weather data provide comprehensive flight following and aid pilots in making informed decisions whether to accept or continue mission61 policymakers will need to determine the feasability of requiring dedicated flight dispatchers in the air ambulance environment and whether these services require an faa certified dispatcher approved under existing faa training

systems could distract pilots these operators are worried that high false alarm rates particularly among helicopter air ambulances that frequently operate in close proximity to terrain in manner not typical of other aircraft and flight operations could largely negate any bene fit that taws may provide in terms of improving pilot situation awareness regarding terrain clearance while false alarms
