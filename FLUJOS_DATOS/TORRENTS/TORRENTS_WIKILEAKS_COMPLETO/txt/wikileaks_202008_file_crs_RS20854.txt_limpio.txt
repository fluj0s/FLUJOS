voluntarily limit candidate spending from personal funds constitutional issues raised by public subsidies and variable contribution limits l paige whitaker legislative attorney american law division summary the supreme court in buckley v valeo ruled that spending limits including the amount candidate can spend on his or her own campaign from personal funds also known as personal fund expenditure limits are unconstitutional the court did however uphold system of spending limits on the condition that they are voluntarily accepted in exchange for some form of public financing as result of these court rulings the concept of various incentives toward voluntary compliance with personal funds expenditure limit has been developed this report discusses some constitutional issues raised by two such incentives public subsidies and variable contribution limits an amendment to s 27 mccainfeingold sa 115 domenici approved 70 to 30 on march 20 2001 would raise the limits on contributions to senate candidate whose opponent exceeds designated level of personal funding in his or her campaign origin of incentives toward compliance with personal funds expenditure limit legislation to impose mandatory expenditure limits on the amount candidate can spend on his or her own campaign from personal funds also known as personal fund expenditure limits is unlikely to be upheld as constitutional in buckley v valeo the us supreme court expressly ruled that limits on personal expenditures by candidates from personal or family resources are unconstitutional1 similar to limitations on independent 1 424 us 1 54 1976 for further discussion of the supreme courts holding in buckley and subsequent related decisions see crs report rl30669 campaign finance regulation under continued congressional research service the library of congress crs2 expenditures the court found that such restraints impose substantial restraint on the ability of persons to engage in protected first amendment expression2 candidate has first amendment right to advocate vigorously and tirelessly for his or her own election according to the court further the court noted it is particularly important that candidates have the unfettered opportunity to communicate their views and positions on the issues in order for the electorate to make an informed vote3 the buckley court did however uphold system of voluntary spending limits conditioned on the acceptance of some form of public financing4 according to the court public financing is within the constitutional powers of congress to reform the electoral process and does not violate any first amendment rights by abridging restricting or censoring speech expression and association but rather encourages public discussion and participation in the electoral process5 specifically the court held congress may engage in public financing of election campaigns and may condition acceptance of public funds on an agreement by the candidate to abide by specified expenditure limitations just as candidate may voluntarily limit the size of the contributions he chooses to accept he may decide to forgo private fundraising and accept public funding6 as result of these court rulings in buckley the concept of various incentives toward voluntary compliance with personal funds expenditure limit has been developed public subsidies or trigger provisions it appears that proposal providing public subsidies or the opportunity to raise more money to candidates participating in personal funds expenditure limit when their opponents have exceeded certain levels of spending from personal funds could be upheld as constitutional so long as the public subsidy incentives also known as trigger provisions are not found to coerce candidates into accepting the spending limits we caution that the supreme court has not provided specific guidance as to the constitutionality of trigger provisions although the issue has been examined by some lower courts for example in gable v patton the sixth circuit upheld state trigger provision whereby the candidate participating in spending limits can raise money over the spending limit and continue to receive matching public funds in 21 ratio if the nonparticipating candidate spends any amount above the limit the court acknowledged that due to the 1 continued the first amendment buckley v valeo and its supreme court progeny by l paige whitaker 2 id at 52 citations omitted 3 id at 5253 4 id at 57 n 65 specifically buckley upheld the current presidential public financing system whereby public subsidies are offered in exchange for spending limits in the primary and general presidential elections see 424 us at 97108 5 id at 9093 6 id at 57 n 65 crs3 trigger provision nonparticipating candidate receives relative advantage from the spending limit while the twoforone matching public funds subsidy provided to the participating candidate assesses substantial cost for nonparticipation further the court found there is only narrow set of circumstances under which candidate could make financially rational decision not to participate7 nevertheless the court held that this type of financial pressure is not sufficient coercion to render the spending limit program unconstitutional absent clearer form of coercion we decline to find that the incentives inherent in the trigger provision are different in kind from clearly constitutional incentives8 in rosenstiel v rodriguez9 the eighth circuit upheld minnesota state statutory trigger provision under which candidates participating in spending limits in exchange for receiving public subsidies are released from the limits if opposed by candidates who exceed the limits further the statute provides that participating candidate is then permitted to raise private funds without limit and permitted to keep the public subsidy funds of up to 50 of the spending limit10 the eighth circuit found that by allowing the participating candidates to be released from the spending limits the state is simply attempting to avert powerful disincentive for participation in its public financing scheme that is concern of being grossly outspent by privately financed opponent with expenditure limit11 moreover in holding that the statute was not coercive the court determined that it afforded the nonparticipating candidate control over whether and when the participating opponent candidate would be released from the spending limits and that therefore the statute actually worked in favor of rather than to the detriment of the nonparticipating candidate12 in fact the court concluded the triggering provision at issue created choiceincreasing framework that promotes rather than detracts from cherished first amendment values13 similarly it appears that proposal to offer tax credit to contributors to candidates who have complied with personal funds limit on expenditures could be upheld like reduced postal rates tax credit is form of public subsidy as it uses funds that would otherwise go to the treasury14 in rosenstiel the eighth circuit court of appeals also upheld minnesota state tax refund statutory scheme against challenge that it was not voluntary but coercive the court found that tax refund when used with other public 7 142 f3d 940 6th cir 1998 cert denied 525 us 1177 1999 8 id at 949 9 101 f3d 1544

finding that tax credits and the deductibility for contributions are form of government subsidy to the entity receiving the contributions crs4 funding to encourage candidates to accept spending limits was simply an additional public subsidy provided to participating candidates and was therefore constitutional15 variable contribution limits or cap gap system under certain circumstances proposal that allows candidates who agree to spending limits from personal funds to accept larger contributions than those who do not participate in such spending limits could pass constitutional muster under such proposal the differing contribution limits are often referred to as variable contribution limits and the system itself is often referred to as cap gap because it creates gap between the caps on contributions permitted to be made to participating versus nonparticipating candidates when court evaluates the constitutionality of cap gap provision it will consider whether the overall statutory framework providing for spending limits is truly voluntary as the supreme court in buckley required or coercive while the supreme court has not provided specific guidance as to how to make this determination between voluntary and coercive some lower courts have considered the issue16 for example the first circuit in vote choice inc v distefano upheld rhode island state statute imposing 1000 limit on contributions to nonparticipating candidates while allowing participating candidates to accept contributions of up to 2000 per donor17 here the court recognized that the statutory scheme was not in exact balance suspecting that very few campaign financing schemes ever achieve perfect equipoise ultimately holding that the law was not unfairly coercive moreover the vote choice court determined statutory framework that merely provides candidates with voluntary alternative to an otherwise applicable assuredly constitutional financing option does not impose first amendment burden18 the vote choice court cautioned however that there is point where regulatory incentives stray beyond the pale creating disparities so profound that they become impermissibly coercive19 that is if the additional contribution amounts that participating candidates may accept are too much larger than the contribution amounts that nonparticipating candidates may accept the disparity might render the program 15 101 f3d at 1551 16 although the issue was not raised in any case we examine challenge to the constitutionality of variable contribution limits could also include the argument which merges the two constitutional standards of free expression and equal protection that the government may not discriminate between different kinds of messages see eg police department v mosley 408 us 92 1972 ordinance struck down that barred all picketing around school building except for labor picketing carey v brown 447 us 455 1980 same niemotko v maryland 340 us 268 1951 permission to use parks for some groups but not for others it could be argued that with variable contribution limit system the government is essentially favoring speech by one contributor over the speech of another depending on the amount of personal fund spending engaged in by each contributors preferred candidate moreover it could also be argued that such system by providing incentives to abstain from personal fund spending results in government disfavoring candidate spending over other types of spending 17 4 f3d 26 37 n 13 1st cir 1993 18 id at 39 19 id at 38 crs5 unconstitutional for instance kentucky federal district court invalidated state statutory system in which the cap gap in effect created 151 disparity in favor of those who accepted the spending limits stating that it was not aware of any case in which disparity of greater than 2 to 1 was upheld further the court found that while there need not be absolute equality between the contribution limits the disparity must not be so great as to destroy the voluntariness of the publicfinancing system20 20 wilkinson v jones 876 f supp 916 930 wd ky 1995 quoting id at 38 for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20854
