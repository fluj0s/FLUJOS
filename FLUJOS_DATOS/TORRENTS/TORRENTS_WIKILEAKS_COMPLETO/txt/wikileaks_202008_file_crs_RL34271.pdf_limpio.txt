commission has released for public comment 10 economic research studies on media ownership that it had commissioned to provide data and analysis to support the policy debate on what ownership limitations are in the public interest these studies also provide data and analysis useful to the ongoing policy debates on how best to foster minority ownership of broadcast stations and on tiered vs à carte pricing of multichannel video program distribution mvpd services such as cable and satellite television the fcc also has released peer reviews of these studies that are required by the office of management and budget in addition consumers union consumer federation of america and free press consumer commenters jointly submitted to the fcc very detailed comments on the 10 fcccommissioned studies that included statistical results from rerunning the models in those studies applying the same empirical data to models revised to correct for alleged specification errors despite the lack of consensus on many issues it appears that the following general statements can be made about the status of the data collection and analysis available to policy makers large systematic detailed and accurate data sets on media ownership characteristics viewerlistener preferences and programming are now available for analysts and policy makers several gaps remain in data collection however most significantly the databases on minority and female ownership of broadcast and telecommunications properties are incomplete and inaccurate and statistical analysis based on those data would not be reliable although the 10 fcccommissioned studies present large number of statistical findings many of these relationships are not statistically significant across alternative model specifications this has led the researchers and peer reviewers to offer disclaimers that the findings are not robust and where they find statistical relationships they demonstrate correlation not causality the peer reviewers and the consumer commenters identified number of possible technical problems in the econometric analyses performed in the 10 studies the potentially most noteworthy criticism appears to be that all but one of the studies addressed the impact of media ownership characteristics on the programming provided by individual crossowned stations not on the total programming available to consumers in the local market which arguably is the key public policy concern it has not yet been determined whether the criticisms are valid andor whether the study results are reliable the consumer commenters claim that when they modified the fcc commissioned studies to take into account these criticisms they obtained robust results demonstrating that loosening the media ownership limits harmed the public interest though their results were not always consistent across model specifications their modified studies have not yet been subject to full review by others

comment 10 economic research studies on media ownership that it had commissioned to provide data and analysis to support the policy debate on what ownership limitations are in the public interest these studies also provide data and analysis useful to the ongoing policy debates on how best to foster minority ownership of broadcast stations and on tiered vs à carte pricing of multichannel video program distribution mvpd services such as cable and satellite television the fccs media ownership rules are intended to foster the three longstanding us media policy goals of diversity of voices localism and competition the current rules place certain limits on the number of media outlets that single entity can own nationally and the number and type of media outlets that single entity can own locally 1 in section 202 of the 1996 telecommunications act congress instructed the fcc to eliminate several of its media ownership rules and to modify others in some cases setting explicit numerical limits itself in other cases instructing the fcc to conduct rulemaking proceeding to determine whether to retain modify or eliminate existing limitations2 congress also instructed the fcc to perform periodic reviews of its dia ownership rules to determine if they are necessary in the public interest as the result of competition and to modify or repeal any regulation it determines to be longer in the public interest the loosening of the media ownership restrictions has led to significant consolidation of ownership in the media sector as part of its periodic review and in response to rulings by the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the fcc adopted an order on june 2 2003 that modified five of its media ownership rules and retained two others3 the new rules most of which would have further loosened ownership restrictions proved to be cont roversial were challenged in court and have never gone into effect on june 24 2004 the united states court of appeals for the third circuit third circuit in prometheus radio project vs federal communications commission upheld the fccs findings that it would be in the public interest to further loosen many of the media ownership restrictions but found the commissions derivation of new crossmedia limits and its modification of the numerical limits on both television and radio station ownership in local markets all have the same essential flaw an unjustified assumption that media outlets of the same type make an equal contribution to diversity and competition in local markets we thus remand for the 1 for

limits the stay currently in effect will continue pending our review of the commissions action on remand over which this panel retains jurisdiction 4 the third circuit also found in repealing the fssr failed station solicitation rule without any discussion of the effect of its decision on minority station ownership and without ever acknowledging the decline in minority ownership notwithstanding the fssr the commission entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem and this amounts to arbitrary and capricious rulemaking for correction of this omission we remand 5 the fcc adopted on june 21 2006 and released on july 24 2006 further notice of proposed rulemaking that sought comment on how to address the issues raised by the opinion of the us court of appeals for the third circuit in prometheus v fcc and on whether the media ownership rules are necessary in the public interest as the result of competition6 the further notice also initiated comprehensive quadrennial re view of all of its media ownership rules as required by statute7 the further notice did not present specific new rules for public comment rather it discussed each rule that was remanded the local television ownership limit the local radio ownership limit the newspaperbroadcast crossownership ban and the radiotelevision crossownership limit plus two additional rules the dual network ban and the uhf discount on the national television ownership limit and then invited comment on how to address the issues remanded by the court it also asked commenters to address whether our goals would be better addressed by employing an alternative regulatory scheme or set of rules8 in addition the further notice sought comment on but did not discuss the proposals to foster minority ownership that had been submitted by the minority media and telecommunications council mmtc in the 2002 biennial review proceeding that the third circuit had taken the commission to task for failing to address in its june 2 2003 order9 two of the commissioners dissented in part from the order adopting the further notice10 criticizing the lack of discussion of proposals to foster minority ownership11 and the

merit of the information by considering among other things 1 whether the methodology and assumptions employed are reasonable and technically correct 2 whether the methodology and assumptions are consistent with accepted economic theory and econometric practices 3 whether the data used are reasonable and of sufficient quality for purposes of the analysis and 4 whether the conclusions if any follow from the analysis the reviewer is instructed not to provide advice on policy or to evaluate the policy implications of the study the peer review is not anonymous the reviewer will be identified

commissioned by the fcc22 perform two functionsdata collection and data analysis systematic data collection is needed because the third circuit decision requires the commission to justify or modify its approach to setting numerical limits23 but there has been dearth of systematic data available on which to base justification of any specific proposed rule the 10 fcccommissioned studies their peer reviews and the critiques and revised models submitted by the consumer commenters in aggregate provide significant body of data and analysis on ownership characteristics and programming needed to perform the analysis required by the third circuit unfortunately the databases on minority ownership and programming remain far less complete and clean despite heroic effort by an fcc staffer to construct time series database for 20012005 from existing sources the data analyses performed in the ten studies tend not to reach strong policy conclusions typically the analyses attempt to determine whether there is statistical relationship between particular aspects of media ownership in market such as newspaperbroadcast crossownership and particular market outcomes such as the quantity of local news or local public affairs programming holding other variables that might affect the market outcomes constant often statistically significant relationship between two variables is found with one particular model specification but if small change is made in the way the model is specified the relationship is continued 00244 further comments of consumers union consumer federation of america and

ownership studies an august 21 2006 fcc news release announced that michelle p connolly had been named fcc chief economist several of the studies suggested in ms marxs memorandum were among those later commissioned by the fcc the memorandum lists number of media ownershiprelated hypotheses that are of interest to policy makers and thus might merit analysis but it also lists for each finding that would support loosening the crossownership limits thus suggesting preferred outcome the memorandum also provides list of possible authors for the studies 22 the fcc identified and referred to these studies as study 1 study 2 etc for ease of presentation in this report the studies will be referred to by their study number rather than by their title 23 see footnote 4 above

the researchers and peer reviewers to emphasize that the statistical findings were not robust24 where relationships are identified the researchers tend to emphasize that these demonstrate correlation not causality few of the studies seek to test for such statistical relations hips without holding other variables constant thus overstating the magnitude of any relationships they find three of the studies had findings suggesting that nonownership variables such as the demographics or commute time in market were better predictors of the amount or type of programming aired than were ownership characteristics this led some researchers to suggest that media ownership characteristics may not be significant determinants of programming none of the studies presents statistical an alysis of the relationship between ownership characteristics and minority programming although study 2 collected data on many types of programming including minority programming and those data were used in study 3 to analyze the relationships between various ownership characteristics and different types of programming results are shown for minority programmingthough results are shown for spanish language programming the two studies directly addressing minority ownershipstudy 7 and study 8 do not address minority programming at all perhaps what is most noteworthy about these 10 studies is that they highlight the large number of variables that may be relevant to full analysis of media ownership issues the following is partial list of variables that the researchers identified as relevant to their analyses station ownership and affiliation characteristics such as whether the station is owned by or affiliated with major broadcast network owned by large station group that does not also own network affiliated with nonmajor broadcast network coowned with one or more broa dcast stations in its local market cross owned with newspaper in its local market crossowned with cable system in its local market owned by provider of cable program network locally owned owned by minority or owned by female local market characteristics such as the number of broadcast stations television or radio in the market the size of the market in terms of population or advertising revenues generated market concentration the number of coowned stations in the market the number of crossowned media entities in the market demographic factors such as age race ethnicity english as second language income and education levels or the average commute time for radio quantitative measures of programming at both the station and the market level such as the amount of primetime and nonprimetime local news programming including and excluding sports and weather local public affairs programming national news programming national public affairs programming minority 24 often it is not possible priori to predict the likely relationship between specific ownership variable and programming market outcome for example on one hand one might expect the owner of multiple stations in market to have diverse programming on those statio ns to attract as many total viewerslis teners as possible on the other hand one might expect the owner of those stations to offer the same type of programming on all the stations in order to take advantage of cost savings from economies of scale or scope given such potentially conflicting market incentives it is not surprising that in most cases tests for relationship between an ownership variable and programming market outcome were not statistically significant still number of statistically significant relationships were identified though different studies sometimes had different findings or within single study slight difference in how model was specified yielded different result suggesting that the results were not very robust

programming adult programming general interest programming or spanish language programming measures of program quality such as program ratings and the amount of advertising shown on the programming which one researcher identified as negative measure of quality broadcast network programming sources such as whether the programming was produced by an affiliate of the broadcast network by an affiliate of competing broadcast network or by an independent studio cable network programming sources such as whether the programming was produced by an affiliate of the cable or satellite operator by an affiliate of major media company that does not have cable or satellite systems or by an independent program producer the cable tiers on which program networks are placed regulatory variables such as whether particular network is covered by must carry and retransmission consent requirements the studies showed that not all of these variables can be unambiguously defined and that at times

at the pew internet american life project concludes that the nielsen study represents credible effort but raises two significant issues worthy of note first the low response rate to the survey as well as certain survey design concerns may have generated sample that is more reflective of the behaviors and attitudes of welleducated and higherincome americans than of the public at large because high levels of income and education are positively correlated with interest in news and current affairs this may have substantive consequences on the surveys result 26 second according to horrigan inclusion in the questionnaire of question eliciting the specific internet news sites watched but not of analogous questions eliciting information on the specific broadcast cable or satellite news channels watched or the specific local or national newspapers read may constrain the usefulness of the survey data to address questions that may be relevant for the media ownership proceeding for example he claims the survey design may limit the ability of analysts to explore whether the internet is substitute or complement to traditional media

the main purpose of this study which was performed by members of the fcc staff was to assemble the most comprehensive possible data set concerning media ownership these data were used by researchers to perform some of the other studies the data cover the period 20022005 and update 2002 commission study that examined media ownership of various types cable satellite newspaper radio and television for 10 radio markets in 1960 1980 and 2000 and expands upon that study by adding data on the availability and penetration of internet access and by examining all designated market areas dmas not just 10 markets the focus of the study is data collection not data analysis although the effort generated many data tables that can provide the empirical basis for analysis the researchers primary task was to combine multiple data sets and then consolidate these metadatasets to the dma level data were collected on more than 1700 television stations 13500 radio stations 7800 cable systems and 1400 newspapers across four years for total of more than 100000 observations and more than 13 million data points the authors provide the caveats that they were unable to know with certainty the accuracy of every observation and that the final results could only be as accurate as the underlying data sets that they combined they believe the collected data give an accurate description of the various media for the fouryear period the authors list five findings media ownership was fairly stable over the 20022005 period in contrast to earlier periods which were characterized by substantial consolidation across most forms of media especially following enactment of the 1996 telecommunications act 26 also high levels of income and education are correlated with internet access

to grow since the previous report in 2005 cable and satellite operators combined served 835 of television households up from 803 in 2002 for broadcast television the data reveal slight increase in the number of stations and slight decrease in the number of owners the number of locally owned stations remained fairly constant the number of coowned television and radio stations increased by more than 20 minorityowned television stations fell by three stations from 20 in 2002 to 17 in 2005 out of more than 1700 television stations femaleowned television stations fluctuated slightly but ended in 2005 with the same number 26 as in 2002 for broadcast radio the number of stations increased moderately the number of owners decreased about 5 and the number of locally owned stations fell 37 coowned radiotelevision combinations increased 19 minorityowned radio stations increased less than 1 while femaleowned stations fell 69 the number of daily newspapers decreased slightly the number of newspaper owners decreased by about 8 and locally owned newspapers decreased by about 5 the number of samecity newspaperbroadcast combinations stayed the same the appendix uses aggregate data from the fcc form 323 on broadcast ownership to construct time series for 2001 through 2005 the data show that for that period there was substantial growth or decline in minority ownership of commercial radio stations increasing from 376 to 390 then falling to 371 and finally increasing to 378 over those years there was decline in minority ownership of commercial television stations from 20 to16 and then increasing to 17 but the author of the appendix raises concerns about the reliability of the minority ownership data which were constructed from noisy or incomplete data bases in 2003 the biennial filing deadlines became staggered tied to the anniversary date of each stations renewal application filing date so the data longer contain single snapshot of minority and female ownership for all stations in the industry that could be used benchmark for measuring industry ownership trends in addition stations whose licensees are sole proprietorships or partnerships comprised entirely of natural persons rather than corporate or business entities are exempt from the biennial filing requirement and need only submit such information voluntarily if they choose moreover in the initial years of filing the new biennial forms many stations failed to complete their forms correctly resulting in their re sponses to relevant question being om itted from an electronic ownership database review of station filings for 2001 suggests that the filings are not complete with respect to ownership information furthermore review of the ownership report data from all periods and the literature suggests that these data contain significant errors there is verification of form 323 data or quality control over the data the author concludes that form 323 data are inadequate for the purpose at hand but these data could be used to augment more reliable data at best we have extensive samples or virtual census of minority and female broadcast ownership data we do not have an actual census although perfect information on transactions and perfect base year would result in census we do not have statistical random samples in summary the data contain noise due to errors in the databases that were used to construct the data httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34271g22g145g142g561g8g5g5g514g156g561g343g342g561g5g152g150g150g146g156g156g146g152g151g142g141g561g7

asian owned commercial radio stations our estimate of 145 hispanic owned commercial radio stations our estimate of 6 native american owned commerci radio stations and our estimate of 5 native hawaiian owned commercial radio stations in light of the sbo data our estimate of the number of minority owned tv stations is reasonable the peer reviewer robert kieschnick associate professor and finance and managerial economics area coordinator at the university of texas at dallas commends the authors for the work that they expended in putting these data together as the source data are diverse and in some cases incomplete or subject to error he finds the methodology and assumptions employed are reasonable and technically appropriate the data used are reasonable and the conclusions about the pattern of changes in media ownership appear to follow from the data

g344g349g561 this study analyzes the relationship between the ow nership structure of television stations and the quantity and quality of certain television programming in the united states between 2003 and 2006 it focuses on seven types of programminglocal news and public affairs minority childrens family indecent violent and religiousidentifying alternative definitions used for each of these programming types it also uses two definitions of programming quality the number of households who choose to watch program as share of households that have access to that programming market rating definition and the number and length in minutes and seconds of advertisements included on the program using the assumption that households do not like advertising and that program quality therefore decreases as the amount of advertising increases the study uses the ownership data developed in study 2 the major findings of the study are broadcast television provides more news religious and violent programming than cable television cable television provides more public affairs childrens and adult programming than broadcast television niche or special interest programming minority adult religious is less widely available than general interest programming news childrens family program production andor availability is falling across time for network news though not local news public affairs family and religious programming and rising across time for latino childrens adult and more violent programming 27 on september 11 2007 gregory crawford was named chief economist of the fcc

programming types with latinospanishlanguage childrens and family programming substantially lower and nonlatino minority and religious programming lower still the relative quality in terms of ratings of news programming is declining as is the relative quality of certain measures of childrens programming but more violent programming is gaining affiliates of the four major broadcast television networks provide more advertising minutes at higher prices than do other broadcast television stations and this advantage appears to be increasing over time from the perspective of viewers this represents decline in program quality the strongest finding with respect to ownership structure relates to local news television stations owned by parent that also owns newspaper in the area offer more local news programming by some methods television stations owned by corporate parents with larger annual revenue also offer more local news but by other methods they offer less local ownership is correlated with more public affairs and family programming although there are differences in the amount of violent programming across network affiliates it does not appear to be correlated in an economically or statistically significant way with ownership structure effects of ownership structure on other programming types or on outcomes in the advertising market are either economically insignificant statistically insignificant or differ in their predicted effects according to the method of analysis the peer reviewer lisa m george assistant pr ofessor of economics at hunter college of the city university of new york finds that overall the study considers an interesting question with appropriate data and methods and should ultimately prove useful for policy purposes but she has three general comments with respect to the robustness of the analytical results while the regressions in the analytic portion of the study are consistent with standard econometric methods the paper does not include specifications that would demonstrate the robustness or reveal the fragility of regression results with respect to the relationship between the empirical estimates and conclusions the empirical analysis does not include cable television yet the paper discusses cable television at great length similarly the paper includes text and tables concerning viewership and ratings yet ratings data are included in the regressions the regressions also consider only primetime hours yet this caveat is rarely mentioned with respect to the theoretical assumptions about advertising the peer reviewer claims the assumption that advertising is inversely related to quality cannot be justified in light of existing economic theory an important idea in the economics literature on twosided markets is that advertising in media markets functions like price in other word s viewers pay for broadcast television with advertising minutes just as better steak costs more than lesser cut and thus commands higher price better television program typically costs more than weaker program and would be expected to command more not less advertising time

section of the study examines the relationship between the ownership characteristics of broadcast television stations and the quantity of news and public affairs programming they broadcast based on the scheduled news and publ ic affairs programming of almost all fullpower broadcast analog television stations in the us for two weeks in each year over the fouryear period 20022005 it uses modeling techniques to control for unobserved marketspecific broadcast networkspecific and timespecific factors28 and also to check for robustness of statistical results this section finds that certain ownership characteristics have statistically significant impact on the quantity of news programming provided by stations but most ownership characteristics do not have statistically significant impact on the provision of public affairs programming specifically televisionnewspaper crossownership is associated with 18 additional minutes 11 per day in news programming television stations that are owned and operated by one of the four major broadcast networks are associated with 22 additional minutes 13 per day of news programming television stations that have coowned television station in market are associated with 24 additional minutes 15 per day of news programming for stations that are owned by large stations groups but not by the four major networks each additional coowned station nationally tends to have quarter minute less of news programming per day local ownership of television station is associated with six minutes 4 less news programming per day televisonradio crossownership does not have statistically significant impact on the amount of news programming provided but is associated with an additional 3 minutes 15 of public affairs programming 28 for example it might be that news programming is especially popular in washington dc where government is the major industry so that all dc stations tend to provide lot of news programming but washington dc has more stations that are owned and operated by one of the four major broadcast networks than do other markets thus if the statistical analysis were not to account for the high leve l of demand for news in washington dc the results might overstate the relationship between network owned and operated stations and the amount of news programming provided

statistically significant impact on the provision of public affairs programming however higher parent revenues for station are associated with the provision of less public affairs programming the author provides several caveats about the analysis first despite the use of more than 6700 observations for more than 1700 stations the effective sample sizes are rather small for some of the variables of interestfor example only 30 television stations are jointly owned with newspaper for 120 observations second the analysis does not include cable channels and internet news programming the constant availability of news weather and sports programming on such cable channels as cnn fox news ms nbc the weather channel and espnews as well as internet news programming is likely to affect the audience interested in local broadcast stations news shows most likely reducing it third the analysis does not distinguish between local and nonlocal news programming even though the supply and demand factors involved may differ fourth the analysis addresses the quantity of news programming not its quality individual stations might choose to respond to demand for news programming by increasing the quality of programming provided rather than the quantity the peer reviewer philip leslie associate professor of economics and strategic management stanford graduate school of business identifies some noteworthy strengths of the datathere are large number of observations the panel structure allows for the use of various fixed effects to control for other factors that affect programming and there is high level of detail on programming and ownership he also identifies few important limitations to the data most of which are acknowledged in the study he concludes that the data are valuable and should be taken seriously but that while the limitations do not undermine the analysis they do lead to question the broader relevance of the findings one limitation that he identifies is the data include information on the number of viewers for each station or each television program and consequently each station is weighed equally in the analysis since we ultimately care about the impact on consumers and some stations are more important to consumers than others this presents limitation on the data

this section of the study examines the extent to which there is relationship between the ownership characteristics of radio station and the quantity of informational news and public affairs programming it broadcasts using data from sample of more than 1000 radio stations and appropriate control variables airplay data were collected for six 20minute segments for each station the econometric technique used produces two sets of results that must be considered jointly the change in the likelihood of airing news or public affairs programming and the change in the amount of news or public affairs pr ogramming that is aired if the station airs news or public affairs programming at all it is noteworthy that market characteristics such as market size length of commute time the audience share that is male the audience share that is minority income levels education levels age distribution etc explain greater amount of variation in the quantity of news and especially public affairs programming aired than station ownership variables the findings related to station ownership include as owners expand their radio operations by acquiring more radio stations either in or outofmarket the stations they own are more likely to air at least some

station may fall such that the overall quantity of news is not significantly affected these relationships hold whether looking at all news progra mming or only local news programming the geographic distance between the parent and the station does not significantly affect the quantity of news aired by stations in the group that might air news but it has negative and significant effect on the probability stations air any news at all these relationships hold whether looking at all news or only local news while it appears that stations that received waiver of fcc rules covering radio newspaper combinations are significantly more likely to air news and public affairs programming only three of the 1013 stations in the sample required such waiver and thus any inferences drawn from the parameter estimates for this covariate are essentially anecdotal radio station crossowned with an inmarket television station is less likely to air news programming than are other radio stations but if it does air news the quantity aired will be relatively larger than that of stations that are not cross owned the overall marginal effect is that inmarket television crossownership increases the expected quantity of news programming by about 110 seconds 31 these relationships are not statistically significant when looking only at local news as owners expand their radio operations by acquiring more radio stations either in or outofmarket the stations they own are more likely to air at least some public affairs programming and the quantity of public affairs programming aired on each station is likely to increase although neither of these relationships are statistically significant on their own the combined effects are significant since only 8 of the stations in the sample aired local public affairs programming during the six 20minute segments for which airplay data were collected the ability to draw meaningful inferences from those data is limited there are too few instances of radio crossownership with newspapers in the sample to draw meaningful inferences the peer reviewer scott savage assistant professor of economics at the university of colorado deems the methodology and assumptions reasonable and generally consistent with accepted theory and econometric practices but would like to see much stronger justification for the important ownership variables of interest in the model and clearer description of their expected signs this would also help make the results disc ussion clearer he finds the dataset would have to be augmented by other measures of market concentration if the study really wanted to make concrete conclusions about economies of scope and market power effects for example does it necessarily follow that large owner with many inmarket stations has more market share and market power than small owner with single inmarket station more importantly number of inmarket stations and total number of stations may be endogenous when they depend on the unobserved preferences of radio listeners ultimately more discussion andor evidence is required to make causal claims

format using arbitron data on the format choices of about 8000 radio stations between 2002 and 2005 and employing the fixed effects regression technique to take into account nonobservable factors that influence radio stations format choices instead of examining actual radio broadcasts as does section ii of this study this section considers stations format and assumes that news format radio stations broadcas t more news than stations with other formats this allows the researcher to collect data over time and to observe the format ramifications of stations that undergo ownership changes the format definitions used do not distinguish between local news programming and other news programming some of the findings of this section are although 65 of all fullpower radio stations broadcast in fm rather than am only about 25 of news stations broadcast in fm holding other factors constant am stations are six times more likely to be news stations than fm stations this is not surprising since am service offers soundquality that is inferior to that of fm and therefore is more likely to be used for nonmusic formats radio station that is crossowned with newspaper in the same market is four to five times more likely to be news station than radio station that is not crossowned radio station that is crossowned with television station in the same market is about twice as likely to be news station than noncrossowned station commercial stations are only about 25 as likely to adopt news format as noncommercial stations stations with local marketing agreement lmathe sale by the licensee of discrete blocks of time to broker who supplies the programming to fill that time and sells the commercial spot announcements in itmay be less likely to be news stations 29 review of this relationship for stations that newly enter an lma however suggests that entering into an lma may make station more likely to be news station but news stations may be less likely to enter into lmas having sibling news radio station in the market appears to increase stations propensity to adopt news format by about 50 radio stations with owners in the same dma appear to be more likely to be news stations than others but radio stations with owners in the same state appear to be significantly more likely to be news stations the peer reviewer scott savage assistant professor of economics at the university of colorado finds the methodology and assumptions reasonable and generally consistent with accepted theory and econometric practices and the data of sufficient quality for the econometric model employed but he finds that the study would benefit from more explicit description of the model more economic discussion of the choice of independent variables and their priori expectations and 29 this relationship was statistically insignificant for one definition of news format used by the researcher and statistically significant for the other definition used by the researcher but in both cases was negative httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34271g22g145g142g561g8g5g5g514g156g561g343g342g561g5g152g150g150g146g156g156g146g152g151g142g141g561g7

characteristics on the news operations of newspapers based on sample of 134 newspapers in the largest 60 designated market areas dmas for 14 randomly chosen days with the constraint that each day of the week is included twice in 2005 the local market is defined as the metropolitan statistical area msa rather than dma because the latter is geographically narrower and therefore more closely coincides with the circulation area of newspapers the absolute amount of space allocated for news in the general news section of the newspaper is used as quantity measure of news operations some of the findings of this section are there is observable relationship between newspapers news operations and crossownership with television station or radio station in the same market newspapers that are coowned with other newspapers within the same metropolitan statistical areas are associated with 5 decrease in the absolute amount of news provided but coowned newspapers outside the market have effect on news operations the level of newspaper concentration in the market as measured by the herfindahlhirshman index has effect on news operations belonging to joint operating agreement with another newspaper in the market has effect on newspapers news operations the peer reviewer philip leslie associate professor of economics and strategic management stanford graduate school of business finds that although the data come from multiple sources they are mainly well explained though focused on larger markets and thus not representative of all newspapers in the united states professor leslie finds it unclear how exactly the identity of which newspapers compete in which markets is assigned he indicates that although restricting the definition of news operations to the quantity of news in the general news section of newspaper is potentially troublesome since it can arbitrarily exclude valid news content in other parts of the newspaper nonetheless there is obviously right approach he proposes that there be some robustness checks on this issue he also states that since the data do not include source of exogenous variation in ownership structure it is less clear whether the analysis uncovers causal effect or mere corr elation finally professor leslie indicates that the data provided show positive relationship be tween coownership of newspapers in the same market and the percentage of total newspaper space news plus advertising taken up by news which he believes is at odds with the negative relationship between newspaper coownership and the absolute amount of news but he provides explanation why priori one should consider these results at odds

ownership structure on numerous different measures of program content30 advertising prices and listenership for nonsatellite broadcast radio using both descriptive and regression analyses it relies on data from number of different sources including the database on radio station programming that the fcc commissioned edison media research to construct in 2005 edison database station characteristic and demographic data from bna financial network bna fn ratings data from arbitron advertising cost data from sqad and additional demographic data from the us census bureau it performs analysis using marketlevel averages stationlevel averages and stationpair analysis as result it has literally thousands of statistical results that researchers can cull through most of the regressions do not show statistically significant relationships between the ownership variables and programming variables being tested which is not surprising given the breadth of variables covered among the study findings are the following if market size is not taken into account markets with greater ownership concentration offer fewer formats and have more pileup multiple stations with the same format but smaller markets have by definition fewer stations and have greater ownership concentration because the fccs media ownership rules permit owners to own larger fraction of st ations in smaller markets relative to bigger markets controlling for the number of stations and the interaction effects between number of stations and concentration concentration has statistically significant effect on the number of available formats however the results suggest that stations are more spread out across existing formats in more concentrated marketsconcentrated markets have significantly less pileup as measured by less format concentration these results are robust also markets with more stations have more formats and less pileup crossownership of radio stations with local newspapers andor local television stations does not appear to have noticeable effect on the number of formats or on format pileup markets with large number of radio stations owned by large national radio companies appear to have more formats and less pileup commonly owned stations in the same market are 5 more likely to have the same format than stations owned by different owners however this pattern is reversed when looking only at pairs of fm stations station ownership characteristics are less good predictors than market demographic factors of whether stations in market will offer the same format 30 these measures include format counts format concentration percentage of station airplay devoted to music percentage of station airplay devoted to news percentage of station airplay devoted to sports percentage of station airplay devoted to talk entertainment percentage of station airplay devoted to advertising advertisements by day part percentage of station programming that is live percentage of station programming that is networksyndicated and voicetracked number of syndicated programs and number of onair personalities these various measures of programming are intended to provide information relevant to the

other stations to have the same format in large markets consolidation of ownership has statistically significant effect on any of the format measures in small markets consolidation is associated with fewer formats operating in market with other comm only owned stations does not have statistically significant effect on how station is programmed newspaperradio crossownership is ssociated with longer blocks of uninterrupted talk in the morning drive time slot and longer blocks of uninterrupted news programming in the evening stations that have large national owners offer more syndicated programs and spend greater percentage of airtime on networksyndicated programming national ownership is associated with statistically significant negative effect on length of an uninterrupted block of music in the evening commonly owned stations in different markets are programmed more similarly than separately owned stations in different markets there appears to be minimal association between radionewspaper or radio television crossownership in market and radio programming analysis of more than 10 programming content variables yields only rare examples of statistically significant relationships and those are small in magnitude local radio consolidation is associated with 4 less music 3 less local programming 3 less live programming and 18 less news programming in the evening though this last effect is estimated from sample of only fm stations all else equal radio stations in concentrated markets offer substantially longer segments of uninterrupted sports programming in the evening the pattern of results suggests that this expanded offering is offset with shorter segments of news programming in the evening commonlyowned news stations in the same market overlap in 1422of their programming and commonlyowned news stations in different markets overlap in 814 of their programming depending on the measure of overlap commonlyowned sports stations in the same market have overlap in their programming and commonlyowned sports stations in different markets have overlap in 59 of their programming the overlap in programming across commonlyowned news stations is statistically significant and there may be more overlap within markets than across markets there is statistically significant overlap in sports programming for commonlyowned stations either within or across markets this result likely reflects practices in the underlying sports broadcast rights market where live often local sporting event typically is broadcast by single radio station within radio

negative effect on advertising prices radio crossownership with television in market has statistically significant positive effect on advertising prices in large markets across number of specifications but not in small markets consolidation in local radio markets has statistically significant effect on average listening to radio listeners served by large radio groups as measured by the number of commercial stations owned nationally by inmarket owners listen more all else equal concentration in large markets is associated with lower average station ratings suggesting that listeners in large markets are not tuning in as much as listeners in small markets stations operating in markets with other commonly owned stations achieve higher ratings than independent stations crossownership of radio stations with local newspapers has statistically significant positive effect on listenership there are other statistically significant effects of ownership structure on listenership the peer reviewer andrew sweeting assistant professor of economics at duke university finds the econometric analysis simple and the specifications explained in transparent way that should make the results straightforward to replicate he offers one general caveatthese results reflect correlations in the data between ownership and programming and there is direct evidence of causal effects professor sweeting also offers several specific caveats when coefficient is identified as being st atistically significant at the 5 level that means that if there was really statistical correlation between the outcome variable and the explanatory variable one would nonetheless expect to see t statistic as large as the one reported less than 5 of the time thus when seeing thousands of coefficients one should expect some of them to be statistically significant even when there is true correlation therefore at minimum reviewers of the data results should attach importance to patterns that are robust across several specifications as these are more likely to indicate true correlations although many of the regressions are repeated with and without controls for market demographics since those demographics may provide reason for differences in programming for example one would expect fewer urban and gospel stations in markets with smaller africanamerican populations the results that do not take into account the demographics should be ignored for the analysis based on stationpairs when creating pairs the number of observations tends to increase dramatically which tends to lead conventionally calculated standard errors to fall and the coefficients to appear to be more significant than they may actually be thus one has to be careful when discussing statistical significance in the edison data base different stations were monitored on different days and this could give misleading impressions of programming overlap for example some common owners switch syndicated shows across stations in the same httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34271g22g145g142g561g8g5g5g514g156g561g343g342g561g5g152g150g150g146g156g156g146g152g151g142g141g561g7

on both stations even though they were never available on both stations on the same day which seems the more relevant criterion for overlap the study presents many different measures of programming but some may be more relevant for policy than others for example it may be important to know how ownership affects the number of commercials played or the amount of local news programming but it is less clear that the balance of music and dj banter or whether the banter comes in long or short blocks matters

this study examines whether crossownership of newspaper and television station influences the content or slant of local television news broadcasts by comparing the late evening local news broadcasts of 29 crossowned television stations located in 27 different markets with those of their major networkaffiliated competitors in the same market for three evenings in the week prior to the november 2006 election in total 312 late evening local newscasts were recorded for total of 104 stations and these recordings were coded and analyzed for local news content and political slant the study findings include local television stations broadcast approximately 26 minutes of total news coverage 31 with about 80 of this time devoted to local stories however fair amount of local news is devoted to sports and weather local news excluding sports and weather accounts for less than half of total broadcast news time state and local political coverage averages just less than three minutes per newscast during the week under study the newscasts of television stations that are crossowned with newspapers are associated with one or two more minutes of total news coverage 47 than those of noncrossowned stations but radio crossownership and other ownership and network characteristics s uch as network affiliation or parent company household coverage are not significant determinants of total news coverage the newscasts of television stations that are crossowned with newspapers are associated with 80 to100 seconds 68 more local news coverage including sports and weather than those of noncrossowned stations after accounting for timeslot effects none of the other ownership variables are significant although the affiliates of oldline networks nbc cbs and abc offer several minutes 31 although most stations broadcast 30 minute news program some broadcast onehour news program so the sum of total news and nonnews content exceeded 30 minutes

cw and mynetwork the pattern of results is very similar for local news coverage excluding sports and weather except that the positive association between televisionnewspaper crossownership and the amount of local content is largely mitigated these results suggest that television stations crossowned with newspapers offer significantly more sports and weather coverage than their noncrossowned counterparts but less of other local news televisionnewspaper crossownership is positively but not significantly associated with the amount of state and local political coverage in newscasts but televisionradio crossownership is significantly associated with an 80 to 100 second reductionabout 50 reductionin the amount of state and local political coverage in newscasts parent companies with greater household coverage also provide significantly more state and local political news as do fox network affiliates the amount of time allotted to state and local political candidates speaking for themselves is about 10 seconds 40 greater on the newscasts of television stations that are crossowned with newspapers than on the newscasts of non crossowned stations similarly crossowned television stations offer about 20 seconds 30 more coverage of state and local political candidates than non crossowned stations while fox affiliat show between 30 to 45 seconds more candidate coverage other ownership or network controls are not significantly associated with these measures of political coverage the amount of time allotted to the coverage of partisan issues the author identifies 12 issues that he categorizes as democratic issues and 10 issues that he categorizes as republican issues based on examining party and candidate websites in the week before the general election does not vary by crossownership status nor does the amount of time allotted to covering the results of political opinion polls however both cbs and nbc affiliates devote substantially less time to opinion polls compared to other networks based on four measures of partisan slantdifferences in speaking time allowed to candidates of each party differences in time spent covering the candidates of each party differences in time spent covering issues identified as republican or democratic and differences in time spent on opinion polls favoring one party or the otherit appears that both crossowned and noncrossowned stations allocate political coverage fairly evenly on every measure though the cross owned stations exhibit slight and insignificant republicanleaning slant however professor milyo provides the caveat that there is baseline for determining whether coverage is appropriately balanced or not and therefore inferences about balance should be made based upon the absolute value of any of these measures for three of the four measures of partisan slant there appears to be significant positive association between the democratic voting preferences in the local electorate in 2004 as measured by the vote percentage in the 2004 presidential election for john kerry and democratic slant in the 2006 newscasts of the local stations this result implies that partisan slant is determined at least in part by demand market forcesstations catering to the voting preference of viewers in their newscasts

whether cross owned stations have some impact on their market as whole the peer reviewer matthew gentzkow assistant professor of economics at the university of chicago graduate school of business finds the authors multiple regression analysis methodology reasonable but initially was unable to replicate the results because of what was determined after discussion with the author to be two errors in the coding of the data set used to produce the original results after correcting for these errors the peer reviewer still could not replicate some of the results he nonetheless concludes that my impression from having worked with the data is that the corrections are unlikely to change either the direction or the statistical significance of the coefficients of primary interest professor gentzkow states the data collected for this study represent significant advance the data give rich finegrained picture of the news coverage of local television stations unlike anything that was available before the sample selection criteria make sense and maximize the power of the withinmarket comparisons the author makes an obvious caveat is that the data cover only three days in november 2006 the differences found may or may not be similar to differences that would be found in other periods the author acknowledges this issue clearly professor gentzkow explains that coding the content of news broadcast is challenging and inherently subjective but states that the author focused primarily on measures such as minutes of news in particular categories that are welldefined easy to interpret and potentially replicable though the procedure for identifying the partisan issues used to measure political slant was more subjective than some of the other measures 32 professor gentzkow raises one concern with the results as reported all of the specifications of primary interest include both main effect of the newspapercrossownership variable and an interaction between this variable and the radiocrossownership variable the conclusions as reported are based on the main effect coefficients without taking account of the interaction this means that the reported differences apply only to the subset of stations that are not crossowned with radio rather than to the sample as whole

this study examines the data collected in the 2002 survey of business owners sbo to identify the extent of female and minority ownership in the radio television and newspaper industries in the united states and to provide direct comparison with the broader universe of us 32 it should be noted that the choice of measure for political slant is the most controversial aspect of this study and that professor gentzkow has performed several studies of political slant in the media using the types of measures of political slant used by professor milyo in the study professor milyo states i follow gentzkow and shapiro in using speaking time of candidates as one metric for partisan slant i also use several measures that are very similar in spirit to those employed by gentzkow and shapiro in particular time devoted to all candidate coverage time devoted to issues favored by one party or the other and time devoted to po lls favoring one party or the other thus some critics have claimed that professor gentzkow cannot provide an objective peer review

fcc should proceed in analyzing minority and female ownership of medi enterprises the authors emphasize that due to the nature and quality of the available data they are not able to reach strong conclusions so their recommendations should be viewed more as points of discussion than prescriptive for policy the study finds based on the most complete data source available the 2002 sbo minorities and females are underrepresented in the three industries relative to their proportion of the us population though these patterns hold across the broad run of industries as well approximately 511 of the us popula tion is female but women own only 1401 of radio stations 1368 of television stations 2025 of newspapers and 1774 of all nonfarm businesses approximately 1340 of the us population is hispanic but hispanics own only 371 of radio stations 604 of television stations 158 of newspapers and 385 of all nonfarm businesses approximately 1268 of the us population is black but blacks own only 435 of radio stations 489 of television stations 244 of newspapers and 182 of all nonfarm businesses approximately 122 of the us populati on is american indian but american indians own only 017 of radio stations television stations 100 of newspapers and 047 of all nonfarm businesses approximately 441 of the us population is asian but asians own only 227 of radio stations and 324 of newspapers asians own 603 of television stations and 621 of all nonfarm businesses the figures listed above are for nonpubliclytraded enterprises if publicly traded companies were included the ownership shares of women hispanics blacks american indians and asians would be slightly lower since the observed ownership asymmetries are economywide they are undoubtedly linked to broad systematic factors not specific to these particular industries while full accounting of the causes of these systematic trends is beyond the scope of this analysis it appears that access to capital is primary cause of underrepresentation for minorities this is suggested by review of the market shares of the top 4 top 8 top 20 and top 50 firms in full set of industries for which data are available the concentration ratios in the information category and specifically in radio and television broadcasting are very high which is indicative of high barriers to entry most likely in the form of capital requirements review of the rvey of consumer finances conducted every three years by the us federal reserve shows that the ratio of median net worth between whites and nonwhites was about 66 and the average ratio of mean net worth between whites and nonwhites was 35 thus minorities on average have significantly less personal capital at their command to meet the capital requirements of media enterprise deeper analysis with more data would be needed to address the position of females

crude and subject to large enough degree of measurement error to render it essentially useless for any serious analysis the author makes the following recommendations the fcc should take steps to improve its data collection process strong effort should be made to ensure full consistent and accurate reporting of ownership status and its composition as long run endeavor information on minority and female ownership should be carefully tracked and integrated into the main firm database in coherent fashion currently the fcc simply flags as minority or femaleowned any firm with greater than 50 female or minority ownership this information is maintained as separate and incomplete spreadsheet that is not linked to the broad census of firms firms should be classified not only by race and gender but also by whether the company is publicly traded or privately owned efforts also should be made to track the demographics of minority as well as majority stakeholders more broadly the fcc should further examine the rationale behind this exercise the commission should ask whether there are quantifiable benefits to increasing minority and female ownership and how ownership policies affect change to what extent media content is driven by demand that is consumer preferences for certain types of programming or for slanted news coverage rather than supply that is owner preferences whether owner preference can only be imposed through controlling interest rather than minority interest whether publicly traded firms feel pressure to be broadly representative in their programming how nontraditional media such as the internet change the debate the peer reviewer bd mccullough professor of decision sciences at drexel university states that the fcc should have contracted with the authors to do fullblown study of the problem rather than simply conduct small and perfunctory analysis he states this issue requires sophisticated analysis that might show the extent to which the ownership disparity is explained by such relevant variables as education and industry experience in the absence of such analysis all the disparity is incorrectly attributed to the single factor of race or gender moreover the minority categories are too aggregatedfor example hispanics lumps together puerto ricans mexicans and cubans despite overwhelming evidence that these groups are remarkably dissimilar in terms of mean education income health etc professor mccullough questions the authors claim that lack of access to capital is primary cause of underrepresentation for minorities since the analysis does not include education work experience or any of host of other variables the actual assertion of link between race and access to capital would require great deal of additional work with respect to the authors recommendation that the fcc track and integrate information on minority and female into the main firm database professor mccullough states the authors should have offered their considered opinion on how to define the variables they want collected

relaxation of the television duopoly rule on minority and female ownership of television broadcast stations in 1996 that rule was amended to allow the ownership of two television stations in certain markets provided only one of the two was vhf station the overlapping sign als of the coowned stations originated from separate though contiguous markets and the acquired station was economically failing or failed or not yet built because the fcc did not begin collecting data on the race and gender of broadcast station owners until 1998 the period studied was 1999 to 2006 the study does not provide econometric analysis rather it 1 identifies the transactions resulting in television duopolies that could not have occurred before the rule change and 2 determines the number of commercial broadcast television stations that were purchased or sold by minority or women owners in markets in which television duopoly was introduced that could not have existed before the rule change the study finds from 1999 to 2006 the relaxation of the duopoly rule did not appear to have positive impact on minority and female ownership of television stations instead the major beneficiaries were the largest 25 television broadcast station owners the relaxation of the duopoly rule codified the existing contractual relationship local management agreements or lmas between group station owners and the stations they managed lmas allowed television broadcasters that were not allowed to be jointly owned to combine their operations to reduce their costs by sharing staff andor programming to expand their market reach by combining signal coverage to increase their advertising revenue shares by controlling access to larger percentage of desirable market segment andor providing more opportunities to air programming some group station owners leveraged their control of lmas into control of access to attractive syndicated programming as well as access to programming affiliated with emerging networks the broadcast group owners that benefitted from the relaxation of the duopoly rule were primarily the largest broadcast group owners those in the top 25 based on revenue national market reach andor number of stations owned as of 2005 they accounted for 83 of the 109 76 duopolies identified many of the group owners that managed sister lma stations acquired those stations outright once the duopoly rule was relaxed

dissolved since there were preexisting minorityowned duopolies there were surviving minorityowned duopolies across all markets in which minorityowned television stations operated between 1999 and 2006 the number of minorityowned television stations dropped by 27 within markets entered andor occupied by television duopolies the number of minorityowned stations dropped by more than 39 by contrast in nonduopoly markets the number of minorityowned stations dropped by 10 the duopolies created in markets in which femaleowned television stations operated were nonfemale owned since there were preexisting femaleowned duopolies there were femaleowned television duopolies 36 of the femaleowned stations operating in duopoly markets were sold all of the stations were sold to nonfemale nonminority owners femaleowned stations were more likely to be found in nonduopoly markets in addition the study presents but does not analyze number of hypotheses about the relationship between the revised duopoly rule and minorityfemale ownership that have some logical appeal but remain untested and unproven for example it presents an argument made in 1992 by minority broadcaster who was concerned that increasing ownership caps or loosening duopoly rules would reduce opportunities for minority ownership 33 that broadcaster claimed that relaxation of ownership rules in 1985 caused an increased demand for stations that were attractive as second television properties in market and the resulting sharp increase in station prices placed minorityowned stations in double jeopardythey couldnt afford to trade up to the better facilities and the stations against which they were competing were rapidly becoming parts of large broadcast groups capable of bringing significant economies of scale to the market this argument on its face appears reasonable but on its own does not demonstrate how significant the relationship is between the dua l ownership rule and minority ownership during the time period cited by the minority broadcaster the fccs old minority tax certificate program 34 was in place and appeared to be successfully fostering the sale of broadcast properties to minority owners35 the dual ownership rule was loosened in 1996 just one year after congress eliminated the tax certificate program the authors found that minority ownership has fallen significantly since 1999 the first year that data on minority and womenownership were available but they do not perform analysis that helps determine how much of that decline is attributable to the 33 see study 8

the tax certificate program and how much to other factors the peer reviewer bd mccullough professor of decision sciences at drexel university states this report is fatally flawed by fundamental logical error that pervades every aspect of the analysis referring to finding in the study that minorityowned stations were four times more likely to be sold in duopoly markets than in nonduopoly market professor mccullough states in the context of their report their obvious implication is that the existence of duopoly is the reason that minority stations were observed to be sold more frequently in duopoly markets rather than in the nonduopoly markets this could only be logically inferred if the duopoly and nonduopoly markets were identical in all other respects which the authors did not show because they could not show this since the markets are not identical some effort must be made to control for the differences between the duopoly and nonduopoly markets there exists wide variety of statistical and econometric techniques to control for th differences yet the authors employ not single one the authors had access to the bia database and could easily have made some effort to control for confounding variables that the authors did not bother to control for confounding variables completely vitiates their analysis of minorityowned stations the same is true for the womenowned portion of their report the authors do document that the number of minority andor womenowned broadcast stations changed during this time their error is to attribute this change solely to the relaxation of the duopoly rule without consideration of any simultaneously occurring economic or demographic phenomena it may well be true that the duopoly rule relaxation was the cause of the decline in the number of minorityowned andor womenowned broadcast stations but the authors have not provided any evidence thereof there was another economic study addressing the television duopoly rule submitted in the proceeding in its reply comments the national association of broadcasters nab included december 2006 study entitled the declining financial position of television stations in medium and small markets 36 which provides financial data to support its contention that relaxation of this rule to permit coownership of television stations in smaller markets would provide needed financial relief to television broadcasters and allow television stations to compete more effectively with cable operators and other multichannel video programming distributors the study examines the profitability of television stations in markets 51175 for the data years 1997 2001 2003 and 2005 it finds profit margins are already at risk today especially for the lower rated affiliated stations it

are also now at stage where the average low rated station experienced act ual losses declining network compensation coupled with increasing news expenses adds to the tenuous financial situation of these small market stations it concludes that as this study demonstrates relaxation of the television duopoly rule to permit common ownership of two stations in sm aller markets would provide needed relief for these struggling stations thereby increasing the strength of local television the nab study is based on selective choice of data it uses only the financial data for odd numbered years omitting the data for evennumbered years when political advertising generally adds to the revenues of television stations without imposing comparable costs television station profitability tends to be higher in evennumbered years given that station revenues and profitability follow relatively predictable cyclical pattern it is appropriate to analyze data that incorporates the entire cycle not just the predictably lower performance period in the cycle to determine the real financial health of the industry the nab study therefore appears to be biased 37

this study examines the prevalence of vertical integration in television programming presenting findings relating to whether integrated producers systematically discriminate against independent content in favor of their own content it separately addresses primetime broadcast programming and cable network carriage its focus is on the impact of vertical integration on independent programmerswhether broadcast networks discri minate against programming they do not have an ownership stake in and whether cable and satellite operators discriminate against cable networks they do not have an ownership stake in it attempts to measure this by performing regression analysis on the ratings of and advertising revenues generated by inhouse and independent programming carried by vertically integrated broadcast networks if the ratings for andor advertising revenues generated by their inhouse programming is consistently lower than those of the independently produced programming that they carry that would suggest that they favor their own programming even when it is ss sought out by viewers similar analysis is performed for cable networks focusing on the number of subscribers and viewers of and on subscriber fees and advertising revenues generated by the vertically integrated and independent cable networks carried by mvpds this study does not address another issue related to vertically 37 the nab study is one of submissions that the fcc had peer reviewed the peer reviewer robert kieschnick associate professor and the finance and managerial economics area coordinator

position strategically by refusing to make their inhouse must have programming available to competing distributors38 the principal findings of the study are using four different measures of vertical integration in each case the data document that large fractiontypically the majorityof the programming on any broadcast network during primetime was made inhouse the distribution of independently produced programsthose with affiliation with network company at allis fairly evenly spread across the networks while the programs produced by production companies that have an ownership tie with network are overwhelmingly more likely to be broadcast on their affiliated network from the perspective of how many people watch particular program on the margin there is little evidence that independently produced primetime broadcast programming differs from inhouse programming in the same time slot just as many people watch one as watch the other but from the perspective of programs total advertising revenue vertically integrated primetime broadcast programs perform worse than independent ones independent shows in the same time slot and the same season must have 16 greater advertising revenues to get on the air even controlling for the demographic characteristics of the audience the advertising revenues on the margin are significantly lower for the vertically integrated shows than for independent programming consistent with them being held to lower standard than the independents the noninhouse programming aired by broadcast network can be produced by an entirely independent program producer or by program producer that has an ownership affiliation with another broadcast network when this distinction is taken into account on the margin the vertically integrated programs have 25 less advertising revenues and the fully independent programs have 23 less than programs made by production companies with ownership ties to rival broadcast networks this result suggests that costbased efficiency explanation for vertical integrationthat networks apply lower standard to their own programs because they can make them more cheaplyprobably will not suffice those efficiencies would not exist when the programming is truly independently produced and thus one would expect the networks to require independent programming to generate more advertising revenues than inhouse programming to gain network carriage that the netw orks appear to demand approximately the same amount of advertising revenue generation suggests that efficiencies from inhouse production is small 38 must have programming refers to programming for which significant number of mvpd subscribers have such strong intensity of demand that they would not subscribe to an mvpd service that does not carry that programming although demand varies somewhat from geographic market to geographic market examples of programming that often is categorized as must have are major sports programming and the programming of local broadcast stations affiliated with major networks

generated by truly independent programming and programming produced by companies with ownership affiliations with rival networks may reflect that rival networks have more bargaining power over syndication revenue revenues generated by the programming when it is longer aired on primetime network television if broadcast network cant get part of the syndication profits from the programs producer it may require that show to generate higher advertising revenue to put it on the air with respect to cable program networks there are networklevel data on the performance of channels nationally and systemlevel information about what networks system carries but there are not systemlevel data on network performance so the evidence is more suggestive than the evidence available on the broadcast networks the concentration on national basis of the largest mvpds has grown over time with the considerable consolidation of cable and the rapid growth of dbs on marketbymarket basis however the opposite has occurred each market has gone from virtual monopoly for the local cable franchise to market where the cable franchise shares the market with the two major dbs providers and now there is beginning to be entry in some markets from the two major telephone companies tt and verizon of the top 15 cable networks as measured by the size of their primetime audience the share of vertically integrated networksdefined as networks that have an ownership affiliation with an mv pd but excluding networks that have an ownership affiliation with major media company that does not own an mvpd such as disney or viacomhas been falling over time from eight in 1997 to four in 2005 the share of cable networks owned at least in part by an mvpd fell from 40 in 1996 to 20 in 2005 but many of the cable networks without any mvpd ownershi p are owned by giant media companies it is difficult to find single major cable network owned by someone other than major media conglomerate there is very small negative effect of vertical integration on the number of subscribers cable channel has when channel goes from being independent to being owned by an mvpd it loses subscribers but there is small positive effect of vertical integration on the subscriber growth rate when channel goes from being independent to being owned by an mvpd its subscriber growth rate increases by small amount looking at the subset of networks where there are data on the number of viewers as well as the number of subscribers holding the number of subscribers constant the number of viewers actually watching the channel falls when it becomes vertically integrated looking at the impact of becoming vertically integrated on the amount of license revenue the cable network gets from the distribution systems and the amount of advertising revenue it generates that is the two sources of revenues for the programming and the amount spent on programming that is the cost of providing the programming there is very little evidence that vertical integration of channel has any noticeably beneficial impact on revenues or costs the same network performs exactly as well before and after it is vertically integrated

efficiencies of vertical integration flow only to startup networks not to well established ones analysis also was performed for the subset of networks that were started since 1997 results for these younger networks showed major differences from the results for all networks there is evidence that when new networks become vertically integrated it increases subscribers or changes their subscriber growth rates excluding the major vertically integrated cable network that are carried on virtually all major cable systems and focusing instead on 11 wholly or partially vertically integrated basic cable networks that have carriage rates between 5 and 90 nine of those cable networks showed evidence that cable systems are significantly more likely to carry the cable network if they have an ownership interest in the network but for nine of the 11 networks the higher the dbs share in the local market the more attenuated that relationship becomes for those nine the interaction of vertical integration with the dbs share has significant negative coefficient this evidence suggests perhaps an explanation for vertical integration rooted in competitive pressures rather than efficiencies the dbs share that makes the vertical integration effect equal to zero averages around 2025 thus for at least subset of the networks there is evidence consistent with the view that dbs competition reins in the ability of cable systems to use vertically integrated position to promote their own channels at the network level there is little evidence that vertically integrated cable networks attract more subscribers grow faster raise more advertising revenues or licensing fees or have lower programming costs the peer reviewer david waterman professor indiana university department of telecommunications generally finds the regression analysis used in the broadcast portion of the study to be valid methodology but he states the results of this regression must be regarded as suggestive rather than conclusive at least in the absence of more detailed vetting of the results robustness to alternative model specifications as the report acknowledges program profits rather than revenues are the desired measure and meaningful cost measures are not available he indicates that there are large differences in primetime program costs by program format eg sitcom variety drama as well as by netw ork that may not be captured by the model and could thus bias or invalidate the results with respect to the cable portion of the study professor waterman notes that the overwhelming majority of independent cable networks successfully launched in the period of the study are owned by affiliates of large media conglomerates who do not have cable system interests which implies that the financial resources or bargaining leverage in common to the large corporations which also own numerous other established networks rather than vertical integration itself may be the most significant advantage that successful cable network suppliers now have he states that the study uses regression techniques that show vertical integration to have little or positive effect on cable network performance bu t in my opinion this regression analysis while interesting and suggestive employs methodology that makes interpretation of the results questionable the primary measure of vertical integration in the studythe ratio of the total national subscriber base of the mvpd that owns the network to the networks national total of subscribershas some desirable characteristics but it is difficult to interpret because it combines in one functional form three separate aspects of vertical integrations potential effects the fact of integration itself the influence of mvpd size and the variations of influence

understand the effects of integration per s professor waterman finds the models and estimation methods used in the analysis of the 11 basic cable networks with between 5 and 90 national market penetration are valid and the authors conclusions are reasonable but he states that the study does not address the effects of vertical integration on the carriage of independently owned networks and does not consider whether the various integrated networks or their nonintegrated rivals are carried on basic tiers or on generally less accessible digital tiers

10956 during the same time period the number of owners declined 39 from 5133 to 3121 the decline in the number of owners reflects continuation of the consolidation of the commercial radio industry

radio companies realizing larger gross profits but netting less than the typical sp firm suggests that radio companies either are paying more in taxes than other firms are or are paying more in interest than other firms that is using more debt to finance operations debt as percentage of total capital represents measure of firms debt load and is the typical measure of firms relative use of debt capital vs equity capital the publicly traded radio companies have generally used more debt than the typical sp 500 company to finance operations and growth therefore the radio companies lower net profit margins result at least in part from the greater interest expense of these companies another effect of the greater debt loads leverage is the increase in the volatility of radiosector earnings compared to the lessleveraged sp 500 companies this increase in volatility is seen by comparing the variability of the radiosector median ebit margin and net profit margin values with those of the sp 500 firms publicly traded radio companies debt as percentage of capital declined over time until the third quarter of 2004 approaching the debt load of typical sp 500 company however since then the ratio of debt to total capital for publicly traded radio companies has increased significantly and remains well above the sp benchmark fixed charge coverage after taxes is measure of firms ability to pay its interest expense out of its net income this is measured as the ratio of quarterly net income before extraordinary items divided by interest expense from which 1 is subtracted the ratio measures how many times the interest expense is covered by the companys net income which provides sense of the companys ability to manage its debt load while not generating the same level of net income to interest expense as other companies the publicly traded radio companies appear to be generating enough cash flow to meet their interest obligations fixed charge coverage for radio stations remains positive for all quarters except the first and third quarters of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002 fixed charge coverage rose substantially after the first quarter of 2002 for the radio sample and after the first quarter of 2003 for the sp 500 the market to book ratio is defined as the ratio of firms market value of equity which is the accounting value that remains of firms assets after the firm pays off its creditors the market to book ratio is useful measure of the markets assessment of that firms future prospects until the year 2000 the market placed higher valuations on radio properties and operations than those of other companies such as those reflected in the sp 500 median market to book values the market to book ratios of the radio companies exceeded those of the sp 500 companies in all 17 quarters before 2000 however in the first quarter of 2000 the median market to book ratio for the study sample of radio companies dropped below that of the median sp company and has remained below the sp level ever since this seems to suggest that the market value of radio companies relative to book value had declined relative to the sp 500 quarterly stock market returns of the publicly traded radio and sp 500 companies are calculated by including their cash dividends in the return calculation this return measure reflects both stock price appreciation and the

the typical radio companys returns have varied more than those of the typical sp company radio company stocks overall outperformed the broader market as reflected in the sp 500 median stock returns in most quarters until the year 2000 the greater volatility of the radio companies stock market returns is related to the greater leverage of greater use of debt by these companies but stock returns for radio companies declined sharply throughout 2000 and 2001 beginning in 2002 radio companies stock market returns bounced back relative to the sp 500 even exceeding it in some quarters since 2004 the radio companies seem to have underperformed the sp 500 the decline in stock returns in 2000 and 2001 likely was the result of the slowing economy during that time revenues in radio depend exclusively on advertising and firms willingness to advertise is highly sensitive to how much consumers are buying the percent change in retail sales and food services adjusted for inflation fell sharply beginning in the second quarter of 2000 retail sales growth rates while somewhat volatile have rebounded from the 2001 trough but have not reached the peak growth rates of 1999 possible source for radios stock decline may be the slowing of the radio industrys consolidation as opportunities for increased profit through radio acquisitions have dwindled investors have placed lower value on the radio industry depressing the value of the radio industrys stock the trend in the average number of listeners to radio per quarter hour has continued to fall since 2002 from autumn 1998 to autumn 2006 arbitron reports that the average number of listeners per quarter hour has fallen from approximately 197 million to 184 million drop of 66 while listenership declined slightly between autumn 1998 and autumn 2000 listener ratings held steady between the summer of 2000 and the early portion of 2005 during 2005 however radio listenership appears to have taken another substantial dip between autumn 1998 and autumn 2006 the average annual decline in the average number of listeners per quarter hour is 082 average radio advertising prices have increased since september 1996 from 1996 to 2002 radio advertising prices increased steadily in excess of the consumer price index cpi radio advertising prices dipped between 2002 and 2004 before continuing to increase the dip in prices was probably lagged response to the sharp decline in growth in retail sales overall it appears that the cost of radio advertising has nearly doubled since the 1996 act was passed by contrast the cpi increased 29 during the same period in other words the cpi increased approximately 3 per year during this time period while the annual growth rate in radio advertising prices was approximately 10 radio consolidation may have an effect on radio advertising prices if advertisers have fewer radio owners to bargain with over prices consolidation in the radio industry may allow radio companies to

reviewers or by the consumer commenters themselves and were run using the data from the fcc studies the consumer commenters state that one of th positive externalities of the 10 studies is the creation of usable data set for the public to use to conduct policy analysis of its own but once they perform their own analysis the consumer commenters claim that once definitions are corrected and

only at the station level rather than at the market level at the market level crossownership results in the loss of an independent voice as well as decline in marketwide news production this finding

the consumer commenters present number of criticisms of the fcc studies some of these involve relatively narrow technical matters of model specification that are unrelated to whether the models address the right policy issues but may have significant implications for the statistical analysis40 these criticisms should be addressed by expert econometricians capable of vetting their seriousness41 other criticisms raise fundamental questions about whether the models in the fcccommissioned studies address the right policy issues or are constructed in fashion that allows the statistical results to be unambiguously interpreted here are few of the consumer commenters policyrelated criticisms

fccsponsored studies address the effect of crossownership on the local news output of the crossowned stations rather than the effect on the local news output in the entire market from the standpoint of the individual citizen it is the total amount of available news and the diversity of independent voices offering that news in the entire market that matters while in some cases there may be an increase in news output at the individual crossowned station although much of this is sports and weather examining the question at the market level reveals decline in the total output of local news for the market as whole it is possible for crossownership to lead to increased local news programming by the cross owned station but decreased local news programming for the overall market for example cross ownership might reduce the news production costs or increase the advertising revenues of the crossowned station thus fostering more spending by that crossowned station on local news programming but at the same time reduce the advertising revenues and news audience for competing stations thus discouraging them from providing local news programming the latter effect could be greater than the former resulting in less total local news programming

effects should be included to relax the assumption that time period effects are equal across all markets and that in studies 3 4 and 6 the models should be run with parent fixedeffects 41 the

those that have been created subsequently through the waiver process tvnewspaper combinations with waivers involve the recent entry of tv station into crossownership situation the owners bought the news operation they did not create it to claim that the behavior of the acquired stations reflects the effects of crossownership is simply incorrectin the form of an error of confusing correlation with causation cross ownership did not create the behavior since the grandfathered situations have been in place for long period of time it is much more reasonable to argue that the behavior of the tv stations in those combinations reflects th longterm effect of crossownership the waived crossownership situations have been created recently primarily by the merger of highly rated tv stations in large competitive markets with dominant newspapers the acquired stations produced more news before they merged and lacking time series data the analysis claim benefits of crossownership that just reflect the acquisition of station that already did more news the stations that entered into crossownership combinations in recent years subject to waiver were in less co ncentrated larger markets with higher market shares the newly minted tvnewspaper combinations are also likely to behave differently for another reason because they are subject to waiver they are likely to be on their best

the consumer commenters fault the fcc for failing to create an accurate census of the gender and race of broadcast licensees based on its own data and for allegedly commissioning two lastminute studies studies 7 and 8 in the absence of usable data on minority ownership they state that the commissions flawed data on minority and female ownership infected all of the major statistical studies of the broadcast media studies 3 41 and 6 and claim that closer examination of corrected data shows that relaxation of dia ownership limits reduces minority ownership the consumer commenters claim at p 14 that the authors of the two external studies of minority issues commissioned by the fcc abandoned the fccs data base and were forced to resort to other data bases our own efforts to construct an accurate census of minority ownership suggest that the fcc has missed between twothirds and threequarters of the stations that are minorityfemale owned according to the consumer commenters the m ain issue with the two studies of minority issues is the absence of usable data the authors of study 7 relied on bureau of census count of firms to estimate minority ownership but the consumer commenters claim that the authors should have counted stations not firms since on average minorityowned firms have fewer stations than majorityowned firms so data on minorityowned broadcast firms as share of all broadcast firms will overstate the actual representation of minorities in broadcast ownership the consumer commenters state that the authors of study 8 which analyzes the impact of the fccs duopoly rules on minority ownership sought to build an accurate data base but did not achieve that goal nonetheless the consumer commenters state the study is supportive of our independent findings it finds that sales of minor ity stations were twenty times higher in duopoly markets than in nonduopoly markets this corroborates the conclusion in our analysis that relaxation of ownership limits has already reduced minority ownership but the consumer commenters do not explain why they appear to have more confidence in the findings of study 8 with which they themselves find fault than in the findings of

in agreement with their own findings that confidence appears to be misplaced for several reasons the consumer commenters themselves admit the authors of study 8 were not able to build an accurate minority ownership database the consumer commenters claim that the fcc database missed between twothirds and three quarters of the stations that are minorityfemale owned did the database constructed by the authors of study 8 ca pture many of those missing and thus uncounted minority and female owners if not depending on whether the undercount was more pronounced in the earlier or later years of the 19992006 period the findings of study 8 might understate or overstate the actual reduction in minority and female ownership further statement by the consumer commenters suggests that the database used in study 8 failed to identify many of the minority and female owned stations that the consumer commenters identified they state that study 8 estimates large decline in the total number of minority owned stations free press one of the consumer commenters did not identify such large absolute decline although it did see relative decline if study 8 overstates the decline in minorityowned stations especially in the later years of the study period the consumer commenters may have misplaced its confidence in the study 8 finding that sales of minority stations were twenty times higher in duopoly markets than in nonduopoly markets as explained in the earlier discussion of study 8 that study improperly attributes all the changes in minority ownership between 1999 and 2006 to the change in the duopoly rule without controlling for any of the other factors at play during that time such as the elimination of the minority tax certificate program thus it likely overstates the impact of the change in the duopoly rule on minority ownership

in analyzing the relationship between media ownership and media bias the author of study 6 ascribes slant to media outlet by defining certain words or issues as democratic or republican and then counting the number of times the word is used or the issue is covered by stations what is actually said or shown about the issue is not analyzed the consumer commenters call this contentless content analysis and claim that academics and professional journalists have identified four major concerns with the methodology it fails to understand what it means for reporter to cite source and to distinguish between ideological opinion in news coverage and reporting the selection of external referents to ascribe ideology to media outlets is inevitably biased selectivity in coverage of

phrases or issues does not reveal how those phrases were used or issues portrayed for example the study categorizes the iraq war as democratic issue but during the week covered by the study president bush visited 10 states to hold press conferences with local candidates or give major speeches speaking frequently about the war under the methodology used news coverage of those presidential speeches was likely categorized as having democratic slant the consumer commenters also claim that by choosing to analyze single special weekthe week before the 2006 electionrather than the routine practice of building database from randomly selected days to construct twoweek sample the author risked using non representative sample that might be radically different from normal also the methodology used in study 6 is an extension of the methodology used in the research of the peer reviewer of study 6 and the consumer commenters argue that the peer reviewer therefore cannot provide an objective review

ignores several fundamental characteristics of the contemporary video industry including the relegation of the small number of independent programmers in primetime to unscripted reality shows the dominance of vertically integrated programming in pilots and syndication the role of suites of cable program networks from dominant content providers that force carriage of those networks program placement in cable tiers that discriminates against independent producers the importance of broadcasters mustcarryretransmission rights and the resulting vertical integration into cable by the dominant broadcasters through the leveraging of these quasiproperty rights the consumer commenters also claim that the broadcast data set used in study 9 is biased against finding of barriers to carriage for independents in two fundamental ways first they claim that independents are particularly disadvantaged in the category of new shows and pilots but the study 9 data set does not include shortlived shows thus missing the fact that vertically integrated shows are given many more opportunities to fail the average ratings of vertically integrated shows are thus likely lower than they are depicted in the data set the consumer commenters allege that this undercuts any analysis that claims that vertically integrated programming and independent programming have equal ratings second study 9 counts shows not hours or time slots thus primetime programming made up of two onehour affiliated shows and two halfhour ffiliated shows would be portrayed as equally divided between affiliated and nonaffiliated even though the affiliated programming was onair twice as long the consumer commenters do not demonstrate however whether the unaffiliated programming tends to be shorter in length than the affiliated programming

by the author of study 9 and addressed by the peer reviewer that use of revenues data rather than profits data due to the lack of data on costs could lead to bias the consumer commenters argue that the author chose to exclude news programming from his analysis because it tends to be less costly to produce than scripted programming and therefore would skew the results but did not exclude reality programming which also is less costly to produce than scripted programming but when we know that independent programmers in primetime are delivering lowcost reality shows rather than highcost scripted entertainment revenues are bad measure of short term profits the consumer commenters also have several criticisms of the cable programming carriage portion of study 9its failure to examine movies which are an increasingly important component of cable programming its failure to consider the tier on which programming is carried and its failure to consider the role of broadcast networks with mustcarryretransmission rights they also question why the study excludes those cable networks that reach more than 90 or less than 5 of households

reviews and the comments and analysis submitted by the consumer commenters in aggregate provide huge quantity of data as well as points of analytical agreement and disagreement that are helpful in the public policy debate on media ownership despite the lack of consensus on many issues it appears that the following general statements can be made about the status of the data collection and analysis available to policy makers large systematic detailed and accurate data sets on media ownership characteristics viewerlistener preferences and programming are now available for analysts and policy makers but several gaps remain in data collection most significantly the databases on minority and female ownership of broadcast and telecommunications properties are incomplete andor inaccurate and statistical analysis based on those data would not be reliable in addition since most programming has been made available to consumers either as free overtheair programming or as part of large bundled tier of programming there is very little information on the intensity of demandhow much people value and would be willing to payfor individual programs or channels also although mvpds increasingly offer their programming through multiple bundled tiers the fcc does not appear to have collected data on the specific tiers on which programming is offered although the 10 fcccommissioned studies present large number of statistical findings many of these relationships are not statistically significant across alternative model specifications this has led the researchers and peer reviewers to offer disclaimers that the findings are not robust and where they find statistical relationships they demonstrate correlation not causality some of the researchers found that demand variables such as the preferences of viewers or the length of commute time for radio listeners have stronger influence over programming decisions than supply variables such as ownership

open to competing interpretations some researchers have suggested this implies that ownership limits have little impact on the goals of localism and diversity but other researchers have suggested this shows that ownership limits ensure more diversity of voices without sacrificing local news and public affairs programming although several of the commissioned studies included lengthy discussions of cable ownership and programming as well as broadcast ownership and programming only the study on vertical integration performed statistical analysis of the relationship between cable ownership and programming the peer reviewers and the consumer commenters identified number of possible technical problems in the econometric analyses performed in the 10 studies the potentially most noteworthy criticism appears to be that all but one of the studies addressed the impact of media ownership characteristics on the programming provided by individual crossowned stations not on the total programming available to consumers in the local market which arguably is the key public policy concern process is in place to determine whether the criticisms are valid andor whether the study results are reliable the consumer commenters claim that when they modified the fcc commissioned studies to take into account these criticisms they obtained robust results demonstrating that loosening the media ownership limits harmed the public interest though their results were not always consistent across model specifications their modified studies have not yet been subject to full review by others though they were criticized in an econometric review by harold furchtgottroth that was appended to the reply comments of media general 42

rules to determine whether they are still in the public interest and to modify or eliminate the rules if appropriate at the same time the prometheus decision requires the commission to justify with reasoned analysis any explicit numerical limits in its rules 43 the 10 fcccommissioned studies are intended to provide data and analysis that support such reasoned analysis those studies and the additional data collection and analysis performed by the consumer commenters collectively provide policy makers and interested parties with far more detailed and accurate media ownership viewerlistener preference and programming databases than were previously available however the fcc staff commissioned researchers peer reviewers and commenting parties have identified continued gaps both in data collection and in data analysis especially with respect to minority ownership on one hand those gaps may render the current record insufficient for the fcc to perform reasoned analysis of

make public interest determination with diversity of voices one of the public interest goals but there is single understanding of what is meant by diversity of voices diversity might refer to among other things the number of different viewpoints on particular subject or the number of different issues that are addressed by media in market or the variety of programming offered in market or the number of different gatekeepers who determine what programming is provided or some combination of these and other possible concepts of diversity as will be discussed below this could be of particular concern if fcc rules particularly as they involve minority ownership are reviewed by the courts

although three of the 10 fcccommissioned studies attempted to collect data on minority and female ownership issues and the consumer commenters attempted to supplement that data collection with their own effort all the researchers and the peer reviewers agree that the fccs databases on minority and female ownership are inaccurate and incomplete and their use for policy analysis would be fraught with risk th is may have significant policy implications in its prometheus decision the third circuit instructed the fcc to consider the impact of changes in its media ownership rules on minority ownership 44 without accurate data on minority and female ownership it is impossible to perform such analysis for example one of the interesting hypotheses raised in study 8 that merits serious analysis is that loosening the television duopoly rule reduced opportunities for minority ownership because it increased demand for stations that were attractive as second television properties in market and the resulting sharp increase in station prices placed minorityowned stations in double jeopardy because they could not afford to trade up to better facilities and the duopoly stations against which they were competing became parts of large broadcast groups capable of bringing significant economies of scale to the market related hypothesis is that further loosening of the duopoly rule would further reduce opportunities for minority ownership although st udy 8 did not properly test this hypothesis because it failed to take into account concurrent changes that might have affected minority ownership such as elimination of the minority tax certificate program even if it had been constructed properly its results would have been suspect because they by necessity would have been based on the only available data on minority ownership which is recognized by all to be inaccurate and incomplete the same problem arises with respect to the impact of each and every media ownership rule on minority and female ownership it is possible that the third circuit would not approve any fcc media ownership rule until the commission has developed minority ownership database of sufficient accuracy to allow for reliable testing of the impact of the rules on minority ownership 44 although that instruction applied specifically to the fccs elimination of the failed station solicitation rule the language provided at pp 12 above would appear to be applicable to all the fccs media ownership rules

however any governmental measures to facilitate minority broadcast entry that are based on racial classification must satisfy the heightened constitutional standards that apply to governmental preferences for minorities under the equal protection clause the supreme courts ruling in adarand constructors inc v peña 45 requires that governmental measures based on racial classifications be analyzed using strict scrutiny standard under which they would be deemed constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interest it is easier to meet these standards if race is but one of several criteria for program eligibility and not definitive criterion46 proponents of measures to facilitate minority broadcast entry have been concerned however that broadening eligibility for such programs to include all small businesses might fail to foster diversity because focusing solely on economic disadvantage fails to take into account the social disadvantage suffered by certain groups47 for example the children of established business people might qualify under the small business criterion proponents therefore have proposed constructing definition of socially and economically disadvantaged businesses sdbs that would grant eligibility to individuals with social disadvantages stemming either from individualiz ed factors or from membership in class such as racial group for which discrimination has inhibited entry and financing in its august 1 2007 second further notice 48 the fcc sought comment on how to define sdbs in fashion that would satisfy constitutional standards while it is not possible to predict what sdb definition would satisfy the courts it is possible to review past court decisions and dissents to identify the type of information the courts might demand in support of any definition for example if supreme court ruling were to follow the line of argument in dissent joined by tw current supreme court justices scalia and kennedy to the 1990 decision metro broadcasting inc v federal communications commission et 49 then any definition of sdbs that provides eligibility based on membership in racial group and not just on individual status might require empirical evidence to demonstrate the nexus between membership in that group and the objective of the program50 the dissent states the fcc assumes particularly strong correl ation of race and behavior the fcc justifies its conclusion that insufficiently diverse viewpoints are broadcast by reference to the percentage of minorityowned stations this assumption is correct only to the extent that minorityowned stations provide the desired additional views and that stations owned by individuals not favored by the preferences cannot or at least do not broadcast 45 515 us 200 1995 46 for detailed discussion of the legal issues surrounding governmental measures based on racial classifications see crs report rl34269 minority ownership

ownership to improve programming assumes that preferences linked to race are so strong that they will dictate the owners behavior in operating the station overcoming the owners personal inclinations and regard for the market at pp 618619 one particular flaw underscores the governments ill fit of means to ends the fccs policies assume and rely upon the existence of tightly bound nexus between the owners race and the resulting programming three difficulties suggest that the nexus between owners race and programming is considerably less than substantial first the market shapes programming to tremendous extent members of minority groups who own licenses might be thought like other owners to seek broadcast programs that will attract and retain audiences rather than programs that reflect the owners tastes and preferences second station owners have only limited control over the content of programming third the fcc had absolutely factual basis for the nexus when it adopted the policies and has since established none to support its existence at pp 626627 if this view were to gain the support of the major ity of the supreme court it would appear that if the fcc implements programs that provide preferences to sdbs and some entities qualify as sdbs as part of socially disadvantaged racial group rather than socially disadvantaged individual the burden would be on the commission to demonstrate the nexus between favoring that group and the compelling government interest in fostering diversity of voices as discussed earlier there is single understanding of diversity of voices one possible meaning could be the diversity of issues addressed in local news and public affairs programming second meaning could be diversity in programming in the sense of an identifiable target audience whatever meaning of diversity is used the fcc would have the burden to show that the broadcast ownership by members of the socially disadvantaged minority group affects programming in fashion that fosters diversity but the fcc apparently has not collected the data needed to make such showing it does not have an accurate database on minority ownership nor if diverse programming is compelling government interest has it established that diverse programming is not currently being sufficiently provided but could be expected to be provided in greater quantity by minority owners the courts might expect the fcc for exam ple to have performed survey to identify the types of issues that are of particular interest to socially and economically disadvantaged groupsperhaps issues of homelessness housing discrimination lack of public transportation and then to have collected data on the local news and public affairs programming of all broadcast stations to determine whether stations owned by the racial minorities included in the sdb definition adopted by the fcc offer significantly more programming that addresses those issues than nonminorityowned stations such data collection and analysis have been put forward

the commission chose the brightline approach in large part because it identified regulatory certainty as an important goal in addition to the three traditional goals of diversity localism and competition51 it stated any benefit to precision of casebycase review is outweighed in our view by the harm caused by lack of regulatory certainty to th affected firms and to the capital markets that fund the growth and innovation in the media industry companies seeking to enter or exit the media market or seeking to grow larger or smaller will all benefit from clear rules in making business plans

thenchairman powell reportedly stated in an interview that it may not be possible to linedraw part of says maybe the best answer is to evaluate on casebycase basis the commission may end up getting more pushed in that direction53 given that the third circuit explicitly gave the fcc the opportunity to justify or modify its approach to setting numerical limits it did not signal preference for casebycase approach vs brightline rule currently the fcc continues to use brightline rules that set numerical limits some of those limits are set by statute not by fcc rulemaking but in its 2006 further notice the commission did ask whether our goals would be better addressed by employing an alternative regulatory scheme or set of rules 54 several aspects of the data collection and analysis performed to date suggest that it might be difficult to construct brightline numerical limits or that such numerical limits might not always be effective in fostering diversity localism and competition although literally thousands of regression analyses have been performed by multiple researchers in an effort to identify relationships between various media ownership characteristics and the amount or type of various programming aired the researchers report very few strong findings often statistically significant relationship is found with one particular model specification but not found if the model specification is changed this led many of the researchers and peer reviewers to emphasize that the statistical findings were not robust where relationships are identified the

setting numerical limits because moving beyond those levels might threaten policy goals in her internal memorandum55 former fcc chief economist leslie marx laid out possible methodology for determining the critical number of outlets required to be reasonably sure that the goals of competition diversity and localism are met as part of basis for justifying relaxation of newspaperbroadcast crossownership restriction but that analysis was at the drawing board stage not complete and it is not clear whether such models would generate statistical results sufficiently robust to justify particular numerical levels study 9 found robust empirical evidence that large fractiontypically the majorityof the programming on any broadcast network during primetime was made inhouse but the findings explicitly ruled out costbased efficiency explanation for that vertical integration of broadcast networks into program production nor did the study find an efficiency explanation for the vertical integration of cable systems into cable network production the peer reviewer commented that the overwhelming majority of independent cable networks successfully launched in the period of the study are owned by affiliates of large media conglomerates who do not have cable system interests which implies that the financial resources or bargaining leverage in common to the large corporations which also own numerous other established networks rather than vertical integration itself may be the most significant advantage that successful cable network suppliers now have it appears that the vertical integration that has decreased the diversity of program production sources is not driven by efficiency considerations if that is the case then brightline rule that treats broadcast station that is owned and operated by major broadcast network exactly the same as an independently owned station would fail to take into account the impact of vertical integration on diversity and might not be as effective as casebycase analysis in determining the impact of acquisitions with vertical elements on one measure of diversity the consumer commenters claim that the large media companies that own broadcast networks have been able to use their mustcarry and retransmission consent rights to obtain broad mvpd carriage of their expanded suites of broadcast and cable networks thus reducing the diversity of cable network program sources the mustcarry and retransmission consent rules were implemented in the early 1990s to protect broadcasters from cable companies that were monopsony purchasers of broadcast programming now that cable companies face competition from dbs providers and telephone companies and broadcasters have the retransmission rights to musthave sports and local programming that cable companies need to carry or risk the loss of subscribers to those competing mvpds that do carry the programming the broadcasters enjoy much stronger negotiating position though the large cable companies that have created large regional clusters appear to have countervailing leverage 56 55 see footnote 21 above 56 for example crs report on programmerdistributor conflicts found that often broadcaster involved in carriage dispute owned or controlled more than one broadcast station in small or medium sized local market it appears that where broadcaster owns or controls tw stations that are affiliated with major networks that potentially gives the broadcaster control through its retransmission consent rights over two sets of musthave programming and places

consent rights the broadcasters will have as they begin to transmit multiple digital signals over their licensed spectrum that is whether cable systems will be required to carry all of the local broadcast stations signals or only the primary signal which is the current requirement the resolution of this regulatory issue would likely affect how much leverage the various parties would have over programming decisions in local markets with such uncertainty about future mustcarry and retransmission consent rules there may be advantages to analyzing the public interest implications of proposed acquisitions on casebycase basis that can take into account changes in mustcarry and retransmission consent rules rather than implementing brightline numerical limits set under todays regulatory environment all of these factors suggest that the fcc might want to use the extensive data it has collected to analyze more fully the advantages and disadvantages of the casebycase and brightline

household price sensitivity is greater for individual programs than for large tier of programs so tiering makes it easier for mvpds to raise their prices in addition they claim tiered pricing does not take into account the intensity of demand for individual channels in the tier so it is possible that channels that are highly valued by niche audiences will not be carried while general interest channels that attract larger audience but are not as highly valued will be carried proponents of tiering counter that tiering is the mo st costefficient way to offer programming and thus lowers retail prices that it increases consumer benefits by allowing channel surfing that it reduces the risks associated with introducing new cable networks and that it helps support niche continued risky to lose carriage of both signals or when broadcaster ow ns or controls one station that is affiliated with major broadcast network and second station that is affiliated with weaker broadcast network it may be able to tie carriage of the major broadcast network to demand that the cable operator also carryand perhaps pay for carriage ofthe signals of the weaker broadcast network which otherwise the cable company would refuse to pay for or only carry for free as part of mustcarry arrangement see crs report rl34078 retransmission consent and other federal rules affecting programmerdistributor negotiations issues for congress by charles b goldfarb 57 one further variation would favor noncommercial channels by only providing price reduction for opting out of commercial channels

own they claim that new independent cable networks in particular would have an extremely difficult time making themselves known and attracting an audience and advertisers in an à carte environment the 10 fcccommissioned studies collected some data that are relevant to the debate about these à carte proposals the nielsen survey study 1 asked questions about which channels mvpd subscribers would be interested in dropping from their service if they could receive reduction in cost and which channels they would like to receive but do not currently subscribe to because they would have to subscribe to larger package of channels when asked to identify the channels they would be interested in dropping in case was particular channel identified by as many as 5 of the respondents this might suggest that most respondents could not immediately identify the specific channels they do not wish to receive and pay for or that most respondents are generally content to receive and pay for large bundle of channels even if they actually watch only small portion of the channels when asked to identify which channels they would like to receive but do not currently subscribe to because to do so would require them to subscribe to larger package the only channels identified by more than 2 of the respondents were premium channels hbo 89 showtime 36 and cinemax 30not advertisingsupporte d channels since most households subscribe to the enhanced basic tier rather than larger tier this might suggest that most mvpds already include most general interest channels on their enhanced basic tiers the survey questions elicited information on consumer preferences but did not generate any information on how sizeable cost reduction consumers would demand to drop channels or how much additional they would be willing to spend to get additional channels nor did they generate data to help determine the intensity of demand for individual channels or for tiers of channels study 3 found among other things that niche or special interest programming minority adult religious is less widely available than general interest programming news childrens family and that news and violent programming are the most highly rated programming types with latinospanishlanguage childrens and family programming substantially lower and nonlatino minority and religious programming lower still it is not surprising that nonlatino minority and religious programming which have low audience ratings are not widely available the public policy issue is how best to serve audiences for such niche programming to further the goal of diversity as explained earlier tiered pricing does not take into account the intensity of demand for individual channels in the tier so it is possible that channels that are highly valued by niche audiences will not be carried while general interest channels that attract larger audience but are not as highly valued will be carried mvpds typically offer mostly general interest and other large audience programming on their expanded basic tiers and make less popular programming available either as part of larger tiers that are available at higher prices or on an à carte basis that could consist of single channel or several closely related channels 58 but data are not available on subscribers intensity of demand for 58 the tiering terminology that is used by the industry and by the fcc often differs from common usage the basic tier continued

the tendency toward serving general audiences on basic tiers and niche audiences on other tiers increases or decreases overall consumer welfare it is possible however to in vestigate how the market appears to be operating today the market shows that small number of viewers can support programming if they are willing to pay enough for such programming for example although the audiences for nonspanish foreign language programming such as korean language programming are relatively small as result of the willingness of threshold level of households to pay between 25 and 30 month for package of several korean language channels both directv and dish tv offer korean language packages as do some cable systems though these offerings may not be available universally throughout the us the intensity of demand for nonspanish foreign language programming appears to be relatively high in households that include members that speak little or english or that have strong desire to maintain cultural connections even as their children become more assimilated it is not clear whether the intensity of demand for other niche programming such as nonforeign language minority programming and religious programming is sufficiently great to support such an à carte solution the fcc does not have data available on the intensity of demand for such niche programming but the absence of à carte options in the form of individual channels or very small specialized bundles for such programming suggests that the mvpds do not expect the intensity of demand to be sufficient to support such programming especially when taking into account the opportunity cost of using scarce channel capacity to serve these niche audiences those niches programs are most likely available on larger higher priced tiers subscribers to niche programming such as korean language programming that is available as part of an à carte option also must purchase the basic cable tier because of the statutory requirement that all cable subscribers receive the local broadcast stations as well as any public educational and governmental channels required by the franchising authority 59 but they do not have to purchase any other cable networks that is not the case for households that seek niche programming that is not available on an à carte basis some critics of the current system complain that it is unfair to require audiences for niche programming that is not available as part of an à carte option to purchase tiers that are larger and more expensive than the expanded basic tier in order to receive that niche programming but absent data on the intensity of demand for the various niche and nonniche channels it is not possible to determine whether those niche channels could survive in an à carte environment or to demonstrate consumer welfare loss from the current system and even if the current system does impose consumer welfare loss on niche audiences it is not clear how regulation could be implemented to identify and require carriage of such niche channels continued consists of the local broadcast channels the public educational and governmental peg channels required by the local franchising authority and perhaps small number of cable networks typically the basic tier consists of approximately 20 channels and is priced in the vicinity of 1520 per month fewer than 10 of cable subscribers choose the basic tier the most popular tier is the expanded basic tier which typically includes everything in the basic tier plus 30 additional cable networks most of which are general interest networks the expanded basic cable tier typically is priced at about 50 per month other premium tiers available at higher prices provide additional cable networks digital programming andor high definition programming 59 these requirements apply to cable service not to satellite service
