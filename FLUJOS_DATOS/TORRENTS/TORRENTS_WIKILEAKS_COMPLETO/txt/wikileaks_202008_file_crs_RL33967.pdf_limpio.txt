signed the adam walsh child protection and safety act on july 27 20061 the act serves four basic purposes first it reformulates the federal standards for sex offender registration in state territorial and tribal sexual offender registries and does so in manner designed to make the system more uniform more inclusive more informative and more readily available to the public online second it introduces fairly extensive and diverse set of amendments to federal criminal law and procedure featuring among other things federal procedure for the civil commitment of convicted sex offenders upon their release from prison random search authority over sex offenders on probation or supervised release and number of new mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment for various new and existing federal sex offenses third it creates amends or revives several grant programs designed to reinforce private state local tribal and territorial prevention law enforcement and treatment efforts in the case of crimes committed against children finally it calls for variety of administrative or regulatory initiatives in the interest of child safety such as the creation of the national child abuse registry the act arrived on the presidents desk as hr 4472 having been approved by the house on march 8 2006 2 and by the senate on july 20 20063 each chamber had previously passed many of the same provisions in separate bills of thei r own in the case of the house the predecessor was hr 3132 which the house endorsed on september 15 20054 in the case of the senate it was s 1086 which the senate approved on may 4 20065 g21g142g161g561g17g143g143g142g151g141g142g155g561g20g142g144g146g156g157g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 one of the center pieces of the adam walsh child protection and safety act is the

walsh act preserves the basis structure of the earlier law expands upon it and makes more specific matters that were previously left to individual state choice9 it contemplates publicly available contemporaneously accurate online system conscious of the legal and technical adjustments required the walsh act anticipates that states and other jurisdictions may require three years or more to fully implement its modifications as consequence for purposes of compliance by the states and other jurisdictions the prior law remains in effect until the later of three years after enactment or one year after the necessary software for the new uniform online system has become available 10 for registrants however the new requirements became effective upon enactment11

supreme court connecticut department of public safety v doe12 and smith v doe 13 in smith the court rejected an ex post facto challenge because the statute was intended to create regulatory scheme that was civil and nonpunitive and because it was not so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate the states intention to deem it civil14 in connecticut department of public safety it rejected the argument that due process required preregistration hearing as to the current dangerousness of the offender because the statute predicated registration upon prior conviction not upon current dangerousness 15 continued code ann 453321 to 453357 mo ann stat 589400589425 mont code ann 4623501 to 4623 570 neb rev stat 294003 to 294013 nev rev stat 179d010179d850 nh rev stat ann 651b1

condition of their supervised release or probation76 as general rule random searches raise fourth amendment questions the fourth amendment states that the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized77 the amendments facially absolute terms are subject to qualification for example the supreme court recently upheld the random search of the person of parolee in sampson v california 78 as the court explained in that context the hallmark of fourth amendment compliance is reasonableness and the courts will examine the totality of the circumstances to determine whether search is reasonable79 more precisely whether search is reasonable is determined by assessing on the one hand the degree to which it intrudes upon an individuals privacy and on the other the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interest80 the court had previously upheld the suspicionbased but warrantless search of probationers apartment in united states v knights 81 there the court had observed that in balancing an individuals privacy interest against the interests of the government the weight afforded the individuals interest varies according to the individuals justifiable expectation of privacy under the circumstances and those subject to punishment by the government like prisoners parolees and probationers may claim only reduced expectation of privacy 82 among them however there is range of expectations corresponding to the continuum of punishments that accompanies 76 18 usc 3563b23 3583d

expectations of privacy than probationers and those on federal supervised release83 moreover parolees acceptance of suspicionless searches as condition of parole significantly diminishes the individuals expectation of privacy84 under these circumstances the sampson court concluded sampson had legitimate expectation of privacy on the other hand the court considered the governments interest substantial states interest in reducing recidivism and thereby promoting reintegration and positive citizenship among probationers and parolees warrant privacy intrusions that would not otherwise be tolerated under the fourth amendment85 in the absence of such an expectation the court found it unnecessary to consider the question of whether the search might be justified under the fourth amendments special needs doctrine or under the amendments consent exception 86 some may believe that section 210 makes such an examination necessary since it involves probationers and those on supervised released individuals said to have higher expectation of privacy than the parolee in sampson application of the courts special needs and c onsent jurisprudence however presents its own challenges the special needs doctrine emerged from the courts school and drug testing cases87 beginning there the court has identified circumstances under which the governments particularly weighty special interests balanced against the nature of the intrusion upon an individuals privacy interests justify search without the usual protection of either probable cause or warrant even here however the court has been particularly reluctant to recognize exceptions to the general rule of individualized suspicion where the government authorities primarily pursue their general crime control ends 88 yet there are circumstances under which the court has been able to overcome its reluctance89 as for consent an individual could be said to have consented to condition for parole and perhaps even probation where the alternative is incarceration but supervised release is imposed in addition to rather than in lieu of imprisonment90 unlike parole or probation it is imposed rather than accepted imposition of the condition however is discretionary91 and court might impose alternative less desirable conditions to be applied should the individual fail to consent to random searches whether this would be considered sufficient to constitute voluntary waiver of an individuals fourth amendment rights is unclear at best 92 yet the question is unlikely to arise 83 sampson v california 126 sct at

matter suggests that the changes worked by section 210 would pass constitutional muster federal law requires consent to dna sample collection as mandatory condition of federal probation93 and of federal supervised release94 fourth amendment challenges to the collection of dna samples from prisoners from those on probation and from those on supervised release have generally been unsuccessful in the lower federal courts although the courts sometimes reach the same result from the different approaches some favor special needs analysis and others knight reasonable analysis 95 section 210 amends the provisions governing probation and supervised release to permit the court to impose as an explicit condition of probation or supervised release that an individual required to register as sex offender remain subject to warrantless searches without the need of suspicion if conducted by probation officer as part of his supervisory duties or upon reasonable suspicion that the individual has violated condition of his probation or supervised release if conducted by other law enforcement officers the distinction between probation officers and other law enforcement officers in section 210 reflects the two modes of analysis under which random searches may be permissible in knights the court approved the warrantless search of probationer by law enforcement officers with reasonable suspicion in the school and drug cases the court approved random searches in the interests of special administrative needs inte rests arguably comparable to the governments interest in the administration of the federal system probation and supervised release g7g161g153g138g151g141g142g141g561g6g16g3g561g140g152g149g149g142g140g157g146g152g151g561 prior to the 109th congress the dna

notification that the individuals conviction for the qualifying offense has been overturned100 as noted previously the lower federal courts have generally rejected constitutional challenges to these

2005 pl 109 162 119 stat 2960 3085 2006 amended the dna act to authorize the collection of samples from individuals arrested under the laws of the united states or from nonunited states persons detained under the laws of the united states without regard to whether qualifying offense supplies the basis for the arrest or detention102 section 155 further expands the attorney generals authority to permit collection of samples from those 1 facing chargesfor federal offense or 2 convicted of any federal offense rather than just those convicted of qualifying offenses the act does not define the term facing charges nor is it defined in any other section of the code without more it might be thought to refer to those under indictment but use of the term later in same subparagraph suggests it was intended to refer to those released on bail but under pretrial supervision103 the amendments in the 109th congress may anticipate certain technical adjustments for example they do not amend the expungement provision that applies only to qualifying offenses so that the records of individuals with overturned convictions for the more serious qualifying offenses continue to be subject to expungement but those with overturned convictions for the less serious nonqualifying offenses are not 104 the violence against women and the walsh amendments of the 109th congress appear to have been

sampling practices106 and as noted earlier the lower courts have generally rejected constitutional challenges to dna collection statutes particularly following conviction107 yet in fourth amendment context defendants whose convictions have been overturned and arrestees particularly those never prosecuted do not fit as readily into special needs category as inmates parolees and those on supervised released moreover on the continuum of punishment mentioned in knight and sampson they presumably have greater expectation of privacy than inmates parolees and those on supervised release all of whom have been convicted whether court would consider the difference sufficient to tip the balance remains to be seen

the victims of federal crimes enjoy limited statutory rights to notice attendance and participation in related federal judicial proceedings 18 usc 3771114 the victims of state crimes generally enjoy comparable rights in state judicial proceedings as matter of state law115 section 212 affords the victims of state crimes certain attendance and participation rights in federal habeas corpus proceedings involving the state crime of which they were the victim116 it grants them the right not to be excluded from the habeas proceedings the right to be reasonably heard there the right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay and the right to be treated fairly and with respect for their dignity and privacy 117 the rights are available to all victims not merely those who were children at the time of the offense or those who were the victims of sexual offense the federal courts are obliged to honor these and the other rights vested in section 3771 which are enforceable through writs of mandamus118 the rights conveyed to the victims of state crimes in federal habeas proceedings however impose obligations upon federal executive branch officials119 all of which gives section 212 number of interesting features first the section does not include right to notification of the time or place of the habeas proceedings to which the other rights attach although some state statutory or constit utional provisions may require notice by state officials120 second it seems to call for the right of victims to brief and argue the points of law raised in the habeas proceedings the right to be reasonably heard since the usual form of victims being heard the victim impact statement has real place in habeas proceeding121 third it seems to promise right of attendance or participation for the families or representatives of those victims who are children unless the child is dead or incapacitated122 victims right to habeas proceedings unmarred by unreasonable delays can be traced to hearing testimony and to an earlier shortlived section of the bill which would have imposed time limits in federal habeas cases when they involved challenges to state convictions for the murder of 114 see generally crs report rl33679 crime victims rights act summary and legal analysis of 18 usc 3771 by charles doyle 115 see generally beloof cassell twist v ictims in criminal procedure

generally formulated and amended by committees within the judicial conference working under the auspices of the supreme court and with at least tacit congressional approval 124 the general rule on federal privileges states that they shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the united states in light of reason and experience125 under this rubric the federal courts have recognized two marital privileges one protects confidential communications between spouses126 and the other permits one spouse to refuse to testify against the other127 the federal courts have recognized an exception to the communications privilege in cases involving crimes committed by one spouse against the other or against children in the home 128 but at least one court has refused to recognize corresponding exception to the privilege against compelled spousal testimony129 section 214 directs the committee on rules practice procedure and evidence of the judicial conference to study the necessity and desirability of establishing an exception to both privileges in cases involve crime committed by one spouse against child or minor ward of either the results will presumably be presented to congress in the form report transmitted through conference and the supreme court since by statute only congress can create abolish or modify federal rule of

some circumstances may be used to commit sex offenders132 the supreme court has addressed concerns that the sex offender civil commitment procedures could be used in lieu of criminal trial to circumvent the constitutional protections afforded the criminally accused faced with the argument that the statutes might be used to punish an individual simply because he was thought to pose risk of committing some undefined crime in the future the court upheld narrowly crafted kansas statute in kansas v hendricks the challenged act unambiguously requires as finding of dangerousness either to ones self or to others as prerequisite to involuntar confinement commitment proceedings can be initiated only when person has been convicted of mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes the person likely to engage in the predatory acts of sexual violence the statute thus requires proof of more than mere predisposition to violence rather it requires evidence of past sexual violent behavior and present mental condition that creates likelihood of such conduct in the future if the person is not incapacitated finding of dangerousness standing alone is ordinarily not sufficient ground upon which to justify indefinite involuntary commitment we have sustained civil commitment statutes when they have coupled proof of dangerousness with the proof of some additional factor such as mental illness or mental abnormality these added statutory requirements serve to limit involuntary civil confinement to those who suffer from volitional impairment rendering them dangerous beyond they control the kansas act is plainly of kind with these other civil commitment statutes it requires finding of future dangerousness and then links that finding to the existence of mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes it difficult if not impossible for the person to control his dangerous behavior the precommitment requirement of mental abnormality or personality disorder is consistent with the requirements of these other statutes that we have upheld in that it narrows the class of persons eligible for confinement to those who are unable to control their dangerousness 133 soon thereafter the court seemed to wit hdraw somewhat from its pronouncements in hendricks the kansas supreme court read hendricks to mean that civil commitment of sex offenders under the statute required proof that they could not control their criminal urges not so said the united states supreme court in kansas v crane 134 it is enough to say that there must be proof of serious difficulty in controlling behavior and this when viewed in light of such features of the case as the nature of the psychiatric diagnosis and the severity of the mental abnormality itself must be sufficient to distinguish the dangerous sexual offender whose serious mental illness abnormality or disorder subjects him to civil commitment form the dangerous but typical recidivist convicted in an ordinary criminal case the later courts have been of two minds when it comes to dealing with what standard of control will satisfy due process demands for sexual predator civil commitment statutes in light of

that the individual has serious difficulty controlling his potentially dangerous behavior135 others conclude that it is sufficient to establish that by virtue of some mental disorder the individual is more likely than not to engage in sexual violence in the future becaus such proof implicitly includes proof that such personss mental disorder involves serious difficulty in controlling his or her sexually dangerous behavior136 section 302 establishes federal civil commitment procedure for sexual offenders in which it takes the more cautious approach137 it permits commitment where the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the individual is sexually dangerous person138 sexually dangerous person is one who has engaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child molestation and who is sexually dangerous to others139 person is sexually dangerous to others who suffers from serious mental illness abnormality or disorder as result of which he would have serious

of the majority of circuit court decisions that had held that simple unlawful possession of firearm is not crime of violence for preventive detention purposes147 when considering whether to order

otherwise the defense would be under considerable burden and when there was indication that either defense counsel or its experts were likely to disregard the courts protective order and abuse their access to the material154 section 504 states that material constituting child pornography must remain in the care custody and control of the prosecution or the court155 rule 16 notwithstanding defense requests for copies must be denied as long as the prosecution makes the material reasonably available ie with ample opportunity to inspect and examin the material at government facility156 the few

3559f for maiming 25 years is greater than the sentence otherwise authorized for the crime 20 years the impact of section 3559f on federal assault law may be difficult to assess there are scores of federal assault statutes202 many prohibit assaults directed at federal officials and consequently are not likely to involve children as victims in most instances of the others some impose more severe penalties when an assault involves dangerous weapon or bodily injury but many simply condemn assault few impose sanction as severe as the life sentence or the 10 year mandatory minimum called for in section 3559f moreover though the section defines fairly narrowly the injuries that trigger its application 203 it leaves undefined and open to liberal description the range of dangerous weapons whose use may result in the accelerated sanctions of section 3559f in other federal criminal statutes the term dangerous weapon has been understood to include shoes 204 belts205 rings206 chairs207 desks208 teeth209 and host of other ordinarily innocent objects that can be misused to inflict serious injury sampling of the federal assault statutes whose sanctions section 3559f replaces when child is victimized with imprisonment for any term of years not less than 10 years or for life along with the authorized penalties for their violation in the absence of child victim appears in the margin210 in
