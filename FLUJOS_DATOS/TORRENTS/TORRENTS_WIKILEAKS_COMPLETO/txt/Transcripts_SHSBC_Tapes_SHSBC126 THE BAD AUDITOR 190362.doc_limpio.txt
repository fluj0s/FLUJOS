the bad auditor lecture given on 19 march 1962 i see some of you have made some progress and some havent i dont see anybody has totally retrogressed however except you of course laughter the that clock up there is twoandahalf minutes slow beg your pardon five minutes slow shows you i go away two weeks you lose five minutes worth of time just like that five invaluable minutes now you can think back down your time track when five minutes would have been long time just before you ran into the brick wall another five minutes wouldnt that have been marvelous laughter well tonight we have subject which i must approach with considerable diplomacy subject which however means much more to you than you would at first glance recognize and one which if youre ever going to train anybody you had better know pretty well it took quite while to work this out i sniffed around the edges of it and finally hit it right on the button the bad auditor you notice the bad auditor the auditor is in quotes because there is such thing as bad auditor the auditor is not in quotes do you see but frankly before i go any further do not expect to do condemnatory dissertation and spit my teeth out on the subject of how bad bad auditor is because im not going to frankly people who have this combination wrong with them deserve an enormous tribute for auditing at all it must drive them straight up the wall now this is based on hcob of 8 march supplemented 15 march 1962 ad 12 i notice these are two different time strata its hcob of 8 march 1962 and hcob of march 15th ad 12 and so there are two entirely different time tracks now i am not at any time ever going to be found in situation where i am ranting and roaring about how bad auditors are this is not true i have enormous confidence in auditors and i always feel when an auditor is not able to make the grade with pc that it is i who am at fault not the auditor because the willingness and good heartedness of auditors has been proven to time and time and time again over long period of time the difficulties which people have in learning to audit are twofold one is technology adequacy of that comes under the heading and two my lack of experience with their troubles in auditing now those are the first and foremost difficulties with auditing as soon as i find what you dont understand or i found out that you dont understand it under the second heading i can pretty well be counted on to remedy it rapidly because i only have my auditing to judge by until i observe somebody else having trouble auditing most of the modifications which you have gotten throughout 1961 and thus far into 62 have been modifications which have come directly out of part two of which i just gave you they actually dont come out of the first part technology adequacy of but now we have piece of technology which gives us the key to an auditors having difficulty so you see weve got number one boost in the first part i just mentioned to you technology adequacy of now this technology of course pervasively speeds up cases and does lot of things every time you get new piece of technology it of course speeds up all cases thats about the first thing you can expect of it but this does more than that this tells you why people make mistakes and that is all there is to it this tells you why people have difficulty learning and so on this tells you an enormous number of odds and ends about human behavior and therefore if i werent so interested in making you an excellent auditor this would have come out under another heading entirely advance which it came out under march the 15th you see it wouldnt have come out under the heading the bad auditor it would have come out under the heading of suppressors but i wanted to call this to your attention and i was most interested in the fact that this does explain the diffidence and difficulty of an auditor and therefore if you are ever d of t this data is absolutely priceless because this tells you why youre going to have trouble with every student that youre going to have trouble with this person that were talking about who becomes bad auditor would of course have rather an exclusive corner on this aberration in other words you recognize that all aberration is is concentration on single ability for instance the communist is crazy because he is totally concentrated on the third to the utter abandonment of the first that makes him crazy you see i mean his concentration is so enormous that he looks insane now if you look this over youll see then that person who is utterly mad as viewed from psychiatric viewpoint is describable as sane lets look at this now the psychiatrist collects madnesses and when hes all through collecting all the madnesses one sample of each madness in his spinbin they call them hospitals they dont know better when hes got one sample of each he then actually has chart of sanity you see and thats why the psychiatrist has never been able to understand sanity and thats what he cant understand the psychiatrist can understand insanity but he cant understand sanity and this is the main difficulty that the whole society has with the psychiatrist you know he never has sane conduct he has insane conduct and to him the absence of insane conduct gives us sanity but by that same definition the only sane man would be dead man because hed have total absence of insane conduct with one exception catatonia and that would throw that out too you see so the psychiatrist has nothing like sane conduct he could not describe sane conduct he has observation of sane conduct therefore any one of you or any citizen in the united states or england or france and particularly russia brought up in front of psychiatrist to find out whether or not he is sane or insane could be taken with any response to be insane by the psychiatrist you see and he said well do you eat oh the fellow said i eat oh yes i eat i crazy he eats well you you think this is right he says well have you ever eaten any strange objects or eaten anything odd or anything strange oh you say well in the normal course of human events i was out camping one time we used to eat ants and dirt ah well youve had it now of course what he should ask and possibly even does is whether or not the person exclusively eats ants and dirt now this person eats nothing else but ants and dirt you see hes perfectly insane thats for sure you see that insanity is nothingelsethan thats what insanity is its fantastic concentration on any sanity to the exclusion of all other sanities and then the fellow goes nuts theres reason why you shouldnt be able to eat ants and dirt but if you never wanted to eat anything but ants and dirt and you felt you couldnt ever digest anything but ants and dirt and you felt itd kill you to eat anything else but ants and dirt and you never thought about anything else except eating ants and dirt and you never did anything but go find dirt and ants to eat youd be crazy do you see that its the degree now thats why you time to time have thought you were crazy you see because all sanity has its lower harmonic its mockery every sane impulse every sane action has its lower harmonic and mockery its intensity of and to the exclusion of anything else that makes something that is pretty nutty do you see we would not consider person mad for drawing squares on walls but now we get person who does nothing but draw squares on walls and doesnt do anything else but draw squares on walls and doesnt want to do anything else except draw squares on walls and couldnt draw anything else on walls except squares and must fill up all possible walls with squares we dont get an architect we get nut laughter you see its to the exclusion of other things and so with that small preamble you must view this subject of the bad auditor as one of degree now you are often leery of your own sanity as i started to say minute ago only because if you ever read full catalog of insanities you would find you in it repeated several times you see insane patients do and then we just list whole bunch of things you see and then you look down this list of things and you say huh wait minute i do that huh well wait minute i do that huh i do laughter that puts you on beautiful withhold because you go out in the society you dont tell everybody you think youre nuts you see inevitable this is one of the most generalized mechanisms you could imagine the person what does he do all of these various things an insane person you see and what does he do you see and actually if you listed all insane things that all insane people did all you would do you know without any degree of it mentioned youd just get sane person thats all youre liable to do any of these things see theres accounting for what people will do it isnt even in an unguarded moment they will do some of the wildest things but if they dont do anything else thats what makes it insane see im sure maybe sooner or later you have had an impulse to join the army or something like that well itd just be degree of how you join the army and of course if you joined new army every week we would get it up to highly insane level but you reading this list of what insane people do this has impulse to join an army and youve had an impulse to join an army so you classify yourself you see and similarly every auditor reading this bulletin the bad auditor let say this every auditor except those who should have thought this said to himself thats thats he wasnt even grammatical about it just that was it we had him labeled now that wasnt true that wasnt true everybodys got little bit of this well the last time you saw buzz saw buzzing and didnt put your finger in it is easily explained you didnt want to see your finger lying on the floor longer attached to your hand you see well thats perfectly rational and understandable therefore you would say to yourself well i must be trying to suppress things if i dont want to see my finger cut off lying on the floor well nobody does want to see his finger cut off and lying on the floor at least until he can mock up new finger in exactly the same place with the same mobility as his old hook little bit easier in space opera you go down to the tin shop and they bang you out new finger but that is if youve got pull with the commanding officer of the armorer or somebody you can always get new finger but these humanoid bodies are triggered to live only once the philosophy of live only once the philosophy of when you are dead oh boy are you dead gives you superprotect superpreserve supersurvive computation with regard to the body and you get so that you mind losing fingers in buzz saws and so you dont want to find your finger on the floor so you tend to suppress actions which would lead to finding your finger on the floor well that doesnt mean that you classify under this heading anybody could run any of these processes and lines with considerable benefit anybody could run any of them see and theyd get something out of it dont worry but the case were talking about starts running this thing and this isnt even the worst case and they start running this thing and they say agggghhhhh and you say give another one agggghhhhh oh and you say well give another one agghhh oh thank you mmmm and you say whats the matter oh i dont know my god well whats happening well my whole spine just turns into total solid pain lets not think about it anymore huh you ask them question and you get oh and then they finally give you one see thats the case im talking about you see thats the reaction were talking about not ugghh hey what do you know ooomp you know ooomp haw my stomach feels funny urp all right heres another one ohoh there went bullet see were not talking about that reaction were talking about oh my god please not another one oh you know i audited guy through terror charge one time he was lying on couch tell you how i got that terror charge off of him one time it might it might amuse you you might find somebody sitting on terror charge and you might want to try this i told him to go to the beginning of track and scan all the way forward to present time thank you go to the beginning of track scan all the way forward to present time thank you beginning of track scan all the way forward to present time take him four or five minutes each time to come the whole track see of course i was sticking him in the engram necessary to resolve the case thats all thats the only reason you do that youre not trying to erase track you just erase the illusion of moving on the track because the guys been stuck in this particular engram for very long time and after about the third or fourth one of this the terror charge turned on and he was lying on the couch and i am not kidding you the couch was perfectly even and its legs sat perfectly on the floor and there was nothing uneven about this floor and the person started vibrating he was shaking with such terror and such violence that the couch was picking up and banging against the floor ive never seen this happen before i watched it with some amazement i told him that was very well done laughter and found him in an incident that hed been sitting in since mmm whereby he and his friend were out on scout and they got captured by the other tribe and he watched his friend spitted on stake alive and broiled to be eaten and then he went mad and they threw him over the cliff they didnt eat him and he had been stuck in that thing ever since it isnt even much of an incident as incidents on the whole track go see boy he really must have been what we know now about him is man man he must have really served it out of the deepfreeze every day human steak you know but he actually was in such terror charge that that whole couch just beat against the floor at some low droning note well it was beating up and down just about an inch and quarter something like that just banging i thought the whole couch was going to shatter i ran him through it i just sat there and ran him through it from beginning to end having stuck him in it with scanning you see whats going on ran the thing out he was sure never the same again it took tremendous terror charge off of him well now if person can contain this much terror on the whole track in single incident imagine because that must have been free track or i would never have discovered the incident you see the amount of charge thats possibly there in valence which is dictating terror you see and which is all composited on terror and that sort of thing which is terrified of anything appearing anyplace well now what is the exact action of person who is terrified it isnt just terror that this is in but terror is very good one to describe it with terror is as the result of something having appeared engramically and then later on threatening to appear again remember that secondary or emotional charge can only exist later on the track than physically painful incident technology of 19 late 1951 early 1951 the only way you can ever get grief charge or terror charge or an anger charge or something like that is after the fact of physical pain if you trace this back if you find loss of an ally lets say you find this girl and her fathers dead and you run off the death of the father and youre bleeding tears off the death of the father and thats fine and you run this thing out and it looks like its disappearing and so forth do you know that you can ask them question which drops them immediately into the similar engram which lies below that terror charge see youll find that theres some similar physical pain engram overt or motivator which lies immediately and directly below that grief charge that the person is experiencing in other words person cannot actually cannot experience misemotional charge independent of having received physical pain in other words your emotion is always lighter and is always secondary to actual physical contact and pain thats why its called secondary thats where the word came from so you one day youre riding in the car youre nine years old youre riding in the car the old man has had few snifters too many and he goes off the edge of the road and you bung your shins up and you feel bad about the whole thing physically youre not hurt seriously youre twentyeight years of age and you read in the newspaper how little child has been killed in an automobile accident and you feel very sad the very funny part about it is you wouldnt feel sad if you yourself hadnt had some pain connected with similar incident do you see the way to knock out all secondaries of course is to get at the engrams and run them out and the secondaries pour off like mad but sometimes the secondaries lock up an engram so if you dont get the emotional charge off you cant get at the engram and thats very important and lot of auditors have noticed this before they got off grief charge or six or eight or ten or fear charges or anger charges or something like that they never did find the lower incident but after that they found that after theyd run this grief charge or something like that off and you realize any misemotional charge compares with grief charge you can run off terror you can run off fear you can actually run boredom off you can run apathy any of these things as well as grief i dont know why the psychoanalyst only found grief as his tone scale his tone scale consisted of just two things apathy and grief thats as far as he ever got up off the launching pad because he really didnt consider euphoria an emotion that was life but he thought euphoria was bad too now when you got into physical pain situation you could later on expect to get an emotional reaction to similar situation now that is everything on which this bad auditor proposition depends i mean you remember that relationship between the engram and the secondary after youve had few automobiles wrapped around your head you do one of two things you either get used to having automobiles wrapped around your head and decide that you are now familiar with this phenomena and to hell with it and go on or you decide that the threatened appearance of an automobile or the threatened well anybody is in this state threatened accident must be instantly suppressed you see youre going down the road and you see fellow coming your way and hes weaving from side to side and you go agggghhhhh and the passengers all try to put on the brakes and that sort of thing you know suppression theyre trying to suppress something from happening theyre trying to keep something from happening thats their action there because its obvious that an accident might occur well thats visible isnt it all right lets take this person who has been in fifteen wrecks and hasnt become familiar with them yet hasnt lived along the m1 and this person accident before last was with red car and they just look way up the road and they see red car and its parked but thats enough they instantly suppress the red car now you could ask them immediately afterwards what automobiles and what color were they have we passed in the last five minutes and hed tell them all but he wouldnt tell you the red car see hed omit the red car because that must be suppressed now that persons pretty batty hes not just around the curve hes bit around the bend now in earlier activities we called this restimulator the red car was the restimulator of an accident and then car any car would be restimulator well car tire tracks would be an associative restimulator for restimulator all right these are all substitute substitute substitute you have the real car in the real accident now the person substitutes similar situations to the first accident he associates those to the first accident so every one of those he starts reacting to as though it were the first accident now you call that restimulator so any situation or environment which is similar to that first accident in which he was really hurt he tends to suppress and the very funny part of it is if you ask him to spot everything in his environment at the moment of restimulation you see him turn pale all of sudden and you ask him to spot everything in the environment just that way you just say well now point out everything there is here thats good auditing command on somebody like that experimental im talking about experimental auditing command you say point out everything there is here and you just keep that up see and every time he slows down you tell him go ahead now point out everything there is here and he points out few more and well point out everything there is here you see and hell point out everything and hell point out everything now look if youre whats wrong with the auditing session do you know hell never point to you if you are restimulator for this person he will never point to you he will always omit you by the mere process of elimination havingness and familiarity with the environment he may very well finally point his finger at you and at that moment heave sigh of relief well youve all of sudden ceased to be restimulator for that particular accident in other words that is the action of keying out the person without knowing what the earlier instance was has the lock vanish thats keyout the first keyin is the first time he ever got restimulator for the original accident this accidents been riding along just fine all of sudden the same cars coming the same circumstances under the same situation all from the same direction at the same time of day the same day of the year you know riding with the same girl you know with the same guilty conscience and all of sudden boom he has an awful pain in his stomach and he goes on having this pain in his stomach and doctors analyze him and they give him barium meals and you dont dine well on barium meals you know and they decide that he has to take bromides and listen to political speeches anything anything you see put him to sleep get him quiet and just nothing does anything for this stomach and then you come along one fine day and you say well have you ever had an accident to your stomach never have see thats dead giveaway hes given you the suppressor now just think about it for moment person walking on this planet in the space of any two years who has not had something give him knock in the stomach or who has not knocked his stomach against something doesnt exist or who has not eaten something that slightly disagreed with him you get the impossibility almost anybody would say to you normally somatic in the stomach you see well did anything ever happen to your stomach yeah yeah i suppose yeah probably oh yeah but not this guy see not this guy you say to him anything ever happen to your stomach never has never has it just mysteriously got ill heres the somatic you see which calls him liar at once you as scientologist know damn well somethings happened to his stomach hes got somatic in it anything ever happen to your stomach well now are you sure nothing has ever happened to your stomach i couldnt think of anything well hes not going to try either haha youll finally get him on the emeter and spot it on the time track the person goes through horrible sensations something is liable to appear or something like this and then if youre lucky all of sudden this time he socked somebody in the stomach or time he got socked in the stomach suddenly turns on and this automobile accident you see turns on whereby he hit his stomach on the dashboard or something like this you see and theres the accident the person who says to you under circumstances has anything like this ever happened i tell you now never it never did of course this fellows lived for 200 trillion years you know its damn lie you see just on the law of averages on the law of averages not with any degree of aberration but you as you sit have certainly done to some slight degree practically everything that could ever be done anyplace with and to anyone you see and this person tells you hes sitting there well what kind of weather are you having well youre having weather fine yes i like to go fishing and all of sudden you ask him well did you ever have an accident or ever have anything happen to your stomach nohohoho never have never sort of what are you going to do about it you know you can find it with the emeter and suddenly present him with some interesting pictures and he can fit these into place and you can work these out and probably get rid of his somatic what youve run into is suppressor person is suppressing restimulators using the original power of suppression in the original painful incident and that is suppressor just before he was hit with the car he tried to unmock one car crunch you see hes had terrific impulse to unmock this car it hit him anyhow so that made him lose but later on its that same crunch see that comes down and unmocks the restimulators now he finds out he can unmock the restimulators and because its longer there in the bank the first incident appears to be unmocked thetan never gives up see there he is lying there you see squashed as bug you know green juice i dont some on one planet or another its different colors you know laughter splattered all about you see and there is the car utterly triumphant snuffing contemptuously through its radiator not even slight dent you know not even any green stains on its bumper not even ruffled but in this guys bank you have totally wiped out car there he lies stone dead but his picture is of totally wiped out car thetan never gives up he couldnt mock it unmock it in actuality he will mock it in the bank thats why it takes you so long to run an engram youve run off the unmock and then you can find the actual incident dont you see and then you eventually can erase the incident and get the pain and you know how long it takes very often when youre doing touch assist for the physical pain to turn on you sometimes youll audit the guy for half an hour before he gets any physical pain out of the incident well youre running into the suppressor and you have to get the suppressor all the way off before the physical pain is connected with and all of sudden ouch and there it is you see and then you get off little other pieces of the suppressor and you get these little flicks thats why he doesnt get the somatic all at once and thats why it didnt run out instantly after the accident now if he wasnt suppressing and if he wasnt in such games condition with mest this is what would have happened the car hits him splat knocks him into telephone pole splat he comes around and drops on the road again and gets run over by bus splat and if he didnt feel so undignified he simply would have said well splat splat splat whats few laughter and he would have picked the body up and dusted its clothes off and so forth and it would have been totally uninjured in other words the somatic would have run out as fast as it happened but because of his notis the somatic stays in place and this alone is disease aberration physical malformation and all the other difficulties he suffers from are all contained under the heading of notis now person goes through various phases of notising suppression talking about the same thing he goes through various phases of notis he notises slightly or notises more and persons impulse toward notis if failed can turn into an alteris now persons alteris can turn into notis and his notis can turn into an alteris so person can have suppression stacked with change and that is dubin see you get you get suppression and he knew the suppression wasnt successful so he alterised he knew he couldnt suppress so he alterised you see so you get dubin it usually happens below the level of unconsciousness hence dreams and theyre just alter ises of the things you cant notis now when you get into situation as an auditor where you feel little bit leery about auditing somebody you have entered specialized field of suppression now some auditors have difficulty only auditing certain type of pc in hgcs this gets to be traditional d of p who knows his staff auditors very often will have to be very careful with one or two auditors one he doesnt dare assign certain auditor to audit young man because auditing occurs or the pc will just be torn to ribbons or some mal auditing activity will occur you dont dare let certain staff auditor audit an elderly lady something bad will happen as result of the session and yet these two staff auditors one that cant audit the young man and one that cant audit the elderly lady you see can audit every other type of pc with perfect equanimity but cant audit one type of pc now thats what you call the most selective condition of suppression their suppression on this particular type of being is the prevention of restimulator theyre afraid something is going to appear that is the only way you can state it adequately theyre suppressing something this person puts them into certain frame of mind so they have to suppress this person and what result do you get we get the immediate result that one way or another in ten thousand different guises this pc must not talk to that auditor pc mustnt give up withholds pc mustnt do an auditing command pc mustnt ever change pc mustnt ever originate and how many ways can this be expressed well theyre just invariable the number of manifestations we get out of suppressor how many ways can we keep pc from communicating well we can let the pc go on forever without an acknowledgment you wouldnt have thought of that at first glance as just method of preventing the pc from communicating you see you never let the pc you never direct any of the pcs communication so the pc is just left to fish and wander you see and steers all over the place and doesnt know where hes going and the auditor says well if i just let him go get good and lost hes not going to say thing haha haha but if i got in there with couple of smart questions hoho oh well thats different proposition he might suddenly reveal something something might leap up about this that would be harmful to one and all particularly or him who knows but thats good way to keep him from communicating by never directing his communication dont you see oh theres many ramifications of this pc starts to answer the auditing question and the auditor instantly acknowledges the pc doesnt answer the auditing question you see pc says mmhm ah thank you well keep him under control here real good now have you ever seen any mice ah yes i thank you what are you upset about well i wasnt upset about anything oh well you look upset to and so forth oh well yes i was little well you i dont see any arc break registering here thank you now lets see let see how many ways could you keep pc from revealing something how many ways well there are just thousands and thousands and thousands of ways and its the composite one or another or composites of one or another of those ways that combines every auditing fault once an auditor knows the form of auditing once person is trained into the form of auditing if he persists along any of these ways i can tell you now since ive gone through this with finetoothed ron to recognize exactly what hes doing this took an awful lot of worry and work on this thing of trying to sort it out and exactly what the conditions were hes just using method of suppression and thats all ill give you method if he doesnt ever learn how to audit he wont ever get anything revealed will he but hes willing isnt he perfectly willing to audit but cant ever learn how to audit you never get the pc to reveal thing do you well that is the slow freight out see thats the slow freight you see that mostly in an academy person grinding on through cant do the trs hahaha just cant seem to get any of the trs you see cant sit there and look at somebody you know just cant do it you know cant do 1 2 3 and 4 you know just muffs one or another of these things goofs up see does it for months and months and months they actually have been well the actual fact is that if you keep person at it long enough he will run this out he will find out unless it is absolutely potty you know totally neurotic and psychotic in intensity person will eventually run it out person says oh well pcs they dont arent going to reveal anything thats going to knock my head off you know they get used to it in other words they get used to it by familiarization now thats the only cure we had to the bad auditor in all former training some of them however never did get used to it by familiarization there are two courses you can take about automobile accidents you can either have enough of them so that you get familiar with it you see and skip it or you get to point where you totally suppress all automobiles and some people in studying auditing take this other route they are in minority they are only about 20 percent or something like that but you just keep it up forever you can train and train and train and train and train and train and train and train and train and train and train and its just taking them so long to get over this by the route of familiarity that it hardly counts now thats 20 percent now about 30 percent get over it rather slowly well its case of well another six or seven accs well have an auditor laughter and then 50 percent of them in varying shades of gray get over it rather rapidly rather easily well theyre all getting over the same thing every one of them whether theyre nutty on the subject or it only bothered them for their first week of training we dont care which but theyre all on that band the length of time required in training is directly proportional to the number of suppressors you are trying to overcome in the student and that establishes the length of time in training now i think from what ive seen around here that person would be pretty darn well trained after about four months person should be pretty well trained they should be putting up pretty good show after about four months if they go into their fifth month or six month we can consider them at least guilty of having shade of gray here there must be shade of gray if they go into the sixth month and havent learned yet at all hardly wed say well thats starting to look suspect thats starting to join up with the 20 percent dont you see but it all comes from the same thing is how how much is person going to suppress what is this effort to suppress how great is the effort to suppress because you see theyre dealing with the root stuff of human aberration and of course there is likely to be revealed from the pc dont think of this now in terms of withholds and how somebody would spank them if they found out well lets not worry about that lets just take the idea that if they had an automobile accident and if another automobile accident showed up like that theyd have to go through all the pain and agony of the automobile accident they had theyre not going to have anything to do with the automobile accident thats all so they say to the pc all right now they were they were fine they were doing fine their first two weeks at the academy they just did swell youll find this too by the way youll find this abundantly just did fine and one day they were saying something you wouldnt mind forgetting theyre running this as an exercise and theyre sitting there all keen and the person says an automobile accident with an etype jaguar they didnt even hear the answer see the suppressor is right there on automatic see they quit oh well something you wouldnt mind forgetting wheres the instructor do you have an arc break why not laughter laughter and they all of sudden dont like auditing the one thing they mustnt reveal and the one thing they were trying to get rid of in their own case without ever revealing it to them you see was an automobile accident with this type of car and by god the pc sat right there and handed it to him you see and the person says brakes see scream you know thank you haha haha now why dont you answer the auditing question they frankly wouldnt even have heard the answer to the auditing question because they just would have gone clunk gone everything would appear rather dazed if you run them through the session and tried to find that piece of the session itd be gone and youd know what it was too because you went over it long enough youd at least get what the pc said but you wouldnt be able to analyze what the reaction of the auditor was or why youd know it was because the pc said restimulator of the auditor and the auditors suppressing that well then you just check back kind of similar incident in the life of the auditor and bang that would knock out that suppressor but in view of the fact that several hundred trillion suppressors exist in every case to run out each and every one of them individually would be very nearly impossible therefore it requires much better approach it requires drills of suppression familiarization with suppression not familiarization with incidents lets familiarize with the mechanism and the identity of who or what would suppress and we get these things sorted out and these things out of the road we can start clearing up this particular mechanism now who is the person who is the person with the field the black v the invisible field and so forth this is person only in tremendous suppression person with black field of course is more prone to suppress at night than in the daytime its natural you go around walking around the dark streets of the town and youre liable to have things appear that you cant recognize because you dont have enough light to recognize them so you just go walk around the corner and you go oomph oh well thats newspaperman and you go past an alley and you oomph and well that thats horse old tieup stand for horse and you go around the next corner and you go oomph and you say oh thats just restaurant sign by the time youve finished few blocks of walk youve got black field for while see because youre suppressing all the blacknesses see blacknesses are just difficulty of recognition thats all invisibility is rarer but people who are suppressing glass objects we learned long time ago will develop invisible fields yeah you can actually put out glass ashtray and tell them to try to make it disappear thank you try to make it disappear thank you try to make it disappear and their field will change make the window vanish thank you make the window vanish thank you try to make the window vanish and youll get change in their field those are not good processes but they give you an idea of an invisible field and of course the person who is suppressing thetans has an invisible field he has total nothingness involved and other types of suppression so youll have suppression of visible things suppression of invisible things suppression of matter energy space time you get suppression of almost anything you can think of and anytime you suppress anything in certain time stream you of course are also suppressing time so time becomes the primary suppression and therefore you get the instantaneous quality of the reactive bank so that all time is now in the reactive bank because of the suppression of the reactive bank and that is simply notisness in the reactive bank all right as we look this thing over then we see that almost anybody is trying to suppress something anybody is trying to suppress lot of things not just something lots of things im not now talking about trying to suppress bad things about their past or anything like that theyre just trying to suppress things see they suppress the impulse to put their finger into buzz saw see people just normal human conduct calls for suppression and now we go from that into suppressing things which are likely to appear and then we go from that into suppressing things which are likely to become known about them we get the withhold and then we get suppression of things that others are liable to think youre really doing honey then suppressing other peoples thoughts you know man i tell you if you want good failure try that it leaves more invisible fields scattered around and various things like that and you get various complications of suppression and various automaticities of suppression now its only the person who has suppression of banks on total automatic completely out of their own control utterly lost and completely nuts on it that actually are damaging as auditors and such people are damaging as auditors because they will not let pc ever reveal anything so therefore the pc gets totally stuck in everything he utters and if process works today that auditor is going to change it to another process tomorrow because if he kept on with workable process uuuuuu that auditor will only run processes which are totally inactive on the case he will only run processes that are flat he will only change processes that are changing theres the primary source of q and its actually quite horrible when you look it over if the pc is trying to get rid of withhold the pc is trying to reveal something the auditor will totally qanda with him and say the pc must never reveal this thing doesnt matter what it is just it mustnt be revealed thats all so the auditors attitude is to goof arc break not find it on the meter or only pick up something that hes well aware will be very very safe out of which nothing will occur now do you have any withholds well he just misses that one and that one and that one and that one and then picks up this withhold where the person says well yes i do have withhold this morning i sneezed thats safe thats all right he can have that one so he works on times the pc has sneezed theres going to be nothing ever reveal itself on this channel and hell work that channel endlessly because its perfectly safe operating channel because nothing is ever going to be revealed out of it perfectly all right with him you come around to the back of this auditor and hes running the end rudiments have i missed withhold on you clang the needle goes you see and goes spung and shivers on the side of the pin this person says all right that ones straight and goes to the next end rudiment theyll do it and that of course we know by present technology is dangerous auditor now that is real dangerous auditor because that auditor willynilly all with the very best of possible intentions doing their very very best will arc break anybody that is ever audited by them and drive them out of scientology he isnt trying to do this see all hes trying to do is do good safe job that isnt going to upset anybody and they know how to do good safe job that isnt going to upset anybody you just never find anything out you never let anything be revealed now naturally you refer this to the field of study if the person looks at the paper and never lets the paper reveal anything to him he never can learn can he and if hes hearing tape or something like that and he never lets any of the sense or meaning of the tape ever come through to him why he never has anything revealed does he so thats perfectly safe action funny part of it is hell sit there and listen to hundreds of tapes thats fact i mean hell sit there and listen to tape after tape after tape and never register anything off of any of the tapes because thats safe thing to do everybody to some degree is suffering from staggeringly bad memory id say if youd killed as many women as you have or killed as many men as you have or something like that or disrupted as many lives as you have normally youre going to have some slight suppression so you listen to tape four or five times before youve got it verbatim you see im talking about this as as total thing you see person sits there and listens to this whole tape and its on the subject of how you should do the trs you see and listens to this whole tape from beginning to end and comes through at the other end and the examiner says to him all right now what does tr 0 consist of and the person says well its like the twist only different laughter and he really cant understand how he doesnt know anything about it it looks like such an innocent activity but the last person to notice this about himself is the person thats what makes it grim because of course that person is in the total suppression so the one that you worry about when youre training people is the person that doesnt have this wrong with them and they know it that doesnt apply to you see it has nothing to do with my auditing its perfectly normal and natural that isabel today while i was auditing her and so forth she had an arc break any auditor auditing her would have had an arc break and when she left the session i went and got her back didnt i how can you perfect say that i was ever trying to suppress anything about isabel ive been trying and trying and trying to find out about why she drinks water laughter and this doesnt seem reasonable to you you can assume that this auditor was suppressing something on the subject of isabel because he wont let isabel give or get rid of her case or get audited and yet the auditor will audit isabel which is very fascinating so frankly the person would help them out and this is the only exception to persons helpingness theres just this one exception to helpingness person will help another to the degree of his tolerance to stand something being revealed and thats to what degree he will help another revealing something establishes the degree he will help so that this works into blackmail and dossiers and everything else if you dont help i am going to reveal about you you get that mechanism well it works the reverse the person will help somebody unless that person is likely to reveal something that would be the most natural thing in the world that consists of the coordination of the suppressor and the bad auditor it also is bad student but remember im not saying these in any reproving tones i am simply calling to your attention that we have the mechanism and its taken us an awful long time to find this mechanism and youll find this mechanism will work like bomb once you get used to using this mechanism why you will understand why auditors wont pull withholds in other words this is what keeps people from employing the technology of scientology and ive been looking for that for long time the that little point well why wont they employ it even when they know it sometimes and if i could find that button why that actually is all the importance the button has its the importance of learning rate and the importance of application it has of course vast case repercussions of one kind or another it produces dubin and various things but frankly from our point of view and from the point of view of this lecture were only interested in the degree that it inhibits good auditing and i stand for that thank you
