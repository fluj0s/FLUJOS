education this report provides an overview of the federal need analysis system including discussion of recent legislative changes and proposals this report will be updated as warranted by significant legislation federal need analysis federal need analysis title iv part f is complex system that is used to allocate billions of dollars of federal student aid under title iv of the hea it entails gathering financial data which are provided by the student via the free application for federal student aid fafsa1 calculating the efc and packaging of the applicants financial aid award by the postsecondary institutions financial aid administrator faa this section provides description of the efc and how it is calculated in addition the role of the fafsa and student financial aid packaging is examined 1 the fafsa can be submitted through the internet using fafsa at httpwwwfafsa edgov electronically through higher education institution or with standard paper application crs2 expected family contribution the efc is the amount that the federal need analysis system determines family has available to contribute toward postsecondary education expenses in calculating the efc consideration is given to available income combination of taxable and untaxed income and benefits and for some families available assets in addition living expenses retirement needs and federal and state tax liability are considered the income contribution is calculated by determining the total income of student and his or her family where applicable and determining available income by subtracting series of allowances from total income percentage of that available income is considered as an income contribution toward postsecondary education costs contribution from assets is similarly calculated the combination of the available income contribution and asset contribution divided by the number of individuals in the family enrolled in college constitutes the efc the efc process looks back year for its income data and federal income tax liability that is for award year 200720082 2006 income and federal income tax data will be used the calculation of the efc varies depending upon the applicants dependency status there are three separate dependency classifications for individual applicants dependent student independent student with dependents and independent student without dependents3 these distinctions are important because parental financial information is not considered if the applicant meets the statutory definition of an independent student to be classified as statutorily independent title iv section 480d an applicant must meet one of the following conditions 24 years of age or older by december 31st of the award year married enrolled in graduate or professional program have dependent other than spouse orphan or ward of the court or the applicant was until age 18 or military veteran4 or active duty service member applicants who do not meet any of the aforementioned conditions are considered to be dependent for the purposes of title iv student aid 2 the 20072008 award year began july 1 2007 and ends on june 30 2008 3 the calculation of the efc is delineated in the hea in sections 475 476 and 477 each of these sections applies to recipients based on their dependency status 4 section 480c defines veteran as an individual who was engaged in active duty in the us army navy air force marines or coast guard and was released under condition other than dishonorable crs3 calculating the efc the following is stepbystep description of the basic calculations used to determine students efc this description applies to the 20072008 award year5 the calculation descriptions are organized as follows parents of dependent students dependent students are included within the calculation for parents and independent students with dependents other than spouse and independent students without dependents other than spouse the calculation for parents of dependent students and independent students with dependents other than spouse are discussed together because the two are identical except that the dependent students contribution is added together with the parents efc calculation for parents of dependent students and independent students with dependents other than spouse first step calculate total income is calculated by adding the following adjusted gross income agi income earned from employment untaxed income and benefits eg welfare and child support payments other sources of income such as federal education income tax credits eg hope and lifetime credits and certain student grant and scholarship aid eg americorps benefits second step calculate allowances various allowances for noneducational expenses are subtracted from these allowances are for expenses such as basic living expenses the income protection allowance federal income tax liability state and other taxes social security and employment expenses third step calculate available income ai ai is calculated by subtracting the various allowances previously described from ai can be negative number fourth step calculate asset contribution ac ac is calculated by adding cash savings and checking and the net worth of investments businesses and farms excluding the value of the family home family farm or small family business6 and then subtracting an asset protection allowance to determine discretionary net worth the amount of the asset protection allowance increases with the age of the older parent for dependent students or the age of the student for independent students with dependents the asset protection allowance protects assets that are needed for retirement and future education costs the ac is equal to 12 of the discretionary net worth if the result is negative the ac is zero 5 for more detailed description of the federal need analysis system see the 20072008 efc formula worksheets and tables available at httpwwwifapedgov efcinformationattachments0708efcformulaguidedecfinalpdf 6 section 480f2c defines family ownership of small business as small business with not more than 100 fulltime or fulltime equivalent employees that is owned and controlled by the family crs4 fifth step calculate adjusted available income aai ac is added to ai to produce the aai progressive assessment schedule is applied to the aai to determine the proportion of income and assets to be contributed7 the assessment rate ranges from 22 to 47 both aai and the contribution from aai can be negative number sixth step the contribution from aai is divided by the number of family members in the household excluding the parents in the case of dependent students who are enrolled in college for parents of dependent students the resulting number is the parents contribution to the efc for independent students with dependents other than spouse this number is the efc next the dependent students portion of the efc is calculated as follows seventh step similar to step 1 is calculated for the dependent student based on the amount of untaxed income and benefits other sources of income and certain student grant and scholarship aid eighth step dependent students also receive various allowances for federal income tax liability state and other taxes and social security however dependent students do not receive an allowance for employment expenses in addition if the parents aai is negative see fifth step above then the amount is converted to positive amount and added to the total allowances that the student receives ninth step calculate the available income ai ai is calculated by subtracting the allowances previously discussed from ai is then assessed at 50 this equals the dependent students contribution from ai if the result is negative the ai is zero tenth step the calculation for the dependent student asset contribution is the same as the calculation for parents and independent students with dependents see third step above however dependent students assets are assessed at 20 eleventh step the final step the total efc for the dependent student is calculated by adding the parents contribution see sixth step above to the students asset and income contribution efc calculation for independent students without dependents other than spouse the efc calculation for independent students without dependents other than spouse is hybrid of the calculation for parents and the one for dependent students the calculation for this group is as follows first step calculate total income is calculated by adding the following income earned from employment untaxed income and benefits and other 7 under progressive formula as the aggregate amount of income and assets rises the proportion expected to be contributed toward educational expenses also rises crs5 sources of income such as federal education income tax credits and certain student grant and scholarship aid second step subtract allowances various allowances for noneducational expenses are subtracted from these allowances are for expenses such as basic living expenses the income protection allowances federal income tax liability state and other taxes social security and in some instances employment expenses8 third step the total allowances are subtracted from to produce the available income ai similar to the assessment imposed upon dependent students the ai of independent students without dependents is also assessed at 50 the resulting amount is the contribution from ai fourth step the asset contribution is calculated by adding together cash savings checking and the net worth of investments businesses and farms excluding the value of the family home family farm or small family business similar to the protection afforded to parents and independent students with dependents independent students without dependents also receive an allowance to protect assets that are needed for retirement and future education costs and the amount of the protection also increases with the students age the asset assessment rate for independent students without dependents is 20 fifth step the efc is calculated by adding the contribution from ai to the contribution from ac and then dividing by the number of family members in college special efc conditions in addition to creating common application form and single methodology for determining need congress has also sought to further reduce the application burden for those applicants with family incomes at or below specified threshold under the simplified needs test snt9 the efc calculation does not consider assets for the student or spouse if married or parent if the student is dependent if their adjusted gross income agi is less than 50000 and certain conditions regarding federal tax returns are met10 the automatic zero efc hereinafter autozero efc 11 sets the expected family contribution to zero for dependent students parents and the dependent student or for an independent student 8 independent students without dependents other than spouse receive an employment expense allowance only if they are married and both the student and the spouse are employed 9 hea section 479b 10 to be eligible for snt the student and his or her parents must not have to file an income tax return or must file or be eligible to file federal tax form 1040a or 1040ez individuals who complete federal tax form 1040 solely to claim the hope or lifetime learning tax credit are eligible as well further eligibility for snt can be satisfied if any family member including the applicant has received federal meanstested benefit 11 the same income tax filing requirements and receipt of federal meanstested benefit that apply to snt applicants apply to autozero applicants as well autozero efc is not provided to independent students without dependents crs6 who has dependents and has an agi not greater than 20000 the autozero efc is not provided to independent students without dependents other than spouse fafsa the fafsa is used to collect most of the information that is utilized to calculate the efc applicants are required to report identifying information such as their name and social security number information about the institutions where their information should be forwarded and financial information pertaining to income and assets as mentioned above there are three ways to complete the fafsa via the web electronically through higher education institution or by filling out paper form the paper web and onsite electronic versions of the fafsa differ in the ways that submitted data are treated as result the two electronic versions of the fafsa provide advantages that the paper form does not for example the paper version lacks internal and endofentry data edits that require the applicant to resolve conflicts and complete all necessary fields prior to submission in addition the two electronic versions contain skip logic which enables applicants if they choose to skip over the sections of the fafsa that do not pertain to them as result eligible applicants who apply via the electronic formats are able to take advantage of either the snt or autozero efc because the technology allows sections to be skipped where applicable at present there is comparable approach available for paper form filers efc and packaging fafsa data are submitted to central processor an entity working under contract for the us department of education that calculates the aid applicants efc based on statutorily defined rules from the central processor the efc and other summary data are reported to faas and to the fafsa filer the faa determines the students need for federal student aid and other sources of aid based primarily upon the efc and cost of attendance coa12 this is true for all federal student aid programs eg loans campusbased programs except for the pell grant program13 for nearly all pell recipients the award is calculated by subtracting the efc from the maximum appropriated pell grant for the year ie without regard to the coa the faa determines need in conjunction with each programs award rules and puts together the financial aid award or package which consists of the specific sources and amounts of student aid each applicant will receive to help pay for his or her educationrelated expenses 12 the cost of attendance coa is measure of students educational expenses it is statutorily defined in title iv section 472 of the hea in general it is the sum of tuition and fees an allowance for books supplies transportation and miscellaneous personal expenses and room and board allowance 13 for additional information regarding the pell grant program see crs report rl31668 federal pell grant program of the higher education act background and reauthorization by charmaine mercer crs7 the financial aid package starts with the pell grant the federal foundation for student aid other aid such as campusbased student aid program funds state and institutional aid and federal loans are added to create the students aid package the aid applicant is then notified concerning the composition of the financial aid package some of these calculations vary from faa to faa not only does the aid administrator have some discretion in the awarding of campusbased student aid but section 479a of the hea explicitly gives faas discretion to adjust on case by case basis the coa or the values of the items used to calculate the efc to allow for treatment of an individual eligible applicant with special circumstances the statute offers examples of these special circumstances such as the recent unemployment of family member when the faa might exercise this professional judgement if he or she chooses to do so legislative proposals addressing federal need analysis as discussed simplification of need analysis is perennial issue several proposals have been introduced that attempt to further simplify the process this section reviews major legislation of the 110th congress that addresses need analysis although the college cost reduction and access act ccraa made significant changes to the federal need analysis formula both s 1642 and hr 4137 senate and house hea reauthorization bills include provisions to further amend select aspects of need analysis formula specifically both bills propose to modify the definition of room and board to include room and board allowance for students who live in housing located on military base or who receive basic allowance for housing in addition both bills would exclude the value of military housing or military housing allowance received by student or his or her parent from consideration as untaxed income or benefits in the need analysis formula for other versions of this document see
