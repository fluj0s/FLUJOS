specialist in energy economics resources science and industry division petroleum refining economic performance and challenges for the future summary the petroleum refining industry provides products that are critical to the functioning of the economy virtually all transportation land sea and air is fueled by products that are refined from crude oil industrial residential and commercial activities as well as electricity generation use petroleumbased products along with volatile changes in crude oil prices the industry has faced evolving health safety and environmental requirements which have changed and multiplied product specifications and required capital investment in refineries since the late 1990s the industry has undergone significant structural change which might alter its profitability requirements its ability to provide stable product volumes to the consuming market and its ability to adapt to current and future environmental requirements two significant structural changes characterize the industry mergers acquisitions and joint ventures have changed the ownership profile of the industry altering concentration patterns both regionally and nationally change in the business model from an integrated component to standalone profit center has focused attention on earning competitive profit rates at each stage in the production chain evidence suggests that the new market structure and business model might demand better economic performance from the industry regulatory compliance to meet congressionally mandated environmental standards both on refined products and refinery sites requires substantial capital investment by refiners and has resulted in reduced profitability according to the energy information administration eia to the extent that continued capacity expansion and technological investments are reduced or not undertaken because of low historical rates of return even though recent returns are higher us dependence on imported refined products might increase or product markets could be disrupted by shortages and price spikes as the 110th congress considers energy legislation it is likely to be concerned with domestic energy security and market stability issues linked to the performance of the petroleum refining industry increased imports of refined products particularly motor gasoline combined with growing imports of crude oil could make the united states increasingly vulnerable to shocks originating in the world oil market importing motor gasoline into the united states in appropriate volumes may become increasingly difficult because of the unavailability of world supplies consistent with us fuel specification requirements this report will be updated contents refining economics 2 defining

refining economic performance and challenges for the future the petroleum refining industry processes crude oil and produces variety of products that are used in the transportation residential commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in 2007 over two thirds of refinery output went to transportation uses nearly quarter went to industrial uses and the remainder was used in residences commercial activities and electricity generation the transportation sector remains the most heavily dependent on petroleum drawing over 95 of its fuel needs from refineries because the refining industry plays such key role in providing energy for the us economy its structure and economic condition are matters of national interest in recent years the industry has undergone significant change the traditional industry model based on ownership by vertically integrated oil companies with profitability viewed within the context of linked supply chain has been altered by companies and joint ventures whose primary business is refining increasingly the business model for these firms as well as the integrated oil companies is the stand alone profit center refiners now must earn market rates of return for investors as well as returns sufficient to make investments in expansion technological improvements possible business restructuring and to meet environmental regulations both with respect to refined product specifications and refinery site operations and expansion should the industry fail to meet these marketbased performance standards policy makers may be faced with the prospect of weighing the costs and benefits of decisions taken to mitigate supply and price volatility especially in gasoline markets if the industry determines that it is unable to invest sufficiently to meet projected demand increases additional supplies of refined products will likely be imported if imports were to increase significantly policy makers might need to prioritize the needs of the local markets within the context of national energy security goals the ability of the refining industry to meets its economic challenges will likely determine in part the nature of the energy challenges facing congress this report seeks to describe the recent performance of the refining industry to evaluate the structural changes that are occurring in the industry and to analyze the nature and effects of the challenges confronting the industry crs2 refining economics when considering the economic performance of petroleum refiner several characteristics should be noted first the production process is capital intensive and technological improvements are embodied through investments in the basic refinery as result any circumstance which affects the availability or allocation of capital investment can have significant structural effects on the firm and the industry second the major variable cost in the production process is crude oil the price of which is determined in the world petroleum market third while labor and other variable costs are relatively small fractions of total costs great deal of attention is given to minimizing them in the interests of enhancing profit margins finally regulatory costs both capital and operational required to meet congressionally mandated environmental standards on both refined products and refinery sites increase as new requirements are phased in evaluating the economic performance of the petroleum refining industry is complicated by the fact that many refineries can use crude oil of lower quality as an input while others cannot crude oil can be of lighter or heavier density as well as having higher or lower sulfur content the density of the crude oil is important because in general lighter crude oil input yields lighter product mix lighter product mix is important because lighter products are generally in higher demand and yield higher prices for the refiner does this mean then that refineries that are able should always use the lightest crude oil available not necessarily if the crude oil market pricing mechanism is working well the market compensates for differences in the quality of crude oil by price differential the lightheavy price spread however at any given time the actual specific spread value for any set of crude oils is also influenced by relative availability on the world market as well as the location of the oil as result the value of the spread changes and at any given time the purchase of either light or heavy crude might be warranted by economic conditions if technologically feasible for the refiner table 1 shows the behavior of the lightheavy price spread over time measured in constant dollars following historic peak in the late 1970s the spread dropped sharply with the general collapse in the price of oil in the mid1980s in the early 1990s the spread increased relative to the low values of the late 1980s and as result during the 1990s us refiners invested heavily in technologies that allowed the use of heavier crude oil inputs these investments led to stronger demand for heavy crude oil effectively raising its price and reducing the magnitude of the spread as well as the profit potential of those investments during the recent period of increased crude oil prices from 2004 through 2007 the spread between light and heavy oils has again increased reaching record levels in 2006 by january 2008 the spread had increased to 1879 another record in the longer term it may well be that the relative quantities of light and heavy crude oils available on the market will continue to shift toward the heavier oils this shift if it continues might still validate the financial investments made by refiners in the 1990s and encourage additional investment in refinery enhancement crs3 table 1 us real price spread between light crude oil and heavy crude oil 19832007 dollars per barrel year spread year spread 1983 810 1996 510 1984 397 1997 643 1985 340 1998

information administration petroleum marketing monthly april 2008 table 24 p 49 further complications in refining economics arise from the technology of refining simple refineries those whose technology is limited to basic distillation process produce low yields of light products an output of 20 percent gasoline 30 percent middle distillates and 50 percent heavy residuals based on an input of arabian light crude oil might be typical with an investment in the most sophisticated refinery technologies the output mix might change to as much as 60 percent gasoline 35 percent middle distillates and 5 percent heavy residuals in 2007 motor gasoline earned an average refiner price of 218 per gallon excluding taxes while residual fuel oil brought an average refiner price of 135 per gallon net of taxes this 83 cent per gallon price differential represents premium of almost 61 for motor gasoline compared with residual fuel oil1 table 2 traces the value of the price differential between motor gasoline and heavy residual fuel oil since the mid 1980s while the differential has shown little trend it has shown significant volatility this can affect expected profitability 1 energy

position for complex refinery that has invested in the capability to produce light product mix from heavy crude input is large price spread between light and heavy crude and also large spread between light and heavy products in that environment similar to that observed in 2007 refiner can buy heavy crude to minimize direct input costs and sell light product mix at relatively high prices to enhance the gross margin per barrel the potential for economic gain represented by these two price spreads form the incentive for investing in more complex processing units in the refining process while these units enhance economic performance they require substantial capital investment usually billions of dollars in 2005 refinery capital expenditures by the financial reporting system frs companies in the united states totaled 15 billion up from 81 billion in 2004 likely reflecting the high returns earned by refiners in 2004 as well as other factors2 however in 2006 refinery investment declined to 11 billion decline of 27 when compared to 2005 additionally 57 billion was spent by the frs companies in foreign refinery capital expenditures in 2006 an 2 energy information administration performance profiles of major energy producers 2006 december 2007 table 16 data and charts crs5 increase of 883 not all of this amount was for technological improvements or capacity expansion environmental based investment is also included4 an additional factor in refining economics is crude oil sulfur content defined to also include the presence of heavy metals and contaminants low sulfur crude oil is said to be sweet while crude oil with high sulfur content is said to be sour low sulfur crude oil sells at premium compared to higher sulfur crude oil because substantial investment must be made at the refinery to reduce the sulfur content of the product mix these two factors crude oil density and sulfur content taken together determine the quality differential in crude oil prices at any point in time refiners strive to run an optimal mix of crude oils through their refineries the optimal mix depends on the state of the refineries equipment and technology the desired output product mix and the price spreads on available crude oils and products in the longer term the refiner must decide whether to continue to invest in new technologies as they become available based on expected future values of these factors defining profitability measures of economic performance in the refining industry usually begin with the gross margin the gross margin is defined as the difference between the wholesale composite product price and the composite refiner acquisition cost of crude oil both the product price and the acquisition cost of crude oil must be composites or weighted averages because they reflect the multiproduct nature of refinery output as well as the multigrade character of the crude oils used as refinery inputs the gross margin is simple first approach to refinery profitability it is computed as the total revenues from product sales minus the cost of the largest single input in refinery operations crude oil however other inputs are used and they too generate costs which leads to the net margin the net margin is defined as the gross margin minus petroleum product marketing costs internal energy costs and other operating costs both margins are usually expressed on per barrel basis over time crude oil prices have been volatile reflecting international political and economic events both margins normally respond inversely to movements in the price of crude oil other things held equal an increase in crude oil prices would reduce positive margin and decline in the price of oil would expand the margin of course other things are rarely equal changes in the price of crude oil may be passed on to consumers of petroleum products however refiners ability to pass on price increases and maintain sales volumes may not be equal for each component of the product mix produced by the refinery as result in practice margins may 3 energy information administration performance profiles of major energy producers 2006 december 2007 table 16 data and charts 4

least one of the following control at least 1 of us crude oil production or reserves control at least 1 of us natural gas production or reserves or control at least 1 of us crude oil distillation capacity or product sales in 2001 the frs companies share of refined product output was 85 crs6 increase or decrease when the price of oil increases additionally in some cases the event which accounted for the change in crude oil prices might itself alter specific product demand levels for example when expectations concerning the onset of war in iraq drove up crude oil prices they also reduced the demand for air travel and hence jet fuel lower demand for air travel made it difficult for refiners to pass on cost increases of crude oil while maintaining sales volumes for jet fuel as result of these factors margins are not stable or even predictable during periods of crude oil price volatility the outcome tends to depend on the nature and magnitude of the crude oil price change as well as the level of demand in the product markets over time persistently low margins may have important consequences for the industry low margins may lead to reduced refinery investment which ultimately can lead to constrained domestic capacity and higher product prices but low margins also put pressure on refiners to reduce operating costs and spread fixed costs over larger production runs in an effort to enhance margins the relationships between crude oil quality product price mix and technological improvement make capital investment management important to the refining industry in refining there are several competing demands for investment funds capacity expansion is necessary to keep pace with growing demand siting new refinery is long and expensive process as result virtually all us capacity expansion in the last decade or more has come from enhancing and modifying existing refineries technological investments can improve refinery economics by allowing refiners to use cheaper heavy sour crude oils as inputs and still produce light high value mix of products finally investment must be undertaken to keep both the refinery site and the products it produces in compliance with evolving environmental standards the issues surrounding refinery investment are covered later in this report the most widely used measure of economic performance in the refining industry is return on investment roi5 as with the gross and net margins assessing this measure requires care first refining returns are usually reported together with returns from marketing largely determined by motor vehicle gasoline retail sales marketing net income can also be affected by credit card business performance and convenience store profits neither of which is directly associated with the core business of refining petroleum products second depending on accounting procedures and transfer pricing rules an integrated oil company might report profit as earned in various business activities of the company contrasted to company whose only business is refining third depreciation reduces the net value of assets over time creating an upward bias in roi over time for any specified level of net income fourth business strategy decisions such as whether to distribute products at the retail level through companyowned service stations or through franchises can alter the measured roi by affecting the invested capital base 5 the eia in compiling frs data defines return on investment as net income earned by the us marketingrefining line of business excluding unallocated items mainly interest expense as percentage of net fixed assets involved in us refining and marketing crs7 performance of the refining industry table 3 provides historical data on refining margins for us major refining firms in the frs survey net margins have generally increased since the late 1990s except for sharp decline in 2002 the relationship between the net and gross margins was variable for most of the yeartoyear changes the two margins track each other but in 19921993 and again in 19971998 and again in 20032004 the gross margin decreased while the net margin increased net margins recovered in 2003 from the poor performance of 2002 refining margins reached record highs in 2005 and remained high into 2007 table 3 refining margins of us major oil refiners 19932006 inflation adjusted dollars

table 14 data and charts margin data are expressed in terms of 2005 dollars price adjusted and on the basis of dollars per barrel where barrel equals 42 gallons two factors which reflect refinery economics emerge from the data underlying these margins first general operating costs declined by about 50 percent over the period the refining industry has exerted significant effort in controlling cost and enhancing efficiency second energy costs related to the production process within the refineries have declined this is the result of significant effort by the refining industry to harness waste energy and apply it to productive purpose in the interest of reducing costs for most of the period the combination of volatile prices for crude oil and refined products offset the increases in efficiency implemented at refineries yielding low and volatile margins after 2002 the financial performance of the industry was enhanced by the rising petroleum product prices in the wake of the war crs8 in iraq demand growth in china and other consuming nations and the shortages that resulted from refinery closures in the aftermath of hurricane katrina table 4 shows the mix of us refinery

characterized by increasing demand for most products and increasing prices for refined products along with rising prices for crude oil the potential for instability in crude oil supplies began to play role in late 2003 and affected the market even more in 2004 through 2006 continuing into 2008 crude oil prices as measured by the composite refiner acquisition cost began 2004 at 3093 and ended the year at 3660 with an average price of 3698 reflecting concerns of the effects of war with iraq growing world demand and crs9 instability in other oil producing parts of the world6 while motor gasoline demand for 2004 increased by about 1 the price of gasoline increased by about 24 jet fuel demand increased by about 4 and the price of jet fuel rose by almost 38 distillates demand increased by about 3 while the price increased by about 24 residual demand decreased by about 1 but the average price increased by about 6 overall refined product revenues for the frs companies increased by about 26 from 2004 to 2005 and total refined product costs rose by almost 21 data for 2005 and 2006 suggest much stronger financial performance for the refining industry crude oil prices based on the refiners average composite acquisition cost averaged over 50 per barrel in 2005 and over 60 per barrel in 2006 this led to dramatic spikes in motor gasoline prices and other petroleum product prices the airline industry has continued to show weak demand for jet fuel but the cold winter periods increased the demand for heating oil and diesel fuel demand continued to increase in the short term the demand for most petroleum products appears to be relatively inelastic with respect to price meaning that the rising cost of crude oil can be passed on to consumers with little loss in sales volume yielding high net income for refiners when oil prices are high7 table 5 provides an overview of profitability for the refining and marketing sectors of the frss companies measured by roi the values for roi are complicated by the joint reporting of refining and marketing as noted earlier in this report these two sectors have different capital intensities and different age profiles for their capital stocks leading to differing values of invested capital net of depreciation the data shown in table 5 are somewhat at odds with other measures of industry activity especially those related to capital investment even though roi has become negative twice in the data set production rates and industry capacity continue to expand suggesting that an incentive for capital investment exists how might this behavior be explained for the integrated oil companies even though profit rates might have been low and volatile in refining and marketing it is possible that the firm as whole made adequate returns from other parts of the business notably the production of crude oil however this explanation is not consistent with the profit center business model the industry appears to be adopting for the non integrated oil refiners who constitute larger component of the industry since the wave of merger and acquisition activity of the late 1990s this explanation is not applicable the data in the table 5 indicate that in 2000 roi in domestic refining and marketing was 96 rising to 145 for 2001 an increase in the rate of return of over 50 the declining margins of 2002 left the roi in the negative range for that year the first negative returns since 1992 for 2003 the frs companies 6 petroleum price data from the energy information administration petroleum supply monthly table 1

demand is more elastic in the longer term as consumers are more able to adjust their decisions to the higher prices crs10 domestic roi from refining and marketing rose to 93 setting the stage for the

capacity of the sector declined by about 8 ownership of refining assets has changed as well table 8 shows the top twenty us refiners rated by capacity several observations can be made about this table first in 1980 ownership of refineries was largely held by the major integrated us oil companies in 2006 significant foreign ownership existed including british petroleum plc the fourth largest refiner and pdv america subsidiary of the venezuelan national oil company second the period since 1981 has seen significant merger and acquisition activity within the us oil industry as oil companies sought to acquire expanded crude oil reserves as well as other assets through acquisition and merger with other firms as result of mergers acquisitions and corporate strategy the ownership of many specific refineries has changed hands even though the total capacity of the corporate entity has remained relatively stable for example the bayway refinery in linden new jersey with current capacity of 238000 barrels per day was owned by exxonmobil but is now owned by conocophillips conoco and phillips petroleum were separate companies in 2001 third the industry now has significant capacity operated by firms that are not integrated oil companies at all but specialize in only part of the petroleum supply chain fourth specific joint venture organizations eg motiva enterprises have been created to engage specifically in refining joint ventures have become common because they allow for significant cost and risk reductions through asset sharing and rationalization but do not require the financial and institutional stresses of more direct union through merger or acquisition crs14 table 8 top twenty us refiners 19802005 thousand barrels per day 1980 2006 company capacity company capacity exxon

frontier oil refining 154 tosco 260 murphy oil corp 154 source american petroleum institute basic petroleum data book section viii table 11 october 2007 the characteristics of the refining industry suggest that significant structural change has occurred over the past twenty years much of that change can be attributed to the forces of economic rationalization rather than to economic decline however even if it can be determined that the industrial structure today is stronger than that of the past it still may be that the industry is not fully capable of meeting the challenges of the future one of the most obvious structural changes undergone by the industry is the number and size of available refineries clearly the number of refineries has sharply decreased three factors play role in explaining the decline the end of government regulation technological developments and economic reality the emergency petroleum allocation act of 1973 pl 93159 attempted to ensure an equitable distribution of petroleum products establish equitable prices and preserve the independent sector of the oil industry at time when oil market relationships were in disarray after the oil embargo of 1973 through its supplier purchaser rule the buysell program and the crude oil entitlement program all of which tried to protect small independent refiners the act had the effect of crs15 increasing the incentive to build and own small refineries many of which were inefficient between 1973 and 1981 there was net expansion of 43 refineries 75 newly constructed 32 old units closed all but two of the new refineries had an input capacity of less than 50000 barrels per day which was the average refinery size in 1973 the average capacity of the new refineries that came on line over the period was 14900 barrels per day the utilization rate of the refinery sector declined during the expansion phase in 1973 the capacity utilization rate was 939 but by 1981 it had fallen to 686 the industry was characterized by idle capacity too many producers and many refineries too small to benefit from economies of scale in addition many of the small refineries were very simple distillation facilities unsuited to produce the product slate required by the market and environmental requirements as result good portion of the output of these facilities was only suited to serve as feedstock for larger technically sophisticated refineries president reagan ordered the elimination of the allocation programs that favored the small refiners in 1981 and since then the industry has responded to market forces10 technological and economic rationales for the decline in the number of refineries are linked the market for petroleum products has become heavily skewed toward lighter product mix mainly gasoline to serve demand from the transportation sector lighter product mixes are primarily produced by adding additional technical processing units downstream from the basic distillation procedure the technology and economics of the industry suggest that investment in those downstream facilities is only rational for large scale plants due to significant economies of scale the net effect of these factors may be that the smaller number of larger refineries operating in 2006 are economically and technologically better prepared to meet the requirements of the market than the earlier structure even with far fewer refineries and smaller total capacity although foreign ownership of refineries on us soil has increased this may be the result of continuing process of internationalization of the oil industry us major oil companies have long had presence in all aspects of the industry around the world they have brought quality products as well as technological expertise and investment to many countries today with the largest oil companies even more international in character than in the past the united states is receiving share of the products technology and investment that us oil companies provided and continue to provide around the world threat to us supply security related to foreign ownership might be possible if the owner of the refineries was controlled by foreign governments with oil supply as well as hostile intentions to the united states but this does not seem to be the case in the present pattern of ownership beyond the number of firms and their productive capacity and the extent of foreign ownership another important part of the structure of the refining industry is the degree of concentration concentration refers to the proportion of the total market accounted for by the largest firms in petroleum refining concentration can be determined on the national level and on the regional level the results are quite different the largest national refining companies are not necessarily the most 10 energy information administration the us petroleum refining industry in the 1980s october 1990 p 6 crs16 important refiners in

petroleum industry research foundation inc ny april 2002 p 24 energy information administration httpwwweiadoegov the table shows that on the national level the share of the industry held by the largest five firms has increased from 32 in 1996 to 44 in 2002 and to 49 by 2006 however the top five firms were different in 2006 than in 1996 the top section of the table shows that concentration is generally higher on regional level than on the national level the bottom part of the table reveals however that the firms that dominate refining at the national level are not necessarily the same firms that hold the largest shares of refining capacity in the padds padd 3 which is the gulf coast has the lowest regional concentration 48 this region also has the second largest share held by the leading national refiners and the share of the national leaders has increased by 27 since 1996 however padd 3 production is far greater than regional demand and pipelines connect the major gulf coast refiners to other major consumption markets as result refiners 11 the information on industry concentration in the padds draws from report by the petroleum industry research foundation inc refining concentration and industry dynamics april 2002 12 padd is an acronym for petroleum administration for defense districts the 50 states and the district of columbia were divided into five geographic

the top five regional refiners is over 70 and the share held by the largest national refiners is 57 several features also isolate the region from the rest of the nation first there is major finished product pipeline between padd 5 and the rest of the country this effectively isolates the market from competition from other areas especially padd 3 with its large refineries that compete in other regions of the nation second padd 5 is characterized by the carb california air resources board gasoline unique statemandated formulation which adds to the relative isolation of this market by making gasoline from other areas generally unsuitable in large portions of padd 5 as result the federal trade commission has been especially active in requiring divestiture during mergers and acquisitions in this padd to assure continued competition for example both the exxon mobil and the chevron texaco mergers required divestiture of padd 5 refining assets by at least one of the merging firms many other mergers acquisitions and joint ventures in padd 5 only achieved federal trade commission approval after divestiture in some cases these actions brought new competitors into the region as when bp acquired arcos refineries padd 1 the east coast could be characterized as an open market while it is connected via pipeline to the large refineries on the gulf coast it is also accessible to imports from overseas within the region the largest five national refiners have 49 share of the market while the leading refiner sunoco has approximately 5 share of the national market padd 4 the rocky mountain area is again similar to padd 5 an isolated market but in this case the top five regional refiners hold 51 share while the national leaders hold 27 share13 padd 2 the midwest has had relatively stable pattern of market share and it shares with padd 1 the characteristic of being an open market it is tied by pipeline to padd 3 which supplies the region with approximately 20 of its supplies in summary even though there has been significant merger and acquisition activity in the refining sector the data for the period 1996 to 2001 do not indicate sharply different patterns of industry concentration at the national or regional levels while concentration has increased from 2002 to 2006 because of the economic rationalization and concentration on core competencies that these mergers and acquisitions seem to imply the firms that remain in the industry might well be better positioned for market competition 13 as result of the conoco phillips merger the share of conoco which was the largest regional refiner grew to 25 from 21 this caused the top five share to rise to 66 crs18 challenges facing the refining industry historically the major oil companies treated the refining activity as an integrated part of production stream that ran from exploration to final retail sale of petroleum products one implication of this business model was that the refining sector was not necessarily considered to be standalone profit center refinery profits or losses could be integrated with other parts of the business this model has changed in the 2000s to one requiring each component of the supply chain to pull its own weight or generate sufficient profitability to satisfy investors requirements for return on invested capital this changed business model results at least partly from the entrance into the refining market of large independent companies whose major interest in the petroleum industry is downstream refining and marketing14 given the place of refined products in the economy earning sufficient return on invested capital in the refining industry should be possible after all the industrys output is largely characterized by products that are essential to modern life motor gasoline diesel fuel jet fuel and other products whose demand has generally been growing the industry has also made significant progress in controlling operating costs although the most significant cost that of crude oil is beyond its control the basic challenge to the industry is to maintain competitive roi at the same time that adequate capital is allocated to technological improvements refinery expansion is undertaken to meet forecasted increases in demand and investments to keep refinery products and sites consistent with environmental laws and regulations are made15 if the refining industry is successful in meeting this challenge more stable market will likely prevail if industry is unsuccessful in meeting this challenge the market is more likely to experience instability characterized by supply disruptions and price spikes as well as an increasing dependence on foreign supplies of refined products environmental requirements from refiners point of view most environmental requirements whether they affect product specification or site compliance affect business operations in similar manner they require capital investment in additional stages or technical processes to be added to the refinery the investment process begins with certification and permit approval with regulatory agencies and ultimately moves to design and construction at the refinery to implement the new processes some of the current or expected product specification requirements that are likely to affect refiners over the next several years include reduced sulfur content in gasoline and diesel fuels reductions in smogforming compounds released during handling vapor pressure reduced smogforming emissions from vehicles reformulated gasoline reduced toxics and chemical exposure during handling and storage methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe bans improved engine performance drivability index and the use 14 dj peterson and sergej mahnovski new

this report is not to evaluate the net benefit of any of these requirements or environmental site requirements which form an additional set of restrictions but to recognize that they all have similar impact on the refining industry they require an allocation of resources to capital investment that does not result in lower costs or increased output and are therefore likely to affect the ability of the industry to meet economic performance expectations capital investment capital expenditures in the refining industry serve variety of purposes first they may augment capacity or upgrade technological capability either through the construction of new refineries or through the modification of existing refineries second they may be required to allow both or either the produced products or the site itself to meet environmental requirements third capital expenditures may be used for mergers and acquisitions as discussed earlier in this report there has been significant investment in new refineries in the united states in the past twenty five years however investment has taken place to enhance the capacity of existing facilities investment in capacity expansion and technology is expected to generate profits enhancing the net margin and yielding positive roi environmental investments are different they are required to allow the refinery to stay in operation but they yield little or direct financial return for the refiner they are either absorbed from profits or passed on to the consumer or both since they increase the capital value of the refinery but yield net revenue they can reduce the overall roi depending on cost pass through to the consumer capital expenditure for merger and acquisition has dominated the investment picture in the refining industry since the late 1990s these expenditures are made for variety of reasons from entering or expanding firms presence in the industry to rationalizing refining strategy to production and marketing goals or by legal directive as in conjunction with the stipulations to complete merger or acquisition firms expect these expenditures also to be profitable at least in the longer term even though refining and marketing profitability has grown with the oil price increases since 2004 the profit and cash rich position of integrated oil companies and domestic refining companies may not translate into capital investment in the refining sector the choice to invest in new refinery is actually decision to produce an additional barrel of refined petroleum products for the us market growth in product demand especially gasoline suggests that the demand for the additional product is fairly certain the question remains what is the cheapest way to provide that extra product to the market four possible answers exist first company could decide to expand the capacity of an existing refinery second company could build new refinery third company could decide to import the extra production into the united states 16 ibid p 22 crs20 fourth company could acquire the refinery of another company the fundamental economics as well as the market and regulatory environments suggest that all other things equal construction of new refineries is not likely to be the chosen alternative over the past two decades refiners have chosen to expand existing refineries in preference to new construction the reasons are part economic and part regulatory economic rationales favor expansion over new construction because the fixed cost associated with new facility can be avoided and economies of scale at the expanded facility can be realized satisfying regulatory requirements for an expansion at an existing facility are likely to be less costly less time consuming and less subject to challenge by local groups compared to new facility given the economics of the oil market it may remain cheaper to import extra petroleum products than to produce them in the united states excess capacity for gasoline that meets us specifications is available in europe and other parts of the world similarly it may also be cheaper for any given company to expand its refining capacity by purchasing assets from other companies while this strategy may improve the supply position of the acquiring firm it does little to improve the supply position of the us market as whole special circumstances may justify construction of new facility such facility is planned for construction in arizona17 in the case of the arizona facility the refinery is positioned to supply products to the persistently tight southern california market where high margins might be earned using mexican crude oil as an input although the permitting process for this facility is nearing completion it has been in process for over five years another new proposed us refinery project is to be located in south dakota and produce ultra low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel the source of crude oil would be from canadian oil sands and the refinery is expected to use about 400000 bd of crude oil the cost of the refinery has been estimated at between 8 and 10 billion18 17 sarah reynolds east county oil refinery will move the yuma sun

table 6 p 10 mergers and acquisitions figure 1 shows the behavior of refining capital investment by the frs companies since the late 1980s isolating both environmental and merger and acquisition based expenditures the effect of environmental requirements specifically the clean air act amendments of 1990 pl 101549 on capital expenditures are shown in the figure in the late 1980s capital expenditures for environmental purposes averaged 05 billion annually in inflation adjusted dollars to meet the oxygenated gasoline reduced sulfur diesel fuel and reformulated gasoline mandates of pl 101549 investment peaked at 27 billion in 1992 and remained above 2 billion for the following two years in inflation adjusted dollars according to the eia these environmental investments made substantial contributions to the reduced roi of the refining industry during the period 1991 to 1995 the eia has determined that roi was reduced by 69 over the period as result of the implementation of federal environmental statutes andor the clean air act amendments both phase i and phase ii of the complex emission regulations for reformulated gasoline in 1998 and 2000 respectively caused increases in capital expenditures in anticipation of their effective dates the eia determined that roi was reduced by 42 from 1996 to 2001 as result of environmentally based capital expenditures19 the challenge for the industry is how it responds to the next round of required environmental investments given this experience estimates forwarded in the 2003 19 the energy information administration the impact of

sulfur diesel requirements by 2006 and perhaps 1015 billion additional to meet other mandates20 the american petroleum institute sees the total cost of meeting the 2006 onroad ultra low sulfur diesel requirements at 8 billion it sees an additional 8 billion investment to meet gasoline sulfur reduction requirements21 the range of investment cited is large and significant uncertainty remains concerning actual values if accurate there could be some concern that environmentally based claims on capital expenditure might crowd out other investments in that case investment in capacity expansion might not be funded even though potentially profitable that lack of investment could drive up capacity utilization rates even higher which would likely increase the fragility of the market and make it more open to price volatility and quantity disruption the strength of the crowdingout argument diminishes when the rapid increase in capital expenditure shown in figure 1 for mergers and acquisitions from 1999 to 2001 is considered clearly the ability to raise capital either in the form of debt or equity must have been available to the industry to fund the approximately threefold increase in investment from 1999 to 2001 much of it to finance mergers and acquisitions the ability of the industry to manage and balance its capital investment budget between competing claims may well be an important determinant of how well the industry is able to meet increasing demand with new environmentally compatible capacity production and growth in its reference case forecast the eia projects that refined products consumed will increase from 207 million barrels per day in 2004 to 227 million barrels per day in 2015 and 269 million barrels per day in 203022 this growth implies an average annual growth rate of 11 over the period another way of looking at the projected growth is to note that if it were to be met by domestic refining capacity it would require capacity increments of approximately 238000 barrels per day per year this would be equivalent to the production capacity of one new large refinery an additional similarly sized refinery would have to be added to the capacity base each year to meet projected market requirements alternatively capacity expansion based on technological improvements would have to continue at high rate for the 26year period set against this forecast of increasing demand is the incrementally increasing capacity of the industry as well as the declining number of refineries the last new refinery to open in the united states was the petro star refinery in valdez alaska in 1993 which had an original capacity of 38000 barrels per day and was simple refinery the last refinery of significant capacity 200000 barrels per day or more 20

louisiana which opened in 1977 more than 30 years ago23 with this historical record construction of new 400000 barrelperday capacity refinery per year to meet projected demand growth would appear to be major challenge several factors come into play in the refining industrys plan to meet forecasted market requirements even though new refineries were constructed during the 1990s and the number of refineries declined refinery capacity increased on average 15 per year if projected into the future this growth is sufficient to meet the eia long term forecast of demand increases for refined products these increases in capacity are due to investment in new processing units marginal expansion known as capacity creep obtained through bottleneck removal and more intensive use of existing capacity by lengthening time between maintenance and overhaul this type of expansion ultimately could encounter diminishing returns although the record of the industry suggests that even more capacity might be squeezed out of the existing stock of refineries another key factor in maintaining production is capacity utilization capacity utilization rates remain high approximately 93 in 2003 and almost 91 in 2002 the capacity utilization rate has remained above 90 every year since 1993 excess capacity is luxury refiner seems anxious to support because of its effect on profitability this view is borne out by executives who participated in the rand study24 imports with capacity utilization rates near maximum new refinery construction likely and growth through capacity creep less than the growth in eia projected demand imports of petroleum products would seem to play an increasingly important role in the supply of refined products refined product imports mostly from canada the caribbean and europe have been an important component of the total supply equation for some years in 2006 petroleum product imports of all types totaled about 35 million barrels per day which amounted to approximately 17 of total product supplied to the us market import dependence on refined products has averaged approximately 6 of total product supplied since 1992 however the percentage has increased in each of the past six years most observers feel that there is sufficient short run capacity in the world market to expand us imports with the expansion of specific blends of motor gasoline for specific regional or state markets posing the greatest potential challenge table 10 shows data from 1992 to 2006 for total petroleum product imports as well as the most significant sector motor

information administration annual energy review 2006 table 53 p129 and computations by the author the table shows that imports of motor gasoline and blending components began more or less steady upward movement in 1996 imports of these two items increased by 60 in 1996 compared to 1995 and since then have increased by another 128 over the period covered in table 10 the increase in motor gasoline and blending components accounts for about 80 of the increase in the imports of all petroleum products the total increase in petroleum product imports without motor gasoline and blending components is less than 61 over the period while the increase in motor gasoline and blending components is 223 imported petroleum products other than gasoline and gasoline blending components include wide variety of distillate fuel oils jet fuel liquefied petroleum gases residual fuel oil unfinished oils and other products several difficulties could emerge as increased reliance is placed on imports the first issue is sourcing if worldwide economic growth continues to remain sluggish an excess of world refining capacity could persist and the us market might well continue to find product available european sources accounted for over 50 of motor vehicle gasoline and 40 of gasoline blending component imports in 2007 continued availability of european stocks at volumes comparable or greater crs25 than these levels may not be sustainable europe is undergoing transformation of its transportation fuels mix while its refinery capacity is largely oriented toward gasoline production due to past investment decisions the european vehicle fleet is rapidly moving toward diesel fuel the implication is that until refinery conversion is completed european refiners will have an excess supply of gasoline to sell on the world market as result the long term availability of european supplies of gasoline may diminish as the us demand for gasoline continues to grow slow growth in the asian economies excluding china continues to hold back the growth of demand for gasoline in the region before the financial crisis in 1997 asian gasoline growth rates were the highest in the world until economic recovery is complete and demand growth comparable to precrisis levels returns the asian market is also likely to have excess refining capacity near term sourcing of imports then from europe as well as asia seems relatively secure in the longer term structural change in the european fuel mix and the recovery of asian demand growth may limit available imports the second factor influencing the viability of increased reliance on imports is the segmented nature of the us gasoline market gasoline in the united states is longer fungible or easily transferable product differing us regional and state air quality standards with respect to fuel specifications have produced market where shortages may appear because gasoline of particular specification is tight even though gasoline of other specifications might be available as the large us market is divided into smaller submarkets that demand fuels not required in other regions or other parts of the world it might become difficult to find refiners on the world market willing to customize production to satisfy particular us demands the result can be that spot shortages and price spikes similar to those that occurred in chicago in 2002 in conjunction with the elimination of mtbe as gasoline additive availability as well as price considerations suggest that if gasoline were standardized commodity rather than specialized good it would be less likely to be linked to local market instability final factor regarding imports has to do with long and short run matching of demand and supply the eia forecast indicates long term need for imported refined products mainly gasoline and blending components recently there has been growing market in very short run target of opportunity cargoes of refined products that is an almost speculative market has developed in which tanker might load cargo without firm buyer at port where gasoline is available at an attractive price the owner of the cargo then directs the tanker to the port at which the best price might be earned on the one hand this type of activity represents market forces directing supply to areas with high demand on the other hand the process may represent somewhat opportunistic and uncertain way of securing supplies it is not hard to imagine scenario where this type of supply dependency might periodically lead to market disruptions complete with shortages and price spikes permits and regulatory uncertainty an important concern of the refining industry is largely administrative and regulatory as noted earlier in this report the refining industry is working within long term program of implementing congressionally mandated environmental crs26 standards some see the regulated environment as an opportunity some participants in the rand study noted that regulations formed barrier to entry into the market the result might be higher profits for which they cite california refiners who are faced with the most stringent set of federal state and local environmental regulations in the nation and yet operate the most profitable refineries in the nation25 in general however the rand study reports significant concern in the industry regarding the administration and implementation of the regulatory process26 according to the rand study the best case regulatory process from the industrys point of view is one that minimizes uncertainty and maximizes flexibility the industrys preference is to see regulatory roadmap laid out which covered an adequately long planning horizon say decade they would like to see plan where regulations contradict or compete with one another they would like to see phasing in of regulations in manner that minimizes pressure put on construction or investment timetables and plans they would like to see smooth timely permitting process in which administrative delays are minimized industry would also prefer to have flexibility in how technologically to meet environmental standards27 conclusions the petroleum refining industry forms critical infrastructure in the us economy it provides products which allow america to move whether by air land or sea but it must accomplish this while maintaining national and regional environmental standards the industry has demonstrated that this is possible there has been minimal market disruption that can be traced to the refining sector over the past twenty years however the eia annual energy forecast 2006 suggests that the industry is unlikely to be able to maintain this performance over the planning period to 2030 without the domestic market becoming significantly more dependent on imported motor gasolines and blending components increased import dependency implies the potential for both supply disruption as well as national energy security concerns the eia has found that the legacy of past environmental requirements on the industry have been substantially reduced roi the industry has been able to absorb these lower rates of return in the past largely because of the ownership structure of the industry and the associated business model new market structure and business model might implicitly require better economic performance from the industry to the extent that the performance of roi negatively affects decisions concerning continued capacity expansion and technological investment in the industry the effect of the structural changes in the industry might have national energy policy implications 25 dj peterson and sergej mahnovski new forces at work in refining rand science and
