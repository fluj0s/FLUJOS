generating surplus tax revenues however under the intermediate assumptions of the social security board of trustees the trust funds are estimated to be depleted in 2040 at which point 74 of benefits would be payable with incoming receipts the primary reason is demographics between 2010 and 2030 the number of people aged 65 and older is projected to grow by 76 while the number of workers supporting the system is projected to grow by 6 in addition the trustees project that the system will begin running cash flow deficits in 2017 at which point other federal receipts would be needed to meet benefit costs if there are other surplus governmental receipts policymakers would have three options raise taxes or other income reduce spending or borrow this report analyzes the effect of 12 social security solvency options on social security beneficiaries these 12 individual options fall into 6 categories of reform proposals for some reform options we present two or more variations on how they could be approached they include the most commonly discussed or introduced proposals to improve cash flow and achieve social security solvency reducing the annual cost of living adjustment cola increasing the number of computation years in the benefit formula increasing the full retirement age fra longevity indexing initial social security benefits progressive price indexing initial social security benefits increasing earnings subject to social security payroll taxes by raising or eliminating the taxable earnings base the primary rationale for all of these options is to help achieve solvency by either cutting benefits reducing spending or increasing payroll taxes there are also secondary reasons for most of the options for example encouraging longer working careers accounting for increased longevity making the payroll tax more progressive etc each section of the report focuses on one reform category and explains current social security policy reasons why some policymakers propose this particular type of reform how the reform proposal works the distributional effects of the reform proposal on various types of social security beneficiaries and legislation related to the reform being analyzed distributional effects are presented in terms of social security beneficiaries median payroll tax increase or benefit reduction and show the varied effect of these reforms on beneficiaries along socioeconomic lines ie age type of benefit received and income quintile crs analysts used the dynasim microsimulation model to project the effects of these reforms on social security beneficiaries in 2035 assuming the reforms first take effect in 2013 this report will not be updated

system is facing longterm financing problem social security is primarily payasyougo system in which todays workers pay for the benefits of todays retirees for every dollar paid into the social security system approximately 75 cents is immediately paid out in benefits currently the system is generating surplus tax revenues which are invested in bonds and credited to the social security trust funds however under the intermediate assumptions of the social security trustees the system will begin running cash flow deficits in 2017 at which point social security must redeem any bonds including interest accumulated in previous years unless the government is running surplus redeeming the bonds would require cuts in overall spending payroll tax increases andor borrowing the trustees project that the trust funds will be depleted in 2040 at which point 74 of benefits would be payable with incoming receipts the primary reason is demographics between 2010 and 2030 the number of people age 65 and older is projected to grow by 76 while the number of workers supporting the system is projected to grow by 6 this report analyzes how 12 options to improve social security solvency would affect social security beneficiaries in 2035 compared with current law 1 they include the most commonly discussed or introduced proposals to improve cash flow and achieve social security solvency crs takes position for or against any of the options presented in this report the presentation of options in the report moves from least complex to most complex the ordering of the 12 options and the assumptions used in their analysis reflect policy recommendations or preferences on the part of crs for some reform options two or more variations on how they could be approached are presented each option would affect beneficiaries differently this report assumes that all of the options take effect in 2013 and shows the distributional impact of each option in 2035 using results from the dynasim microsimulation model 2 the following section outlines some of the major findings on how each option would affect beneficiaries the dynasim model is not an actuarial model and so cannot produce solvency estimates for these options g15g138g147g152g155g561g8g146g151g141g146g151g144g156g561 as shown in figure 1 the magnitude of the benefit change that beneficiaries would experience varies greatly by policy option median benefit reductions for individuals receiving social security benefits in 2035 range from 11 for reducing the social security cola by 1 percentage point to reduction for the options to eliminate or raise the taxable earnings base 1 those unfamiliar with the social security reform debate or the social security program may wish to first read the following reports crs

in order to maintain purchasing power over time social security benefits are increased annually by costofliving adjustment cola the cola is based on inflation ie price growth and is applied starting in the year after an individual becomes eligible for benefits this report examines two options to reduce the annual cola 1 reducing the cola by half percentage point and 2 reducing the cola by one percentage point overall an estimated 98 of beneficiaries in 2035 would be affected by reduction in the cola among social security beneficiaries in 2035 half percentage point reduction in the cola would result in median benefit cut of approximately 6 one percentage point reduction would result in median benefit cut of approximately 11 3 the longer beneficiary has been eligible for benefits the more his or her benefits would be cut because of reductions to the cola 3 this analysis includes all social security beneficiaries in 2035 regardless of whether they are receiving retired worker spousal survivor or disabledworker benefits the analysis presents results for the beneficiary at the median this means that half of the beneficiary population in 2035 would experience larger benefit reductions and half of the beneficiary population in 2035 would experience smaller or benefit reductions

for benefits would be disproportionately affected by both cola options since the effect of the cola reduction would be compounded for longer period of time including older beneficiaries women

social security benefits are calculated using the highest 35 years of workers taxable earnings this report examines two options to increase the number of computation years from 35 to 38 1 where all newly eligible beneficiaries are affected and 2 where only newly eligible retirement and survivor beneficiaries are affected while disability beneficiaries are held harmless overall an estimated 83 of all beneficiaries in 2035 would be affected by change in the number of computation years if every newly eligible beneficiary was subject to the option an estimated 67 of all beneficiaries in 2035 would be affected if disability beneficiaries were exempt from the change among beneficiaries in 2035 increasing the number of computation years from 35 to 38 would result in median benefit cut of approximately 2 regardless of whether disability beneficiaries are held harmless the effects of increasing the number of computation years shown in this report are driven mostly by the fact that some beneficiaries become eligible before the option is assumed to take effect in 2013 and thus are not affected by the option some groups of beneficiaries are more likely to become eligible for benefits after the option takes effect this includes those who are younger have higher incomes are retired worker beneficiaries and are disability beneficiaries unless they are held harmless variations on the computation year options that would increase the number of computation years from 35 to 40 were also analyzed these options yielded greater benefit reductions with nearly identical distributional effects g11g151g140g155g142g138g156g146g151g144g561g157g145g142g561g8g158g149g149g561g20g142g157g146g155g142g150g142g151g157g561g3g144g142g561g507g8g20g3g508g561 social securitys full retirement age fra is gradually increasing from 65 to 67 under current law this report examines an option that would accelerate the currentlaw increase in the fra and then further increase the fra to age 70 this option would affect beneficiaries born in 1951 or later increasing the fra would create an incenti ve for individuals to work longer or to delay taking up social security benefits overall an estimated 64 of all beneficiaries in 2035 would be affected by increasing the fra under this option among beneficiaries in 2035 increasing the fra would result in median benefit reduction of 2 overall the fra increase is phased in gradually over time thus each successive cohort of beneficiaries would have deeper benefit cuts until the option is fully phased in as result younger beneficiaries would have larger benefit reductions than would older beneficiaries httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33840g17g153g157g146g152g151g156g561g157g152g561g3g141g141g155g142g156g156g561g21g152g140g146g138g149g561g21g142g140

affected by the option to raise the fra since all disability and most survivor beneficiaries would be held harmless under this option majority of beneficiaries in each income quintile would receive benefit reduction of less than 10

despite the currentlyscheduled increase in the social security full retirement age fra the fra has not been adjusted to fully account for increasing longevity people retiring today at the fra are receiving benefits for longer period of time than those retiring at the fra when the system was designed this report examines two options to index ie link reductions in initial social security benefits to increases in longevity 1 longevity indexing the primary insurance amount pia formula factors and 2 longevity indexing the pia value and holding di beneficiaries harmless until they reach the fra overall an estimated 84 of all beneficiaries in 2035 would be affected by longevity indexing the pia formula factors for all newly eligible beneficiaries an estimated 71 of beneficiaries in 2035 would be affected by longevity indexing the pia value and exempting disability beneficiaries until they reached the fra among beneficiaries in 2035 longevity i ndexing the pia formula factors would result in median benefit reduction of appr oximately 5 longevity indexing the pia value and holding disabled beneficiaries harmless until they reached the fra would result in median benefit reduction of about 2 compared with current law the effects of longevity indexing increase over time thus each successive cohort of beneficiaries would have deeper benefit cuts as result younger beneficiaries would have larger benefit reductions than would older beneficiaries retired workers and higherincome beneficiaries would also be disproportionately affected by both longevity indexing options due to interactions of the policy changes with currentlaw social security program rules

currently initial social security benefits are calculated based on an individuals past earnings which are indexed ie linked to wage grow th progressive price indexing would involve indexing the initial social security benefits of newly eligible beneficiaries to combination of wage and price growth lowearning individuals would receive benefit that is indexed closer to wage growth and highearning indi viduals would receive benefit that is indexed closer to price growth ie inflation since wages have historical ly grown faster than prices this change would progressively cut benefits overall an estimated 69 of all beneficiaries in 2035 would be affected by progressive price indexing among beneficiaries in 2035 progressive price indexing would result in median benefit reduction of about 4 compared with current law the effects of progressive price indexing increase over time thus each successive cohort of beneficiaries would have deeper benefit cuts as result younger beneficiaries would have larger benefit reductions than would older beneficiaries

benefit reductions than lowerincome beneficiaries since the option is designed to be progressive

security payroll taxes are levied on earnings up to maximum dollar amount set each year called the taxable earnings base 4 the taxable earnings base serves as both cap on contributions to the system ie payroll taxes and cap on benefits this report examines the effects of 1 raising the dollar amount of the taxable earnings base to 100 of aggregate covered earnings in the us eliminating the taxable earnings base and 2 raising the dollar amount of the taxable earnings base to 90 of aggregate covered earnings in the us instead of the 85 currently taxed overall an estimated one in five beneficiaries would earn more than the currentlaw earnings base at some point in their lifetimes and thus be affected by raising or eliminating the base however in given year fewer than 8 of workers are projected to earn more than the currentlaw taxable earnings base and only 1 of workers are projected to earn more than base that covered 90 of all earnings looking only at beneficiaries in 2035 who ever earn more than the current base the median increase in payroll taxes would be 3 and the median increase in benefits would be 2 compared with current law if the base were completely eliminated eliminating the taxable earnings base would affect primarily highincome beneficiaries half of all beneficiaries in the highest income quintile in 2035 would see their payroll taxes and benefits rise although most would have relatively small increases for example in the highest quintile 12 of beneficiaries would have payroll tax increases of 10 or more and 8 of beneficiaries would have benefit increases of 10 or more since each year only 1 of the population earns 10 of all earnings the distributional effects of raising the taxable earnings base to cover 90 of earnings is nearly identical to eliminating the base entirely the only difference between the options is that the share of individuals who have large payroll tax and benefit changes declines if the base is capped at 90 of earnings policymakers could also raise or eliminate the taxable earnings base for tax purposes only and not credit the additional earnings toward an individuals benefits under this variation the estimates of payroll tax increases would be the same as the options above but benefits would be unchanged 4 social security payroll taxes are levied on covered earnings upon benefit receipt individuals within certain income brackets may pay income taxes on their social security benefit payments the analysis in this report focuses exclusively on the distributional effects of raising or eliminating the level of earnings subject to payroll taxes httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33840g17g153g157g146g152g151g156g561g157g152g561g3g141g141g155g142g156g156g561g21g152g140g146g138g149g561g21g142g140

rationale for all of the options in this report is to improve the solvency of the social security system all of the options would enhance longrange solvency by either cutting benefits or increasing payroll taxes there are also secondary rationales behind most of the optionsfor example some would reward longer working careers or account for increases in longevity the options in this report include the most commonly discussed or introduced proposals to improve cash flow and achieve social security solvency5 each option in this report is analyzed in isolation but it is important to note that the options are typically proposed in combination with one another andor with other social security reform features such as individual accounts or benefit enhancements for low earners6 the options analyzed in this report can be viewed as set of building blocks for comprehensive social security reform

year 2013 was chosen since many policymakers have indicated desire to leave the benefits of individuals who are currently age 55 or older unchanged since they would have little time to alter their savings work or retirement plans with the exception of the option to increase the full retirement age none of the options presented in this report are phased in gradually over time any of the options could be implemented before or after 2013 or could be phased in gradually this analysis aims to compare all of the reform options using consistent assumptions and under identical circumstances however for some options all beneficiaries would be affected starting in 2013 including those who became eligible for benefits before 2013 eg reducing the cola for other options only new beneficiariesthose who become eligible for benefits in 2013 or laterwould be affected eg progressive price indexing initial social security benefits these differences are dictated by the nature of the reform options themselves and the particular social security program rules affected by these reform options

focuses on the effects of policy changes on beneficiaries in 2035 the figures and accompanying analysis are essentially snapshot of the projected beneficiary population in this single year focusing on different ye ar would lead to different results 5 some solvency options such as increasing the social security coverage of state and local government workers altering the taxation of social security benefits or investing portion of the so cial security surplus in equities cannot currently be modeled in this version of dynasim therefore these options are not included among the options analyzed in this report 6 combining any of the options with one another or with other features could significantly alter their distributional impacts thus it is not possible to sum the results of any combination of options shown in this report since the options could interact in unexpected ways

competing goals the first goal is to allow sufficient amount of time to pass for the differing effects of the policy options to become clear once the new policies are implemented since all of the options are assumed to begin in 2013 by 2035 most beneficiaries would be affected an earlier date may not capture the disparate effects of the options particularly for those options with relatively small annual changes the second goal is to provide the most reliable information possible since it is impossible to accurately predict the future all projection models contain some level of uncertainty the further into the future one projects the greater the estimates may ultimately deviate from reality the most accurate data are the actual observations that exist when the projection period began the youngest individuals eligible to receive retirement benefits in 2035 would have been born in the early 1970s and so actual data would be included in the models projection of their retirement benefits extending the analysis to periods much later than 2035 would rely more heavily on the models assumptions about future trends under some of the options not all beneficiaries in 2035 would be affected this is because some of the options apply only to beneficiaries who become eligible for benefits in 2013 or later eg progressive price indexing for these options th analysis in 2035 will show sizable group of beneficiaries who are not subject to the change since they became eligible for benefits before 2013 because the proportion of beneficiaries who become eligible for benefits before 2013 varies significantly by socioeconomic characteristics the date of implementation drives many of the results in 2035 particularly the results by age results shown for 2035 also do not reflect the full impact of the options over time the effect of some options increases over time eg longevity indexing under these options each successive cohort of beneficiaries would be affected more than the last so that beneficiary who becomes eligible 50 years after implementation would be affected much more than beneficiary who becomes eligible in the first year all other things being equal for other options the magnitude of the benefit change does not increase over time eg increasing the number of computation years under these options each successive cohort of be neficiaries would be subject to the same rules so that beneficiary who becomes eligible 50 years after implementation would experience the same magnitude of change as beneficiary who becomes eligible in the first year all other things being equal since the analysis in this report focuses on single year these distinctions are not shown

beneficiaries in 2035 by benefit type age group andor other categories these figures show the median percentage difference between benefits under current law and benefits under the option 7 the median is the midpoint in group of values such that half the values are above the median and half are below unlike mean or average median will not be skewed by small number of extremely large or extremely small values for ex ample consider five beneficiaries affected by policy option one loses her entire benefit under the option meaning she has change of 7 the report compares benefits under each option to scheduled benefits under current law some other analyses compare benefits under policy options to payable benefits or the level of benefits that could be funded with current funding levels however

compared with current law the median percentage change for this group would be 2 because 2 is the third value of the five values arranged from least to greatest the mean percentage change would be 22 because it is the sum of all five values divided by five since policy changes sometimes result in very large benefit changes such as beneficiaries gaining or losing benefit for few beneficiaries the median is good measure of how policy would affect typical beneficiary the analysis for each option also includes figure that shows the magnitude of the change for all beneficiaries broken down by income quintile to show whether an option is progressive or regressive for more information on income quintiles please see the subsection below called breakdowns by income quintile these figures show how beneficiaries at different levels of income would be affected for example the figure s show what proportion of beneficiaries in each of the five quintiles have benefit reductions of up to 10 reductions from 10 to 19 etc if lowincome beneficiaries would receive deeper cuts under an option relative to highincome beneficiaries that option is regressive if highincome beneficiaries would receive deeper cuts under an option relative to lowincome beneficiaries that option is progressive every attempt has been made to be consistent in the presentation of the results of the analysis the same benefit reduction scale has been used in all figures across the various reform options so as not to visually skew the results furthermore the figures for all of the options include the entire dynasim population with one exception due to the nature of the results from the policy option most of the figures for the options to raise or eliminate the taxable earnings base include only beneficiaries who would be affected by the option since relatively small share of beneficiaries would be affected by the options to raise or eliminate the taxable earnings base including the entire dynasim population in the figures for these options would show only that the average beneficiary in each subgroup was not affected

population by the type of social security benefits they receive four types of social security beneficiaries are analyzed in this report retired worker beneficiaries who receive social security benefit based on their own earnings disabled worker beneficiaries who receive social security disability benefit based on their own earnings spouse beneficiaries who receive social security retirement benefit based on their working spouses earnings and survivor beneficiaries who receive social security survivor benefits based on their deceased spouses earnings some individuals may qualify for more than one type of benefit in the analysis that follows the retirement benefits only category and the disability benefits only category are made up of beneficiaries who receive solely retired or disabled worker benefit not spouse or survivor benefit the survivor benefits category and the spouse benefits category include both beneficiaries who receive solely spouse or survivor benefits as well as those who receive both spouse or survivor benefit and retired or disabled worker benefit ie dually entitled beneficiaries the disability benefit only category includes both beneficiaries receiving disability benefits in 2035 and those who originally received disability benefits but automatically converted to retirement benefits at the full retirement age as required by law

most of the policy options include figures in the report that break down the beneficiary population by age group these categories reflect beneficiaries ages as of 2035 it is important to note that beneficiaries in the age 61 and younger category are primarily disability beneficiaries but also include some aged survivor beneficiaries who began to receive benefits at age 60 or 61 other social security beneficiaries who are eligible to receive benefits before age 60such as young widowers children of retired disabled or deceased workersare not included in the analysis in this report for retirement beneficiaries the earliest age of eligibility is age 62 thus retirement beneficiaries are included in the age 61 and younger category

beneficiary population by income quintile in other words they separate the dynasim population into five equal parts the onefifth with the highest incomes the onefifth with the secondhighest incomes etc down to the onefifth with the lowest income for the pu rposes of this analysis income includes social security benefits supplemental security income ssi benefits pension payments earnings and the annuitized value of financial assets income is calculated on per capita basis which means that for married couples the income of both spouses is averaged together it is important to note the distinction between income levels and social security benefit amounts some beneficiaries with relatively low social security benefit amounts may be included in one of the higher income quintiles and vice versa for example beneficiary married to person with high income may be in one of the higher income quintiles despite receiving small social security benefit similarly beneficiary with relatively large social security benefit but with other income may be in one of the lower income quintiles

sometimes the results shown in this report may be unexpected for example an option to cut social security benefits could result in small number of beneficiaries receiving an increase in their benefits such counterintuitive results are not errors but interactions between the option and the current law social security rules for example the interaction between the current law retirement earnings test ret and certain options to reduce benefits leads to benefit increases for some beneficiaries who were subject to the ret before reaching the full retirement age but are currently older than the full retirement age for full explanation of how this interaction works please see appendix c one of the advantages of microsimulation model such as dynasim is that it brings unexpected interactions between policy options and program rules to light social security is complex program and changes to its structure could result in unintended consequences where relevant these issues are highlighted in the

percentage points and reducing the annual cola by 10 percentage point projected future cola increases are taken from the 2005 social security trustees report to model the first policy option above the annual projected cola increase in 2013 of 28 is reduced by 05 percentage points to be 23 ie 28 minus 05 to model the second policy option above the projected currentlaw cola in 2013 of 28 would be reduced to 18 ie 28 minus 10 since the 05 percentage point and 10 percentage point reductions would also apply each year after 2013 the size of the redu ction would be compounded over time so with each additional year of eligibility the reduction would increase 13 for both options the changes are assumed to begin in 2013 and to affect all social security beneficiaries including disabled beneficiaries and those who began to receive benefits before the change was implemented

she would be affected by reductions to the cola since the effects of the option compound over time for example the first year after an individual becomes eligible for benefits his or her benefit would be 05 lower than current law if the cola were reduced by half percentage point and 10 lower than current law if the cola were reduced by one percentage point each year the difference between benefits under the cola option and current law increases so that by the 10th year of benefit eligibility benefits would be 5 lower than current law if the cola were reduced by half percentage point and 9 lower than current law if the cola were reduced by one percentage point by the 30th year of benefit eligibility benefits would be 14 lower than current law if the cola were reduced by half percentage point and 25 lower than current law if the cola were reduced by one percentage point continued changed the way the cpi is calculated reducing the growth of the cpi by an estimated 07 percentage points

example some analysts suggest using the experimental price index for americans 62 years of age or older cpie rather than the cpiw among other differences the cpie takes into account the rising cost of

index for the elderly by brian w cashell 13 for example after 21 years of benefit eligibility the reduction in benefits under an option that cut the cola by half percentage point would be just over 10

and 2035 groups of beneficiaries with relatively long periods of eligibility would be disproportionately affected by both cola options these groups include older beneficiaries women survivors disabled beneficiaries and lowincome beneficiaries the oldest beneficiaries tend to receive benefits for long periods because of their longevity women have longer life expectancies than men survivor beneficiaries may become eligible for benefits at younger age and tend to live longer than other types of beneficiaries 14 disability beneficiaries also become eligible for benefits at younger ages lowincome beneficiaries are more likely to be female and also to receive disability and survivor benefits15

half percentage point is assumed to be implementedthe median benefit reduction would be 6 the size of the benefit reduction under the cola options increases the longer beneficiary is eligible for

median benefit cut of about 1 under the option to reduce the cola by half percentage point among the beneficiaries analyzed in this report those under age 62 are almost all disability beneficiaries in 2035 96 of beneficiaries in this category are projected to receive disability benefits and 4 are projected to have taken up survivor benefits at age 60 or 61 in contrast beneficiaries over age 85 are projected to have median benefit cuts of about 11 surviving spouses who receive benefits longer on average than other beneficiaries would receive the largest reductions of any benefit type under the option to reduce the cola by half percentage point in 2035 survivor beneficiaries are estimated to have median benefit reduction of about 10 compared with current law 14 women make up the substantial

the variance between income groups lowincome beneficiaries tend to have received benefits for longer periods of time one reason for this discrepancy is that the lowest income quintile includes disproportionate number of disability beneficiaries who are eligible to receive benefits earlier than retired worker beneficiaries thus under this proposal lowincome beneficiaries would have deeper benefit cuts than would highincome beneficiaries for beneficiaries who have been eligible for benefits for at least 20 years the benefit cut from half percentage point reduction in the cola would be expected to exceed 10 abou t fourfifths of the beneficiaries with benefit reductions of 10 or more under this option have been eligible for benefits for at least 20 years including disproportionate share of the lowest income quintile after accounting for years of eligibility small number of beneficiaries in each quintile have largerthanexpected reductions under the policy option for example 4 of beneficiaries in the lowest quintile and 2 in the highest quintile in the lowest quintile the primary reason for largerthanexpected cuts is beneficiary type the majority of the beneficiaries in this quintile whose reductions of 10 or more are unexplained by years of eligibility receive spouse or survivor benefits 17 thus their cola amount is based on their spouse s years of eligibility not their

is assumed to be implementedthe median benefit reduction would be about 11 compared with current law as in the first cola option the size of the benefit reduction increases the longer beneficiary

by using the chained cpi rather than the cpiw to calculate the amount of the annual cola21 the social security actuaries estimate that using the chained cpi would reduce the cola by about 022 percentage points per year on average compared with current law22 hr 440 does not correspond directly to any of the options analyzed in this report while there is recent legislation proposing fixed reduction to the cola the social security actuaries have recently estimated the solvency effects of several proposals which would reduce the annual cola including half percentage point reduction and one percentage point reduction similar to those analyzed in this report23 in calculating the solvency effects of these options the actuaries assume the reduced cola would be applied to social security benefits in january 2007 which is six years earlier than the start date assumed for the cola options in this report thus the solvency effect of the cola reduction proposals in this report could be somewhat smaller than the actuaries estimates 24 the actuaries estimates were prepared using the assumptions of the 2005 social security trustees report which estimated social securitys longrange solvency gap as 192 of payroll and projected trust fund insolvency in 2041 according to the actuaries reducing the cola by 05 percentage point would reduce social security expenditures by an estimated 076 of payroll solving about 40 of the programs long range funding gap and extending solvency for about nine years reducing the cola by 10 percentage point would reduce social security expenditures by an estimated 149 of payroll solving about 78 of the programs longrange funding gap and extending solvency for about 26 years 20 at the time of this reports publication those bills most recently introduced that contained versions of these generic options were used to illustrate possible variations in each of the options analyzed regardless of which congress they represented as the intent of

benefits sooner and live longer than did previous generations27 increasing the number of years of work for the purpose of calculating social security benefits is intended to reward longer working careers and to provide an incentive for people to stay in the workforce longerthus paying into the social security system for more years and collecting benefits for fewer years 28 however increasing the number of computation years would primarily affect retired worker and disability beneficiaries not spouse and survivor beneficiaries since the total amount of spouse and survivor beneficiaries benefits is based on their spouses earnings histories not their own earnings histories changes to the number of computation years would affect their benefits only indirectly 29 the length of their own careers would not affect the total amount of their benefits thus increasing the number of computation years would not reward spouse and survivor beneficiaries for additional years worked 25 for more information on the social security benefit formula see appendix 26 for disability benefits the number of computation years equals the number of years of earnings between age 22 and the onset of disability reduced by the disability dropout factor the disability dropout factor is equal to the number of elapsed years after age 22 divided by five and rounded down the nearest whole number for example person with 20 elapsed years would have disability dropout factor of four and 16 total computation years for survivors benefits the number of computation years is equal to the number of years that have elapsed from the time the worker turned 22 until he or she died reduced by five for example worker who died at the age of 32 would have 10 elapsed years and five computation years 27 crs

this report examines proposal to increase the number of computation years from 35 to 38 years30 the change would begin in 2013 and would affect only new beneficiaries who became eligible for benefits in 2013 or after not beneficiaries who became eligible before 2013 two versions of this option are analyzed increasing the number of computation years to 38 for all newly eligible beneficiaries including disability beneficiaries and increasing the number of computation years to 38 for newly eligible retirement and survivor beneficiaries only and holding disability beneficiaries harmless variations on these options which would increase the number of computation years from 35 to 40 were also analyzed these options yielded greater benefit reductions with nearly identical distributional effects while the focus of the anal ysis below is the option to increase the number of computation years from 35 to 38 the results of the two options to increase the number of computation years to 40 will be discussed briefly full distributional results for the 40 computation year options are available in crs report rl33841 options to address social security solvency and their impact on

adding years with lower earnings or with earnings into the social security benefit calculation some beneficiaries would not be affected by the change since they and in some cases their spouses are

to increase the number of computation years to 38 for all newly eligible beneficiaries would be implementedsocial security beneficiaries are projected to receive median benefit cut of 2 compared with current law for the option to increase the number of computation years to 40 beneficiaries are projected to receive median reduction in benefits of 4 compared with current law the effects of changing the number of computation years would vary depending on beneficiarys age in 2035 younger beneficiaries would have larger benefit cuts compared with older beneficiaries since the new formula is assumed to apply only to people who become 30 for disability and survivors benefits the change in the number of computation years would be proportionate to the change for retired worker benefits for example in the proposal to increase the number of computation years from 35 to 38 for all beneficiaries the number of computation years for disability and survivor beneficiaries would be calculated as their computation years under current law times 109 that is 38 divided by 35 then rounded to the nearest year 31 see crs report rl33841 options to address social security solvency and their impact on

beneficiaries between the ages of 62 and 66 would have median benefit reduction of 3 relative to current law if the number of computation years was increased to 38 for all beneficiaries as shown in figure 6 this is because over 98 of beneficiaries in this age group would have been subject to the new formula32 in contrast beneficiaries over the age of 85 would have median change since 90 of these

type of benefits person receives one reason is that the proportion of beneficiaries who become eligible for benefits before 2013 varies significantly by benefit type thus the proportion of beneficiaries subject to the new rules would also vary by benefit type for example as shown in figure 6 survivor beneficiaries would have median reduction of about 1 compared with current law while retired worker beneficiaries would have median reduction of about 3 the primary reason for this difference is that fewer survivor beneficiaries would be subject to the new rules about third of survivor beneficiaries in 2035 are projected to become eligible for benefits before 2013 compared with fewer than 6 of retired worker beneficiaries survivors are eligible for social security benefits at age 60 two years earlier than retired workers among 32 the remaining 2 of beneficiaries between ages 62 and 66 who have benefit reduction were disability beneficiaries who were eligible to receive

eligible to receive benefits earlier than retired worker beneficiaries34 some individuals benefits are not changed under the option even though they began to receive benefits in 2013 or later the explanation for this result depends on the type of benefits received among beneficiaries who are projected to take up benefits in 2013 or later but whose benefits are unchanged by the proposal 85 are spouse or survivor beneficiaries 14 are disability beneficiaries and the remaining 1 are retired worker beneficiaries spouse and survivor beneficiaries are less likely to be affected by any benefit reduction because their benefit amounts are based on the work records of their spouses who may not be subject to the change or may experience change that is smaller than the spouse or survivor would have received based on his or her own work record 35 disability beneficiaries are less likely to be affected by changes in the number of computation years because increases in the number of computation years are applied proportionately under current law many disability beneficiaries have smaller number of computation years36 finally all of the retired worker beneficiaries who are unaffected by this proposal despite becoming eligible for benefits in 2013 or later were affected by the retirement earnings test ret early in their retirements but in 2035 would be older than the full retirement age these individuals benefits are adjusted upward at the full retirement age and the adjustments tend to eliminate or mitigate the effects of benefit reductions37

life expectancy has increased and is projected to continue to increase for future generations for example the social security administrations actuaries estimate that in 1950 65yearold male had remaining life expectancy of approximately 13 years by comparison in 2000 65year old male had remaining life expectancy of 16 years 50 the pattern is similar for females the actuaries estimate that

years in the labor force rather than in retirement thereby reducing the financial strain on the social security system51 an increase in the fra could reduce financial stra in on the system in two ways through reduced benefit payments and through increased revenues first cost savings for the system would result from larger benefit reductions for individuals who choose to retire early or from individuals who opt to wait until the higher fra to retire in 2002 71 of workers who became entitled to retirement benefits received reduced benefits because of entitlement before the fra in that year 56 of workers elected retirement benefits at the earliest eligibility age age 62 if majority of workers continue to elect early retirement for variety of reasons that may include poor health physically demanding occupation preference for leisure etc an increase in the fra would result in cost savings for the social security system alternatively individuals may delay their takeup of benefits to avoid the higher reduction for early retirement in this case the social security system saves money because it pays out benefits to these individuals for fewer months second an increase in tax revenue for the system would result from additional payroll tax contributions by individuals who choose to remain in the labor force for longer period the extended period of covered employment by workers would generate additional payroll tax revenue for the system while the additional earnings could result in higher benefit for these workers 52 the social security administration projects that an increase in the fra would have net positive effect on the systems financial outlook they estimate that savings due to larger benefit reductions for early retirement andor increased payroll tax revenue associated with extended periods of covered employment would outweigh any increase in benefit payments due to the additional covered earnings or the potential incr ease in the number of older workers who would become entitled to unreduced disability benefits53 g17g153g157g146g152g151g561g157g152g561g11g151g140g155g142g138g156g142g561g157g145g142g561g8g20g3g561 the fra option examined in this report would accelerate the increase from age 66 to age 67 scheduled under current law and would further increase the fra from age 67 to age 70 specifically for retired workers and spouses the fra would increase from age 65 to age 66 in twomonth increments for individuals born in 1938 through 1943 as under current law it would remain age 66 for individuals born in 1944 through 1950 compared with 1944 through 1954 under current law the fra would increase again from age 66 to age 67 in twomonth increments for individuals born in 1951 throug h 1956 the fra would reach age 67 for persons born in 1956four years earlier than under current law for individuals born in 1957 or later the fra would continue to increase one month ev ery two years until the fra reaches age 70 for 51 although life expectancy is projected to increase some individuals may not be able to extend their working lives due to variety of factors that include but are not limited to health problems physicallydemanding occupations and various aspects of the labor market such as forced retirement and labor supply issues with respect to older workers for additional information on older workers and labor supply issues please seecrs report rl32757 unemployment and older workers by julie m whittaker 52 the dynasim model does not assume any changes in behavior due to policy change thus for the analysis that follows all individuals are assumed to apply for social security benefits at the same age under the option as they did under current law 53 an increase in the fra and the larger benefit reduction could create the incentive for individuals to apply for social security disability benefits because disability benefits would be unaffected by the fra change

survivors under the option would be the same as that for retired workers and spouses although the phasein would begin for individuals born in 1940 rather than 1938 the fra would reach age 70 for survivors born in 2029 or later in this illustration beneficiaries born in 1951 or later who retire early would face benefit reductions under this option under this option consistent with current law individuals who receive disability benefits would not be directly affected by an increase in the fra they would not be subject to reductions under the fra option because disability benefits are converted to retiredworker benefits when the individual reaches the fra thus an increase in the fra and the benefit reductions associated with early retirement do not directly affect disability beneficiaries because they do not receive early retirement reductions for survivors the maximum reduction would remain 285 for someone taking benefits at age 60 with proportionate monthly reduction base d on the number of months between age 60 and the fra thus for each month of early retirement the size of the reduction per month is smaller under the fra option than under current law for example under the fra option survivor born in 1958 would be subject to an fra of 67 compared with 66 and four months under current law the benefit reduction for each month of entitlement before the fra would be 339 28584 months 00339 compared with 375 under current law therefore because the per month reduction is 036 per month smaller than under current law this survivor beneficiary would actually experience very slight benefit increase under the fra option relative to current law the early retirement reduction for retired workers and spouses would increase to reflect the increase in the fra for example for an individual with an fra of 67 and one month ie an individual born in 1957 the total reduction in retiredworker benefits would be 304 compared with 275 under current law for an individual who elects to receive benefits at age 62 the total reduction in spousal benefits for this individual at age 62 would be 354 compared with 325 under current law

quintile generally the younger the cohort the greater the reduction in benefits under the fra option compared with current law this finding is consistent with the design of the option in which the fra and therefore the level of benefit reduction associated with early retirement would increase gradually over time for individuals born in 1951 or later the results show that disability and survivor beneficiaries would receive median benefit reduction of 0 compared with current law because disability beneficiaries are not affected by changes in the fra under current law they are held harmless under this option in addition because the fra option maintains the maximum benefit reduction for survivor benefits most survivor beneficiaries are also held harmless spouse and retiredworker beneficiaries would receive median reductions of 2 and 3 respectively 54 the slightly greater reduction for retiredworker beneficiaries is attributed to their younger ages 54 the median represents beneficiaries at the middle of the distribution ie half of the beneficiary population in 2035 continued

each income quintile would receive benefit reduction of 10 or less in addition small percentage of beneficiaries would receive an increase in benefits due to the interaction of the fra option with the social security retirement earnings test figure 10 shows the median percentage change in benefits under the fra option compared with current law among beneficiaries in 2035 by age and benefit type the results show that the younger the cohort the greater the reduction in benefits under the fra option compared with current law this finding is consistent with the design of the option as the fra gradually increases for each new cohort of beneficiaries the reduction for early retirement will also gradually increase55 thus the benefit reductions in the year 2035 are smaller than the reductions

affected by the fra option those aged 86 and older would have been eligible for benefits before the fra option is assumed to take effect in 201356 individuals aged 8185 would receive median benefit reduction of 1 compared with median reduction of 2 for those aged 7180 and median reduction of 4 for those aged 6266 the youngest category of beneficiaries aged 61 or younger would have median change of 0 because 96 of individuals in this category are disability beneficiaries who would not be directly affected by an increase in the fra see discussion below figure 10 also shows breakdown by benefit type as illustrated individuals receiving disability benefits would receive change in benefits compared with current law because disability benefits are converted to retiredworker benefits when the individual reaches the fra an increase in the fra and the benefit reductions associated with early retirement do not directly affect disability beneficiaries in other words disability beneficiaries are held harmless under the fra option the figure shows that the median benefit change for survivor beneficiaries under the fra increase would be 0 compared with current law the vast majority of survivor beneficiaries experience change in benefits this result is expected because the maximum reduction for survivor benefits taken before the fra is the same under current law and the option 285 some survivor beneficiaries may experience slight benefit increases under the fra option since the 285 maximum reduction is divided over greater number of months under the fra increase the per month penalty for early retirement is smaller under the fra increase than under current law therefore survivor beneficiaries who took benefits any time after age 60 could have experienced very slight benefit increase under the option on the other hand some survivor beneficiaries that were not affected by the early retirement reduction under current law could receive benefit reductions under the option to increase the fra for example survivor who applied for benefits at age 67 under current law would have been retiring at or bove the fra and would have experienced benefit reduction however under the fra increase to age 70 this survivor would now be taking benefits earlier th an the new fra and would be subject to an early retirement penalty the results also show that individuals receiving spousal benefits and retiredworker benefits would receive median reductions of 2 and 3 respectively compared with current law spouses would receive slightly smaller reduction in benefits than retiredworkers because spouses tend to be slightly older and thus have lower fra for example spouses have median fra of 67 and 3 months by comparison retire dworkers have median fra of 67 and 4 months the lower median fra for the spouses results in smaller reductions than those for retiredworkers figure 11 shows the percentage change in benefits under the fra option compared with current law among beneficiaries in 2035 by income quintile the results show that median benefit reductions do not differ significantly by income group majority of the beneficiary population in each income quintile would receive benefit reduction of up to 10 56 because the option is assumed to take effect in 2013 there would be change in benefits for individuals born in 1950 or earlier the first cohort affected under the option would be workers born in 1951 who would become eligible for retirement benefits at age 62 in 2013

months of benefit reductions under the option while 8 of beneficiaries in the highest income quintile with benefit reductions of up to 10 are affected by the ret none of the beneficiaries in the lowest income quintile with this size benefit reduction are although the share of beneficiaries affected by the ret differs the share of beneficiaries by other characteristics such as age and benefit type does not differ significantly between the lowest income quintile and the highest income quintile among beneficiaries who would receive benefit reduction of up to 10 slightly larger percentage of

individuals who would receive benefit increase of up to 10 ranges from 1 in the lowest income quintile to 4 in the highest income quintile this result is attributed to larger percentage of individuals in the highest income quintile who have benefits reduced by the ret prior to the fra and who have reached the fra by 2035 if an individuals benefits are withheld as result of the ret benefits are recomputed when heshe reaches the fra to take into account months for which benefits were withheld ie reductions for early retirement would not apply for those months if an individuals benefits are withheld for additional months due to the increase in the fra mentioned in the previous paragraph the re computation of benefits at the fra could ultimately result in higher benefit compared with current law ie the recomputation would take into account additional months for which early retirement reductions would not apply the share of beneficiaries in the highest income quintile who are

intermediate assumptions of the 2005 trustees report the actuaries estimate that eliminating the 10year hiatus in the fra increase from age 66 to age 67 and further increasing the fra by one month every two year s until the fra reaches age 70 would eliminate about 36 of the programs longrange funding shortfall projected under current law and extend the projected trust fund exhaustion date from 2041 to 204762

2000 life expectancy longevity64 at age 65 increased by about five years while the social security fra remained constant at age 65 in the year 2000 the fra began gradually increasing from age 65 to age 67 this increase was enacted in 1983 as part of series of amendments to improve the solvency of the social security system when the fra ultimately reaches age 67 life expectancy at age 65 will have increased since 1935 by 55 and 6 years for men and women respectively thus despite the currentlyscheduled twoyear increase in the fra an individual retiring at the fra under current 60 social

in this report ie the actuaries assume that the fra would increase from age 66 to age 67 at faster rate in addition there may be other differences in the specifications for the fra option analyzed by

social security benefits 64 life expectancy or longevity is defined as the average remaining number of years expected prior to death life expectancy varies both within birth cohort as one ages their life expectancy changes and across birth cohorts historically earlier cohorts had lower life expectancies than current cohorts some statistics report life expectancy across cohorts from birth however not all of the individuals that are measured for this statistic survive to working age and even fewer survive until retirement age thus for the purpos of social security benefit estimates the most useful statistic is cohorts life expectancy at age 65 contingent on having r eached age 65 furthermore life expectancy varies along socioeconomic lines such as gender with women generally having longer life expectancies at 65 than men the longevityindexing options presented in this report were developed based on unisex life expectancies projected by the social security administrations office

years longer than an individual retiring at the fra in 1940 provision in current law would increase the fra to compensate for increased longevity and longer years of benefit receipt although supported by numerous greenspan commission members as part of the 1983 amendments65 there are provisions in current law to continue increasing the fra as life expectancy increases nor are there any other currentlaw provisions that would adjust benefits to reflect increases in life expectancy

because the fra has not been adjusted to account for increasing longevity people retiring today at the fra are receiving benefits for longer period of time than those retiring at the fra when the system was designed contributing to the financial strain on the social security system there are two possible approaches to reducing the financial strain caused by increasing longevity 1 raise the fra in line with gains in life expectancy to reduce the number of years that an individual receives the same monthly benefit am ount under current law or 2 reduce the social security monthly benefit amount payable at the full retirement age based on increases in life expectancy when provided with various options for achieving longterm solvency increasing the fra is consistently unpopular with americans 66 as result some policymakers have suggested other approaches that would achieve the same solvency effect reducing social security benefits based on increases in life expectancy ie longevityindexing would reduce social security expenditures and help restore solvency longevity indexing social security benefits seeks to roughly offset the demographic changes in longevity that increase program costs despite the average increases in life expectancy over the past 70 years it is important to keep in mind that future longevity gains are not guaranteed for example while life expectancy could continue to rise with technological and medical advancements it could also decline with increases in obesity and related diseases in fact demography experts disagree both on the magnitude and the direction of future trends in life expectancy67 furthermore while average life expectancy has been increasing these gains in life expectancy may not be shared equally across the population for example life expectancy gains at age 65 have been higher for women than for men and higher for whites than for blacks between 1950 and 2000 women gained 43 years and men gained 35 years 68 over this same period white males gained 35 years while black males gained 16 years and white females gained 41 years while black females gained 25 years69 65 see the supplementary statement on

this report examines two options to slow the grow th in social security benefits by indexing ie linking the reduction in initial benefits to increases in longevity71 longevity index pia formula factors the first approach would reduce the social security primary insurance amount pia by multiplying the pia formula factors 90 32 and 15 by 0995 annually ie reducing the pia factors by 05 annually72 this adjustment would reduce monthly bene fit levels by an amount equivalent to increasing the fra for retired workers by enough to maintain constant life expectancy at the fra for any fixed age of benefit entitlement73 for example for those reaching age 62 in 2013 the first year that the policy is effective the pia formula factors would be 8955 3184 and 14925 the 0995 multiplier would be updated every 10 years starting after 2010 to reflect actual historical increases in longevity for the most recent decade this provision would apply to all new beneficiaries longevity index pia value the second approach would reduce beneficiarys social security pia by multiplying the current law pia by the ratio of the life expectancy at age 62 for 2010 to the life expectancy at age 62 for the year that is three years prior to the year in which the retiree turns 62 74 for example for worker retiring at age 62 in 2024 the reduction in benefit level would be based upon the increase in life expectancy at age 62 between 2010 and 2021 year 2024 three years75 this provision would apply to all new oasi beneficiaries but would require complex calculation for disabled beneficiaries disabled beneficiaries would not be affected until they reach the full retirement age fra and convert to retiredworker benefits 76 then at the fra proportional reduction would apply to their benefits based on the number of years they could have worked since 2006 ie years without disability benefits77 with this formula disabled workers that had few years of work would have smaller weight 70 see crs report rl32792 life expectancy in the united states by laura b shrestha 71 there are certainly number of possible approaches to achieving longevity indexing and these two options are not intended to be exhaustive rather we have selected two that include the most variety among recent proposals in terms of what is being reduced pia formula factors versus the dollar amount of the pia itself and who is being affected all beneficiaries or with some being held harmless and how the specialtreatment groups are ultimately affected eg proportionally reducing benefits for the di beneficiaries upon conversion to retiredworker benefits at the fra 72 for more information on the pia calculation under current law please refer to appendix 73 calculations of the 0995 multiplier are based on the mortality assumptions for the intermediate estimates of the 2004 oasdi trustees report and the actuarial reduction factors in current law 74 minimum of threeyear lag is necessary to ensure the availability of final life expectancy data in all cases life expectancy is taken from period life tables in the relevant calendar years 75 calculations of the reductions applied to pias are based on the mortality assumptions for the intermediate estimates of the 2004 oasdi trustees report and the actuarial reduction factors in current law 76 under current law all disability insurance di benefici aries convert to oldage or survivor insurance oasi benefits at the full retirement age 77 the year 2006 is assumed to be the year that the bill establishing this provision is passed

benefit type and income quintile under both longevityindexing options the later beneficiary becomes eligible for social security benefits after the policy takes effect in 2013 the more he or she would be affected by longevityindexing reductions to the pia thus older beneficiaries would see the least amount of change under both of the longevity indexing options the oldest old those 86 and older in 2035 would be nearly held harmless while those retiring early age 62 to 66 in 2035 would face the largest percent reductions relative to current law retired workers would experience proportionally larger benefit reductions than other beneficiaries partly because they are more likely to be subject to the retirement earnings test ret survivors who are predominan tly women and who frequently qualify for survivor benefits off of their husbands earnings record would have smaller benefit cuts than other beneficiaries generally the effect of reducing the pia through longevity indexing would be proportionate with most of the individuals in each income quintile experiencing the expected 10 reduction78 however some interaction with current law program rules results in higher cuts for higherincome beneficiaries than for lowerincome beneficiaries

eligible for benefits in 2035 would face benefit reductions of approximately 10 under this policy option because of the cumulative effect of reducing the pia formula factors by 05 per year over 22 years those receiving benefits in 2035 including all of those who became eligible for benefits since 2013 would experience median benefit reduction of 5 compared with current law th majority 76 of beneficiaries would have benefit cuts of up to 10 some 16 would experience benefit change and some 7 would experience benefit cuts of 10 or more relative to current law the primary reasons for these varied experiences are differences in the year when an individual becomes eligible for social security benefits and the interaction of the longevity indexing provision with currentlaw program rules as figure 12 demonstrates an individuals age has large impact on the size of the benefit reduction an individual would face if the pia formula factors were longevity indexed the pia is calculated at the earliest eligibility age age 62 for retired workers the year of disability for disabled workers and the year of death of the insured worker for survivors because the 78 the 0995 reduction is compounded over 22 years 099522 0896 therefore in 2035 the pia formula factors are multiplied by 896 leading to reduction of 104 in the pia

beneficiaries of the same birth cohort are projected to experience approximately the same benefit reduction the size of the benefit reduction increases after 2013 with each passing year due to the cumulative effect of the annual 05 reduction to the pia formula factors thus the youngest beneficiaries who become eligible for retirement benefits in later years would have the greatest reductions for example in 2035 beneficiaries between age 62 and 66 are projected to have their benefits cut by median of 10 compared with current law by contrast beneficiaries age 86 and over are projected to experience benefit change as they would have already passed the earliest eligibility age before the longevity indexing policy takes effect in 2013 individuals aged 61 or younger would experience smaller benefit reduction than those aged 62 through 66 because the younger group is composed of disabled worker and survivor beneficiaries because disabled worker and survivor beneficiaries have their pias calculated at younger ages than retired worker beneficiaries of the same birth cohorts because their eligibility age is likely to be lower than age 62 the lower the number of years that would have passed between 2013 and the year of entitlement and the smaller the effect of longevity i ndexing on the pia formula factors figur 12 median p er cent chang in benefits under longe vity

with longevity indexing the pia factors79 relative to other benefit types retired workers would be much more likely to take early social security retirement benefits but keep work ing making them subject to the ret under the ret these workers would experience benefit reduction of up to 100 because of post retirement earnings in excess of the ret thresholds until they reach the fra on the other extreme survivors would receive smaller benefit reductions than expected under the policy option due to the social security dualentitlement rule 80 because of the application of the social security dualentitlement rule survivor beneficiar ies who are more likely to be female 99 of aged survivors are women and have lower earnings than their male counterparts are likely to obtain larger portion of their survivor benefits off of the earnings record of an older spouse than off of their own earnings record under the longevity indexing option this older spouse would likely have smaller reduction to his pia than th survivor would on her own record thus the survivors overall benefit reduction would be smaller than those receiving only retired worker benefit because longevity indexing would lead to proportional reductions in social security benefits median benefit reductions do not vary significantly by income group in 2035 beneficiaries in the lowest income quintile are projected to receive median benefit reduction of 4 while beneficiaries in the highest income quintile are projected to receive median benefit reduction of 6 as seen in figure 13 the majority of individuals roughly 75 receive benefit reduction of less than 10 compared with current law regardless of income quintile however more of those in the lowest income quintile 22 experience benefit change while more of those in the two highest income quintiles 10 and 9 respectively experience larger benefit reductions than expected ie greater than 10 under the option 79 please see appendix c for additional information on how the retirement earnings test ret works and could result in larger benefit decreases or benefit increases relativ to current law than are attributable solely to the policy option 80 please see

experience benefit change are primarily survivor beneficiaries or disabled workers these survivors tend to be in the older age groups and thus are not affected by the policy change the disabled workers qualify for benefits in earlier years than the rest of their birth cohort and so face lesser reductions under the policy change both groups rely heavily on social security in retirement thus the disproportionate number of these groups in the change category could be viewed as an advantage for this policy option those in the top income quintile that received disproportionately large benefit reductions are not actually being hit by the longevity indexing provision but are being affected by the ret all of the individuals in this category fall between the ages of 62 and 66 took early retirement benefits and are retired worker beneficiaries who have continued working after early retirement subjecting them to the ret because earnings are included in the definition of income

including all of those becoming eligible for benefits since 2013 would experience median benefit reduction of 2 relative to current law the distributional effect of longevity indexing the pia value is similar to that of longevity indexing the pia formula factors the majority 70 of beneficiaries would have benefit cuts of up to 10 some 29 would experience benefit change and few 2 would experience benefit cuts of 10 or more compared with current law the primary reasons behind these varied experiences are differences in the year when an individual becomes eligible for social security benefits the special treatment afforded to di beneficiaries under this option and the interaction of the longevity indexing provision with currentlaw program rules as with the first longevity indexing option the size of the benefit reduction increases the later beneficiary becomes eligible to receive benefits thus the youngest beneficiaries tend to have the greatest reductions for example as seen in figure 14 in 2035 beneficiaries younger than the full retirement age age 62 through 66 are proj ected to face median benefit cut of about 6 compared with current law by contrast benefici aries over age 85 are projected to experience benefit reduction unlike the first longevity indexing option discussed in this report the option to longevity index the pia value holds disabled workers harmless from any benefit reduction until they have reached the full retirement age at the fra disabled worker benefits convert automatically to retired worker benefits and are subject to proportional reduction under longevity indexing based on the number of possible work years that the worker was not disabled and thus able to work this policy difference explains the few distributional differences between the two longevity indexing options and leads to unexpected results in some beneficiary categories for example under the option indexing the pia value itself disability beneficiaries receive benefit reductions under this policy option figure 14 but would experience median benefit reduction of 5 under the alternative discussed above figure 12 81 the 0997 reduction is compounded over 22

other categories of beneficiaries to appear better off than would be expected under the policy option more of those receiving survivor benefits under current law would instead continue to receive di benefits off of their own record through 2035 since the di benefit they are eligible for is higher than the survivor benefit they would receive under the option as result survivor beneficiaries are held harmless under the option indexing the pia value because of the currentlaw program rules that provide individuals with the higher of their own benefit or the survivor benefit that they are eligible to receive because longevity indexing the pia value would lead to proportional reductions in benefits median benefit reductions do not vary significantly by income group in 2035 beneficiaries

social security benefit check under current law social security benefits increase from one generation to the next at the rate that the national average wage rises in other words initial social

to constrain the growth of initial benefits for future retirees and provide cost savings for the system while protecting the benefits of lowearning workers the progressive price indexing option emerged as modified version of full price indexing which also has been proposed by some policymakers under full price indexing initial benefits for all future beneficiaries not just higherearners would be indexed to price growth rather than wage growth by indexing initial benefits to combination of wage growth and price growth the progressive price indexing option is designed to provide the same level of benefits as under current law for very low earners and the same level of benefits as under full price indexing mechanism for high earners89 workers at other earning levels would receive benefits that are lower than those scheduled under current law and greater than those projected under full price indexing proponents of progressive price indexing believe that blending price and wage indexing will reduce the policys impact on low earners who are more likely to rely on social security benefits for greater share of their total retirement income however the growth of initial benefits for higherearner future retirees would longer keep pace with average wage growth in the economy and social security benefits would replace smaller and smaller share of an individuals preretirement income over long period of time these increasing benefit cuts would cause the majority of workers to receive the same initial benefit 90

formula that are wageindexed although only one is modified by this option for complete description of how the benefit formula is calculated see appendix the first component is workers past earnings which are wage indexed before calculating the workers career average earnings this feature allows earnings at the start of workers career to be treated equally with those earned at the end of his or her career without wageindexation the timing of workers earningswhether peak earnings came early or late in his or her careerwould influence the benefits that individual would receive this

security benefits that replaces about the same 88 due to increases in worker productivity wages tend to rise faster than prices when measured over long periods of time consequently if initial benefits were based on the rate at which prices rise rather than the rate at which wages rise initial benefits for each succeeding generation of workers would grow more slowly than under current law under the

with similar earnings regardless of when they become eligible for benefits91 for example under current law social security benefits would replace about 40 of preretirement earnings for workers who earn the economywide average wage for their entire career wageindexing the current benefit formula allows the growth of initial benefits for future re tirees to keep pace with the growth in wages in the economy and allows future cohorts of beneficiaries to maintain their preretirement standard of living it is this wageindexing feature which ensures replacement rates are maintained across cohorts that is modified under this option the mechanics of progressive price indexing the benefit formula can be found in appendix d

type and income quintile overall an estimated 69 of all beneficiaries in 2035 would be affected by progressive price indexing for beneficiaries in 2035 progressive price indexing would result in median benefit cut of 4 compared with current law the effects of progressive price indexing would increase over time thus each successive generation of beneficiaries would have deeper benefit cuts than the last as result younger beneficiaries in 2035 would have larger benefit reductions than would older beneficiaries higherincome beneficiaries would also have proportionately higher benefit reductions than lowerincome beneficiaries since the option is designed to be progressive figure 16 shows the median percentage change in benefits under progressive price indexing among beneficiaries in 2035 by age and benefit type the oldest beneficiaries aged 86 and older in 2035 would receive little or change in benefits compared with current law these beneficiaries would have been eligible for benefits before the option is assumed to take effect in 2013 beneficiaries age 7680 would receive median benefit reduction of 4 under progressive price indexing because the policy would have been in effect for only few years before they became eligible for benefits individuals in the age 7175 age 6770 and age 6266 categories would receive median benefit reductions of 7 9 and 8 respectively the youngest cohort of beneficiaries aged 61 and younger would receive the smallest cut in benefits 2 disability beneficiaries who make up approximately 96 of this youngest age category have generally smaller cuts in benefits as they may have become eligible before the policy took effect or had low earnings there are significant differences in benefit reductions by the type of benefits person receives retired worker or spousal beneficiaries would have median cut in benefits of 6 compared with current law disability beneficiaries would receive relatively small median reduction 1 under progressive price indexing for reasons described above survivor beneficiaries are projected to receive median change in benefits 92 in 2035 almost 80 of survivor 91 the benefit formula is structured to provide higher replacement rate for lowerwage earners and lower replacement rate for higherwage earners 92 among survivor beneficiaries in 2035 51 would have change in benefits relative to current

port int roduction figure 17 shows the percentage change in benefits under progressive price indexing among beneficiaries in 2035 by income quintiles progressive price indexing is designed to cause minimal benefit reductions for individuals with low earnings and larger reductions for those with high earnings since earnings tend to be good indicator of income the pattern of the results shown in figure 17 is generally consistent with the intent of the option the share of beneficiaries that experience change from the policy decreases with rising income and the share of beneficiaries that have large benefit cuts increases with rising income while two thirds of beneficiaries in the lowest quintile are unaffected by the policy only 16 of those in the highest quintile would see their benefits remain the same as under current law the highest two income quintiles have the largest proportion of beneficiaries 5 and 4 who would receive cuts of 20 or more individuals in the lowest two income quintiles receive benefit reduction of 20 or more this option is designed to protect the benefits of w earners so it is not surprising that two thirds of beneficiaries in the lowest income quintile would receive change in benefits however having low earnings during workers career does not always correspond with having low continued have benefit cut of less than 10 and 9 would have cut in

the impact on the solvency of the social security trust funds of progressive price indexing option similar to the one analyzed in this report94 under the intermediate assumptions of the 2005 trustees report they estimate that progressive price indexing initial benefits could significantly improve the solvency of the social security program95 this option is projected to eliminate 75 of the longrange financial shortfall under current law and would extend the trust funds exhaustion date from 2041 to 2051

earnings up to maximum level set each year96 in 2006 this maximum or what is referred to as the taxable earnings base was 9420097 the taxable earnings base serves as both cap on contributions into the system and cap on benefits as contribution base it establishes the maximum amount of covered earnings that are subject to the payroll tax as benefit base it establishes the maximum amount of covered earnings that are used to calculate benefits the taxable earnings base limits the amount of wages or selfemployment income used to calculate contributions to social security 98 unlike income taxes workers who have earnings over the limit whether they earn 100000 thousand or 100 million pay the same amount in social security payroll taxes under the 2006 limit of 94200 the maximum amount wage and salary worker would have contributed to social security was 584040 99 his or her employer would contribute an equal amount while selfemployed individual would have contributed maximum of 1168080

that are used in benefit calculations and thus sets ceiling on the amount social security pays in benefits for example the maximum amount of earnings in 2006 that would be used to calculate workers benefit was 94200 regardless of whether the worker earned above that amount if an individual earned at or above the earnings base for his or her entire career100 and retired in 2006 at the full retirement age his or her annual benefit would be 24636 288633 per month the maximum benefit payable under current law however very few americans receive the maximum benefit as it is rare to have had such consistently high earnings over lifetime according to statistics from the social security administration small share of workers earn above the taxable earnings base each year in 2003 6 of workers 85 million individuals earned more than the taxable earnings base 101 most of the individuals earning above the base were men 67 million individuals or roughly 80 of the total in 2003 8 of all male workers and 3 of all female workers had earnings above the maximum most individuals earning above the base were wage and salary workers roughly 90 of the total roughly 5 of all wage and salary workers 79 million individuals nd 5 of all selfemployed workers 765000 individuals had earnings above the base in that year

be substantial however the full impact of the policy change would depend on whether th wages above the maximum would also be counted toward benefits raising or eliminating the taxable earnings base while maintaining the current benefit structure where benefits are calculated on the full contribution base would lead to higher monthly social security checks for individuals who earned more than the taxable wage base over their careers these higher benefit payments would lead to greater program outlays although these outlays would be more than offset by greater tax revenues while the solvency impact would be improved to greater degree if the cap on taxes was eliminated and the cap on benefits was retained the traditional link between contributions and benefits would be broken some argue that the taxable wage base should cover constant share of aggregate earnings in 1982 90 of aggregate earnings in the united states were taxed for social security 103 rising inequalityprimarily increases in the earnings of the highest paid individualshas led to decline in the share of us earnings that are taxed in 2005 only 85 of aggregate earnings were taxed104 the share of earnings that are taxed is projected to continue to fall105 maintaining consistent tax base would increase revenue and help to improve the systems solvency 100 the social security benefit formula calculates

this report examines two proposals to raise or liminate the taxable earnings base both options are assumed to be effective in 2013 option 1 eliminate the taxable earnings base one approach would be to remove the taxable earnings base completely under this scenario all earnings would be taxed policymakers could retain the current earnings cap used to calculate social security benefits or they could fully credit the additional earnings and allow benefits to rise for those individuals with earnings above the current taxable earnings base option 2 raise the taxable earnings base to cover 90 of earnings second approach would be to raise the taxable earnings base to consistently tax 90 of aggregate us earningsrestoring it to roughly the level in 1983 when congress last addressed social securitys finances 106 the earnings base for benefit calculation could also be raised to allow individuals to receive correspondingly higher benefits

high earnings in 2003 6 of covered workers earned more than the taxable earnings base 107 the dynasim model projects this share would remain relatively constant through 2050 while fewer than 8 of workers are projected to earn above the taxable earnings base in given year the model estimates that roughly one in five would earn above th maximum at some point in their lifetime figure 18 the model projects that 12 of workers would earn above the earnings base for between one and five years over the course of their working lives very few individuals sustain the high earnings for long periods in their careers the model estimates that only 5 of workers would earn above the taxable wage base for more than five years 108 unlike the other sections in this report that analyze the effect of the policy option on the entire dynasim population most of the figures for the options to raise or eliminate the taxable earnings base include only beneficiaries who would be affected by the option since relatively small share of beneficiaries would be affected by the options to raise or eliminate the taxable earnings continued 105 the taxable wage base is increased annually by the average growth in wages so the share of the population below the cap is expected to remain relatively stable over time however the share of payroll that is taxed is expected to decline even further under the intermediate assumptions of the 2006 trustees report the percentage of earnings that is taxable is projected to decline to about 83 in 2015 and remain stable thereafter 106 estimates of the taxable earnings base that would capture 90 of covered earnings between 2005 and 2050 are from the social security administrations office of the actuary and were calculated using the intermediate assumptions of the 2005 trustees report for example the actuaries estimate that the 2006 wage base of 94200 would have needed to rise to 164100 to cover 90 of aggregate covered earnings 107 ssa statistical

these options would show only that the average beneficiary in each subgroup was not affected there are only minor differences in the distributional effects of policy that raises the taxable earnings base to cover 90 of earnings or one that would eliminate it entirely this is because the dynasim model projects that roug hly 1 of workers have earnings above the 90 limit each year in other words due to high levels of earn ings inequality roughly 1 of the population earns 10 of the earnings109 looking over the course of ones lifetime the model projects that less than 4 of the population would ever earn above the 90 base and nearly all of those who do would earn above the base for less than five ears because such small share of the population ever earns above the 90 limit this distributional analysis will focus on eliminating the taxable wage base the only difference between the options is that the share of individuals who have large tax and benefit changes declines if the base is capped

base could significantly improve the solvency of the social security program114 tax 90 of earnings and pay higher benefits raising the wage base to 90 of earnings would have net positive impact on the social security trust funds this option is projected to eliminate 43 of the longrange financial shortfall and would extend the trust funds exhaustion date from 2041 to 2044 in addition to raising the taxable wage base to tax 90 of earnings to make social security solvent for the full 75year projection period the total payroll tax rate would have to be raised by 109 percentage points from 1240 to 1349 or other policy changes would have to be made to cover this shortfall tax all earnings and pay higher benefits if the earnings base was completely eliminated for both employers and employees so that all covered earnings were taxed 95 of the projected financial shortfall in the social security program is projected to be eliminated under this scenario high earners would pay higher taxes and also receive higher benefits however the net benefit to the trust funds is positive in addition to taxing all earnings to achieve solvency for the full 75year projection period the total payroll tax rate would have to be raised by an additional 01 percentage points from 124 to 125 or other policy changes would have to be made to cover this shortfall tax all earnings and pay additional benefits if the base was completely eliminated for both employers and employees so that all earnings were taxed but those earnings did not count toward benefits the social security program would remain solvent for the full 75year projection period the increased revenue would eliminate 115 of the projected shortfall and the program would have surplus of 029 of wages under this scenario the payroll tax rate could be immediately lowered from 1240 to 1211 and the program would remain solvent for the full 75year projection period 114 social security administration estimated oasdi longrange financial effects

payable to an individual upon entitlement to retirement benefits at the normal retirement age ie the pia does not reflect any adjustments for early or delayed retirement or disability benefits in addition the pia is the base amount used to determine monthly benefits payable to family members on the workers record such as spouse or surviving spouse under current law the pia is determined by applying benefit formula to the workers average lifetime covered earnings in the first step of the benefit computation the workers nominal earnings up to 2 calendar years prior to the year of eligibilityfor example earnings prior to age 60 in the case of retirement benefit are indexed to wage growth to reflect the change in average wages over time earnings in subsequent years are counted at nominal value for purposes of computing basic retirement benefit the 35 highest years of indexed earnings are then averaged and monthly amount is computed to determine the workers average indexed monthly earnings aime if worker has fewer than 35 years of covered earnings years of zero earnings are counted in the computation of the aime 115 the benefit formula is then applied to the workers aime the benefit formula that applied to individuals who first became eligible for retirement or disability benefits in 2006 or who died in 2006 before becoming eligible for benefits is as follows 90 of the first 656 of aime plus 32 of aime over 656 through 3955 plus 15 of aime over 3955 for example the pia for worker who reached age 62 in 2006 based on an aime of 4500 would be 172780 the pia would be computed as follows 90 x 656 59040 plus 32 x 3299 105568 plus 15 x 545 8175 pia 172780 rounded to the next lower 10 cents the workers pia is based on the benefit formula that applies in the

than the first year of 115 the number of computation years used to determine the aime varies depending on the type of benefit retirement survivor or disability the number of computation years is based on the number of elapsed years ie the number of calendar years after 1950 or if later attainment of age 21 up to the year the worker attains age 62 for retirement benefits the year of death or if earlier attainment of ag 62 for survivor benefits or the year of disability for disability benefits minus any dropout years the number of dropout years also varies depending on the type of benefit for purposes of retirement and survivor benefits up to 5 dropout years apply for purposes of disability benefits for workers disabled before age 47 1 to 4 dropout years apply depending on the workers age and the number of dropout years however fewer than 2 computation years may be used for disability benefit calculations

the pia is increased by the annual social security costofliving adjustment cola for any intervening years between eligibility and benefit receipt for example if an individual who first becomes eligible for retiredworker benefits at age 62 in 2006 elects to receive benefits at the normal retirement age age 66 in 2010 the pia effective at the normal retirement age would be the pia calculated using the benefit formula for 2006 shown above adjusted annually according to the cola effective in december 2006 december 2007 december 2008 and december 2009 the dollar amounts that separate the three brackets of aime in the benefit formula 656 and 3955 are referred to as bend points under current law the bend points are indexed to wage growth on an annual basis to provide stable replacement rates over time for workers with similar earnings patterns the replacement rate is based on social security benefits in the first year of retirement divided by final earnings for example under current law the benefit formula is designed to provide replacement rate of approximately 40 for averagewage earners regardless of the year of retirement the percentages that apply to each of the three brackets of aime in the benefit formula 90 32 and 15 are referred to as formula factors or replacement factors the formula factors which are fixed under current law are structured such that social security benefits replace greater share of preretirement earnings for lowerwage workers compared with higherwage workers

that could mitigate the effect of the policy option for beneficiary 1 if his or her benefit type changes under the option or 2 if the spouse on whose work record his or her the benefit is based changes under the option some individuals could change benefit types under policy option because of the spouse and survivor rules thus mitigating the effect of the options benefit reduction for example consider couple in which the wife receives 600 retired worker benefit and the husband receives 1100 retired worker benefit under current law the woman would not qualify for spouse benefit under current law since her worker benefit 600 is greater than 50 of her husbands primary insurance amount assuming he is not subject to any reductions or credits this amount would be 550 if the wife is younger than the husband she would be subject to greater benefit reduction in 2035 under most of the policy options analyzed in this report continuing the example above lets assume under policy option that the wifes benefit were reduced by 100 making her retired worker benefit 500 and the husbands benefit is reduced by 50 making his retired worker benefit 1050 as result the wife would become dually entitled to receive partial spouse benefit in addition to her full worker benefit her total benefit amount under the option would be equal to 50 of her husbands pia or 525 in this case ie 500 in worker benefits and 25 in spouse benefits thus the dual entitlement rule leads the wife to receive 75 benefit reduction rather than 100 reduction some individuals could receive spouse or survivor benefit based on different marriage than under current law as result of policy change thus mitigating the effect of benefit reduction that would otherwise result from the policy option for example consider woman who divorced after 15 years of marriage then remarried under current law she receives spouse benefit of 600 her spouse benefit is based on her current husbands pia of 1200 her former husbands pia is 1180 under the policy option her current husbands pia is reduced by 100 to 1100 and her former husbands pia remains at 1180 since he retired before the policy option was implemented under the policy option she would receive divorced spouse benefit based on her former husbands work record rather than her current husbands work record since the benefit she would receive based on her former husbands record 590 would be greater than the benefit she would receive based on her current husbands record 550 thus the rule that allows beneficiaries to receive the highest spouse or survivor benefit to which they are entitled means that the wife in this example receives 10 benefit reduction rather than 50 benefit reduction it is important to note that in either scenariochanging benefit type or changing the spouse on which the benefit is basedthe affected beneficiary would receive higherthanexpected benefit under the option due to social securitys spouse and survivor rules the reason for this effect is that the social security rules always allow beneficiaries to receive total benefit that is equal to the highest of the various benefits to which they may be entitled

dollar joe had excess earnings of 17520 in 2006 30000 12480 thus the reduction to his social security benefit was 8760 17520 x 05 in 2006 joes currentlaw social security benefit is 1500 per month

increased at the full retirement age under current law workers are only subject to the ret if they have excess earnings receive nondi benefits and have not yet reached the full retirement age when individuals receive nondi benefits prior to the full retirement age they are subject to an actuarial benefit reduction the size of which is dependent on the number of months of benefits the individual is projected to receive benefits before the full retirement age the greater the number of months of benefit receipt prior to the full retirement age the greater the actuarial reduction those retiring at the earliest eligibility age 60 for survivors benefits 62 for retirement benefits face the largest reduction for every month that an individuals early retirement or early survivor benefit is eliminated as result of the ret the actuarial reduction that he or she is subject to goes down as compensation for these lost benefits when the individual reaches the full retirement age the actuarial reduction is lowered and the retirement or survivor benefit is adjusted upward to account for the lost months of benefits under the ret following on the previous example if joe takes social security benefits at the earliest eligibility age 62 his benefits will be 25 lower than if he retired at his fra of 66 120 if joes full retirement benefit pia was 2000 per month his monthly benefit after the early retirement reduction would be 1500 2000 x 075 however if joe continues working as described in the previous example he would lose benefits for ov er five months out of the year due to the ret if joe worked intermittently between age 62 and 66 and the ret ultimately eliminated joes benefit for total of 12 months over this period essentially joe delayed taking up social security benefits for an additional year therefore his actuarial reduction for early retirement should be adjusted to reflect his receipt of social security benefits for only 36 months prior to his full retirement age instead of 48 joes actuarial reduction would be reduced from 25 to 20 at the full retirement age of 66 thus at age 66 the ret would increase joes monthly benefit from 1500 to 1600 2000 x 80 under currentlaw about 7 increase on an annual basis the ret would increase joes benefit from 18000 per year to 19200 per year

options that reduce benefits relative to current law those affected by the ret appear to receive larger benefit reductions than what could be attributed to the policy change alone the ret calculation is based on workers excess earnings since earnings are not affected by the policy option the ret reduction is the same dollar amount under both current law and the policy option if policy option reduces social security benefits this smaller social security benefit is being reduced by the same dollar amount 120 the benefit reduction of 25 is calculated based on the number of months joe retires

ret thus his annual benefit prior to the ret is 18000 and the policy option reduces his benefit by 10 1800 to 16200 since joes earnings dont change and he still has excess earnings of 17520 in 2006 the ret still reduces his annual social security benefit by 8760 so joes final annual benefit after the policy option and the ret is 7440 16200 8760 which is approxi mately 20 decrease 74409240 from the current law annual benefit of 9240 after the ret thus the interaction of the policy option with the ret program rules is res ponsible for the larger than expected reduction in joes benefit

benefit to size where the fixed dollar amount of the ret fully eliminates the social security benefit for greater number of months than under current law because of the interaction of the policy option with the ret and the actuarial benefit reduction the ultimate consequence of this benefit elimination is later increase in benefits relative to current law when policy option reduces the size of the social security benefit the unchanging dollar amount of the ret requires more months of benefits to be eliminated than under current law thus at the full retirement age when the benefits are adjusted upward for this loss they are increased relative to current law making some individuals receive benefit increases that would seem to be counterintuitive under policy change that reduces benefits for example if joes benefit were reduced relative to current law lets say that the ret would eliminate his now smaller social security benefit for 16 months instead of 12 months during the period he worked between age 62 and 66 joes actuarial reduction would be adjusted to reflect his receipt of social security benefits for only 32 months prior to his full retirement age instead of 36 months under current law after the ret joes actuarial reduction would be reduced from 20 to approximately 167 thus under the policy option at age 66 joes benefit increases from 1600 pia of 2000 x 080 under current law to 1666 pia of 2000 x 83 under the policy option benefit increase of 4 in summary the ret can either magnify the size of benefit reduction under policy change or appear to create benefit increase relative to current law depending on whether an individual is below or above the full retirement age

for future retirees by using combination of wage indexing and price indexing in the benefit formula to apply differing degrees of benefit reduction based on the workers careeraverage level of earnings the following section explains the mechanics of the progressive price indexing option examined in this report 121 the basic steps used to calculate initial benefits for future retirees under the progressive price indexing option include

the benefits of lowwage workers would be pres erved by establishing new bend point in the pia formula below which initial benefits would continue to be fully wageindexed for the option analyzed in this report the new bend point would be established at the 30th percentile of earnings this means that workers with careeraverage earnings in the lowest 30 of the earnings distribution would experience change in benefits relative to current law the new bend point would fall between the first and second bend points under current law the replacement factors for the now four brackets of average indexed monthly earnings in the benefit formula would be set initially at 90 32 32 and 15 the new bend point would increase each year after 2013 by the rate of growth of the national average wage just as the two current bend points are wageindexed all workers with careeraverage earnings below this new bend point would continue to have their initial benefits fully wageindexed workers with careeraverage earnings above the new bend point would have their initial benefits reduced because the third and fourth replacement factors 32 and 15 would be adjusted downward each year described in

for those who become eligible for retiredworker benefits in 2013 and each year thereafter calculate hypothetical fully priceindexed pia for worker who had maximum earnings over hisher career and the percentage reduction in benefits between this hypothetical pia and the current law pia ssa would compute the percentage benefit reduction that would apply for career highwage earner 122 if all three of the currentlaw pia factors 90 32 and 15 were fully priceindexed 121 these steps follow those described in memorandum from stephen goss chief actuary of the social security administration to robert pozen dated february 10 2005 see httpwwwssagovoactsolvencyrpozen_20050210pdf 122 career highwage earner is someone who earned at or above the taxable wage base for at least 35 years in their entire

the full retirement age in future year were determined to be say 2800 per month and the percentage changes in prices and wages since 2011 were 28 and 39 respectively the benefit for highwage earner would be recalculated with each of the three pia factors multiplied by the ratio 10281039 or 989123 thus in this example the benefit of highwage earner under full price indexing would be reduced by 11 in 2013 the first year that price indexing would be in effect after ten yearsassuming that prices and wages continue d to grow annually by 28 and 39the pia factors would be multiplied by 1028 10103910

the new bend point 32 and 15 that would result in the same benefit reduction for careerlong maximumwage earners those always at or above the annual maximum taxable wage as would have applied to these earners if price indexing had been applied to all workers this would reduce benefits for careerlong maximumwage earners by the same percentage as they would have been reduced if the benefit formula were fully priceindexed for workers at all earnings levels benefits would be reduced by smaller percentage for workers with careerlong average wages and not at all for workers with average wages that fall in the lowest 30 of the earnings distribution 123 earnings are indexed to the average wage level two years pr ior to the workers first year of eligibility because there is twoyear lag time associated with the release of official wage data for given year thus if the first year the policy applies is 2013 it would be necessary to obtain the official wage data from 2011

institutes dynamic simulation of income model dynasim is computer model that uses survey data to project demographic changes retirement income and social security benefits it was created by the urban institute and was purchased by the congressional research service dynasim can be used to analyze the consequences of retirement and aging policy issues on individual and family income and benefits one of the major advantages of using the dynasim model is the ability to analyze the distributional effects of social security proposals for example dynasim can be used to 1 analyze the difference in benefit levels between particular social security reform proposal and current law 2 model the combined effects of multiple and complex policy changes on individual and family benefits and total income 3 model the effect of change in social security policy on an individuals eligibility for other meanstested federal programs eg ssi the effect on individuals and families can be broken down along multiple demographic and economic lines such as gender educational attainment marital status race and wealth g10g152g160g561g6g152g142g156g561g6g162g151g138g156g146g150g561g25g152g155g148g501g561 through statistical adjustments of the data sources listed below dynasim projects the major pillars of retirement income starting with representative sample of individuals and nuclear families the model ages the data year by year from 1993 to 2050 characteristics such as an individuals year of birth educational attainment marital status and race are used to predict future values of variables such as earnings marital changes and wealth for each year dynasim simulates such demographic events as births deaths marriages and divorces and such economic events as labor force participation earnings hours of work disability onset and retirement the large amount of demographic and income information makes dynasim particularly suitable to analyze the distributional effects of various social security reform proposals and other issues relating to the aged population for example retired worker social security benefits are based on 35 years of workers earning history having tool such as dynasim that contains an individuals earning history as well as the individuals traits over hisher entire career is essential to modeling social security reforms one such policy option that requires 40 years of workers earning history is to increase the number of computation years from 35 to 40 in addition to modeling provisions that require long work histor ies we can analyze how benefits change due to changes in life events such as marital status change or the death of spouse over the span of the individuals lifetime at the end of the simulation process we have detailed information on the lifetimes of multiple individuals with all of the information needed to calculate social security benefits and total incomes in addition to workers earning histories the dynasim model includes additional retirement income projections useful for analyzing policy options these projections include but are not limited to social security coverage eligibility and benefit levels pension coverage and participation income from assets and supplemental security income ssi

resources the base population is composed of households from the 1990 through 1993 panels of the survey of income and program participation sipp this sample consists of more than 100000 people and 44000 families and is limited to individuals who answered questions regarding assets and pensions124 annual earnings are created from mixture of historical and projected data earnings histories are calculated for sipp respondents by matching individuals from the sipp to individuals interviewed in the panel study of income dynamics psid and to individuals interviewed in the 1972 current population survey cps the 1972 cps is unique dataset because it is matched to social security administrative records the 1972 cps is matched to the social security administrations summary of earnings records and is used to provide sipp respondents with earnings between the years 1951 and 1967 the psid also collects annual earnings information and provides sipp respondents with earnings between the years 1968 and 1992 once earnings are imputed for the years 1968 through 1992 earnings are then projected for the years 1993 through 2050 dynasim uses information from the panel study of income dynamics and the national longitudinal survey of youth to project individual earnings from 1993 through 2050 using series of statistical regression equations the earnings are projected in five steps first hourly wages are estimated using randomeffects model second results from the hourly wage model are used to calculate predicted wages for all individuals in the psid third the number of annual hours worked is predicted using tobit model that includes the predicted wage results from the previous regression in the fourth step labor force participation is estimated using randomeffect probit model finally the labor force participation rates are adjusted to reflect projected employment rates from the oasdi trustees report by age and gender the model utilizes survey data to estimate population growth family formation education and health earnings employee benefits asset accumulation pension and social security benefits and payroll taxes some of the survey data used to estimate these processes include the survey of income and program participation the panel study of income dynamics the current population survey the health and retirement survey the national longitudinal mortality study the national longitudinal survey of youth estimates from the social security administrations office of the chief actuary vital statistics the pension simulation model from the policy

despite the many advantages of using microsimul ation model such as dynasim one must keep in mind the caveats that are common to the use of microsimulation models in general such caveats include but

ocacts fertility and mortality assumptions are too optimistic or pess imistic will also have the same views of dynasims fertility and mortality assumptions in addition dynasim models mortality using an individuals age raceethnicity marital status education disability status and work history there may be other variables that affect mortality that are not used in this model 2 like all projections historical information is used to calculate future information for individuals such as future earnings future marital status changes future pensions etc there may be historical information however that will not provide good estimates of future values for example 40 years ago it could not have been foreseen how technological advancements would have altered mortality and earnings similarly future technology and medical advancements will have an effect on the population that can not currently be predicted model such as dynasim would not be able to factor in these kinds of advancements unless they are already somehow accounted for in historical information put another way the model assumes that the future will resemble the past the model often uses variety of techniques eg cohort effects to place heavier weight on more recent experience than on less recent experience the model projects social and economic change mainly through change in the composition of the population 3 microsimulation models require many assumptions and utilize many specific mathematical equations therefore care should be taken when interpreting results for example because of their detailed assumptions microsimulation models better represent relative changes in benefits rather than exact benefit levels all microsimulation models are estimates of what given population will look like in the future because they are estimates all microsimulation models contain some level of error by analyzing relative differences rather than point estimates such as average benefits some of the error is controlled for because the underlying error will be the same under both options thus microsimulation models will be more accurate in stating that plan is estimated to result in 23 increase in benefits over current law than stating that individuals under plan receive monthly benefit of 900 because the error found in microsimulation models is difficult to quantify but can be mitigated by comparing plans across the same population and in essence holding the error constant in addition to the caveats associated with microsimulation models there are caveats that are specific to the dynasim model for example 1 dynasim does not model the old law social security benefit rules in place prior to 1979 therefore the benefits for the oldest individuals may not precisely reflect the level of benefits that they actually received 2 dynasim does not include behavioral changes resulting from the modification of the social security benefit and tax structures thus changes to social securitys tax or benefit structure will not automatically alter an individuals work patterns or retirement decision 3 dynasim does not include macroeconomic feedbacks change in the social security program can affect other segments of the economy for example benefit cut could have effects on the labor force participation and the savings rate these kinds of macroeconomic effects cannot automatically be modeled using the dynasim model thus second order microeconomic effects such as the effect of the savings rate on the interest rate earned by individual accounts cannot be modeled

tax module because social security benefits may be subject to income taxation reform options that alter the level of social security benefits can also alter the amount of income tax paid by individuals although income taxes cannot be modeled the amount of social security payroll taxes paid can easily be calculated from an individuals earnings 5 dynasim is not social security actuarial model and thus cannot estimate the solvency effect of proposed policy change the dynasim model does not contain all of the information required to produce solvency estimates for ex ample dynasim does not calculate childrens benefits and so complete account of benefit payments cannot be calculated in addition dynasim simulates the population between the years 1993 and 2050 the benefits received by individuals outside of this yearly range would not be included in the calculations for these same reasons longterm cost estimates cannot be calculated 6 dynasim incorporates differences in processes on the basis of raceethnicity where the data suggest that such differences are significant the literature is not always definitive on the magnitude of differences by race and measurement issues can complicate estimation of such effects we thus suggest conservative interpretation of differences by race and hispanicity despite the caveats related to microeconomic models and specifically to dynasim the urban institutes dynamic simulation model is an extremely useful tool for analyzing the effects of social security reform proposals and other topics related to the aged the wealth of demographic and economic information found in the dynasim model enables crs to provide members of congress with indepth analysis regarding the distributional effects of reform proposals that would not be possible without the use of microsimulation model
