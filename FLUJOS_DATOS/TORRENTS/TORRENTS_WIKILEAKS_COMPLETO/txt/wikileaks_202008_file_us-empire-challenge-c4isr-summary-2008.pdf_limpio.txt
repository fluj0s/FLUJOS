communicationselectronics research development and engineering center cerdec organization chartered in june 2006 to perform integrated c4isr system of systems sos livevirtualconstructive lvc technology demonstrations on yearround basis pm c4isr otm facilities include relevant ield environment at fort dix nj and development integration and simulation laboratories that leverage high performance computing hpc capabilities at fort monmouth nj as an army capital investment pm c4isr otm supports both department of defense and industry technology development eforts by providing testassessanalyzeix environment in which systems supporting future force initiatives or being considered for acceleration into the current force can be matured and evaluated in relevant structured lowrisk manner activities conducted at pm c4isr otms lab or ield sites are not formal tests but are activities constructed as opportunities to expose systems to conditions not ordinarily available within their development environments he goal of these activities is to evaluate systems against speciic performance criteria and then facilitate maturation by providing early feedback to the developing organization from april through august of 2008 rdecom cerdec and pm c4isr onhemove executed the largest c4isr and networking technology demonstration to date referred to as c4isr onhemove event 08 e08 utilizing the combined capabilities of the joint megabase fort dix lakehurst naval air engineering station mcguire air force base e08 built upon the accomplishments of e07 both in the number of systems and in the complexity of their interconnections he demonstration enabled networkcentric environment incorporating more than 100 live communications sensor and battle command systems hese live systems were complemented by brigadesized element represented in virtual and constructive simulation utilizing organic hpc assets and instrumented via robust suite of automated data collection tools e08 was designed to assess the technical capability functionality maturity and performance of future emerging and spin out technologies and was comprised of axes of exploration collaborative eforts and technology excursions key issues relevant to the armys transformation efort were organized into ive diverse dependent axes of exploration termed brigade and above brigade and below fcs future force modeling and simulation and instrumentation data collection and reduction each axis of exploration difered in focus but all utilized common integrated c4isr sos architecture each axis addressed requirements from various customer organizations but all were aligned to facilitate overall event execution and designed to support broader army and dod requirements for each axis individual systems were evaluated in componentlevel assessments communication sensor and battle command systems were then integrated into sos for endtoend technical evaluations finally force efectiveness was studied by conducting missions designed to assess technology in relevant environment customized automated data collection and reduction tools developed by the pm and leveraged from army and dod partners were employed which allowed comprehensive evaluation and assessment of both individual system and emerging sos metrics for oficial use only distribution limited as speciied on

architecture and elements of pm c4isr otms physical infrastructure andor integration services to explore and mature technology readiness in an environment not ordinarily available to individual systems hese activities are characterized as collaborative eforts finally technology providers performed focused componentlevel analyses or technology excursions which utilized the sos architecture but did not contribute to the integrated sos analyses c4isr otm e08 was executed by employing mix of objective surrogate and simulated platforms and systems since all elements of the architecture were not available and in place during any given assessment activity tight coupling between planning design and execution strategies was required each e08 axis of exploration was as large and complex as any pm c4isr otm event prior to 2006 additionally e08 was over three times as large as the 2006 capstone experiment and employed signiicantly more complex data collection and reduction techniques and ms capabilities than e07 over seventyive government and industry organizations and technology providers as well as soldiers from the 29th infantry regiment ft benning participated in e08 on peak days approximately 400 people supported simultaneous activities across fort dix lakehurst naval air engineering station fort monmouth hanscom air force base and china lake in total more than one thousand
