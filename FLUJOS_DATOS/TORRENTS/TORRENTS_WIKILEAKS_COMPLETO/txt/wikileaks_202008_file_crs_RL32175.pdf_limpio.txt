finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32175insurance guaranty funds summary some constituencies are urging congress to allow insurers to become federally regulated like banks other constituencies are urging congress to instead ratify its 1945 delegation of insurance regulation to the states in the past few years various pieces of legislation have been introduced to implement some form of federal charter for insurance companies the latest such legislation is the national insurance act of 2007 s 40 and hr 3200 how to protect insurance policyholders in the event of their insurers insolvency is among the thorniest issues in insuran ce regulation whether fe deral or statebased the current system of protection for insu rance policyholders is called insurance guaranty funds this interdependent syst em is cooperative effort among regulators and insurers in the states where the insolvent insurer operated it is administered statebystate and funded by assessments on insurers though it has developed relatively recently the system has provided some protection for policyholders of both large and small insolvent insurers if congress were to consider regulating insurers federally it would confront the issues of whether and how to provide th at policyholder protection should congress wish to protect insurance policyholders in an insolvency it might choose to establish or expand federal program like the fe deral deposit insuran ce corporation the pension benefit guaranty co rporation or the national cr edit union share insurance fund another option would be to require fe derally regulated insu rers to participate in the statebased guaranty fund system establishing federal protection for policyholders of insolvent federally regulated insurers would have costs and benefits direct costs woul d include at the least the costs of establishing and administering th system costs could also include funding of catastrophic shortfalls as happened in the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s indirect costs could include inefficiencies that might result from dampening market discipline the measure of benefit to policyholders would depend on the scope of protection offered the poten tial benefit to the us ec onomy would require further analysis requiring federally regulate d insurers to participate in state guaranty funds would have costs and bene fits as well the costs would include the economic inefficiencies created by externalizing the costs of ineffective solvency regulation the benefits would be simplicity nd consolidated assessment base

debate1 proponents of federal regulation of insurers make analogies to banks and their regulation they argue that insurers like banks should be allowed to elect whether to hold state or federal charter and to r eap the perceived benef its of choosing their regulator the analogy of insurers to ba nks is useful insurers and banks are both financial intermediaries pe rforming similar important func tions in the us economy they are also both so important that our society has constr ucted protection for consumers holding contracts with insolven t financial intermediaries of both types the federal insurance funds of the fede ral deposit insurance corporation fdic the pension benefit guaran ty corporation pbgc and the national credit union share insurance fund ncusif provide similar protections they operate differently however than the statebased system of insurance guaranty funds2 these differences may gain significance if congre ss considers federal re gulation of insurers how insurance guaranty funds work provision for policyholders of insolvent in surers began slowly in the late 1930s by the 1950s some states had security funds for disabled workers covered by insolvent workmens compensation insurers and few had similar provision for policyholders of insolvent automobile in surers then in the late 1960s congress considered creating fede ral fund similar to the fdic to protect all property liability policyholders state regulators and insurers objected to federal regulation and they cooperated to create model law that at least 47 states had enacted in some form by 19743 most states did not enact life and health insurance guaranty fund laws until after the baldwinunited insolvency in 1983 and the executive lifehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32175crs2 4 see national

states had enacted life and health insurance guaranty fund laws by late 19925 three principles guided the drafters of both model laws policyholders should not lose their risk protection upon insolvency losses due to insolvency should be shared and claim payments should not be unduly delayed by an insolvency these principles operate differently in propertyliability insurer insolvencies than they do in life and annuity insolvencies as discussed below property and liability coverages are shortterm contracts usually long er than one year while life and annuity contracts are longterm contracts often for the life of the insured6 under both model laws once the home state insurance commissioner determines that the insurer whether propertyliability or life is financially troubled the commissioner is required to ta ke steps to protect policyholders and claimants the commissioner can order the insurer to take corrective steps and to suspend business the commissioner can petition state court either for an order of rehabilitation if it is determined that the insurers pr oblems can be corrected or for an order of liquidation if it is not the courts order of li quidation appoints the commissioner as liquidator and the commissi oner appoints receiver the receiver takes possession of the insurers offices r ecords and assets assuming the records are adequate the receiver advises policy holders and claimants of the insurers liquidation and of the process for filing claim against the insurers estate7 cooperation among the states where the in solvent insurer opera ted is essential usually the insurance commissioner in the insurers state of incorporation known as its domicile or domiciliary state petitions first for an order of liquidation from state court in that domicile and that court retains principal jurisdiction over the insurers liquidation the domiciliary insurance commissioner also appoints the lead receiver insurance regulators in th other states where the insurer operated will appoint ancillary receivers af ter entries of orders of li quidation in those states thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32175crs3 8 ibid the national organization of life and

generally triggers the operation of that states guaranty fund though the trigger vari by state each guaranty fund is mandatory association of all licensed insurers doing business in that state each fund has board of those insurers and the board governs the fund an accumulation of money does not actually exis t until after th insolvents liabilities and assets are evaluated each participating insurer is billed for its proportionate share of the shortfall and each insurer remits its allocat ed share for that particular insolvency9 the fund is the sum of those remittances the term guaranty fund can also refer to insurers statutory obligation to participate in this protection system10 in general each states guaranty fund is responsible for the policyholders residing in that state and the protection extends only to policyholders of licensed insurers within the limits of statutory coverage in that state of residence propertyliability insurers the entry of an order of liquidation of propertyliability insurer typically terminates all existing prope rtyliability policies within 30 days though the insurer remains liable for any claims that arose befo re the order the order usually prohibits the insurer from issuing any new policies and it suspends all claims payments to allow an orderly and equitable evaluation of the insurers liabilities and assets state laws give policyholders claims on the assets precedence over general creditors but not over the expenses incurred by the liquidator receiver and guaranty associations the entry of the order of liquidation obligates that states propertyliability guaranty association to begin processing claims from residents though it is not obligated to cover all claims for exampl most states laws usually cap coverage at 300000 and exclude claims for punitive da mages the propertyliability insurers that are members of the guaranty associa tion assess themselves proportionate to their premium volume in that state to fund the difference between the insolvents assets and the residents claims the assessments are imposed first on the particular type of propertyliability insurance that occas ioned the insolvency and are limited to 1 to 2 annually of each insure rs premium volume in that line in that state if that assessment proves insufficient then other types of propertyliability insurance known as accounts may be ssessed as well most stat allow assessed insurershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32175crs4 11 for further information see national confer ence of insurance guaranty funds guaranty fund laws summary 2007

organization of life and health guaranty associations facts figures guaranty association laws available at httpwwwnolhgacomfactsandfigur esmaincfmlocationstateinfoto include the assessments in their rate s though some states allow insurers to surcharge policyholders or offset the assessment against their premium taxes11 life insurers the entry of an order of liquidation of life insurer in contrast does not cancel life or health insurance policies or annuity contracts the rationale is that unlike propertyliability coverage which an insured may replace easily life and health insurance and annuity contracts may be difficult to replace the model laws drafters decided that to preserve the policyholders risk protection through an insolvency coverage issued by life insurer should be continued through an insolvency in practice life insurance guaranty associations often meet this obligation collectively by selling or transferring the covered policies to another life insurer as with propertyliability insurance there are limits on life insurance guaranty fund protection generally 300000 is th limit on life insurance death benefits 100000 is the limit on cash values in life insurance and nnuity contracts and 100000 is the limit on health insurance policy benefits most states laws cap coverage for any one life at 300000 thoug h some states have higher limits guaranty association coverage usually extends neither to any policy or portion of policy in which the policyholder bears the investment risk nor to hmos also as with propertyliability insuran ce licensed life insurers in each state assess themselves for the shortfall ty pically assessments up to 2 of each life insurers premium volume by type or account are imposed annually if that assessment proves insufficient then othe r types or accounts ma be assessed most states allow life insurers to recoup those assessments by offsetting up to 20 of the assessment against their premium taxes for five years12 other financial intermediaries protection systems the fdic protects deposits in banks nd savings associations the pension benefit guaranty corporati on pbgc protects particip ants in defined

summarized in chart in the appendix policy issues opinions differ markedly over whether the current insurance guaranty fund system functions well or poorly supporters say that the cu rrent system has been very effective the president of the nationa l conference of insurance guaranty funds ncigf notes that funds have paid out about 21 billion in claims that would have gone unpaid in the last four decades13 the national organiza tion of life and health guaranty associations nolhga indicat that since 1983 guaranty funds have protected 22 million policyholders by guaranteeing more than 212 billion in benefits and contributed 44 billion to sure that policyholders received their benefits14 some critics of the current state in surance guaranty fund system say it is inefficient slow parochial and fragmented and they urge that it be replaced with federal system or significantly reformed15 other critics say the existence of guaranty funds distorts incentives by allowing some insurers to increase risktaking behavior and by imposing the costs of that be havior on more conservative insurers16 the critics say that the current system provides powerful risk subsidy incentive that solvency monitoring does not entirely offset17 that effect is exacerbated by flathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32175crs6 17 continued 477498 quoting from p494 18 feldhaus and kazenski riskbase d

one critic has observed that incentives are further distorted by the existence of tax offsets and by the insurers ability to pass some of these costs to policyholders19 whether to change the current system of policyholder protection would be significant policy issue in any legislation to authorize or require federal regulation of insurers in the 110th congress senators john sununu and tim johnson introduced the senate version of the national insurance act of 2007 s 40 and representatives melissa bean and ed royce introduced house version h r 3200 both bills would require all federally li censed insurers to participate in state guaranty funds with the possibility of federal guaranty fund if the state guaranty funds do not treat national insurers in the same manner as state insurers versions of the national insurance act s 2509 and hr 6225 were also introduced in the 109th congress by senators sununu and johns on and representative royce20 in the 108th congress senator ernest hollin gs introduced legislation s 1373 to require all interstate insurers to be federally licensed and regulated it would have established prefunded nati onal insurance guaranty ssociation and required all interstate insurers to pay into the fund in the 107th congress representative lafalce introduced legislation hr 3766 to allow insurers to elect federal licensing and regulation it would have required all insurers ecting federal regulation to participate in state guaranty associati ons senator chuck sc humer proposed similar legislation in the 107th congress to create an optional federal charter for insurers21 it also would have required fe derally regulated insurers to participate in statebased system of policyholder protection operating generally as it does now some of the policy issues that cong ress might confront should it consider federal chartering for insurers are as follows should federal legislation create federally based protection system for federally chartere d insurers or instead require them to participate in the state based guaranty fund systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32175crs7 22 see generally jeanjacques laffont and david martimort the theory of incentives the principalagent problem princeton nj prince ton univ press 2002creating federally based pr otection system would enta il direct federal costs at least for establishing and maintaining its administrative infrastructure even if the system were administered by the fdic requiring federally regulated insurers to participate in statebased protection system would entail significant though unquantifiable indirect costs to policyholders insurers and taxpayers this is because incentives would be misaligned that is the costs of insolvencies would fall on the states not on the federal regulator and the states though bearing the financial burde n would have control over the effectiveness of federal regulation for solvency these conflicting objectives could create the potential for significant economic inefficiencies22 if congress considers federal regulation of insurers should it also consider creating federal syst em of policyholder protection creating federal policy holder protection system for federally regulated insurers might stress the federal budget and arguably undermine market discipline on the other hand it mig ht more directly align behavioral incentives because federal regulator would have both the responsibility for regulating for solvency and the respons ibility for all or some portion of the unfunded claims of an insolvent insure r as well as for administering the liquidation should any federal system of po licyholder protection include or exclude stateregulated insurers including stateregulated insurers in any federal policyhol der protection system could distort incentives because it w ould bifurcate the responsibility for solvency regulation of statecharted insurers from the consequences of any failure of that regulation on the othe r hand excluding statechartered insurers from any federal system might destabilize either or both of the federal and state protection systems this is because fe wer insurers would be members of either system which would mean that any assessments would be imposed on reduced premium base if congress were to create fe deral protection system what limits should apply the principal issues would be deciding what types of policyholders would be protected in the event of an insurers insolvency and what the limits on their recovery should be this would be challenging especially for property coverages for regional disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes and for business liability coverages also if congress wished to protect only policyholders of federally regulated insurers then constituents might have different levels of protec tion depending on whether th eir insurers were state regulated or federally regulated alternatively congress might require states to adopt levels of protection identical to the federal levels if congress were to create fede ral policyholder protection system should it be prefunded or postfundedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32175crs8 23 dan swanson

historically averse to paying for an governmentheld fund their competitors in the financial intermediation marketplace such as banks and savings institutions might argue that insurers should be subject to prefunding like themselves there would be technical i ssues too such as whether to maintain separate funds for life insurers and propertyliability insurers and how to calculate an appropr iate fund balance if congress were to create fede ral policyholder protection system should an insurers assessments be based on its risk profile though some argue that flat assessm ent rates dilute market discipline determining how to profile insurers risks could become technically complicated and politically contentious insurers are required currently to hold additional capital based on their risks very generally speaking life insurers calculate that additional required capital ba sed on categorization of the riskiness of their investments and propertyliability insurers calculate it based on the types of insurance they underwrite and their past experience in each line of insurance23 whether analogous calculations woul d be feasible for guaranty fund assessments has not been studied other issues would include whether insu rers should have access to the federal reserve boards discount window and the relationship of any federal system of policyholder protection to the fdic24 conclusion whether to maintain some level of policyholder protection against insolvency may be significant issue in any congressi onal consideration of federal regulation of insurers how to offer that protection will likely entail more difficult decisions policy considerations could in clude whether to offer fede ral protection or to require federally regulated insurers to participate in the ex isting state system should congress decide to offer fe deral protection technical i ssues could include how to fund the protection its scope the location of the administering agency in the executive
