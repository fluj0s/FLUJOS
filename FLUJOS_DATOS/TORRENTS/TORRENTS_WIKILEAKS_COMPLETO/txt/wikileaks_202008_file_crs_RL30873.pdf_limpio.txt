specialist in economic policy government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873saving in the united states how has it changed and why is it important summary how much we save as nation has si gnificant consequences for the economy saving is that share of income that is not consumed by saving more now we can raise our living standard in the future because it is not consumed it is available for investment in new capital as well as replacements to the existing capital stock as it wears out growing capital stock is an important contributor to increases in productivity and thus risi ng standard of living whether or not we are saving enough as nation is of cons iderable relevance to number of public policy issues including how to reform social security whether or not to balance the federal budget nd the efficacy of individual retirement accounts and other forms of private saving incentives there is concern that we are not saving enough while the personal saving rate averaged nearly 7 of gross domestic product gdp in the 1970s and 1980s it fell during the 1990s and in 2000 fell to near zero total gross national saving averaged 197 of gdp during the 1970s but fell to an average of 171 during the 1990s in recent years the national saving rate has recovered somewhat during the 1990s total private saving fell but during the same period increased public sector saving more than offset the decline clearly during that period without the emergence of significant public sector budget surpluses the national saving ra would likely have fallen further more recently in part due to federal governme nt budget deficits national saving has fallen saving from domestic sources is insufficient to provide for all of domestic investment as result we are importing resources from abroad prior to the 1980s the united states was net supplier of savi ng to foreigners during the 1980s and 1990s however we have been importing savi ng from abroad at an average of 15 of gdp this net inflow of foreign capita l has consequences in order to invest funds in the united states foreigners must first buy dollars that raises the foreign exchange value of the dollar the rising dollar in turn makes imports cheaper and us exports more expensive the result is trade deficit that mirrors the net inflow of foreign capital raising the national saving rate has become priority to some policymakers two routes have been used to achieve this goal one has been attempts to reduce the federal budget deficit in the 1990s this policy was so successful that substantial surplus was temporarily achieved this approach to raising the national saving rate was supported by wide spectrum of econo mists the second approach has been to attempt to raise the household saving rate by giving preferentia l tax treatment to specific form of household saving the ira the effectiveness of this approach is unclear and it does not share the same widespread support among economistshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873contents t h m s u r m n t f s v i n g 2 d t n v r i u s m s u r s f s v i n g4 p r i v t s c t r s v i n g4 g r s s r n t p r i v t s v i n g 6 p u b l i c s c

this report rather than savings for an important reason in the lexicon of economics saving refers to the fl ow of nations output which is not consumed savings carries somewhat different connotation it is generally used as synonym for wealth and refers to the stock of assets that have been accumulated as result of saving portion of the nations outputsaving in the united states how has it changed and why is it important saving is considered by many to be synonymous with thrift which is usually thought of as simply putting money aside in bank or buying stocks and bonds economists however have something broader in mind than putting money in bank or adding to ones holdings of financial assets for them saving represents that portion of total national output that is not used for consumption as such it represents output or resources that can be used to create sustain and expand the nations stock of capital1 while the nations capital stock is often thought of in tangible terms as the machinery equipment and structures that are needed to produce output it also has an important human dimension this consis ts of the skills and knowledge of its labor force its entrepreneurial skills social orga nization etc factor s that are essential in making the best use of the existing st ock of physical capital to produce goods and services creating new physical capital improving its efficiency over time and innovating new ways to produce output thus nations capital stock has both ta ngible and intangible component and the act of saving frees resources to cr eate renew and expand both tangible and intangible capital the growth of this capital over time is closely linked to the growth in the material wellbeing of na tions citizens growth in per capita real income over time is an important measure of the ability of an economy to deliver the goods when an economy di sappoints in the sense of being unable to deliver continuously rising standard of living or st andard that rises at the same rate it did historically economists are often led to investigate the growth rate of the capital stock and this leads inevitably to an inves tigation of the saving rate there is widespread perception that the us econom has come up short in this regard over much of the past 25 years for this r eason the national saving rate has come under scrutiny whether or not we are saving enough as nation is of considerable relevance to number of public policy issues including what to do with rising budget surpluses how to reform social security and the efficacy of individual retirement accounts and other forms of private saving incentiveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs2 2 gross domestic product measures all output pr oduced in the united states regardless of who owns the productive factors gross national pr oduct gnp on the other hand measures all output produced by american ow ned factors of production regardless of where they are domiciled for the united states the two measures have been virtually the same over time 3 since many governments operate programs which transfer income from one group of continuedinvestigating the causes for the international differences in economic performance often leads to an investigation of the differences in national saving rates these differences have been an important part of some explanations for the occasionally lackluster perform ance of the us economy thus from both national and internati onal perspective concern has arisen about the adequacy of the us saving rate the measurement of saving the basic measurement of saving for the united states comes from the national income and product accounts hereafter nipa prepared by the bureau of economic analysis bea of the department of co mmerce some may presume that saving is done primarily by individuals or hou seholds while this is an important component of domestic saving it is not th only source saving is also done by businesses and by all vels of government the public sector moreover since the united states is an integral part of th wider world economy it both supplies saving to and absorbs saving from the rest of the world in this section the various components of aggregate saving will be identified private saving will be distinguished fro m public saving and both private and public will be combined in measure known as national saving in order to define and measure the diffe rent saving rates and to organize the discussion as well as provide some analyti cal tools for the subsequent discussion of policies toward saving it is necessary to explore in greater detail the concept of saving found in the nipa gross domestic product gdp can be calcu lated in two different ways first by adding up all of the income earned in the production of goods and services and second by adding up the value of all the goods and services produced to measure saving it is necessary to make use of both2 measures of income can be used to obtain estimates of saving done by the private sector on the income side of the accounts gdp is computed by adding up all of the payments made to those who supply inputs the factors of production towards the production of the nations output of goods and services these factor payments consist of wages and salaries interest rent and profits the income recipients then use this income for the consumption of domestically produced goods for paying taxes for buying foreig n goods imports and for saving3 total or grosshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs3 3 continued citizens to another taxes as measured in the gdp accounts are net of these transfer payments 4 part of total business output is allocated to the replacement of existing capital as it wears out this part is referred to as depreciation or capital consumption allowances since it is output not consumed it is regarded as saving it is only component of gross saving however because it does not add to the stock of wealth the distinction between gross and net saving is explored in more detail belowprivate sector saving then represents income that is not used for the first three purposes the private saving rate measures more than just saving by households the nipa break down private saving into tw parts that done by households also referred to as personal saving and that done by businesse s household or personal saving consists primar ily of the saving of individuals and the profits that are retained by noncorporate businesses pr oprietorships business saving includes the profits retained by corporate businesses and the depreciation allowances of all businesses both corporate and noncorporate4 to measure public sector saving and the national saving rate the alternative or product measure of gdp must also be us ed on the product side of the accounts gdp is measured by adding together th nations expenditures on final goods and services such expenditures fall into four categories the spending of households on the consumption of domestically produced goods and services the spending of households and businesses on capital g oods or investment the spending of government or the public sector on g oods and services and the spending of foreigners on goods and services produ ced in the united states or exports since both the income and product pproaches measure common variable gdp the sum of the components of each must be equal thus consumption taxes imports saving must be equal to consumption investment government exports since consumption appears in both measures of gdp it can be dropped in the computation of national saving that leaves taxes less transfers or t imports or m private saving or s which is equal to investment or i government purchases of final output or g exports or x mathematically this is tm sigx which after rearranging gives st g m x i this equation yields two important relationships first it provides definition of aggregate saving as the sum of privat saving the net budget position of the publichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs4 5 basically the balance of payments concept used here is close to what is known as the current account of the balance of paymentsfigure 1 gross private savingsector ie the difference between taxes less transfers and gove rnment expenditures for final output and the status of the nati ons balance of intern ational payments the difference between the import and export of goods and services5 second it says that investment is equal to aggregate saving this establishes the importance of saving to the capital formation of the nation should domestic investment change over time the proximate cause for the change can be traced to changes in private saving the budget position of the public s ector or the balance of international payments data on various measures of saving having defined the various measures of saving the figures and tables below depict their behavior and importa nce over the postworld war ii era private sector saving figure 1 shows the gross saving rate of the private sector and the contributions of its two components several important observations are worth making first the major share of private sector saving is due to businesses and consists of corporate retained earnings and the depreciation allowances of all businesses personal saving has played smaller role source department of commerce bureau of economic analysishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs5 table 1 gross private saving as percentage of gdp 1950 1959 162 1960 1969 1711970 1979 1851980 1989 1921990 1999 168 source department of commerce bureau of economic analysis second while the private sector saving rate over the longer run has tended to be stable for fairly long periods of time it can vary considerably on yearbyyear basis some of this is due to the influence of the business cycle the rate tends to fall in cyclical downturns and rise in upturns third since the early 1980s the personal sa ving rate has been declining and has recently been at or near alltime lows wh ereas the business savi ng rate has held up well over this same period the decline in the personal saving ra accounts in part for decline in the gross saving rate since the mid1980s in figure 2 the business saving rate is divi ded into its two components capital consumption or depreciation and undistributed profits or retained earnings until the early 1980s an increasing proportion of gross business saving was accounted for by capital consumption allowances with decreasing proportion accounted for by undistributed profits some of the rise in capital consumption allowances up to 1982 reflects the rising proportion of tota l investment accounted for by shortlived assets eg business equipment as opposed to office buildingshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs6 6 one element of this controversy centers on the method used to compute capital consumption allowances see goldstein henry should we fret about our low net national saving rate cato journal vol 9 3 winter 1990 pp 641662 7 later the importance of gross versus net w ill be discussed in connection with investment and productivity some economists believe that gross investment is important because new capital that replaces existing capital is likely to embody new technologies and be more productive thus even if net investment occu rs so that the existing capital stock is just replaced as it wears out productivity can still rise 8 for 2000 the personal saving rate was negative households consumed more than their disposable incomefigure 2 components of gross business saving source department of commerce bureau of economic analysis because capital consumption allowances are such large fraction of gross private saving how they are measured is of importance since it can have substantial effect on the net saving rate of the country there has been some controversy over their measurement6 gross or net private saving when the gross saving rate is the focus of attention personal saving is relatively small fraction of th total however large fraction of business saving in the form of depreciation allowances is destined mainly to replace the existing capital stock as it wears out and does not increase the size of the capital stock7 growing capital stock depends on the net saving rate and from net perspective personal saving has been more important than the undistributed profits of businesses because of this cr ucial role it is the decline in the personal saving rate that began in the last half of the 1980s highlighted in table 2 that has raised the concern of policy makers and has been the subject of considerable analysis by economists8 the reasons for this decline are discussed in subsequent sectionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs7 9 this is recent innovation in the nipa accounts hitherto all government expenditures were treated as consumption thus the si ze and the depreciation of the governments continuedtable 2 net private saving as percentage of gdp personal saving undistributed profits 1950 1959 55 30 1960 1969 57 391970 1979 68 301980 1989 67 231990 1999 44 24 1990 58 181991

readily appa rent that government at all levels spending and tax policies influence the national saving rate yet when government gathers more reve nue in taxes than it spends on purchases of final output or in transfer payments it adds to the resources available fo r nonconsumption uses conversely when it spends more than it r eceives in taxes it absorbs resources that might otherwise be ava ilable for investment the public sector also owns considerable amount of capital in the form of roads bridges harbors canals waterways airports etc these like capital in the private sector are subject to depreciation the nipa accounts now recognize this depreciation thus according government cap ital comparable treatment to private capital9 it also makes necessary distinc tion between gross nd net public savinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs8 9 continued capital were ignored it was treated as though it did not exist 10 if gross public sector saving rates were show n the levels would be slightly higher but the pattern of variation would be similar 11 some of the variation in the federal saving rate arises because of periodic fluctuations of the business cycle saving rates based on cbo estimates of the standardizedemployment budget deficit and potential gdp yield an average federal saving rate of 12 for the 1960s 10 for the 1970s 26 for the 1980s and 16 for the 1 990s see congressional budget office the economic and budget outlook fiscal years 20022011 january 2001 continuedfigure 3 net public savingthe behavior of the two components of public sector saving is shown in figure 310 source department of commerce bureau of economic analysis throughout the post world war ii period state and local governments have made positive contribution to gross nationa l saving that averaged over decades has ranged between 1 and 2 of gdp on net basis it has been less than 1 after the korean war ended in 1953 th budget deficits of the federal government were heavily influenced by the business cycle the recession of 197375 led to the largest relative budget deficit in the post world war ii period up to that time beginning in the 1970s the federa l government became chronic dissaver even when the economy was doing well in 1997 the gross saving rate of the federal government was positive for the first time since 1971 even though its net saving rate in 1997 was negative 06 of gdp11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs9 11 continued p 141 12 notice that when the us is net lender abroad it is shown as negative fraction of gdp this occurs because to be net lender the export of goods and services must exceed the import of goods and services in terms of the national saving equation on page 3 m x is negative and lending abroad decreases saving available for domestic usesfigure 4 net international saving flows to the united statesthus beginning in the 1980s the us faced two developments that substantially reduced the available supply of domestic resources to augment the national capital stock the fall in both the ne t private and public s ector saving rates international saving as noted above the u s economy does not operate in isolation it is part of the worl d economy which is becoming increasingly integrated the united states is thus able to supply saving lend to the rest of the world and at the same time absorb sa ving borrow from other countries during its early years the united states depended on foreign capital saving to an important extent until world war i the united states was on balance debtor nation with the advent of world war i that changed the united states not only emerged from that war as an international power but as net creditor nation as well this position continued until the 1980s alt hough as shown on figure 4 the fraction of us saving lent abroad on an annua l basis was never rge fraction of gdp12 source department of commerce bureau of economic analysishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs10 figure 5 gross and net national savingthis behavior changed in the 1980s the united states became net absorber of the saving of the rest of the world that inflow of foreign saving has recently risen above 4 of gdp in one decade the infl ow of foreign saving was so large that according to some estimates the united st ates switched from being net creditor to net debtor nation at the least the ne t creditor position of the united states was seriously eroded notice however that an inflow of saving from abroad can help to ensure that some net investment take s place even if the dissaving of the public sector absorbs all of the net saving of the private sector national saving in figure 5 the household business and public sector saving rates are summed to arrive at gro ss and net national savi ng these measures exclude international saving over the long term there has been downward trend to these conventional nipa saving data which in the mid1990s was only temporarily interrupted source department of commerce bureau of economic analysis both the gross and net national saving rates displayed little trend in the first three decades after world war ii to be sure the rates displayed some fluctuations both were heavily influenced by the business cycle since private and public sector saving fall in downturns and rise in uptur ns both the gross and net national saving rates were on downward trend by 1980 trend which shows up clearly in the decade average data in table 3 this is surprising since the 1980s was period of sustained economic expansion an expansion that with the exception of the shallow downturn of 199091 continued into 2000 mo st disconcerting is the experience thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs11 13 for pessimistic assessment of the future consequences for the us economy of continuation

the decline the proximate causes for the decline in the net national saving rate according to the nipa can be seen in both tables 3 and 4 since net national saving results when capital consumption allowances are s ubtracted from gross national saving any rise in depreciation without corresponding rise in the gross saving rate can reduce the net rate and indeed this has occu rred during the 1980s and into the 1990s capital consumption allowances relative to gdp were higher than they averaged over the 20 year period 1950196914 the data in tables 4 and 5 reveal some interesting developments relating to the decline in the net national saving rate in evidence over the last three decades duringhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs12 197079 and 198089 the federal budg et deficit played the major role in the decline the fall in the rate at which businesses retained earnings also played an important though lesser role as did the fall in the personal saving rate during 198089

national saving rate thus negative contribution to the decline in the saving rate as did minor increase in net business saving the personal saving rate is believed by economists to respond to number of behavioral variables and so much effort has been devoted to explaining its declinehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs13 15 net national saving for japan may be significantly overestimated in the japanese national income accounts capital consumption is based on historic cost which results in lower estimate of capital consumption than would replacement cost and thus raises estimated net saving in the us nipa capital consumption is based on replacement cost shifting to replacement cost based measure of capital consumption would not change the fact that japan saves at higher rate than does the us but because estimated capital consumption for japan would be higher the estimated net national saving rate for japan would fall and the difference between net savi ng rates in the us and japan would be reduced see hayashi fumio why is japans saving rate so apparently high nber macroeconomics annual 1986 pp 147210 an updated version appears as an addendum to chapter 11 in hayashi fumio

source organisation for economic cooperation and development there are those who look at these data and conclude that the slowdown in us real income growth is largely self inflicted it is said that we

turning the public sector into large dissaver international saving diffe rences and gdp accounting it is possible that the conclusions drawn above regarding the us saving rate both when that rate is considered in isolation and when it is considered relative to other g7 countries are heavily influenced by how expenditu res are classified in the gdp accounts when some of these expenditures are recl assified more sanguine us picture emerges there are several expenditures that are currently treated in the us nipa accounts as consumption for wh ich case can be made that they ought to be treated as

outla ys are larger fraction of gdp in the us than in most other countries their exclusi on from investment can make difference when international comparisons are involved it s hould be noted that the type of adjustments to gdp accounts discussed here are those that chan ge the national saving rate there are number of adjustments that while they affect one or another of the component parts of the national saving rate have at most minimal effect on the overall rate some of these adjustments are discussed in appendix b 17 some economists include in educational expend itures the income that is

suggested in the discussion above with data from 10 countries over the period 1970 1984 they found that the fraction of us gdp devoted to capital formation rises from 78 of the average of these countries to 92 of that average in addition they made tw other adjustments since capital goods are cheaper in the us than abroad they want to compare real additions to capital relative to real gdp when this adjustment is made it raises the us saving rate to nearly the average of eight other industrial countries for whic h comparable adjustment can be made secondly lipsey and kravis wa nt to put us capital outlays on per capita basis when they do us expenditures on the broad measure of capital was more than 120 percent of the continuedare larger fraction of gdp in the us than abroad specifically these are expenditures on education research and velopment and consumer durable goods16 an important part of the capital stock of nation consists of the skills training and knowledge possessed by its workforce in short its stock of human capital the conventional nipa do not treat edu cational expenditures that enhance and expand the nations stock of human capital on par with those for physical capital17 if they did it would not only raise the us saving rate but rais it relative to those of most other countries ce the united states spends larger fraction of its gdp on education than do most other countries perhaps the strongest case for reclassification concerns expenditures on research and development these outlays are clear ly aimed at enhanc ing future productivity and living standards yet business r d spending is treated in the nipa as cost of current production which decreases the net profits and thus the saving of the business sector household spending on resi dential housing is currently included as investment but all other expenditures on durable goods eg automobiles appliances etc are treated as consumption18 some argue that this inc onsistency should be

owned by foreigners and the income it earns must subsequently be subtracted from domestic output in computing the growth in well being of nations citizens20 table 7 net national saving plus

consumption behavior since saving is the residual that results when consumption is subtracted from disposable personal income these theories apply to both variables see friedman milton theory of the consumption function princeton university press 1957 and modigliani franco life cycle individual thrift and the wealth of nations american economic review vol 76 3 june 1986 pp297313summary saving in the most simple terms is the difference between income and consumption but translating that standard into useful sta tistical measure can be complicated the most commonly cited measures of us saving are from the national income and product accounts nipa these data are behind much of the concern regarding several savi ng trends in the united states first the personal saving rate is at its lowest in decades this decline is the major reason for the continued low level of the national saving ra during the 1990s second although the gross business saving rate has not fallen significantly an increased share of it is accounted for by capital consumption so that net business saving has declined this decline was especially important during the 1970s and 1980s third public saving primarily as result of larg federal budget deficits was the important reason for the fall in the national saving rate durin g the 1970s and 1980s in the late 1990s however public saving increased substan tially helping to offset the continued decline in personal saving overall the nipa data indicate substantial decline in the us national saving rate over the past 30 years lthough the proximate cause of the decline varies over the period other official measures of saving those publishe d by the federal reserve board as well as those published by the organisation for econo mic cooperation and development oecd lead to similar conclusions the united states canada and the uk all experienced declines the oe cd data show that the united states saves significantly smaller share of output than most of the other g7 countries these official measures of sa ving however are not necessarily the final word the adjustments to saving rates found in the lipsey and kravis study are just one example of the adjustments that have been made to published estimates of saving rates in continuing effort to measur and understand saving behavior some of these adjustments improve the position of the united states relative to the average of other countries they also moderate the historical dec line in the us saving rate explaining the personal saving rate the discussion above pointed out the importance of personal or household saving in the level of net national saving and its decline over the past several decades understandably economists have attempted to ex plain this behavior21 an early effort identified personal sa ving as depending only on disposable personal income but this theory by itself could not explain the behavior over time ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs18 22 explanations of consumer saving behavior have to reconcile two seemingly contradictory observations at any given time crosssection data show that individuals with low incomes tend to have low rates of saving while those at the upper end of the distribution tend to have relatively high saving rates this would suggest that over time as incomes rise that overall saving rates would tend to rise as well but that has not been the case with occasional interruptions real incomes have over very long periods trended upward in the united states but the average saving rate has not 23 popular alternative is the socalled permanent income hypothesis developed by milton friedman it shares many features of the lif cycle approach the latter was formulated by franco modigliani in collaboration with rich ard brumberg and albert ando see references in footnote 21 24 very important assumption of this theory is that individuals in their early years can borrow against their future incomethe personal saving rate22 more sophisticated explana tions were required the life cycle hypothesis has become widely accep ted by economists as framework for explaining personal savings23 in order to identify those variables that affect personal saving it is necessary to explain briefly the life cycle theory this theory is based on the assumpti on that individuals over their expected lifetime seek to avoid sharp fluc tuations in their levels of consumption if that is the case then consumers who are just beginning to work and who expect to experience rising income over the course of their car eer would be able to put off saving or borrow against future income in order to consume large fraction of their current income this would also apply to individua ls who are near the end of their working life or are in retirement they would be expected to live off the accumulated wealth and consume more than their current inco those in their prime earning years would be expected to save at substantia lly higher rate than the other two groups these individuals would be th main savers in the economy thus over the course of an individuals lifetime periods of relatively high income are likely to be characterized by relatively high rates of saving periods of relatively low levels of income will likely by characterized by low or even negative eg borrowing saving rates the life cy cle hypothesis assumes that typically over an individuals lifetime income will exhibit humped pattern that is income will tend to be low early in life relatively high as career earnings rise through the pre retirement years and then drop off during retirement the expected pattern would then be for those at opposite ends of th age spectrum to have low saving rates relative to those in the middle24 available data indicate that saving rates do tend to vary with age as the life cycle hypothesis would suggest table 9 presents data from the consumer expenditure survey from 2001 showing saving rates by agehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs19 25 since the life cycle model assumes that cap ital markets are such that individuals can borrow against future expected income in dete rmining how much they wish to consume and save in the current period the real interest rate can play role in determining the saving rate the role is not clear cut however for discussion of this point see footnote 51 26 the role income growth plays in determining saving in the life cycle model can be confusing an increase in the growth rate of income all else constant ought to raise the saving rate since the increase in income will accrue to those who are working and are savers as opposed to those who are retired and are di ssavers on the other hand in the theoretical formulation of the life cycle model the curre nt consumption of indi viduals depends on the present value of current and expected future inco if future income is expected to rise due perhaps to an increase in the demand for labor the present value of current and expected future income will rise this would increase current consumption and reduce current saving thus the saving rate would fall the ultimate effect of variations in income growth depends on which of these two effects is the stronger 27 some have suggested other variables that might influence personal saving including the rate of inflation inflation might affect the saving rate in that it reduces the value of some assets expressed in dollar terms eg bonds to the extent that rising prices erode the real value of household net worth it might be expect ed to stimulate additional saving further high rates of inflation might raise saving because of increased uncertainty as to economic continuedtable 8 saving as percentage of aftertax income by age of consumer unit 2001 under 25 25 to 34 35 to 44 45 to 54

or gets younger that demographics can ffect aggregate saving behavior the 1970s 1980s and 1990s were time of such change produced by the aging of the large cohort of babyboomers thus demographics might reasonably be expected to have influenced the personal saving rate in those years the major variable however affecting saving in the life cycle model is expected income25 to translate expected income in to measurable concept the theory divides income into that part expected to accrue from wages and salaries income from labor and income from property to the extent that markets are efficient meaning that market prices reflect all available relevant information the inco expected to accrue from property should be reflected in the current market value of assets t hus the net worth of households would also be expected to explain personal saving26 in total the life cycle model suggests that household or pe rsonal saving depends on the age distribution of the population income from wages and salaries real interest rates and the net worth of households changes in these variables then should explain the observed changes in personal saving27httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs20 27 continued conditions further considerations that enter into the decision regarding how much to save within the lifecycle framework are life expectancy and retirement age the longer retirement is expected to be the greater ne st egg would be required another factor that is presumed to determine the level of saving is saving up for bigticket purchases such as car down payment on house or college education individuals may save more or less for rainy day depending upon their relative degree of risk aversion the desire to leave bequest has also been identified as consideration 28 bosworth barry gary burtless and john sabelhaus the decline in saving evidence from household surveys brookings papers on economic activity 1 the brookings institution 1991 pp 183241does the life cycle mode l explain recent trends number of studies suggest that the traditional formulation of the life cycle model does not explain the recent decline in the personal saving rate consider first the age distribution of the population th life cycle model implies that any change in the age distribution that significantly changes the relative proportion of savers and dissavers ought to have an effect on th saving rate according to the census bureau between 1980 and 2001 the share of households headed by someone 65 years or older who would likely be dissa vers increased by 01 percentage point over this same period the share of households in the 25 to 64 year old category increased by 20 percentage points within that group there was 44 percentage point increase in the share of households in the 35 to 44 age group the share of households in the 15 to 24 age category fell by 20 percentage points these figures suggest that recent changes in the age distribution probably had little effect on the saving rate and thus do not explain the decline both the working age and retirement age populations increase d relative to the overall population the 15 to 24 age group shrank but in 2001 they represented just 58 of the population so the effect of that decline would be modest in contrast to the age variable changes in household wealth do seem to have contributed to the decline in saving according to the life cycle model any unexpected increase in household net worth th at is perceived to be permanent ought to result in an increase in consumption and decline in saving study by bosworth burtless and sabelhaus ttempts to measure the influence of wealth on household saving28 for the purposes of their study hous eholds were divided into homeowners and nonhomeowners these groups were then further divided into those who owned financial assets and those who did not during the 1960s and 1970s there were substantial increases in values of both hous and financial asse ts this study found that saving fell by little less in those house holds with financial assets than it did in those with none contrary to the predictions of the life cycle model however saving rates fell

personal saving rate and its economic implications by brian cashellmore evidence that increases in housing pr ices help explain the decline in the personal saving rate wa s found by munnell and cook29 they suggest two reasons why the increase in housing prices would ve contributed to decline in saving first is the behavioral response predicted by the life cycle model in addition they argue that the nipa measure of the income and hence saving of homeowners is understated adjustments for these two fact ors yields reestimated saving rate that surged in the 1970s and subsequently returned to levels comparable to those of the 1950s and 1960s between 1990 and 1999 mean nominal household net worth increased by about 8530 major contributor to that rise was the large increase in the value of corporate equities equity prices rose by over 260 between 1990 and 1999 increases in household net worth seem likel to have contributed to the decline in personal saving during the 1990s 31 with respect to the other variables described by the life cycle model as determinants of the saving rate the evidence regarding their contribution to recent trends in the saving rate remains unclear changes in both income growth and interest rates play role in determining the saving rate but since they can affect the saving rate in offsetting ways their contribu tion to recent trends in saving is unclear this motivated some analysts to suggest other possible explanations for example inflation and changes in attitudes regarding the importance of thrift saving and economic growth many claims have been made about what can be accomplished by raising the national saving rate among these claims is that an increase in the rate of saving will produce higher rate of growth in economic output the discussion of the relationship between saving and economic growth or the growth rate of real output can become confused because it is carried on in two quite different contexts in one it is discussion about the shortr effect of change in the saving rate on aggregate demand and the actual output of the economy in other words it involves the relationship between the sa ving rate and the business cycle in the other context and the one relevant to this paper it involves discussion about the relationship of the saving rate and the longrun growth in the ability of the economy to produce goods and services or discussion about the saving rate and the growth rate of potential outputhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs22 32 for discussion of longrun grow th trends see crs report rl31428 productivity growth recent trends and future prospects by brian w cashell 33 some recent studies suggest that higher saving rate may have permanent effects on the growth rate of potential output this school of thought argues that the composition of the capital stock can influence the rate of economic growth known as ndoge nous growth theory this view argues that the pace of technological advance depends on the composition of investment evidence suggests that increas in some categories of investment may contribute to permanently higher rate of ec onomic growth an increase in investment in education for example may create an environm ent more fertile for technological advances see gould david m and roy j ruffin wh at determines economic growth federal reserve bank of dallas economic review second quarter 1993 pp 2540figure 6 the effect of an increase in saving on economic growthin the longrun context the basic question that arises is can the growth rate of potential output be raised by raising th saving rate the answer provided by prevailing economic theory is perhaps surprisingly no32 thus for reasons outlined below by saving higher fraction of its income nation may not increase the long run growth rate of potential output however higher saving rate will during transitory period raise the growth rate of potential output and over the longer run permanently raise the level of potential output33 since population growth is unaffected by the saving rate higher saving rate and the resulting higher level of potential output raises potential per capita income thus higher saving rate is directly linked via higher level of potential output to an increase in the standard of living this point is illustrated in figure 6 the growth rate of potentia l output depends on three factors growth in the labor force growth in the capital stock and grow th in technological progress in the standard growth model the only factor that can be altered by policy is the growth ratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs23 of the capital stock which depends on the sa ving rate and the rate at which capital depreciates the rates of growth of the labor force and technological progress are assumed to be given in orde r to simplify the subsequent discussion the growth rate of technological progress is assumed to be zero the key to understanding why higher sa ving rate will not permanently increase the growth rate of potential output is to understand the nature of the equilibrium or steady state that prevails prior to the change in the saving rate or the conditions that prevail in the economy while it is growing along the line up to point in figure 6 that theoretical state is characterized by equal rates of growth of the labor force the capital stock and output since all grow at the same rate the ratios of capital to labor and output to labor are constant even though both the numerator and the denominator in each ratio are growing any new steady state subsequent to change in the saving rate must have the same characteristics since the growth rate of the labor force is given and unaffected by policy the growth rates in the new steady state of the capital stock and output must conform to it thus the explanation for why higher saving rate does not permanently increase the growth rate of output comes down to explaining why the growth rate of output ultimately falls back to the growth rate of the labor force in the new steady state to begin in the prevailing steady state the amount saved out of given level of output is just sufficient to cover the depreciation of the existing capital stock and to provide enough new capital through ne w net investment to ensure that each additional worker in the growing labor fo rce has the same amount of capital to work with as those who are already in the labor force in other words new investment is sufficient to maintain constant capitallabor ratio suppose now that individuals decide to sa ve higher fraction of their income the absolute amount of current output that is saved rises and is now sufficient to enable new investment to increase both absolutely and relatively each worker now has more capital with which to wor k the additional productivity of the new additions to capital raise potential output since output is already growing at rate equal to the growth of the labor force the additional output raises its growth rate above that of the labor force as additional increments of new investment are made or as additions to the capital stock are made th marginal productivity of these additions declines remember we are assuming change in technology thus additional increments of capital per worker yield smaller and smaller increments of output this means that the additions to the rate at which output was growing are decreasing and that output growth after rising in the early stages of additional investment is falling back toward the growth rate that prevailed prior to the rise in the saving rate as the increments to output decrease so do the increments to saving as do the increments to new net investment ultimately the capitallabor ratio will stop rising and new steady state will be achieved in which the capitaltolabor ratio is higher the capitaltooutput ratio is higher than in the original steady state but in which the growth rate of the capitalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs24 34 for an overview of the arguments that the rate of economic growth may depend on variety of economic factors see gould da vid m and roy ruffin what

growth rate of output in the new stead state the absolute amount of income that is saved will be larger and the absolute amount of output devoted to new investment and depreciation will also be larger some studies suggest however that th rate of technological advance may depend on the composition of investment spending among those types of investments that have been found to be correlated with fast er rates of economic growth are education and business equipment34 for example number of recent st udies have found connection between investment in computers and other infor mation technology investments and the rate of productivity growth35 in similar vein another study identified the decline in public spending on infrastructure as re sponsible for some of the slowdown in productivity growth the us has experienced since the 1970s36 many of these studies however rely on statistical relati onships that are not grounded in any widely accepted theoretical framework if the growth rate of potential output is dependent on the composition of investment then it may be that the type of investment made possible by any increase in saving may be as critical as the tota l amount invested moreover the gains to economic growth available from redirecting current levels of investment may be comparable to those to be had from just increasing the level of saving and investment the internationalization of saving variety of policy proposals have been put forth for raising the national saving rate the end goal of which is to encour age higher rate of domestic investment suppose

abroad and the ease with which foreign saving comes to the united states in short one needs to know the degree to which national fina ncial markets are integrated american experience during the 1980s and 1990s suggests that foreign capital saving comes here with considerable ease yet there are substantial reasons to doubt that national capital markets are perfectly integrated there are number of reasons why savers may be unable or unwilling to seek the highest reward for their capital first unlike domestic investment foreign investment is beset with various special risks and uncertainties even the best informed individuals are unable to accurately forecast what may lie five to 10 years in the future foreign governments may impose controls on capital exports including the repatriation of earni ngs or may change how they tax foreign owned capital within their jurisdiction exchange rate changes may substantially reduce the expected profitability of this investment second countries often enact laws that inhibit the international flow of saving in the united states saving institutions are restrained in the type of mortgages they can hold as are insurance companies and other financial institutions these restraints discriminate against foreign mortgages in addition even wit hout constraints fina ncial intermediaries whose liabilities are denominated in national currency are unlikely to hold assets denominated in foreign currencies this will prevent these institutions who intermediate considerable portion of some countrys saving from buying foreign securities and sending that saving abroad finally considerable evidence exists that capital may flow from one country to another not necessarily to seek the highest rate of return but to implement market stra tegies exploit production knowledge or to overcome trade barriers37 38 given the evidence that capital does flow abroad but that barriers exist to prevent the complete integration of national capital markets question remains about the degree to which saving is internationalized this issue was addressed by feldstein and horioka in 1980 study upda ted in 1989 by feldst ein and bacchetta39httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs26 40 among the important results of the two studies using all 23 countries is that the percent of gross domestic saving used for domestic investment

are correlated number of different oecd country combinations were used in the correlations as were different time periods over the years 196086 the general conclusion from both studies is that substantial portion of domestic saving is used for domestic investment40 the limitation of both studies is that their conclusion applies to the group of countries studied as whole it may not apply well to the united states other economists have however attempted to isolate the extent to which changes in us saving would flow into us investment study by kim using the feldstein horioka methodology found that somewhere be tween onehalf and all of any increase in us saving would flow into domestic investment dependi ng on how investment was defined nordhaus also published some estimates based on largescale econometric model of the us economy he found that about onehalf of the increase in saving from budget deficit re duction would flow abroad summers found that some 35 percent of the increase in sa ving following deficit reduction would flow abroad this is similar in magnitude to what feldstein et found for the 1974 1986 period for all 23 oecd countries as group41 thus while evidence exists that there are substantial flows of capital from country to country it also suggests that national capital mark ets are not perfectly integrated in fact perhaps as much as tw othirds of incrementa l saving that could be induced by policies designed to incr ease national saving might be expected to remain at home to incr ease domestic investment42httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs27 43 the major piece of legislation making this possible was the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 another important contribution was made by the balanced budget act of 1997 44 the literature in

the economic effect of taxing continuedcan public policy raise the national saving rate there has long been consensus among economists that the national saving rate can be raised through public policy great deal of support can be found for the proposition that moving the federal budget from deficit to surplus would all else being equal increase the national saving ra during both the former bush and the clinton administrations legislation wa s enacted to reduce the federal budget deficit43 the shift in the federal budget from deficit to surplus was the major reason why the net national saving rate rose from low of 37 of gdp in 1992 to 59 in 2000 more controversial have b een policies to raise the personal or household saving rate these proposals have centered on individual retirement accounts or iras when these accounts were first introduced in 1982 they drew an impressive amount of funds it was not clear then nor is it today whether those funds resulted from new saving saving that would not otherwise have taken place or mainly from the transfer of dollars from other assets existing wea lth or saving that would have occurred anyway to these accounts whose effective yield was raised by their special tax treatment44 congress later applied various restrictions to iras which made them less attractive to some taxpayers the 105th congress reversed this trend with legislation that made existing iras more available to various taxpayers and created two additional iras45 controversy still surrounds the issue of whether these changes to the ira provisions will raise the personal saving rate and raise it enough to offset any associated decline in the public sector saving rate due to the revenue losses associated with the tax preferences that make iras attractive the objective of the legislation would remain unsatisfied if an irainduced rise in the personal saving rate cost so much in terms of lost tax revenue as to produce an offsetting rise in the federal budget deficit or declin in the federal budget surplus there are number of reasons why many economists believe that an ira approach is unlikely to raise the personal sa ving rate first and foremost economists using us data have with rare exception been unable to show that the us saving rate is at all sensitive to variations in interest rates46 second economic theory ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs28 46 continued capital income cambridge ma mit press 1994 47 the reason for the ambiguity is as follows the interest rate is the price that induces individuals to give up current consumption for larger future consumption if interest rates rise the price of current consumption rises as result individuals will be induced to give up current consumption and save portion of their income so as to enjoy larger future consumption this substitution effect is always positive and leads to higher personal saving rate on the other hand if individuals are target savers in the sense that they save to achieve given wealth objective higher interest rate enables them to achieve that objective with less saving out of current income hence from this perspective rise in interest rates leads to smaller saving rate the overall effect on personal saving depends on which of the two effects dominates 48 gravelle jane g do individual retirement accounts increase savings

private saving it could increase decrease or leave private saving unchanged47 third the fall off in the personal saving rate bega n during the period when ira contributions were fully deductible despite these reasons for bein g skeptical about the ability of iras to raise personal saving several studies found that the dollars that flowed into these accounts came from new saving and not from altering the allocation of existing wealth in careful review of these st udies gravelle cast substantial doubt on the methodologies used by the researchers nd hence on the validity of the results48 in general she concluded that the methodolog was better in two studies that failed to find any evidence that iras rais ed the personal saving rate49 the integration of the components of the private sector saving rate several routes of inquiry suggest that high degree of integration should exist since the household sector owns either directly or indir ectly the business sector to see how ownership might influence the integr ation of sectoral saving rates consider the following through depreciation allowances and undistributed profits businesses renew and add to existing capital assets re sources that would otherwise accrue mainly to the household sector as income these assets as they are renewed and expanded may also embody productivity enhancing improvements increasing the size and productivity of capital ssets should show up as rising profits and rising share prices of ownership claims this would in crease the net wealth of households50 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs29 51 this is most clearly seen when households save for specific purposes 52 similar but indirect route could also operate suppose that the rise in business saving enhanced share prices and this increased the ma rket value of the reserves of pension funds this would mean that smaller contributions would be required from households to fund any future defined benefits the smaller c ontributions would show up as reduction in household saving 53 the most recent study is by bosworth and s hows that for variety of countries including the united states the integration is virtua lly oneforone see bosworth barry p saving and investment in global economy brookings institution 1992 pp 7376 for other recent studies examining this issue see auer bach alan j and kevin hassett corporate saving and

activity the brookings institution washington dc 1987 pp 455503the rise in household net wealth tends to diminish the incentive of households to save51 52 thus the argument can be made that changes in the business saving rate are likely through wealth effect on hous eholds to bring about offsetting changes in their saving rate leaving the gross pr ivate sector saving rate largely unchanged over time the ultimate resolution of this issue is empirical overall while the evidence is mixed it suggests that the degree of in tegration of househol d and business sector saving may be high53 thus policies designed to increase net business saving may not result in comparable increase in total private or national saving since any change in business saving may be larg ely offset by the saving behavior of households the integration of the public and private sector saving rates efforts to reduce the federal budge t deficit more recent if controversial proposition is that the net fiscal position of the public sector is completely offset by the saving behavior of the private sector according to this view the fiscal deficits of the federal government during the past decade should have had effect on the national savi ng rate in essence this view argues that the private and public sector saving rates are completely integrated the intellectual inspiration for this view was attributed to one of the founders of modern economics the english econo mist david ricardo 17721823 the view that the public and private sector saving rates are completely integrated is referred to as ricardian equivalence the essence of ricardian equivalence is simple suppose for sake of argument that government proposes onetime increas in expenditures and that to cover this increase it proposes either onetime tax on the current generation or to borrow from them by issuing bonds the issue is should this generation of taxpayers behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs30 54 the two methods of finance are mathematically equivalent when the bond option is selected taxes will have to be raised to pay the debt service on the bonds that are issued to pay for the additional expenditures while this increase in taxes is on an annual basis less than the one time increase that would be needed to pay for the additional expenditures the present discounted value of these taxes is the equal to the one time tax 55 one of the ironies of this debate is the suggestion that ricardo regarded the two methods of finance as identical he did not thus in very important sense the term ricardian equivalence is inappropriately used 56 in terms of footnote 55 the two methods are ma thematically equivalent only if the present discounted value of the extra taxes for debt service are calculated over an infinite time horizon in ricardos view the typical taxpayer would only disc ount them over hisher expected lifetime which would yield presen t discounted value that was less than the amount of taxes that would have to be paid immediately should that option be selected to finance the increased expenditures 57 see his are government bonds net wealth journal of political ec onomy novdec 1974 pp 10951117 58 there is an old adage that says that only death and taxes are inevitable in the barro world since individuals in essence live forever only taxes are inevitableindifferent between the two methods of fi nance ie should they regard the two as equivalent54 ricardo reasoned that they would regard th two as equivalent only if the current taxpayers lived forever since they do not they would prefer to finance these additional expenditures by selling bonds55 by choosing the bond option some of the taxes that would have to be paid to pr ovide for the debt service can be shifted forward to future generation of taxpayers56 in 1974 professor robert barro in what is claimed to have become the most frequently referenced paper ever written by an economis t revived this ricardian discussion57 barro proposed that if existing taxpayers regarded the wellbeing of their children on par with their own wellbein g and their childrens children etc behaved similarly the existing taxpayers would in effect achieve an infinite life and behave accordingly thus they would not prefer the bond finance option but would be indifferent between the two58 the basic question posed by ricardo can be put in slightly different way which makes its relevance to the fe deral budget deficit and its re lation to the national saving rate clearer suppose government considers tax cut to stimulate the economy what will individuals do with the increase in th eir disposable income conventional macroeconomic theory implies that large fraction would be spent and serve to stimulate the economy the end result w ould be larger fe deral deficit some increase in private saving but fall in na tional saving this would not happen in barro world the recipients of the tax cut in that world would realize that their taxes would have to rise in the future to cover debt service and they would accordinglyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs31 59 the controversy over the barro proposal and the literature it has given rise to is extensive it is effectively surveyed in symposium consisting of papers by yellen gramlich barro bernheim and eisner in the journal of economic perspectives vol 3 2 spring 1989 pp 1794 60 work by bosworth for the united states over the period 1965 1990 suggests that for each dollar change in the fiscal position of the government gross private sector saving changes in the opposite direction by 19 cents see bosworth barry p saving and investment in global economy the brookings institution washington d c 1993 p74save the entire amount of their increased disposable income in order to pay those future taxes not only would there be shortterm fiscal expansion from the tax cut but the entire increase in public sector dissaving would be offset by rise in private sector saving in the barro worl d the saving rates of the two sectors are perfectly integrated and the national saving rate remains unaffected by changes in the fiscal position of the public sector the issue raised by barro is empirical do individuals behave as his theory implies for the united states the evidence accumulated during the 1980s and 1990s strongly suggests that they do not59 thus most economis ts believe federal efforts to reduce public sector budget deficit or increase surplus should raise the national saving rate th relationship however is unlikely to be oneforone60 conclusions it is curiosity of the economic literature investigating saving that in general the theory regarding saving and its conse quences appears to be more widely accepted than is any particular measure of saving that having been said all of the measures of saving available from official sources ll more or less the same story the us national saving rate fell significantly during the 1980s and 1990s personal saving is the lowest it has been for decades lthough the gross business saving rate has been fairly stable larger share of business saving is being allocated to replace capital that is wearing out leaving smaller share available to augment the capital stock the federal government saving rate fell substantially beginning in the late 1970s it recovered in the late 1990s but has since fallen the combined effect of these events has been large decline in gross national saving and an even larger decline in net national saving the oecd data show that the united states canada and uk rates have all fallen the united states also appears to be much less frugal than most of the other major industrial economies these official measures not being the final word on the subject are sometimes adjusted in various ways so that the estimates more closely reflect the theoretical notion of saving for example when li psey and kravis added government capital outlays spending on education research and development and consumer durable goods to official measures of saving the united states appeared to be much less of spendthrift relative to othe r countries just as modifi cations to official saving estimates can change the level of us saving others may shift saving from one sector to another without affecting the to tal for example some of the interest payment on the federal debt represents pr emium for the effect of inflation and this premium is more appr opriately counted as repayment of principal and as such shouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs32 be counted as federal govern ment saving but to the extent that this adjustment raises estimated public saving private sa ving will be reduced see appendix b aside from how the particular estimates are made there is an important distinction between gross and net saving rates many co mparisons especially those between countries are made using gross sa ving rates but often the reason for concern about the decline in the saving rate is its effect on the growth of the stock of productive capital in that context the more relevant meas ure is net saving estimates of net saving however depend on how depreciation is calculated while depreciation accounts for very large shar of gross national saving the way in which it is computed is subject of some controversy most of net national saving is accounted for by personal saving and standard economic theory seeks to explain personal saving behavior the dominant approach uses the life cycle model although the life cycle model is widely accepted it falls short of yielding convincing explanati on for the recent decline in the personal saving rate an amended life cycle model incorporating the effects of social security and government provided hea lth benefits provides bette r but by means generally accepted explanation for the decline one can not rule out that some of the decline could just as well be attributed to change in attitudes about thrift raising the national saving rate has become priority among policymakers two routes have been used to achieve this goal one is the elimination of the federal budget deficit this approach to raising the national saving ra is supported by wide spectrum of economists the second approach has been to attemp t to raise the household saving rate by giving preferential tax treatment to sp ecific form of household saving the ira the success of this approach is unclear and it does not share the same widespread support among economists given the substantial defi cit reduction that has occu rred and perhaps major change in attitudes about thrift what effect would higher nationa l saving rate have some of the increase would likely contribute to larger domestic capital stock higher capitallabor ratio and increased output and productivity some of the increase would tend to flow abroad or reduce us dependence on foreign capital but even to the extent that it does us households would still be better off in the future because of the increase in income from those foreign investments an increase in the saving rate would ve real consequences for the longrun performance of the economy but these conse quences might not seem striking in the short run first any increase in the incr ements to capital thr ough new net investment would be very small in comparison to the total stock of capital second the labor force is expected to grow more slowly now that the babyboom generation has come of age and the laborforce par ticipation rate of women has leveled off the expected slower growth in the labor force means smaller saving rate will be sufficient to sustain trend growth in the capitallabor ratio thus the fall in the net national saving rate may not be as tr oubling as would have been d growth in the labor force not fallenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs33 figure a1 gross national savingappendix an alternative measure of the us saving rate from the flow of funds different ways exist to measure the us

in table a1 is virtual constant sources department of commerce bureau of economic analysis board of governors of the federal reserve system the comparisons in figure a1 and in table a1 raise basic

household sector according to the fof the household saving rate is nearly three times larger than that given by the nipa to understand why it is necessary to explain briefly how the household saving rate is constructed in the fof recall that in the nipa it is the residual that arises when personal consumption is subtracted from personal disposable income when househol ds save it should show up as an increase in househol d net worth to compute household net worth the fof constr ucts balance sheet for the household sector the gross increase in net worth is then equal to the sum of the net acquisitionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs35 61 to compute the net saving rate of the household sector involves the additional step of subtracting out the depreciation or ca pital consumption of household assets 62 conceptually the fof treats government life insurance and pension funds on par with similar transactions involving private comp anies where the nipa makes distinction between the two ie it does not treat them the same 63 note that this differential treatment in the nipa has effect on the gross national saving rate it does however have an effect on the sectoral saving rates when government insurance and pension funds for example bu ild up reserves the nipa method lowers the household saving rate and raises the public sector saving rate relative to the rates computed in the fof this difference helps to expl ain why the federal government and state and local government saving rates computed in table a2 under nipa differ from similar computations in the fofof financial assets and the net investment in tangible assets less the net increase in liabilities issued by the household sector to finance the purchase of assets61 in the fof framework the household acquis ition of all tangible assets is used to measure saving this involves in addition to housing the acquisition of all consumer durable goods recall that in the nipa spending by consumers on all durable goods with the exception of housing is treated as consumption in arriving at the household saving rate since spe nding by households on nonhousing consumer durables is large including it as an elem ent of investment by households on par with housing dramatically increases the savi ng rate of households this is major reason for the higher fof gross saving rate another but secondary reason for the difference is that the fof treats contributions to and payments from gove rnment life insurance and retirement funds as changes to household net worth whereas th nipa treat them as items that affect the current income of households62 this difference in treatment is only important when the life insurance and pension funds ar either building or depleting reserves63httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs36 appendix b the saving rate and the long run rate of growth to understand why an increase in the savi ng rate will not lead to permanent increase in the rate of growth of potentia l output we begin with what is called production function production function expre sses relationship between physical inputs and output it is common to express the relationship in general form as 1 f k n where measures output or income the state of technical knowledge and k an n inputs of capital and labor respectively since interest centers on the growth rate of or ªyy equation 1 can be broken down into the contribution each factor makes to output growth or 2 yy b n n b k ka 1 which says that the growth rate of output depends on the growth rate of the labor force ªnn the growth rate of the capital stock ªkk and changes in the state of technology the coefficients b and 1 b measure the respective contribution of capital and labor to output they are usually measured by the income share that accrue to each and their values sum to one to simplify the discussion it will be assumed that there is technical progress in the economy that ªaa 0 thus in the economy under discussion the growth rate of output depends onl on capital and labor more over further reasonable assumption will be that the growth rate of the labor force is given the next task is to describe th is economy in its socalled steady state or equilibrium such state is one in which while the labor force the capital stock and output are all growing the ratios of capital to labor and output to labor or per capita income are constant this means that the growth rate of the capital stock the growth rate of the labor force and the growth ra of output are all equal under these conditions the new additions to the labor force are supplied with the same amount of capital as those currently in the labor force and who are working and who as result will add the same amount to output notice that in this steady state the factor to which all others must conform is the growth rate of the labor force this grow th rate is assumed to be given since it remains given throughout this exercise in the new steady state it will govern the growth rate of the capital stock and the grow th rate of output as it does not change the rate of growth of output in the new steady state must be the same as in the prevailing steady statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs37 the only conditions remaining to be specified in the existing steady state are the equilibrium levels of per capita output and the capital to labor ratio these depend on the condition that saving is equal to investment or 3 si recalling from the body of the text th at gross saving s is equal to net new investment in plus the depreciation of the existing capital stock d or 4 iind and that d is equal to the depreciation rate d times the capital stock k and that new net investment in is equal to the change in the capital stock ªk or 5 idk k which after substitution in equation 3 yields 6 sdk k further since saving is equal to the saving rate s times income equation 6 becomes 7 sy dk k if both sides of equation 7 are divided by k the result is 8 sykd kk and since the rate of new investment ªkk is in the steady state equal to the growth rate of the labor force ªnn n the result is 9 sykdn when both sides of equation 9 are multiplied by k the result is 10 sy d n k which says that in the steady state the ab solute amount of output that is saved sy is just sufficient to replace the capital stoc k that is worn out in producing output dk plus what is needed to equip the new dditions to the labor force with the same amount of capital as is available to t hose presently in the labor force nk to put the above on per capita basi s both sides of the equation are divided by n resulting in 11 sy n d n k n the steady state is described graphically in figure b1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs38 yn dn knyn knsynfigure b1 saving in the steady state the schedule yn is one in which output increases rapidly at first and then at diminishing rate as the capitallabor ratio increases this means that as more capital is added to labor the ma rginal product of capital falls the saving schedule syn lies inside the yn schedule since the value of the average saving rate s is less than one since this constant is multiplied by yn the slope of the saving schedule mirrors that of yn the investment schedule d nkn is straight line from the origin whose slope depends on the values of d and n the equality of saving and investment determines the equilibrium levels of output per capita and of capitaltolabor it will pay to recall that in equilibrium while yn and kn are constant at values yn0 and ky0 both the labor force and capita l stock are growing at rate n as is output how is this steady state equilibrium affected by an increase in the saving rate in figure b2 the schedule syn will shift up to syn and the new equilibrium point where saving equals investment rises from point to point b along the investment schedule d nkn the investment schedule does not shift since neither the depreciation rate d nor the rate of new inves tment n needed to maintain the capitallabor ratio constant have changedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs39 b afigure b2 effect on the steady state of an increase in the saving rate the net result in the new steady state is larger capitallabor ratio and larger output per capita but change in the equilibrium rate of growth of output this is still equal to the growth rate of the labor force were it not so and for example greater than the growth rate of the bor force output per capita would not be constant at level yn0 but would be rising and the economy would not be in steady state there is however the transition period during which the capitallabor ratio is rising as is the growth rate of output that needs to be explained when the saving rate rises from s to s the amount of saving at the then equilibrium level of income yn0 is now greater than needed for depreciation and net new investment that maintains the capitallabor ratio at kn0 the additional new investment that takes place increases per capita output and the economy moves along the schedule yn the increase in output that occurs is in addition to that already accruing in the growing ec onomy as result the growth rate of output rises however as additional units of capital are added to the labor force the marginal product of capital falls ie while output increases it does so at diminishing rate this has several implications first it means that smaller and smaller increments of output are added to the ongoing flow of output as result the growth rate of output falls over time as the economy moves toward the new steady stat second as output growth falls over time less and less saving is available for new net investment and the growth rate of the capitallabor ratio while still rising does so at diminishing rate ultimately in the new steady state the output saved will be equal to the outputhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs40 that is needed to replace the depreci ated capital and to provide enough new equipment so that additions to the labor force have the same amount of capital as do those that are currently in the labor force at which point the capitallabor ratio is again constant again for simplicity all of this assumes c oncurrent growth in technology in the new steady state while the per capita income and the capitallabor ratio will be higher the growth rate of the labor force the capital stock and per capita income will be the same as in the previous steady state the absolute amount saved and used for depreciation and net new investment will be larger howeverhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30873crs41 references aitig david and katherine samolyk increasing national saving are iras the answer federal reserve bank of cleveland economic commentary
