the reemployment of workers who through fault of their own are let go by their employers among these laws is the worker adjustment and retraining notification warn act pl 100379 enacted in 1988 it requires advance notice of mass layoffs and plant closings congressional interest in the warn act has renewe d in the current decade due in part to growth in offshore outsourcing and perceived shortcomings of the statute s 1792 hr 3662 and hr 3796 would amend the worker adjustment and retraining notification act to require more businesses to provide notice to more workers lengthen the notice period to 90 days increase the back pay penalty for violation of the law and expand those to whom notice must be given eg secretary of labor and us senators and representatives on october 31 2007 the house passed hr 3920 which reauthorizes the trade adjustment assistance programs for workers and firms and amends the warn act changes made by hr 3920 to the worker adjustment and retraining notification act are similar in several respects to those made by hr 3796 such as authorizing the secretary of labor to investigate and attempt to resolve complaints of violations of the act and counting parttime employees defined by the act to include persons employed less than six months toward the employer size threshold the warn act now requires employers to provide written notice to displaced workers or their representatives state dislocated worker units or entities designated by the state to carry out rapid response activities and the chief elected official of unit of local government at least 60 days before plant closing or mass layoff is expected to occur shorter notice may be provided in three instances number of other exceptions to and exemptions from the notification requirement exist relatively small businesses and small temporary layoffs are not subject to the warn act firms with 100 or more employees excluding parttime employees generally must provide advance notice if mass layoff is expected to exceed six months mass layoff is an employment loss at job site within any 30day period affecting 50499 employees excluding parttimers if they make up at least onethird of an employers workforce excluding parttimers or b at least 500 employees excluding parttime employees plant closing is shutdown of work site that produces job losses for at least 50 employees ther than parttimers within any 30day period parttime employees are entitled to notice employees their representatives or units of local government can bring civil actions against employers thought to have violated the act dol does not have any investigative or enforcement authority the maximum liability of employers is back pay and benefits for each day that notice was not provided although the amount of the penalty may be reduced this report will be updated as legislative activity occurs

of the pieces of legislation that congress has passed to facilitate the reemployment of workers who through fault of their own lose their jobs other statutes include the workforce investment act which provides variety of reem ployment services to dislocated workers eg training and the trade adjustment assistance program for workers which provides reemployment services among other assistance to subset of job losers ie those harmed by trade1 although retraining appears in its title the wa rn act does not authorize training it instead requires employers that intend to carry out plant closings or largescale longlasting layoffs to provide advance notice to enable affected workers to more quickly find new jobs

level in 1973 to require advance notice of plant closings and mass layoffs 2 the issue proved to be contentious and more than decade elapsed before congress enacted the warn act pl 100379 in 1988 without president reagans signature3 the law became effective in february 1989 it generated fairly little interest during period marked by brief mild recession at the outset of the 1990s and then by the longest economic expansion in the nations history 120 months interest has renewed in the warn act during the current decade for variety of reasons the frequency and size of layoffs increased markedly during the latest marchnovember 2001 recession and after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 4 few years later policymakers grappling with the issue of offshore outsourcing or offshoring of us jobs to other countries introduced legislation to amend the statute5 s 2090 which was introduced in 2004 would have included under the law employer actions that had the effect of creating shifting or transferring positions or facilities outside the united states and in so doing cause job loss for at least 15 employees during any 30day period in addition the bill would have lengthened the notification period and lowered the firmsize threshold for mass layoffs it also would have required the secretary of labor to issue statistical reports based on the written notices of plant closings mass layoffs and offshoring that covered employers would have had to provide the secretary under current law employers do not provide notices to the federal government 1 for information

the 110th congress s 1792 hr 3662 and hr 3796 have several common features intended to address perceived shortcomings of the law which has not been substantively amended since its inception some 20 years ago6 the bills would revise the law to require more firms to provide notice to more workers terminated masse eg by lowering the size threshold for employer coverage under the act to 50 employees excluding parttimers in the case of s 1792 and hr 3662 retaining the firmsize threshold of 100 employees but including parttimers in the case of hr 3796 covering plant closings of at least 25 employees excl uding parttimers under s 1792 and hr 3662 and of at least 25 employees including parttimers in the case of hr 3796 the bills also would lengthen the notice period to 90 days before the event increase the back pay penalty for violation of the statute and authorize the secretary of labor to bring civil action on behalf of workers while s 1792 would require employers to notify the secretary of labor after covered event had occurred hr 3662 and hr 3796 would require notice be given in advance of covered plant closing or mass layoff to the secretary of labor and to us senators and representatives in the areas in which plants are located hr 3662 would require advance notice be provided to appropriate state senators representatives and governors as well on october 18 2007 the house committee on education and labor marked up and ordered to be reported hr 3796 amended on october 31 2007 the house passed hr 3920 which reauthorizes the trade adjustment assistance taa programs for workers and firms and amends the warn act changes made by hr 3920 to the advance notice statute are similar in many respects to those made by hr 3796 eg provide 90day advance notice increase back pay penalty authorize the secretary of labor to investigate and attempt to resolve complaints of violations of the act count parttime employees defined by the act to include persons employed less than six months toward the employer size threshold and have employers notif the secretary of labor who in turn notifies the appropriate members of congress differences between s 3796 and the taa bills amendment of the warn act include hr 3920 defining covered plant closings and mass layoffs as employment losses of at least 50 empl oyees prohibiting the rights and remedies under the warn act including the right to bring civil action from being waived or lost pursuant to an agreement or settlement reached outside th act and exempting employers from the advance notice requirement if the closing or layoff is directly or indirectly due to terrorist attack on the united states g21g158g150g150g138g155g162g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g25g3g20g16g561g3g140g157g561 the key provisions of

generally the warn act requires employers to provide written notice to affected workers or their representatives at least 60 days before plant closing or mass layoff is expected to occur workers affected by mass layoff would include those who might be bumped from their jobs by more senior workers whose positions had been eliminated state dislocated worker units or entities designated by the state to carry out rapid response activities must be forewarned as well so they may provide assistance under the workforce investment act for example the chief elected offi cial of unit of local government also must receive notice 60 days before plant closing or mass layoff is initiated see the box three reasons for notice period of less than 60 days for the three instances in which the advance notice period can be of shorter duration the warn act does not supersede collective bargaining agreements or other laws whose terms concerning advance notice or related employee rights are superior to those of the statute eg the provision of severance payments if state plant closing law requires employers to provide more than 60 days advance notice the federal laws notice period runs concurrently with the states requirement pl 100379s advance notice period is intended to afford employees time to find other jobs obtain retraining or otherwise adjust to their soontobechanged employment situation as opposed to the termination of few employees large numbers of workers released into local labor market at approximately the same time would produce keen competition for job vacancies the jobseeking efforts of displaced workers could be particularly difficult if they are released from declining industry in which nearby firms producing similar goods or services can offer few employment opportunities similarly geographic area with shrinking or stagnant job base could have much more trouble absorbing many workers laid off at once as opposed to few employees let go from time to time thr ee reasons f or notice p eriod of less than 60 da ys the faltering company exception employers can provide reduced n otice for plant closings but not fo r mass layoffs if they had been seeking fina ncing r bu siness for their faltering ente rprises thoug ht t hey had realistic chance of obtaining fu nds or new b usiness s ufficient to allow the facilities to remain open nd believed in good faith that giving notice would have pre vented t he m from getting t he ca pital or busi ness necessar to continue their operations the unforeseeable business circums tances exception mployers ca n p rovide reduced notice if they co u ld not reasonably foresee the bu siness circ umsta nc that provoked the plant closings or mass layoffs dire circumsta nces t hat occur red without warning nd that were utside the em ployers control could include 1 major client ter minating large contract with t he em ployer 2 strike at pplier of key part s t the employer or 3 t he swift nset of deep economic downturn or nonnat ural disaster eg terrorist attack the natura l disaster exception the occurre nce of floods earthq uak droughts storms and similar effects of natur fulfill this

any units are shut downat single site within any 30day period for 50499 employees excluding parttimers if they make up at least 33 of an employers active workforce excluding parttimers8 or at least 500 employees excluding parttimers pl 100379 thus does not cover small layoffs an employer may have to provide advance notice if multiple groups of workers are laid off over time but each group is smaller during any 30day period than the employeesize thresholds if taken together the number of terminated workers exceeds one of the thresholds during any 90day period the action is considered plant closing or mass layoff unless the employer proves that the employment losses are due to separate and distinct actions and causes and are not an attempt by the employer to evade the requirements of the act in order for the abovedescribed plant closings or mass layoffs to trigger the advance notice requirement the employment loss must involve termination other than discharge for cause voluntary departure or retirement layoff exceeding six months or more than 50 reduction in the work hours excluding overtime hours of individual employees during each month of any sixmonth period if an employer calls layoff that is not expected to meet the statutes sixmonth threshold for providing advance notice and the employer subsequently extends the layoff beyond six months an employment loss will have occurred unless the extension was due to business circumstances not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the initial layoff the employer must give employees advance notice when it becomes foreseeable that an extension of shortterm layoff is necessary as in the case of multiple layoffs of small groups of employees this provision is intended to prevent employers from evading the acts notice requirement by prolonging layoff that initially was too brief to meet the laws definition of employment loss

eg the cost of medical expenses that would have been covered had the employment loss not occurred to each aggrieved employee the penalty is calculated for each working day that notice was not provided up to maximum of 60 days in other words the 60day liability is reduced for each day that notice was provided maximum liability may be less than 60 days for those employees who had worked for the employer less than 120 days if any employer made voluntary and unconditional payments to terminated employees for failure to provide timely notice the amount of the penalty may be reduced10 court also may decrease the backpay liability if an employers fa ilure to comply with the act was in good faith with reasonable grounds for believing that its closure or layoff action did not violate the law in addition court may reduce the 500 day civil fine to which unit of local government is entitled for an employers violation of the statute an employer can avoid the civil penalty entirely if each aggrieved employee is paid the full amount owed within three weeks from the date of the plant closing or mass layoff 10 in contrast severance payments that the employer was legally obligated to make because of the employment loss do not diminish the employers liability similarly payments made by third parties to terminated employees eg unemployment insurance benefits do not limit the size of the employers penalty httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31250g22g145g142g561g25g152g155g148g142g155g561g3g141g147g158g156g157g150g142g151g157g561g138g151g141g561g20
