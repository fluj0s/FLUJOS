have combined population of about 8 million of whom about 54 million are estonian s latvians and lithuanians many of the rest are russian speakers largely ethnic russians but also some ukrainians belarusians and other ethnic groups wh ile their countries are often referred to collectively as the baltic states these three peoples differ ethnically linguistically and in their religious traditions from each other for much of their history they have been dominated by other countries russian dominance in the baltic region was first established in the early 18th century tsar peter the great had defeated sweden in the great northern war seeking military economic and political w indow to western europe he annexed to russia what is now estonia and eastern latvia in 1721 the rest of latvia and almost all of currentday lithuania were seized when the polishlithuanian commonwealth was partitioned by russia prussia and austria in the late 18th century the new rulers did not radically change the social structure of the baltic states german barons descended from the teutonic knights of the middle ages continued to rule over the native serfs in estonia and latvia while poles and polonized lithuanian nobility exercised similar control over the lithuanian peasantry in the late 19th century growing national awareness among the baltic peoples clashed with russification policie s pursued by reactionary russian tsars the baltic countries became independent as result of the collapse of the tsarist empire in 1917 during world war i in 1918 all three baltic states declared their independence but had to fight germ ans bolsheviks and poles in the case of lithuania at various times to preserve their freedom in 1920 bolshevik russia signed peace treaties with each of the three baltic states recognizing their independence the new states were at first parliamentary democracies but each had authoritarian regimes by the mid1930s the baltic states retained their inde pendence until 1940 secret protocol to the nazisoviet nonaggression pact of 1939 ssigned all three baltic states to the soviet sphere in june 1940 soviet troops entered all three states prosoviet governments were installed soviet control was interr upted by german occupation at the end of world war ii the soviets regained control and resumed brutal repression sovietization nd russification of the native population thousands of estonians latvians and lithuanians were executed impris oned or deported to siberia moscow collectivized agricultu re expropriated indus trial and commercial enterprises and integrated the baltic econo mies into the centralized soviet systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96584crs2 the native baltic populations were severely reduced by casualties during world war ii by emigration and by massive portations that accompanied sovietization in addition the three small states had to absorb large inmigration of nonbaltic people mostly russians from the soviet union in 1989 onl about 52 of the population of latvia consisted of latvians compared to 77 in 1939 in estonia the percentage of ethnic estonians was bout 60 in 1989 compared to 92 in 1939 lithuania maintained its ethni c population share at about 80 beginning in 1985 soviet president gorbachevs support for glasnost gave the balts opportunities to reexamin and debate their recent pa st including their incor poration into the soviet union in addition perestroika allowed grassroots econom ic political and cultural activities to occur that resulted in massive resurgence of national consciousness among the baltic peoples burgeoning environmental movement spurred by glasnost and severe environmenta l problems caused in large measure by soviet industrial policy indu ced activists to address larger political issues at the end of 1988 popular front or ganizations arose in all three baltic re publics this development was accompanie d by the proliferation of political groups and parties including indepe ndencenow parties envir onmentalist green parties as well as the rebirth of many parties such as the social democrats which existed during the independence period in ddition largely russian intermovement groups also arose opposing changes in the baltic area in 1990 baltic parliaments with noncommunist majorities were elected in relatively open and free elections on march 11 1990 the l ithuanian parliament declared the restoration of the lithuanian republic independent of the soviet union on march 30 1990 the estonian parliament d eclared soviet law invalid in estonia and declared period of transition from sovi et control to independence the latvian parliament declared transition period to independence on may 4 1990 after the attempted august 1991 coup against gorb achev estonia declared its full and immediate independence from the soviet union on august 20 1991 and latvia did the same on august 21 1 991 on august 24 russian president boris yeltsin recognized the independence of estoni and latvia having acknowledged the independence of lithuania earlier on september 6 1991 the s oviet state council with president gorbachev presiding recogniz ed the independence of estonia latvia and lithuania current political and economic situation since achieving independence the baltic states have established parliamentary democracies and free market economies the political scene has sometimes been unsettled democracy in the baltic states has seen proliferation of relatively small parties none large enough to form gove rnment on its own politics are not based on sharp differences in ideology there has been broad consensus among almost all of political elites on the goals of democracy the rule of law free market reform and membership in nato and the european uni on instead political conflicts are based largely on personal differences between part leaders or the support of parties for competing business interests or on ruralurban split or between those who have benefitted most from reforms and those who have not parties in the baltic stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96584crs3 estonia at glance population 135 million 2004 estonian

officials note that of those applying for naturalization more than 95 pass the language test s and meet all other requirements for citizenship some observers say that part of the reluctance of many

restoration of their independence has been integration into euroatlantic organizations including membership in the european union eu and nato the baltic states achieved these goals when they joined nato in march 2004 and the european union in may 2004 they continue to work to restruct ure their econo mies and societies to bring them closer to eu norms needed changes include improving public administration in order to make use of the large amount s of eu aid the countries will receive fighting corruption particularly serious problem in latvia and lithuania and preparing to join the european monetary union in 2007 or 2008 the baltic states also continue to improve their armed forces and enhance their interoperability with nato to this end they have pledged to continue reforms that they began before being admitted into nato including pledge to spend at least 2 of their gdp on defense they have also deployed platoon or companysized forces to us and natoled missions in the balkans afghanistan and iraq significant commitment given their modest populations and military manpower the baltic states have established str ong political and economic links with the nordic countries links between finland and estonia whose majority peoples are ethnically related are especially close the baltic states have also increased cooperation among themselves in security economic and political matters through the baltic council the baltic assembly nd other intergovernmental organizations relations with russia russianbaltic relations have been strained by the issue of russianspeaking minorities in estonia and latvia and by the baltic states efforts to join nato although the foreign trade of the baltic stat has been radically reoriented toward the west and away from russia over the past decade russia retains important influence in the energy and transport sectors moreover many people in the baltic states are concerned about the influen ce of russian intelligence agencies and organized crime in their countries the impeachment of president rolandas paksashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs96584crs9 in lithuania in 2004 for close ties with russian organized crime boss is particularly dramatic illustration of this problem the russian government has denounced tr eatment of russians in estonia and latvia at the osce and other intern ational organizations estonia and latvia reject the russian assertions and asked in ternational organizations to offer opinions on their laws and to investigate russias charges of human rights violations osce representatives have said that estonia nd latvia do not violate the human rights of their russianspeaking minorities however both countries have changed laws that osce experts believed were not in line with european standards russian officials have said these efforts are insufficient despite concerns raised by russia and local russian speakers emigration of russian speakers from latvia and estonia since baltic independence has been moderate observers believe that despite their grievances most russian speakers prefer to remain in the relatively stable and increasingly prosperous baltic states than to move to russia russia has not signed border treaties with latvia and estonia russia has initialed border treaties with both countries but has linked the signing of the accords to its grievances on the status of russian speakers in estonia and latvia russia and lithuania signed border treaty in october 1997 russia expressed strong opposition to nat membership for the baltic states claiming that having nato country on their borders would weaken russias security they noted that russias kaliningrad region would be surrounded by nato states if lithuania were to join the alliance baltic membership in nato has not led to drastic deterioration in relations between moscow and the baltic states however russian officials continue to express concerns and issue warnings about the deployment of foreign forces from nato countries on baltic soil baltic observers believe russias objections are based on an assumption that as former soviet republics the baltic states belong in russian sphere of interests russias economic role in the baltic states has declined over the past decade but is still significant in some sectors ru ssia has maintained double tariffs on estonian goods since 1992 in retaliation for alleged human rights violations against the russianspeaking population in estonia this policy has had the side effect of sharply redirecting estonias trade toward western countries and away from russia russia will eventually have to drop the trade restrictions against estonia now that estonia is an eu member however russia retains an important role in certain sectors of estonias econom estonian ports are heavily dependent on russian transit trade unlike russian ports in th region estonias ports are icefree year round estonias port facilitie s bring in as much as 14 of the countrys gdp russia similarly accounts for decreasing fraction of latvias imports and exports as trade with other eu countries increases however as in the case of estonia latvian ports are heavily dependent on russian transit trade ventspils in particular is key port for russias oil exports the ports of the baltic states compete with each other as well as possi ble new port facilities developed in russia

importance of competing russian oil terminal at primorsk which it owns in similar move the russian firm lukoil which is closely connected with the russian government cut off oil shipments to the mazeikiai refinery after lithuania sold controlling share in the firm to us firm williams international as result the refinery remained unprofitable in 2002 williams sold its shares in the refinery to the russian oil firm yukos competitor to lukoil that offered to supply the refinery with oil in 2004 yukos came under attack from the russian govern ment allegedly for tax evasion observers believe the move could be an effort by russian president vladimir putin and his cr onies to gain greater control over yukoss assets and the russian oil sector as whol development that some believe could have negative consequences for mazeikiai and lithuania us policy the united states recognized the indepe ndent states of estonia latvia and lithuania on july 28 1922 and never recogniz ed the legality of their incorporation into the soviet union the us govern ment continued to accredit the representa tives of the former independent governments when the baltic states started to push for independence from moscow in 1990 and 1991 the bush administration encouraged baltic independence efforts but stopped short of taking stands that might provoke strongly negative response fro m moscow the administration did however begin some direct involvement with the current baltic governments such as the shipment of medical supplies to all three baltic states in early 1991 after the failed soviet
