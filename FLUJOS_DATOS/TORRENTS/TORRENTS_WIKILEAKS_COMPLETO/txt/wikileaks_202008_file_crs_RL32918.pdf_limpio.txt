congressional pproval of the agreement establishing the wto the house ways and means committee reported the resolution adversely on may 26 2005 and the full house disapproved the re solution by vote of 33886 on june 9 2005 debate on the resolution offered members an opportunity to examine the costs and benefits of wto partic ipation and examine other aspects of wto membership second the 109th congress will monitor wto disputes involving us interests and possibly consider whether or not to amend us laws to address wto dispute panel findings members have criticized the wto dispute process for several reasons but the process does offer stable multilateral forum for trade disputes third the united states and other wto members are actively engaged in multilateral round of tr ade negotiations in the wto the 109th congress is monitoring those negotiations final agr eements are not expected until 2006 or later in report submitted to congress on ma rch 2 2005 on the costs and benefits of continued participation in the wto the administration cited number of statistics that show growth in the us and world economies since establishment of the wto whether the growth cited was the result exclusively or mainly of activity in the wto is arguable academic studies indicate that the united states would gain substantially from broad reductions in trade barriers worldwide at the same time some workers and industries might not share in those gains questions of governance and power are among the issues at the heart of the debate on the wto major decisions in the wto are made by member governments who determine their negotiatin g positions file dispute challenges and implement their decisions however some challenge the claim that the wto is democratic in nature by arguing that sma ller countries are left out of the decision making and that governments tend to represent large commercial interests only the united states has been frequent participant in wto dispute proceedings both as complainant and as respondent there have been many complaints of the wto dispute process including the argu ments that countries do not adhere to decisions and that us trade remedy laws have not been judged properly on the other hand this multilateral trade dispute fo rum is unique and the united states has been successful in many of its challenges other issues include 1 the relations hip between wto rules and countrys right to establish domestic standards for labor the environment food safety and other areas and 2 us policy toward veloping countries including balance

debate on us participation in the wto to put the issue in perspective the report begins with brief history of the wto including its purpose and functions followed by an examination of the economic benefits and costs of the wt the main body of the report addresses selected issues for the ited states the economic costs and benefits to the united states decisionmaking in th wto and national sovereignty the wto dispute process arguments on whether or not to include labor environmental and food safety standards in the wto and th wto and developing countries it ends with brief discussion of alternatives to participation in the wto brief background on the wto following world war ii nations throug hout the world led by the united states and several other devel oped countries sought to establish an open and nondiscriminatory trading system with the goal of raising th economic wellbeing of all countries aware of the role of trade barriers in contributing to the economic depression in the 1930s the countries that met to discuss the new trading system considered open trade as essen tial for economic stability and peace the intent of these negotiators was to establish an international trade organization which would address not only tr ade barriers but othe r issues indirectly related to trade including employment investment restrictive business practices and commodity agreements unable to secure approval of such comprehensive agreement however they reached provisional agreement on tariffs and trade rules called the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt the gatt went into effect in 1948 this provisional gatt becam the principal set of rules governing international trade for the next 47 years the world trade organization wto succeeded the gatt in 19954 it was established as result of the uruguay round of multilateral tr ade negotiations that were held under gatt auspices the wto encompassed the former gatt agreements with newly negotiated reforms new trade issues such as services and traderelated intellectual property st ronger dispute resolution procedure mechanism to review members trade policies regularly and other duties in contrast to the gatt the wto was created as permanent structure the wto has three broad functions fi rst the governments of the member countries agree on set of multilateral rule s and principles for trade which provide stable and predictable basis for trade the economic effects of agreedon rules and principles are difficult to quantify precisely but are likely substantial and attractive to countries since membership in th gattwto has grown from 23 countries in 1948 to 148 countries at present with bout 30 more c ountries waitin g to joinhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32918crs3 5 see also crs report rs20088 dispute settlement in the world trade organization an overview by jeanne j grimmett wto principles of non discrimination the mostfavored nation mfn also called normal trade relations ntr principle requires each member country to grant each other member country treatment at least as favorable as it grants to its mostfavored trade partner the national treatment principle obligates each country not to discriminate between domestic and foreign products once an imported product has entered country the product must be treated less favorably than like product produced domestically also world trade over the past half centu ry by growing more rapidly than world production has served as an engine of economic growth for many countries the second function of the wto is to provide mechanism to enforce the rules the dispute settlement procedure provides way in which disagreements among countries over the interpretation of the rules can be resolved broadly country with complaint requests consultation and if the dispute is not resolved during the consultation the complaining country may request establishment of pane l after the panel issues its decision both disputing parties have the right to appeal after the conclusion of all such proceedings the dispute settlement body representatives of all the wto members adopts the report or reports unless it decides by consensus to reject them5 third the wto provides forum for ne gotiations to reduce trade barriers countries meet periodically in rounds to consider changes in rules on trade barriers in the first five rounds late 1940s to early 1960s negotiations focused on reducing tariffs which are now low as tariffs were reduce d countries sometimes turned to nontariff barrier s for example subsidies government procurement regulations antidumping procedures to rest rict imports negotiations since the mid 1960s have covered nontariff ba rriers as well today negotiations might extend to measures that involve what once were exclusively domes tic policy issues such as health safety or environmen tal standards some wto rules have been agreed on to prevent countries from using such sta ndards as disguised protectionism although each country retains the righ t to set its own standards decisions within the wto are made by member countries not by wto staff and they are made by consensus not by formal vote the highest level body in the wto is the ministerial conference whic h is the body of political representatives trade ministers from each member country the body that oversees the daytoday operations of the wto is the general counc il which consists of representative from each member country many ot her councils and committees deal with particular issues and memb ers of these bodies are also national representativeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32918crs4 6 world trade organization international trade statistics 20012004 economic costs and benefits of the wto one question that congress may consider as it debates continued participation in the wto is its effect on the economy and prosperity of the united states in one sense this is difficult question to answer as the prosperity of the 10 years of wto existence occurred along with the inform ation technology boom in the united states in the 1990s the rise of china as an ec onomic power and macr oeconomic and other factors us involvement in the wto di d not happen in vacuum much of the increased trade may have occurred anyhow or in the case of our two largest partners canada and mexico may have occurred as consequence in part of the implementation of the north american free trade agreement nafta which was approved by congress in 1993 more than because of the wto many economists believe that over the past 50 years the more predictable environment for trade as well as the reduction in trade barriers which were result of multilateral trade rules have contributed to unpr ecedented economic prosperity for the majority of countries for exampl the wto reports that world exports in 2003 were 126 times those in 1948 while wo rld gross domestic product gdp in 2003 was 7 times that of world gdp in 19506 looked at another way the average annual rate of growth in the volume of wo rld exports was higher than growth in gdp during the period such rapid growth in world exports has been attributed to the progressive reduction of trade ba rriers caused by successive rounds of gattwto trade liberalization and may have contributed to the growth in world gdp in the report that the president s ubmitted to congress on march 2 2005 on the costs and benefits of us participation in the wto the administration has equated us economic success with wto membersh ip through variety of trade and non trade statistics for example the re port notes that during the 19942004 period the wto was established in 1995 us gdp rose 38 industrial production rose 35 productivity rose at an nnual rate of 29 compare d with 18 in the 19841994 period business investment rose 78 compared with 38 increase in the 10 years before the wto was established r eal compensation doubled to 18 per year and 172 million new jobs were created the presidents report also cites trade statistics for example bound tariff rate s were lowered an average of 40 for developed countries and 25 for developing countries by the uruguay round us exports of goods and services increased 63 from 19942004 from 703 billion to 11 trillion us exports increased 76 to developing countries and 48 to developed countries imports of goods and services increased 120 from 801 billion to 1764 trillion during the wto period these statistics are used to bolster the case for continued us participation in the wto however saying that this economic activity occurred during the existence of the wto is different than saying it happened because of the wto aside from the time period correlation the report does not conduct rigor ous analysis on the value of us participation because the wto s rules and principles for trade trade liberalization and dispute settle ment procedures are all designed to encourage tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32918crs5 7 for

in play in the past decade such the information and communications technology revolution pr oductivity advances in the united states decreasing shipping costs and other developments nonetheless economists argue that increased trade will have net positive effect on economies specialization from trade strengthens the most competitive and productive sectors of nations economy by reallocating resources from less efficient economic activities increased trade benefits consumers by offering greater selection of goods often at lower prices which in turn would increase the real income of consumers trade liberalization increases the rate of economic growth through such dynamic effects as th introduction of new products access to specialized goods skills transf ers and human capital accumulation7 recently pair of econometri c studies have attempted to measure the effect of the wto on the world economy in both st udies gravity model an econometric model in which different phenomena such as gdp populati on distance common language or membership in trade arrangements are isolated to attempt to determine the importance of each to trade flows was used to attempt to isolate the effect of wto membership on the trade flows of various countries both members and non members the first study8 using some 50 years of trad statistics from 175 countries found that the existence of the gattwto by itself did not have significant positive effect on trade flows however second study9 by two economists of the international monetary fund using much the same data suggests that if the aforementioned gravity model is designed to differentiate be tween developed and developing countries then the effects of the gattwto membership on world trade flows can be positively identified at leas t for developed countries the authors postulate that this result is due to developing countries largely being given free ride due to special and differential treatment provisi ons that has exempted them from gattwto obligations these studies show that the potential exists for wto liberalization to have beneficial effect on trade but the differen ces in their findings show that this issue has not been settled studies also abound on the value of pr ospective wto liberalization to the united states and the world economy r ecently the institute for international economics iie

services liber alization 135 billion would receive some net welfare benefit from ma nufacturing tariff liberaliza tion 365 billion but would actually suffer net welfare loss of 723 b illion from the agricultural liberalization envisioned by the model12 there is consensus that in general consumers gain from trade in the form of lower prices and increased choice the presidents report states the number of wagehours required to buy various consum er goods has decreased during the period of wto and postulates that is due to trade openness promoted by the wto13 workers in export sectors also gain to the extent that the wto opens foreign markets to trade employees engaged in export sectors are generally more highly skilled than those of importcompeting sectors nd are generally more highly paid14 however some labor particularly unskilled labor likely has lost out from free trade the income gap between high and low skilled labor and between labor and other factors of production nd capital is consistent with international trade theory this theory suggests that in terms of f actors of production nd labor capital trade between two countries will result in the rela tively scarce

more productive manner eventually can be long time coming for workers who have lost their livelihood decisionmaking in the wto and national sovereignty an important question related to the wto is who are the decisionmakers in the organization there are many different cla ims about who sets the rules second question is once the decisionmakers within the wto have agreed on rules what do the rules mean with regard to national sovereignty of wto members decisionmaking questions of governance and power are ofte n at the heart of the debate over the wto some critics of th wto portray the wto as an undemocratic elitist organization operating in nontransparen t fashion mostly for the benefit of multinational corporations from rich countries by contrast some supporters say that the wto is body of nations that set thei r own domestic trade policies and represent the interests of all their citizens in their decisions the wto itself consists of highlytra ined support staff economists lawyers and other public policy professionals that assist the member states in their activities this relatively small international or ganization had 601 employees in 2004 and budget of 1618 mil lion its secretaria t provides administrative and technical support to the wtos councils committees wo rking parties and negotiating groups provides technical support to developing countries undert akes trade policy analysis of individual member countri provides legal assistance in the resolution of trade disputes and assists in accession negotiations for potential new members the wto describes itself as memberdriven orga nization major decisions at the wto are made by representa tives of the 148 member governments16 member states proffer negotiating positions build alliances with other nations file dispute settlement cases and implement their verdicts rulemaking power is not delegated to board of directors or an executive board in the wto but is exercised by the member countries as whole while major economies have had greater powerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32918crs8 17 wto members may adopt an interpretation of any wto agreement by threequarters vote but this option has never been usedwithin the wto than smaller economies for many years blocs of developing countries have become much more influen tial at wto meetings some experts argue that country representatives have not re solved all questions about rules through negotiation they point to some questions being resolved through the dispute process where wto rules are being inte rpreted not by member countries but by appointed panelists critics who may acknowledge the limited nature of th wtos power contend the wto is overly influenced by commercial concerns of member states and by the organization to the exclusion of other impor tant issues this argument reflects in part the power of national level interests such as co rporations to shape country negotiating positions but this influence is effected primarily at the national level through domestic institutions multinational corporations ve direct participation in wto decisionmaking nd cannot file dispute settle ment actions on their own consensus decisions are usually reached through consensus among all of the wto member countries17 consensus has been the hallmark of wto decisionmaking since the founding of the gatt in 1947 it was much easier to reach consensus when the gatt was an organization of developed countries or when the developingcountry members were quiescent the increased membership of developing countries in the organizati on and the larger role developing countries are playing in wto affairs have provoked some to question the continued viability of the consensus approach to wto decisionmaking these changes also have implications for the united states which in earlier years did not have to compromise with large blocs of developing countries consensus decisionmaking has been ttacked as undermining the progress of trade liberalization trade liberalization it is claimed is doomed to proceed at snails pace if each country matter how economically small can veto any trade deal some critics characterize this as undemo cratic and threatening to the will of the majority some argue this results in th lengthy duration of trade negotiations and in dilution of benefits derived therefrom however alternatives to consensus are also problematic voting at the wto authorized for certain limited procedural circumstances could be expanded the choice of voting instruments onecountry onevote voting power based on trade flows or voting power based on popula tion would each have adherents or detractors and would favor some countries or country blocs to the detriment of others for this reason any move to voting at the wto would prompt serious resistance from countries that stand to lose from such change currently the united states has considerable influence on wto decisions because of its economic size but if voting system were used in the wto depending on the type of voting system it is unclear what level of influence the united states would maintain aside from voting another method of dealing with the shortcomings of consensus is through the use of carte agreements such as the plurilateralhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32918crs9 18 the sutherland report p 63 19 ibid p 58agreement on government procurement wh ich would allow countries to opt in or out of certain agreements or even to cer tain conditions within adopted agreements this would allow willing member states to undertake commitments on reciprocal basis within areas in which universal commitments are unlikely at least in the near term it would allow for more ambitious trade liberalization in certain areas among likemindedcountries member states could judge whether they were able or willing to take on commitments and c ould join later if appropria this method has been used primarily in terms of sectoral liber alization more extensive use of sectoral liberalization including in the nonagricu ltural market access nama negotiations is favored by the united states this method arguably would undercut th process of the single undertaking which is now part of the current doha round the single undertaking posits that negotiations for the round are only finished when all the agreements are completed the rationale for the single undertaking serv to reinforce the consensus principle all agreements must have universal support the single undertaking acts to prevent the concerns of some members from being ignored in the rush to agreement on other issues it also is way to encourage countri to participate in the talks since there should be something for everyone in the final deal the primary justification for consensus approach is that it provides legitimacy to wto decisions and it reinforces nationa l sovereignty tedious though achieving consensus is such an agreement is more likely to be implemented or at least less openly flaunted if it is agreed by all members recent report on the wto observed it must remain for sovereign governments to d ecide at every point their national interests and to demand that those interests are reflected in everything the wto decides18 as long as the wto remains an organization of sovereign governments the tension between unwieldy decisionmaking and more legitimacy is likely to continue transparency in the wto part of the critique of the wto is that it is an opaque organization that operate s substantially behind closed doors meetings of the general council and of the negotiating groups are not open to the public dispute settlement proceedings are likewise closed and supporting briefs are not automatically available to the public but can be released at the discretion of the authoring government members who are not party to dispute may not attend dispute panel or appellate body proceedings according to the sutherland report this confidentiality is seen as damaging to the wto as an institution and it recommends that dispute settlement proceedin gs be opened to the public as matter of course19 however many of the most egre gious examples of wto secrecy have been addressed over the years most s ubmissions or interventions in negotiations have been available immediately online since 2002 and summaries of meeting are available sometime afte r while some groups have soug ht total transparency in all phases of wto operations other commentators consider measure of secrecy necessary in sensitive negotiationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32918crs10

established the wto in 1994 authorizes cooperation and consultation between the ge neral council of the wto and nongovernmental organizations ngos the nature and extent of that role have remained unsettled during the life of the wto some argue for greater role for ngos as way of increasing the transparen cy of the organization or providing voice within the wto for noncommercial c oncerns

varying attributes of transparency and accountability the interests of the ngos are especially important to consider in light of their activities assisting deve loping countries to formulate negotiating positions sovereignty increasingly critics charge that international bureaucrats at the wto can override laws enacted in the united states the broad scope of wto obligations coupled with strong dispute settlement procedures contained in the wto dispute settlement understanding have led some to argue th at the wto has undue influence on domestic laws and regulati ons as well as on the pro cess of lawmaking itself20 as member of the wto the united states does commit to act in accordance with the rules of the multilateral body ar ticle xvi4 of the agreement establishing the world

these obligations in order to obtain assurance that other governments will not restrict trade in certain ways and in return commit themselves to abide by th same rules count ries participate in trade

losing the dispute was unlikely to accept the finding dispute decisions often did not result in an end to the challenged practice in the uruguay round the united states was principal proponent for

thereb giving permission for the complainant to retaliate procedures ar clearly set out with speci fic timetables at each stage so far under the wto dispute settlement procedure the united states has had more success as complainant than as respondent23 according to ustr lists of disputes involving the united states as of march 21 2005 the united states had filed 74 complaints including compliance proceedings and 48 of those had been concluded those 48 were resolved thus 22 resolved to us satisfaction without completing litigation 22 us won on core issues and 4 us did not prevail on core issues the ustr lists indicate that the united states has won overwhelmingly in the cases that it has brought to the wto24 the united states has not fared as well however when other countries challenged us practices the ustr re ports that as of march 21 2005 the united states was responding party in 103 complaints and compliance proceedings of those 49 have been concluded almost the same number of cases as those with the united states as complainant those 49 cases were resolved thus 14 resolved without completing litigation uncertain whet her or not to us satisfaction 10 us won on core issues and 25 us di d not prevail on core issues according to the ustr lists the united states did not prevail on at least half of the cases where another country brought the case the question of whether or not the ited states should withdraw from the wto raises another question of how the united states would do without the wto dispute mechanism the united states is party to number of freetrade agreements that include dispute procedures where violation of those agreements is alleged the united states or other party to the agreement could turn to those procedures such instances however might be limited for practices not covered by those agreements which would include actions by most countries of the world there would be comparable rules or forum absent the wto countries can always try to settle trade dispute thr ough negotiations as can happen under section 301 of the trade act of 1974 even though there is underlying trade agreement involved trade disputes would have to settled by other means there have been complaints that countri have not adhered to dispute panels findings an example is the us complaint against european union eu trade restrictions on imports of beef produced with hormones the united states was granted permission by the dsb to impose retaliatory tariffs on imports from the eu in spite of higher tariffs on its products the eu has not withdrawn the challenged

transparency and to ensure that it does not act outside its aut hority under the wto agreements to limit trade remedy lawssubsidy offset act commonly known as the byrd amendment which returns antidumping duties to domestic industry wto panel gave permission to the eu and seven other wto members to retaliate and the united states has not changed its law the wto does not have the powe r to force country to change its law these results show that countries may choos not to abide by decisions in the wto the wto as an institution however is only as strong as its members adherence to its rules other complaints center around challeng to us trade remedy laws25 in the last few years the united states has lost number of these cases including cases involving steel safeguards the us antidumping act of 1916 and the byrd amendment in response members of congress and others have questioned the expertise underlying certain wto dispute decisions whether the panels are making rules through their decisions and thus by passing negotiations nd whether the panels are extending appropriate ference to domestic laws26 in the 108th congress senator baucus introdu ced bill s 676 to establish wto dispute settlement review commission to review all reports of dispute settlement panels or the appellate body of the world trade organization wto in proceedings initiated by othe r parties to the wto that are adverse to the united states and that are adopted by the dis pute settlement body in such cases the commission would determine whether the wt panel or appella body deviated from the applicable standard of review including in anti dumping countervailing duty and other unfair trade remedy cases it can be noted that in general the united states tends not to challeng traderemedy laws of othe r countries in the wto but rather challenges productspecific foreign ba rriers such as barriers to dairy products or other nontariff barriers although there are many complaints about the wto dispute process especially after major wto dispute decision against the united states some members of congress look to the wto dispute process as an important way to challenge the trade practices of other nations in number of instances members have protested the actions of foreign country and proposed th at if the situation cannot be resolved then the united states should file dispute in the wto in these instances members have viewed wto dispute resolution as legitimate and possibly effective way to cause the countries to change their actions case in point is the

us participation in the wto an issue that often arises is whether us laws and regulations establish certain standards that increase costs for usbased businesses and whether foreign based companies then have an advantage because they do not have to meet the same standards related to this is the question of whether or not such standards should be part of the wto rules another question is whether or not the wto should infl uence how countries set their domestic standards these questions have been rais ed specifically in discussions on standards for labor the environment and health and food safety critics of current wto trade rules argue that the rules should also include minimum levels and enforcement of labor standards and possibly trade sanctions to enforce the rules they contend th at low or weak foreign labor standards effectively lower costs abroad and that internationallyenforced rules are needed to level the playing field they also state that low standards abroad might lead to declining standards in the united states if producers and govern ments in order to maintain competitiveness become less committed to established labor standards others maintain that the issue is more complicated for example child labor is closely related to poverty they argue nd economic policies to raise family incomes might be more effective than requiring hi gher labor standards further others contend that there is evidence that labor standards in the united states have been lowered by foreign standards some argue that rather than dealing with labor standards in the wto better course of action might be to strengthen the intern ational labor organization especially in the area of enforcement of agreedon rules in 1996 wto members recognized the ilo as the competent body to set and deal with those standards28 others contend that the ilo is not taken seriously because it has enforcementmechanism and that the only way to ensure effective policy on labor rights is to place it in negotiations along with tariffs services and intellectual property rights for their part most developi ng countries are deadset ag ainst including labor rights in the wto considering them an invita

cte are to study the relationship between trade and environmental measur and to make recommendations as to whether modifications of the wto are required environmentalists however have been disappointed that the cte has not ma more progress they are concerned that the goals of multilateral environmental treaties or domestic regulations might be undone by the dispute process of the wto they also are concerned that lower environmental standards abroad might cont ribute to lower standards in the united states supporters of the wto argue th at multilateral envi ronmental agreement has ever been challenged in the wto they contend that in the relatively few cases where environmental measures have been at issue wto dispute panels have ruled on narrow aspects of these laws or regulations they also argue that environmental protection in the united states has not been compromised in the case of food safety some wto critic s have argued that the standards set by us food safety laws are bein g jeopardized by wto panel rulings29 some claim that wto panelists are able to or have overturned us and other countries food safety laws or other critics argue wto panels are superceding judgments by the public in regard to their sired level of food safety wto supporte rs maintain food safety laws are not being ove rturned but that countries have agreed in the wto to administer such laws in nondiscriminator way at issue is usually the wto agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary standards sps which established criteria that countries must meet in order to s how that law is not disguised trade restriction broadly the cr iteria are that sanitary and phytosanitary standards should be based on science risk assessment or relevant inte rnational standards the precautionary principle is notable point of disagreement the principle says that where longterm health effects are uncer tain or unknown country should have the right to ban product veral environmental groups have argued that the sps agreement should be amended to specifically incorporate the precautionary principle while others argue that such principle would be used as trade barrier and that only science should dictate30 wto and developing countries the role of the wto in fostering velopment among the lesser developed nations of the world may play part in th is debate this is because the doha round known officially as the doha development agenda has put issues of development front and center on its agenda the concer ns of developing nations at wto have affected us policy

policymakers recognize that trade has role to play in alleviating poverty and increasing growth in the developing world problems of causality have made it difficult to delineate the contribution of international trade or the impact of wto membership on developing country poverty reduction or growth31 however one estimate has been that global free trade more than that contemplated by the wto doha round would increase the income of developing countries by 90 billion annually in sta tic terms and by up to 200 billion after dynamic gain s were considered over time32 these figures if realized

reaffirmed their commitment to sdt in the ongoing doha round some proponents of free trade argue that the sdt treatment has impeded the progress of developing countries they sa that the refusal of some developing countries to lower import tariffs has left many countries with an inefficient protected economic base that is unable to compete with the outside and is using resources potentially better deployed elsewhere in the domestic economy by exempting them from wto obligations they have also exempted them from the benefits of the multilateral trading syst em according to this view
