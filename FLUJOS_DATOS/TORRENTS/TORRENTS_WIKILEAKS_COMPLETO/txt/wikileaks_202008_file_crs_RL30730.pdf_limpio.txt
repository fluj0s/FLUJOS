divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30730russian fighter aircraft industrial base parallels with the united states summary there are many differences between the fighter aircraft industry in the united states and in russia the united states has traditionally produced its weaponry within capitalist framework which allowed free enterprise and competition between companies in private industry the former soviet unions economy and its fighter aircraft industry was based on marxist command economy where the central government dictated the type and number of aircraft produced and allocated resources for construction once among the most glamorous components of the soviet military industrial complex the russian military aircraft industry has been described by some analysts as being on the verge of collapse russias civilian aircraft industry has faced similar pressures which does not bode well for the military aviation infrastructure it may be difficult for fighter aircraft companies to find employment in russias beleaguered civil aircraft sector the russian government has attempted to reform its fighter aircraft industrial base and make it more efficient and competitive with western industry it has initiated several reforms aimed at reducing the stratification and compartmenta lization of industrial processes as well as improving access to financial resources these reforms have had mixed success while russias military aviation infrastructure has consolidated dramatically the overall effectiveness of these reform efforts still remains to be seen russias remaining fighter aircraft design and manufacturing enterprises sukhoi and mikoyan appear to be struggling to stay alive both companies have sought to make up for decreased domestic demand by increasing their export of fighter aircraft and by winning contracts in the civilian aviation sector success in both areas has been limited and many analysts doubt that russia can support more than one fighter aircraft company for much longer the potential for merger between the two companies has been discussed for some time each company has its own strengths and weaknesses and it is unclear which would survive merger as russia reforms its fighter aircraft industrial base there appear to be many parallels between their experience and what is happening in the united states in terms of declining domestic demand and pressure for consolidation by examining the events in russias military aviation industrial base especially the experience of the sukhoi and mikoyan aircraft design bureaus policy makers in the united

market pressures as other parts of the us economy and therefore perhaps not as dissimilar to the soviet model as many have portrayed for instance the washington post reported in speech earlier this year to navy admirals he secretary of the navy richard danzig elaborated on his notion that the pentagon is the last genuine communist system complete with fiveyear plans and command economy run not by market pressures but by directives from the top it didnt work for the soviet union and i think that it doesnt work very well for the navy he said ricks thomas churning the waters washington post september 9 20001russian fighter aircraft industrial base parallels with the united states introduction there are many differences between the fighter aircraft industry in the united states and in russia the united states has traditionally produced its weaponry within capitalist framework which allowed free enterprise and competition between companies in private industry the former soviet unions economy and its fighter aircraft industry was based on marxist command econom where the central government dictated the type and number of aircraft produced1 yet as russia emerges from the soviet union and westernizes there appears to be many parallels between russias fighter aircraft industrial base and what is happening in the united states these potential parallels include decreased domestic demand for fighter aircraft and increased competition between companies forced to adapt to these changing circumstances companies in both russia and the united states have tried to increase the efficiency of their industrial processes and more aggressively pursue export markets also the military industrial base in both countries has experienced dramatic consolidation as weaker companies are acquired by stronger companies it may be that by examining the russian experience policy makers in the united states may gain insight into current and forthcoming fighter aircraft industrial base issues sample of these questions include how many aircraft manufacturers are needed to support military needs to what extent should the survivability of these firms be taken into account in deciding which aircraft programs to pursue httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30730crs2 2for more comprehensive discussion of russias military and industrial base see russian conventional armed forces on the verge of

tactical aircraft programs affect export earnings and international competitiveness of the aerospace industry russias economic backdrop once among the most glamorous components of the soviet military industrial complex the russian military aircraft industry has been described by some analysts as being on the verge of collapse2 domestic orders for russian military aircraft have fallen off due to

oxford university press 1999 russias civilian aircraft industry is facing similar pressures since the early 1990s russia has experienced strong downturn in domestic commercial air traffic in the past decade passenger traffic in russia has fallen approximately 774 of the roughly 320 regional airlines in russia today 50 of them perform 98 of the work of these 50 companies only the 20 largest offer regular passenger service5 this dwindling air traffic has resulted in reduced revenue profits and resources for recapitalizing russias aging airliner fleet the larger airlines are trying to win passengers by increasing the level of service establishing partnerships with western airlines and acquiring new planes ilyushin and tupolev are the two main established manufacturers of civilian aircraft and produce the il96 and tu204 ilyushin and tupolev currently have firm orders from domestic and internati onal clients for 25 il96s and 30 tu204s respectively yet few deliveries have been made6 while there is some domestic demand for civilian aircraft financial constraints make it difficult for the airlines to purchase or lease new planes russian civilian aircraft producers are

industrial complex conflict studies research centre march 1998their aircraft7 russian civil aircraft manufacturers have had less success than military aircraft manufacturers in making up for lack of domestic demand through export this is often due to the fact that russian products do not meet western standards currently russian aircraft represent less than one percent of the global market for commercial airliners the status of russias civil aviation sector does not bode well for the military aviation infrastructure if the civil aviation sector were healthy it could potentially offer safe haven for under employed military companies however because the civilian industrial base is struggling with its own transformation any movement by sukhoi or mikoyan into the civil sector will only cause additional problems for ilyushin and tupolev8 russias fighter aircraft infrastructure the complexity of the russian aviation industry is sometimes hard for western observers to understand9 traditionally the russian aerospace industrial base inherited from the soviet union has been set up in different manner than the european or american practice unlike the western system the sovietrussian military industrial complex was highly stratified and organized into distinct components rd design and prototyping direct manufacture and some indirect subcontracting factories supplying the main factories all these units were much larger than their western counterparts in practice this system could build large numbers of aircraft but it proved to be extremely wasteful and inefficient10 by the 1970s the soviet ministry of defense realized that the compartmentalization and stratification of the rd production process had serious drawbacks particularly the separation of experimental design bureaus and production facilities to obviate these shortcomings the soviet government created in 1968 researchproduction associations npos nauchnoproizvodstvennoe obedinenie which have grown increasingly influential over time the npo system is patterned on western corporations npos usually consist of an experimental design bureau okb and one or more production facilities npos such as sukhoi avp and rsk mig manage weapon systems developme nt from the engineering development stage through production and system modernization httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30730crs5 11kennaway prof

first authorized in 1968 by 1975 there were only 97 npos in the entire soviet union the biggest jump came in the late 1980s by which time over 500 npos had been formed the npo organization is still less common in the aircraft industry than other fields such as missiles or space russian aerospace industry organization aviation week space technology january 11 1999311 14covault craig yeltsin to

manufacturing the soviets also hoped this reorganization would help achieve number of goals including 1 concentrating lead factories with subsidiaries to emulate the western practice of widespread sub contracting 2 improving npos access to financing and presumably to financial management skills through financialproduction combines 3 designating lead priority areas which would supposedly receive preferential financing and privileges and 4 facilitating the design and manufacture of civilian products11 one constant throughout this period of transition has been the role of tsagi the central aerohydrodynamic research institute which is located near moscow although its size goals and methods have evolved its role to guide the entire russian aircraft industry has remained the same since 191812 reform trials and tribulations the transformation of the sovietrussian aerospace industry has been underway since the 1970s the sovietera reforms were largely ineffective but have received greater attention in the 1990s however the process has been uneven and not altogether successful13 in 1993 tsagi and four other major aerospace research centers the zhukovsky flight research center lii the central institute of aviation motors tsiam the all union institute of aviation materials and the central aviation systems institute failed to win support from boris yeltsin to consolidate aeronautics research facilities factories and design bureaus on regional basis this plan was to have integrated the russian aerospace industry using common business structure14 it was reported that this plan was doomed from the start because it was underfunded and each organization was forced to try to survive in its own way15 following the 1993 industry consolidation failure tsagi underwent painful downsizing and an especially difficult period in the late 1990s from high of about 14000 personnel in the mid1980s tsagi was forced to cut nearly three quarters of its workforce to its current level of 5500 employees facilities were also closedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30730crs6 16covault craig tsagis comeback aviation week space technology may 15 200050 17stark numbers drive russian plan to

us embassy moscow january 1998 although tsagi has nearly 60 wind tunnels and other test facilities about half have been mothballed16 in 1997 the russian government made another attempt at streamlining the aircraft industry at that time the russian military and civilian aviation industry consisted of 335 enterprises 133 of which were devoted to the development and testing of new aircraft systems and components while 131 were engaged in serial production the ministry of economy planned two phase consolidation the first phase was to integrate aircraft developers and producers into few major corporations supported by second tier of subsystem producers multipurpose associations would be created in the second phase which would include design bureaus test facilities and production facilities17 also part of the plan presidential decree 880 of july 14 1997 designated certain scientific organizations and enterprises russian federation state scientific centers that would receive support from the government all other enterprises and research organizations were forced to show profit or convert to nonaviation products18 the progress and success of the 1997 plan is difficult to assess four of the five statesponsored scientific centers for instance appear to be beyond tsagis control and the potential for significant redundancy and inefficiencies in the russian system still exist also the various restructuring plans often seem to merely move components of the industry around without any real reduction in their size or change in their relationships for instance the 1997 presidential decree also converted sukhoi avpk into single true joint stock company yet the various factories under the sukhoi avpk umbrella operate more or less independently the respective plants generate their own income from their own exports and developme nt contracts predictably each wants to retain its own profits as well as control over its business development sukhoi avpk leadership however views centralized control as necessary to pursue coordinated research development and sales mandatory attributes for prosperity in market economy rsk mig has had similar difficulties breaking down traditional stratification and compartmentalization of their design and manufacturing processes despite these challenges some progress has been made in transforming russias military aviation structures tsagi has been placed under the russian space agency now called the russian aviation and space agency rasa which has helped prioritize russian aeronautics research projects and resources and reinvigorated the faltering industry consolidation however one constant in this process has been lack of capitalization in 1998 it was reported that despite an upturn in the

aviation industry suggests that it and the us military aviation industry share similar pressures and experiences these parallels include increased pressure to secure foreign customers and continuing industry consolidation as the domestic demand for russian military aircraft has declined sukhoi and mig have increasingly depended on exports to keep production lines open supplement funding for other

from domestic civil aviation production companies tupolev and ilyushin as well as international companies for the civilian market the ability of russian fighter aircraft companies to compete with commercial companies for market share is unclear while russian aircraft may be cheaper to produce western aircraft generally have lower operating costs and better maintenance and repair services31 on

second element was to continue aggressively marketing advanced aircraft and aviationproduction capabilities abroad and to use export profits to support advanced aircraftdevelopment projects and

general director of sukoi avpk has said consolidation is necessary to ensure survival and prosperity for the russian aircraft industry in todays economic environment this consolidation in pogosyans view goes beyond just sukhoimig merger and extends into other design bureaus such as tupelov and ilyushin and other components of the aircraft industry33 various reports indicate that the russian government is considering merging avpk sukhoi and rsk mig as part of major overhaul of the countrys defense industry34 there is debate over which company would benefit the most from such merger some argue that if continued consolidation does occur it appears most likely that sukhoi will be the surviving entity the su27 line has enjoyed more domestic success than the mig29 variants and appears poised to continue this trend the latest russian military aviation plan designated the su34 and su3537 as the most important russian fighters for the next decade35 furtherm ore exports of sukhoi fighterattack aircraft are increasing in both absolute terms and relative to mig exports36 however others argue that mig would benefit more since it has traditionally had stronger ties to the federal government and appears to be stronger organizationally several events in the 1990s have combine d to make rsk mig appear the weaker sibling the russian military has not procured mig since the early 1990shttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30730crs15 37abulafia richard mikoyan mig29 fulcrum world military and civil aircraft briefing teal group inc january 2000 38 mosow times 11 dec 99 39sukhoi courts mapo

also migs export success in the early 1990s has tailed off finally internal conflicts and defections of key personnel have weakened the organization in late november 1999 dozen leading officials including the chief designers and their deputies for the mig29 and mig31 programs resigned these officials represented the leadership of rsk migs mig29 program shortly thereafter most signed on with new firm russian avionics headed by nikitins predecessor mikail korzhuev that had its own mig29 upgrade program in 1998 the russian air force signed lucrative contract with russian avionics to upgrade their mig29 relegating vpk mapo to subcontractor role38 if mig isnt absorbed by sukhoi in future consolidatio n another possibility is that sukhoi and mig will team up to promote common projects abroad39 in the past the russian air force has also indicated it would like sukhoi and mig to cooperate on developing future combat aircraft programs since it would be able to financially support only one or two such programs at low level40 both nikitin and pogosyan have argued that faster progress could be made in developing fifth generation fighter if other countries such as china and india were drawn into the project41 avpk sukhoi spokesman yuri chervakov noted we just have to publicly acknowledge that it is more feasible to team up with our strategic partners just as the united states lures other western countries into its joint strike fighter project42 mr chervakovs comment regarding the joint strike fighter was not random association like the us experience with the jsf russias industry

russias next generation combat aircraft it has often been suggested that the loser of this contract may not be able to sustain combat aircraft business the pak fa is the most important item in russias future years defense plan the potential market is estimated at approximately 1000 aircraft 420 of which would be purchased by russia the decision on which company will be awarded this contract has been postponed once and it is unclear when it will ultimately be made as officials are considering all military technological and financial aspects of the matter
