epilogue frontier 2010 157 addressing the nwfp new security cooperatio n addressing the fata counterinsurgency and mrzsthis monograph is the first in series by the center on faith international affairs cfia that will examine the intersection of religion and security issues in global context the center has for several years been at the forefront of this topic in 2003 it sponsored conference which examined the role of religion and religion policy in political and social stability an event which formed the basis of book religion and security the new nexus in international relations 1 the centers religion security research program builds on this initial work and by way of international conferences special reports and cfias journal the review of faith international affairs 2 has taken the lead in examining this critical issue from various regional and religious perspectives3 multifaith initiative the center conducts this research with the conviction that the free exercise of religion practiced peacefully can contribute in profoundly positive ways to stable social and political order but also that states must take seriously and deal intelligently with the social and security implications of religious extremism the center exists in part to help scholars policymakers and practitioners strike this critical balance and encourage discussion about the changing role of religion in global affairs the center operates as an education and research program of the institute for global engagement ige faithbased global affairs think tank which since 2000 has worked to promote sustainable environments for religious freedom and sponsor innovative international programs that focus on the intersection of reli gion law and security issues it was an ige initiative which invited nwfp chief minister akram khan durrani to washington in 2005 for discussions regarding political islam in the frontier and which resulted in joshua whites reciprocal trip to peshawar as part of small delegation joshuas subsequent stay in peshawar and his extended interaction with religious and political elites throughout the frontier formed the inspiration for this research project many of the themes and recommendations which appear below were first outlined by the author at presentation prefacein washington in november 2007 which was jointly sponsored by cfia and the south asia studies program of the johns hopkins university school for advanced international studies it is our hope that this monograph proves to be valuable resource to both scholars and policymakers as they

carnegie endowment for international peace and the institute for public policy in bishkek conference in kyrgyzstan on religion and security in the central asian contextislamic politics counterinsurgency and the state pakistans western frontier has been geographic and ideological focal point for religious extremism for nearly thirty years it served as staging ground for mujahidin operations against the russians in afghanistan throughout the 1980s it was the birthplace of qaeda in 1988 and the t aliban movement in 1994 more recently over the last several years neot aliban insurgency has emerged in the pakafghan border areas which has grown into complex religiopolitical movement with three distinct but overlapping objectives one is focused westward on fueling the afghan conflict and overturning the karzai government second is oriented globally toward providing safe haven for qaeda and its af filiates to plan attacks against western interests and third is focused on pakistan itself on carving out sphere of influence within the tribal agencies of the federally administered t ribal areas fata and the nearby settled districts of the northwest frontier province nwfp for the establishment of islamist rule and on destabilizing the pakistani state so as to disrupt its cooperation with the us and western allies focusing on this third objective of the neot aliban movement this monograph examines in historical perspective the interaction between islamic politics and the state in the frontier paying particular attention to the nwfp proper and the nearby settledtribal border regions although the analysis largely brackets number of important bilateral and regional issues such as the challenge of strengthening counterterrorism cooperation improving pak afghan interaction on border issues and larger regional questions dealing with concerns over pakistans lack of strategic commitment to rooting out militant groups and interacting with fragile civilian government in islamabad it seeks to provide framework for understanding the religious and political dynamics which are critical to the development of any successful us strategy in the frontierexecutive summary4 pakistans islamist frontier the narrative begins with an historical review of islamism in the frontier high lighting several recurring patterns which shed light on contemporary trends against this backdrop the monograph goes on to analyze the fiveyear tenure 20022007 of the muttahida majliseamal mma islamist government in nwfp which represented the first extended attempt at actual governance by religious parties in pakistans history and review the ways in which it shaped the current political environment this analysis is followed by discussion of the mmas decline over the last year the rise of the neot aliban insurgency and the return of pashtun nationalist politics the concluding chapters examine the history of american interaction in the frontier and recommend policies by which the us might work with the government of pakistan to implement programs which deny insurgents foothold in the settled areas of the frontier buttress the legitimacy of the state in dealing with religious and militant groups increase the political util ity and longterm sustainability of american development assistance and address the governance deficit in both the settled and tribal areas in such way as to lay the groundwork for more robust state influence and counterinsurgency planning given the upsurge in attention devoted to the hardcore t ehriket alibane pakistan ttp militancy in places such as waziristan and bajaur an analysis which focuses on islamic political behavior in the nwfp might at first seem to be out of step with current crises but this could not be further from the truth religiopolitical dynamics in the frontier are arguably more important than ever before while pakistan and the united states may increasingly resort to military action against ttp and other insurgent groups military efforts alone will ultimately prove insuf ficient in producing stable political order that satisfies the strategic objectives of either country ultimately counterinsurgency is about incentivizing political endgames in the frontier this requires much more robust and comprehensive policy focus on local governance politics and even religion many us officials have come to adopt jaundiced view of political solutions in the frontier believing that they too often serve to empower religious parties militants or both in this the us is often correct but also complicit american patronage has heavily privileged the pakistani military and done little to strengthen the kinds of civilian institutions that are necessary to provide counterweight to both religious politics and insurgent mobilization focus on the settled areas of the frontier is also long overdue while the neo t aliban insurgency remains heavily dependent upon bases deep in the fata the movements center of gravity is gradually becoming more diffuse blurring the distinction between settled and tribal regions the nwfp has been rocked by steep rise in militant activity over the last two years and increasingly resembles the ungoverned tribal areas political reforms in the fata on the other hand are likely to make the tribal areas look more like the settled regions by introducing regular forms of political activity this convergence makes the case for the development of counterinsurgency programs which operate across settled and tribal lines and which deny political space to new religious insurgent movementsexecutive summary 5 the frontier 20012008 evaluating islamic politics the limits and lessons of islamist moderation the religious parties five year tenure leading the nwfp government from 2002 to 2007 represents valuable case study of the ways in which involvement in the politi cal process can serve to shape and ultimately moderate islamic political behavior rather than serving as the vanguard of t alibanlike rule in the frontier as many observers had feared the mma instead became relatively pragmatic and found its islamist agenda limited by both internal and external pressures the lessons of the mmas transfor mation remain deeply relevant in the frontier even following the alliances defeat in february 2008 religious parties will continue to play significant role in nwfp politics particularly if and when their rightofcenter patrons among the pmln return to power in islamabad the united states which has generally avoided engagement with the religious parties also has lessons to learn from the constructive role that the interna tional community played in shaping the mmas islamist experiment understanding the mainstreammilitant divide the rise of the neot aliban insurgency since 2005 has deeply complicated the relationship between mainstream religious parties of the mma such as the jamaateislami ji and the jamiat ulemaeislam fazl juif and more militant organiza tions such as the ttp while these two kinds of islamists often share common political discourse eg regarding the west and the shariah and retain many informal linkages the religious parties are increasingly ambivalent about the goals of the neot aliban and threatened both directly and indirectly by the movements expansion into areas which were traditionally dominated by democratic islamist groups this realignment has reduced the influence of parties such as the juif over the younger generation of madrassah graduates many of whom are now easily recruited to militant groups but has also created new common interests between the religious parties and the state in channeling discontent into the formal political process insurgency as local politics just as analysts in 2002 made the mistake of reading the mma through the lens of the afghan t aliban and thus underestimating the degree to which religious parties would be shaped by local political interests so today observers often make the mistake of reading the neot aliban insurgency narrowly through the lens of qaeda and the waziri militant networks in doing so they again tend to underestimate the ways in which these insurgent groups and their agendas are woven deeply into the fabric of both local and regional politics neot aliban organizations operating in places such as swat khyber darra adam khel and south waziristan while all linked are also quite distinct and require unique strategies on the part of the government while there is clearly unifying ideological dimension to the insurgency it nonetheless remains highly fragmented and dependent upon local grievances6 pakistans islamist frontier legitimacy and peace deals the waziristan accords in 2006 signed by the pakistan army and local militants demonstrated that successful negotiations with neot aliban groups can easily end up as strategic failures american policymakers however have been slow to recognize that the converse can be equally true the failed peace deals in swat in the spring of 2008 were in many ways effective in that they demonstrated the governments good faith and created political space for the state to undertake strong action when the militants reneged on their commitments while some agreements with militants are clearly counterproductive not all peace deals are created equal negotiations can contribute to larger strategy of delegitimizing islamist insurgent activity the false secularism vs shariah debate the mmas defeat in the february 2008 elections sparked optimism that secular nationalism would replace religious politics in the frontier the awami national party anp took advantage of public disillusionment with the islamists governance and with their inability or unwillingness to stem the rising tide of militancy the nation alists victory however says more about cyclical politics and antiincumbency sentiment than it does about political islam the anpppp coalition government vulnerable to criticism from the rightofcenter parties has in fact adopted religious rhetoric of its own and promulgated new shariah regulations in an attempt to under cut public support for islamist insurgent groups local governance and islamism the rise of new militant islamism in the frontier is rightly attributed to political ideological and demographic factors but comparatively less attention has been paid to the internal and structural weaknesses of the state which opened the door to insurgent influence musharraf s 2002 governance reforms inadvertently facilitated the rise of new insurgents by crippling the states ability to respond to threats at the local level and by further bifurcating administration of settled and tribal regions the governments consistent failure to follow through with basic governance reforms in the fata has also weakened its hand against groups which have established religious basis of legitimacy in the tribal areas the present crisis us policy recommendations american policy toward the frontier has focused heavily on counterterrorism objectives in the fata the spreading insurgency however calls for more integrated and creative agenda designed to bolster the states political legitimacy and improve its capacity to respond to new threats this means crafting policies which encourage local communities to side with the state and against islamist insurgents these policies which may take distinct forms in the fata and the nwfp must integrate polit ical engagement public diplomacy security programming and development assistanceexecutive summary 7 broadening political engagement throughout the musharraf era american political engagement was tentative and overly focused on few elites although this is slowly beginning to change it is important that the us continues to find practical ways to signal its commitment to civilian governance institutionalize indirect support to moderate parties in the frontier such as the anp and retool its bureaucracy for longterm engagement with pakistan american diplomats also need to make greater efforts to engage with rightofcenter and religious parties regular consis tent interaction with parties such as the pmln and juif would ironically help to normalize and depoliticize the interaction and allow the us to be better prepared for political realignments which may bring these parties back into power refocusing public diplomacy americas public diplomacy strategy is often overly focused on trying to reduce antiamericanism the focal objective of us public diplomacy in pakistan should be to encourage pakistanis to see cooperation against militancy and extremism as being in their own interest this requires that us politicians and not just diplomats adopt language of common interests and common threats avoid framing the neot aliban insurgency in religious language and find ways to highlight the bleak realities of insurgent governance in both the settled and tribal areas there are also opportunities for the us to promote tracktwo dialogues on issues of religion and on the role of religious leaders in fostering social and political stability and rather than interacting with those muslim lead ers who are moderate by the standards of american liberalism the us must instead seek out interlocutors who are both moderate and influential in their own contexts planning for counterinsurgency in the nwfp communities in the settled areas of the frontier increasingly view local neot aliban groups as criminal enterprises rather than legitimate religious movements and have in some areas begun pushing back against insurgent advances the us should work with the provincial government to take advantage of this trend by funding and equipping rapidresponse police forces which could supplement and support communitybased lashkars as well as programs which address local discontent over the judicial system discontent which the insurgents often use to their advantage american policymakers should also encourage reform of provincial and local governance frameworks in the nwfp which might improve the states capacity to respond to militancy particularly across complex settledtribal boundaries8 pakistans islamist frontier planning for counterinsurgency in the fata us support for counterinsurgency efforts in the fata has been focused largely on the provision of equipment and training to the frontier corps this support is worthwhile but it should not be confused with promotion of actual counterinsur gency which turns on political contestation over government legitimacy absent institutionoriented governance reform in the fata successful and sustain able counterinsurgency activities are effectively impossible the united states should take the lead in organizing an expanded and more robust friends of pakistan consortium which could serve as an umbrella organization for multilateral develop ment efforts in the fata this consortium should then work with the government of pakistan to promote the establishment of model reform zones mrzs in the tribal areas which would integrate critical governance reforms eg elected councils and judicial access highly concentrated and visible development programming steppedup security presence and political incentives in such way as to incrementally build the legitimacy of the state and create demonstration effect throughout the fata leveraging fragmentation the pakistani government has long history of taking advantage of cleavages within and among tribal structures in the wake of the anbar awakening in iraq american policymakers have discussed whether similar strategies might be successful in pakistan carrying out tribeoriented anbar model in and around the fata would pose real challenges on account of the internally fragmented egalitarian and increasingly entrepreneurial nature of the pashtun tribal system although tribal lashkars may prove to be useful in pushing back neot aliban advanc in some areas and should be supported by the state when they do so these ad hoc alliances are likely to disintegrate quickly or even turn against the government any effort to take advantage of fragmentation in the frontier must integrate political strategy with tactical approaches from the outset and as argued above should be oriented around concerted program to incentivize tribal communities and relatively moderate islamist groups to integrate into the political mainstream increasing the effectiveness of development just as successful counterinsurgency campaigns require institutional frameworks so us development programs in the tribal areas need to come to terms with the massive governance gap in the fata much of the usaid programming in the fata is innovative but is unlikely to be sustainable or politically effective given the scope of the american aid commitment in the fata policymakers should insist that broader governance issues are concurrently put on the table the us government should also develop plans to direct more aid to the nwfp proper for more on the mrz concept see epilogue frontier 2010 executive summary 9 especially the border areas adjacent to the fata and explore skills training programs in partnership with moderate madrassah networks and local universities situated in the southern part of the province conclusion as the united states looks toward formulating more comprehensive strategy in the region it would do well to recognize that islamism in the frontier remains highly fragmented not only between those groups which participate in the democratic process and those which contest the legitimacy of the state but also between those which have ideological or transnational agendas and those which simply operate in the realm of local politics solutions to the problems posed by illiberal or insur gent islamism ultimately require political mainstreaming this in turn calls for legitimate and capable state institutions both civilian and military which can set the political boundaries for islamist participation and respond effectively to new and unexpected forms of religious insurgencyepilogue frontier 2010 what follows is fiction it is narrative answer to the question what could the us do in partnership with the government of pakistan over the next two years to deny space to neot aliban insurgent groups in the frontier the account is intentionally optimistic and brackets substantial questions about the situation in afghanistan the nature of interagency coordination within the us the stability of the pakistani coalition government and the state of uspakistani bilateral relations all the same the picture it paints is not farfetched in fact it presents but one of many possible policy approaches to the frontier the particulars of which are far less important than the overall strategic framework which attempts to integrate governance development and security initiatives in geographically focused and politically coordinated manner the narrative first addresses the nwfp region of the frontier and then the fata although these two areas are increasingly interconnected they nonetheless require somewhat different strategies particularly in the nearterm addressing the nw fp new security coo peration it is 2010 two years ago the situation in nwfp was nearly intolerable t ehrik et alibanepakistan militants were clashing with pakistan army forces in swat insurgents were threatening peshawar from nearby khyber agency the spillover from military operations in bajaur had brought hundreds of thousands of residents from the fata into the settled areas and nwfp provincial government officials were regularly being targeted by militant groups in spite of steppedup military action by the pakistan army the united states remained worried that the insurgency was metastasizing and that its spread to the settled areas of the frontier had the potential to seriously destabilize the new co alition government in islamabad review of the us policy portfolio by the new administration revealed that washington had traditionally focused relatively little 158 pakistans islamist frontier attention on the nwfp itself with most of the programs oriented around anti narcotics and few modest development and civil society initiatives in early 2009 us officials in consultation with the provincial government and islamabad identified two major factors facilitating the insurgency in the settled areas frustration with the local justice system which t aliban groups exploited by establishing qazi courts and profoundly low expectations by the public of timely govern ment response to insurgent advances which caused local populations to bandwagon with the militants seeking to assist in addressing the first problem the us began needsassess ment on local nwfp justice issues carried out in cooperation with the provincial government and managed under usaids democracy and governance programming field surveys identified four highrisk districts in which discontent threatened to create openings for the neot aliban the research also underscored that while most local communities wanted shariah they did not want to be governed by clerics or subjected to harsh and arbitrary punishments in the style of the afghan t aliban in second phase of the project building on this research the us funded provincial government programs aimed at speeding the caseload at the district court level and also initiatives which helped to set up alternative dispute resolution mechanisms consistent with local norms and traditions attempts to deal with the bandwagoning problem in the settled areas focused on the critical role of police forces operating in vulnerable areas here the problem was fairly clear local police were the first line of defense but had insufficient resources or incentives to push back against insurgent advances the pakistani military meanwhile had the capabilities but was often unwelcome in these areas local security officials argued that the province needed to develop rapidresponse police force that could deploy quickly to build confidence in the government and encourage local populations to side with the state acting both in response to insurgent activities and preemptively to shore up areas which were coming under increased threat although it recognized the need the us bureaucracy was not well organized to support police programs in the frontier resources expertise and authorities were spread out among the departments of state justice and defense eventually however the us embassy coordinated joint plan to assist the pakistani government in equipping funding and training the force on three year trial basis and the program was rolled out in five highrisk districts bordering conflict zones buner lower dir kohat mardan and peshawar joint uspakistani working group was set up to monitor the program and conduct regular needsassessments operationally this rapidresponse force was overseen by special committee led by the nwfp chief minister along with the inspector general of the frontier corps inspector general of police and representative from the armys xi corps in peshawar the goal of the program was to do more than simply add one additional type of security force it was rather to facilitate robust security coordination at the provincial level and provide capacity for the state to implement graduated response to new threats rather than waiting until situations required fullscale military intervention one critical aspect of the program was that each regional coordination officer rco was given the authority to deploy subsets of the force in his area on short epilogue frontier 2010 159 notice without going up the chain of command provincial police officials recogniz ing that the objectives of this new force were 80 optical designed to shift perceptions and only 20 kinetic designed to physically displace insurgents also mapped out an outreach plan to local politicians bureaucrats police officers and religious leaders to assure them that the rapidresponse force would provide ground support within 24 hours and could be called upon in support of local community lashkars raised against the insurgents the program got off to slow start it took nearly year for the provincial govern ment to induct personnel most of whom were recruited from areas outside of the five focus districts set up the new coordination mechanisms and determine the best way to divide the force within the districts the first training programs moreover were only barely adequate to prepare the force for its new duties by early 2010 however the program was beginning to have noticeable impact local communities dissatisfied with t aliban influence in their areas were increasingly calling on the rapidresponse force for assistance and the provision by centcom of several helicopters to facilitate the insertion of police forces into remote areas further strengthened perceptions that the provincial government was committed to standing with local communities the special police force also took on another important role in mid2010 when at the request of the pakistan army it was expanded to backfill stability operations in the swat valley following the militarys formal departure by late 2010 the forces area of operations had been expanded to 10 of the nwfps 24 districts and had contributed to significant diminution of insurgent influence in the settled areas concomitant with these programs focused on justice and policing the us state department had in early 2009 initiated more broadbased strategy of engagement at both the federal and provincial levels with rightofcenter and religious parties while these parties rhetoric about american involvement in the region continued to be just as heated as ever behind the scenes us officials found the party leaders to be quite pragmatic and interested for their own reasons in seeing the neot aliban insurgency wane in the frontier and in finding new vocational avenues for their madrassah graduates by the time that the pmln engineered surprise return to power in mid2010 bringing with it greater participation by the religious parties in the nwfp the us had built measure of trust with these groups working together with officials from the british german saudi and emirati governments american diplomats had begun dialogue with madrassah leaders about practical ways to support programs that would drain support from the most extreme neot aliban activities and provide new vocational training opportunities for their graduates addressing the f ata counterinsurgency and mr zs it is 2010 two years ago it was clear that the security situation in the fata was rapidly deteriorating localized insurgencies from bajaur to south waziristan and practically everywhere in between were increasingly interconnected american security officials were consumed with targeting not only ttp but also 160 pakistans islamist frontier the haqqanis crossborder network based in waziristan distrust between the us and pakistani governments had increased steadily over the years and had come to flash point following the american ground incursions from across the border in afghanistan in september 2008 as part of thenpresident bushs 750 million aid pledge usaid had begun im plementing development programs in the fata number of these projects were seen as innovative but the collapsing security situation and the lack of any real governance framework in the tribal areas through which to implement meaningful political and economic change produced growing skepticism in washington that the funds would contribute to us security objectives the new government in islamabad appeared at first to be open to substantive fata reforms which might begin to integrate the tribal areas with the pakistani mainstream but lacking political will eventually fell back on plans which implemented reforms only at the margins us military officials were similarly at crossroads focus on the insurgency in afghanistan was intensifying and policy reviews of the situation in the pakistani tribal areas made it clear that the lack of access and more fundamentally the lack of real government in the tribal areas made any kind of anbar model from iraq almost impossible in the fata the egalitarian tribal structure of the pashtuns also made it difficult to imagine sustaining ad hoc alliances in the absence of broader political framework realizing that the security development and governance challenges were in creasingly interconnected us officials settled on new approach which adapted existing counterinsurgency models to the unique circumstances of the tribal areas they would focus aid and stability efforts on select number of model reform zones mrzs in the fata each of which would also be given new system of local governance and representation sponsored by an international consortium which grew out of the friends of pakistan initiative and which was given strong public backing by saudi arabia turkey and the united arab emirates these zones would concentrate the effects of pakistani development efforts plant the seeds for political activity and sustainable governance frameworks and create demonstration effect throughout the tribal areas the mrz effort required sustained negotiations and buyin at the highest lev els the pppled government in islamabad although initially skeptical eventually realized that the political gains from targeted highly visible development efforts could be substantial they also welcomed the excuse to put off major fatawide reforms which might be politically unpalatable the anp leadership in peshawar saw the plan as first step toward integrating the fata with the nwfp an idea that they had long called for the religious parties saw opportunities for expanding their political presence in the tribal areas and the pakistan military agreed to the plan in exchange for us commitments to provide special equipment for use in the mrz areas in addition to increased access for pakistani military officials to us military training abroad the army leadership was somewhat ambivalent about undertak ing counterinsurgency programs in the fata even in relatively peaceful areas but pressure from the new centcom commander along with deteriorating security situation which put nearly all of the 750 million in usaid projects at risk convinced the military that the mrz program was worth supportingepilogue frontier 2010 161 the program began with five mrzs one in each of the five tribal agencies out side of waziristan each zone encompassed approximately one tehsil subagency administrative unit the program was essentially optin tribal communities in particular area were presented with deal if they agreed to the establishment of an mrz in their area they would benefit from windfall of development projects as well as increased security assistance from the frontier corps in return they would come under redesigned governance framework which while respecting local customs and traditions would establish new institutions and rules for politi cal competition the details of this plan contained number of compelling political incentives the government and the international consortium focused development projects in the mrzs and fielded extra personnel and resources respectively for the fc units who operated there the military agreed not to operate regular army troops in the zones except under narrowly defined conditions the office of the political agent retained its robust discretionary powers but was stripped of the authorities granted under the antiquated frontier crimes regulation to exact collective punishment the government agreed to preserve riwaj custom to extend right of judicial appeal to the peshawar high court and to allow qazi courts under the oversight of the political agent the government also set up new wing within the frontier corps which under the direction of the rcos acted analogously to the rapidresponse police force in the settled areas the mrz framework also established for the first time substantive system of local governance in the fata elected councils were set up at the tehsil and union council subtehsil levels and elections were held on party basis parallel struc ture of youth councils was also established in each tehsil in order to encourage politi cal participation by the younger generation these councils were given broad authority to propose local development initiatives though the final approval rested with the bureaucracy in peshawar and each council member was given discretionary funds for development in his own constituency the framework also provided for an interface between elected councils and local jirgas with the latter being given formal role in proposing development projects handling complaints and resolving disputes under the oversight of the political agent the plan included an array of efforts to obtain and sustain buyin by local leaders t ehsillevel elected leaders were granted observer status in the nwfp provincial assembly in peshawar and were afforded some of the privileges formerly retained by the maliks such as the ability to distribute foreign work permits local maliks who had long been the recipients of generous subventions by the state were for the most part coopted into the new system by the prospect of participating in the new and lucrative elected councils of directing development projects to tribal clients and of taking advantage of special transition fund which continued to provide subventions at current levels for five years the political objective of the mrzs was to gradually incentivize an expansion of the states writ in the tribal areas and institutionalize that expansion by cultivat ing new forms of political legitimacy the reality at least initially proved to be more complicated there were disputes and legal hurdles over the new administrative 162 pakistans islamist frontier frameworks it took time to raise new frontier corps levies which would operate in the mrz areas the first set of elections was marred by neot aliban attacks and us officials became concerned when some of the religious parties came to hold sizeable number of seats in the governing councils t aliban groups targeted several of the reform zones during the first year but only twice did the government have to bring in the regular army to clear the area and drive out insurgents by late 2009 however the dynamic was beginning to change it had become clear that the state was committed to securing these areas and to undertaking visible and communitydriven development work usaid capacitybuilding efforts were being extended to include training for ngos and recent university graduates from nearby areas such as peshawar kohat bannu and dera ismail khan once the security situation in the mrzs stabilized the zones became draw for ngos construction companies and young people seeking work there was even talk of situating tarifffree
