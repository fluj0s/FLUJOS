open position at higher rank grades or ranks within the foreig n service are divided into two major categories the senior foreign servi ce sfs of which there are about 600 individuals and the regular service whic h is comprised of about 10500 officers and specialists the sfs is divided into five pay categories and like the civil service senior executive service ses requires presidential ppointment

assignment heshe would experience 589 decrease in salary why change the compensation system both the administration and the foreign service seek to remove the pay difference issue but they are also mo tivated by different considerations foreign service perspective to eliminate major pay difference affecting the majo rity of the foreign service according to 2008 afsa survey the top legislative issue for members of the foreign service is the elimination of the pay disparity that exists between service abroad and service in washington dc which is where most foreign service personnel are domestically assigned12 from the perspective of many in the foreign service it is matter of equity and of recognition of their work as they serve abroad often in difficult and dangerous conditions in 2005 as members of the senior fore ign service were reaching retirement statistics showed they were trying to serve in assignments in the continental united states instead of serving abroad and suffering the loss of pay which could affect their retirement savings thus in 2005 the pay di fference was eliminated for those in the senior foreign service the compensation system for the senior foreign service changed to formalized payforperformance system with adjustments to salary based solely on performance and the pay levels were brought to the washington dc salary level regardless of where they were posted13 supporters of changing the pay system to cover the entire foreign service and the administration both argue that the pay disparity created an increasing pay disincentive to overseas service as it did for the senior foreign service prior to 200514 further even among the foreign service serving at the same post only mid and juniorranked personnel w ould suffer the pay gap while those in the senior foreign service and those detailed to an embassy would not because the pay difference exists for only those foreign service personnel posted abroad who are at the rank of 01

washington dc consistently cited the lack of locality pay as deterrent to bidding at hardship positions in 2002 we reported that the differences in the statutes governing domestic locality pay and differential pay for overseas service had created gap in compensation penalizing overseas employees this gap grows every year as domestic locality pay rates increase creating an ever increasing

percent as estimated in our 2002 report differential pay incentiv for the 15 percent differential hardship posts are now less than the locality pay for washington dc which is currently 17 percent and can be expected to soon surpass the 20 percent differential hardship posts15 administration perspective to correct the pay difference and move another element of the federal service to full

this system commonly referred to as virtual locality pay was developed so that the individual would not be negatively affected in the annuity computation because of lower salary that did not include locality pay however becau the individual serving overseas would have the those years computed as if heshe were serving in washington that individuals contribution to the foreign rvice retirement system also would have to be at level as if the indi vidual were serving in washington24 the conforming amendments of section 2 make adjustments to the foreign service retirement systems by eliminating the virtual locality pay system when the foreign service overseas salary leve l reached the washington dc level with locality pay the virtual locality pay system would not be required the virtual locality paysystem was instituted because as the locality pay disparity became larger it created an incentive for foreign service personnel approaching retirement to seek assignment to washington dc as opposed to going abroad as person approached retirement the lower salary levels received because of the pay disparity for service abroad w ould negatively affect annuity computations at time when person would want to have the highest salary levels possible for the foreign service these levels would be achieved by serving in washington dc an examination of assignment bids among those approaching retirement at that time showed that this was in fact happening the conference report accompanying the legislation explains foreign service officers serving overseas do not receive locality pay thus as they near retirement they have si gnificant financial incentive to seek assignment to washington dc this often deprives overseas posts of the more experienced officers under this section an officer while serving overseas will have his or her annuity calculated as if he or she were actually receiving locality pay25 sec 3 death gratuity the foreign service act of 1980 currently

determined by mexico city shopping basket an annual education allowance for each child and quarters allowance to cover rent nd utilities the amount for the allowance is based upon the grade of the foreign service member th allowances and benefits can change from posttopost even within the same country34 further if the member of the foreign service for personal reasons goes to the post by himherself the family will receive separate maintenance allowance these economic questions as well as the questions of equity recognition of the wo rk of the foreign service impact upon the morale assignments process and possibl retention are often weighed against each other as members and their staff consider this issue is this pay raise many view this proposed compensation sy stem as pay raise for the foreign service and ask why salaries should be increased when foreign service personnel already receive so many benefits supporters for the change state that this is not pay raise but rather correction of 14 years of unintended inequity that is growing every year in the overseas compensation for the foreign service they argue that ending this pay differencehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34668crs12 35 the american foreign service association creating pay equity q discussion piece 2008 36 steve kashkett afsa state department vice president overseas pay disparity debunking the myths foreign service journal may 2008 p 51would help validate the work the foreign service does including the significant efforts and sacrifices that they and their families make in service to the united states35 is locality pay justified ce foreign service already receive many benefits while serving overseas in many posts abroad foreign serv ice personnel receive posthardship differential of 5 35 of base pay costofliving allowance an education allowance for their children and housing allowance these can add significantly to the base salary level providing locality pay for those serving abroad would increase the compensation levels the lack of locality pay is longer matter of retirement benefits because the virtual locality pay for retirement computation in current law already takes care of the imp act on an annuity those who question the need for this change argue that the foreig n service is already well taken care of when they serve abroad those who support eliminating the pay diffe rential contend that the allowances exist to address specific costs and hardships unique to working for long years overseas danger pay compensates for the extreme risks of living in country wracked by war terrorism political violence or endemic lawlessness education allowances make it possible for foreign service memb ers to cover their childrens education when viable public schools are available costofliving allowances help defray the cost of food and other daily needs of life in countries where those things are vastly more expensive than in the united states these were never meant to obviate the need for the basic locality pay adjustment that all other federal employees get36 since the foreign service receives free housing when serving abroad and they ofte n own home in the united states which they can rent and build equity should they also get locality pay equivalent because one of the biggest benefits that members of the foreign service receive is free housing when posted abroad many believe that this should compensate for any loss derived from the lack of locality pay these critics point out that if foreign service personnel own home in the united st ates they would be able to rent it out while they are gone and build equity while the government takes care of their living quarters for free they ask if the locality pay adjustment is really necessaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34668crs13 37 ibid 38 ibidsupporters of the change in the fore ign service compensation system explain that while the housing abroad is free memb ers of the foreign service are not reaping financial windfall even when they own home in the united states these supporters explain most of our members own home in the us on which they have to pay mortgage upkeep insuran ce and property taxes and renting it out often impossible rarely covers all of these expenses and is itself costly proposition37 these supporters for eliminating the pay di fference also point out that there are often hidden costs to serving overseas th at do offset any gain from free housing among these is the fact that it is often impossible for the spouse to get employment and salary equivalent to what could be earned in the united states also there are numerous outofpocket costs for being overs eas these include travel not covered by authorized visitation basis from dist ant economically developing nations this type of travel may include attending the funeral of family member going to family members wedding or graduation or seeing family member who is suffering from lifethreatening illness38 should civil service employees who are detailed to an embassy be provided death gratuity equal to that for foreign service personnel critics of the current death gratuity provi sions believe the official status of us government employee working at an embassy should not matter in terms of death gratuity the civil service employee detailed to an embassy and the foreign service member posted to the embassy shoul d both receive the same death gratuity particularly if either or both died in similar manner such as the bombing of an embassy they were both serving the united states supporters of the foreign service personne lonly death gratuity provision in the legislation state that there is difference between the civil service employee and the foreign service member who dies while detailed at an embassy for the civil service employee it was matter of choice for the foreign service officer service abroad is condition of employment foreign service personnel are expected to be worldwide available and expected to spend the larger proportion of their career abroad that is why there are limits on the number of years member of the foreign service can stay continuously in the united states and why generally member of the service spends about twoth irds of hisher career abroad they point out that when member of the foreign service dies abroad after long career outside the united states the family often does not have the sa support structure to help them when they return to the united states as they would have had if they had lived continuously in community the death gratuity is intended to help the family transition into new life
