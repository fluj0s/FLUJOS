clifford sobel reason 15 d 1 c summary and introduction on december 18 president lula signed the national defense strategy concluding fifteen month drafting exercise the document was principally drafted by minister for strategic planning roberto mangabeira unger and it provides security policy framework that places defense in the context of the governments broader goal of national development the strategy is built on the presumption that it is in brazils interest to be independent that is able to project its military power as it wishes able to produce its own military hardware and able to control strategic economic sectors including space cybernetics and nuclear power much of the document focuses on the future roles and structures for brazils armed forces including updating equipment promoting deployability and enhancing peacekeeping capabilities it also devotes considerable space to issues such as nuclear energy reducing imports and national civilian service that are only indirectly related to how brazils armed forces will defend the country but are crucial when defense is viewed in the context of vision of broader strategy for brazils development into world power by linking reform of the security sector with the governments broader development vision the strategy places the military for the first time since the end of military rule in 1985 into prominent place on the national agenda and strengthens its case for increased resources comments on the strategys provisions for the brazilian military will be reported septel end summary and introduction 2 sbu on september 7 brazilian independence day 2007 president lula tasked minister for strategic planning roberto mangabeira unger to produce national defense strategy paper within one year although unger announced he had completed work on september 7 2008 the new strategy was not signed by president lula and published until december 18 reportedly because of concerns from the armed services that their inputs were not incorporated the resulting document clearly includes many service priorities especially in the area of equipment modernization but the main focus of the document is less to outline future roles and structures for the military than to provide context for the role of the defense sector in the brazilian state the defense strategy is available online via the mod website wwwdefesagovbreventos temporarios2008 estrategia defesa nacionalpdf in portuguese an english version will be transmitted to washington agencies when available 3 c the defense strategy as approved by the government and signed by the president reflects the governments overall priority brazils development into modern world power and sets conditions for the defense sectors role in this development in creating this strategy for the defense sector to contribute to development unger goes beyond normal plan for restructuring the security sector to meet anticipated challenges and cites two other axes for work strengthening defense industry and maintaining required military service in the context of national service obligation in the three main areas of the strategy military reform defense industry and national service the document underlines the importance of acquiring control of the latest technology and of enhancing the role of the central government independence 4 c the strategy for defense and development is built around the concept of independence in the governments vision brazil should be able to control its own security and not have to go outside its own borders in order to equip its security forces the strategy allows for strategic partners but these are seen as countries willing to transfer to brazil technologies that will make brazil more independent not as collaborators in security operations similarly where brazil currently does not have the capability to produce defense equipment it should according to the document seek to purchase the appropriate articles from foreign suppliers but with the aim of allowing for domestic production this point is clearly illustrated by the prescriptive language on acquisition of modern fighter aircraft which rejects the extreme solution of simply buying foreignmade planes and calls for the air force to either 1 purchase aircraft of which brazil can then produce its own upgraded variant or 2 purchase minimal number of foreign planes which then can be augmented by domestic production of the same model comment given the relatively small number of aircraft to be ultimately acquired by the air force neither option makes economic sense but unger places greater importance on independence than military capability or efficient use of resources end comment 5 c the strategy also repeatedly cites three sectors as being of critical importance for the independent development of the brazilian state space cybernetics and nuclear calling for brazil to control these technologies the strategy calls for enhanced brazilian space launch capacity satellite monitoring and surveillance and for brazil to deploy its own gpstype system cybernetics is listed as important for communications and information processing although the strategy document acknowledges that as member of the nonproliferation treaty npt brazil will not have nuclear weapons it then states that for this reason brazil must therefore pursue nuclear power development as an element of security that is important for brazils development this stated connection to defense of the country serves as justification for inclusion of nuclear power as strategic industry albeit one whose importance is more relevant to development than security note nuclear energy is in fact one of the strategic industries enumerated in gobs latest industrial policy published in may see ref c the other industrial policy strategic sectors are defense industry information technology nanotechnology biotechnology and healthcare industry military restructuring 6 c the heart of the defense strategy is its plan for the restructuring of the brazilian military specific comments on plans for each service and the ministry of defense mod will be reported septel much of the restructuring strategy was contributed by the services and provides practical answers to key strategic questions about how brazil will see to its own security over the next generation among the conclusions are that brazil must focus on the three key areas of monitoringcontrolling large areas strategic mobility and military presence to provide security these areas contribute to the services requirements for airlift better communications satellite reconnaissance and maritime domain awareness the strategy notes the necessity of developing better joint service cooperation and the capabilities to conduct joint operations and the need for professional civil service component in the defense ministry there is also clear understanding that country with pretensions to world power status will be asked to make greater contributions to united nations peacekeeping operations brazil currently ranks just below uruguay in regional unpko participation the strategy therefore recognizes that as brazilian capabilities increase so should peacekeeping deployments defense industry 7 sbu the strategy papers most important goal for defense industry is to use the need to modernize the armed forces to acquire new technologies with applications for national development to do so the government of brazil is encouraged to offer tax incentives and legal benefits to these industries tax and financing benefits are already provided under the may 2008 industrial policy unger also clearly states that commercial considerations ie increased trade must be considered subordinate to the countrys strategic interest therefore efficient use of resources and deployment of effective military capabilities are less important than stimulating domestic defense industries which are optimistically viewed as having future export potential according to the strategy industrial partnerships with nonbrazilian entities are advantageous as means to reduce dependence on foreign purchase when the main role in the partnership is played by the brazilian side 8 sbu in exchange for support for the growth of defense industries the strategy proposes that the central government gain special powers over such industries including through socalled golden share arrangements government vetoes over designated corporate actions several press reports carried the story that the mod would be seeking special taxes on private businesses that are perceived as benefiting from security eg petrobras to pay the costs of their defense but such proposal is not included in the final document national service 9 c the strategy states that the basis of national defense is the identification of the nation with the armed forces and the armed forces with the nation for this reason mandatory military service is viewed as essential for the future the strategy states explicitly that the armed forces must limit and reverse the tendency to lower the proportion of draftees and raise the proportion of professionals consistent with the overall goal of encouraging the brazilian governments vision of national development military service is viewed primarily as means of unifying the population and fostering greater social equality the strategy document states specifically that its objectives include forcing higher socioeconomic classes to provide larger proportion of military draftees and opening more places in military academies to students from more diverse backgrounds 10 c the means by which the strategy plans to democratize the armed forces will be new form of national service all young people will have to be available to the military which would be able to select the best qualified as its recruits everyone else would go into civil service which would receive basic military training and be available for mobilization in the case of national emergency of some sort the strategy does not however provide any information as to what sort of national emergency would require the mobilization of potentially millions of poorly trained young brazilians or how the basic training of about three million civil service members per year will be managed by the limited number of military professionals available regional focus 11 c one of the most notable elements of the strategy has been the focus on the defense of the amazon region while the document notes that this region faces ongoing security challenges from uncontrolled borders and potential instability in neighboring states it also indulges in the traditional brazilian paranoia concerning the activities of nongovernmental organizations and other shadowy foreign forces that are popularly perceived as potential threats to brazils sovereignty the strategy calls for greater use of mobility and monitoring technology to improve security in the amazon region and for the shifting of forces north as needed to improve security there 12 c the strategy also calls for improved defense relations with other south american states especially through the development of the south american defense council although it notes that main purpose of the council will be to enhance brazils defense industrial base through exports to its neighbors the strategy concedes that brazil will require greater capacity for participation in international peacekeeping although increasing brazils deployments should be linked to restructuring of international organizations to give developing countries more important roles in their leadership comments 13 c the first sentence of the strategy portion of the document reads national defense strategy is inseparable from national development strategy this point is key for understanding the documents purpose and why it was tasked to the ministry of strategic planning and not the defense ministry not defense strategy per the strategy is set of ideas for how brazils military defense industry and national service can contribute to the goal of development nowhere in the strategy is the goal of development defined but it seems to point toward generally understood vision of brazil as major world power with security council seat with strong state institutions and without threats to its security situation described as brazils proper place by linking reform of the security sector with the governments broader development vision the strategy places the military for the first time since the end of military rule in 1985 into prominent place on the national agenda and strengthens its case for increased resources 14 c while the restructuring plans generally are consistent with the goal of modern more capable military leaving aside such politically popular white elephants as nuclear powered submarine the strategy document is silent on how resources will be found to cover the costs of expensive new hardware including aircraft carriers satellite constellations and fighter production even ballpark estimates by embassy staff of possible modernization costs are far in excess of current defense budgets the defense strategy as whole is in some measure designed to address this question by linking defense to overall development goals but it is likely that defense expenditures will not be increased to the degree required to fulfill the shorter term goal of equipping the armed forces with cutting edge technology produced in brazil 15 c the other two axes defense industry and national service have less to do with improving the military than with integrating national security with national development some of the specific proposals in these areas eg propping up inefficient industries increasing conscription actually could reduce the effectiveness of the military and divert resources from modernization the emphasis on societal benefits over professionalism in military service is consistent with the views of president and other government leaders who started in politics under the military government of the 1970s and 80s and want to ensure that the militarys capacity to become involved in politics remains circumscribed the socialist background of lulas workers party is clearly evident in the efforts at social engineering through mandatory national service at the cost of more effective defense 16 c perhaps the most significant brazilian comment on the defense strategy has been the lack of comment most of the coverage in the brazilian press relied on official press releases in some cases for example reporting inaccurately that the strategy would include the possible taxing of private business to pay for defense other coverage focused on few headlines including the construction of nuclear submarine possible redeployments of forces to the amazon and protection of maritime oil fields this may have been in part reflection of the timing of the release as most brazilians were heading away for the holidays embassy contacts do not seem to have read the document and regard it as summation of alreadyknown government views on defense the documents legal status is also unclear by signing president lula seems to have adopted it as national policy but as many of the recommendations are nonconcrete and would require further action to develop it remains to be seen how much will be implemented while lula seems to pay attention to what unger has to say the degree to which the strategys recommendations are implemented will be good barometer of the minister for strategic plannings real influence 17 c even if some of the more grandiose plans nuclear submarines universal military service are never realized there remains great deal that brazil can do consistent with the new defense strategy that will help it develop more capable modern military focusing on deployability and using technology to help monitor the northern regions of the country are the optimal solutions to brazils strategic problem of controlling vast unpopulated territory these plans create opportunities for us business to partner with brazilian counterparts and for the us armed forces to engage in increased cooperation as brazils military seeks to modernize see ref b we should however expect that engagement with brazil will increase only gradually particularly while the current government is in power the strategy document looks at strategic partnerships primarily in terms of defense trade and technology transfer but we should seek to open up the concept to include real security cooperation in areas of mutual interest such cooperation however must be gauged to be consistent with the brazilian governments vision of defense as means of national development sobel
