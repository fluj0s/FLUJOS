labonte government and finance division november 15 2007 abstract this report surveys the econometric literature on oil shocks to provide quantitative estimates of how large an eﬀect oil price changes have on economic activity it also reviews the statistical robustness of these ﬁndings and discusses some of the limitations of these types of statistical analyses before examining the empirical record it is useful to explore why economists believe oil shocks might aﬀect the economy and explore the channels through which that eﬀect is

recessions and mitigating the effects of recessions eight of the nine postwar recessions were accompanied by sharp increases in the price of oil the last four recessions followed this pattern the 19731975 recession followed the oil embargo the double dip recession of 19801982 followed the second oil shock which was caused by the iranian revolution and iraniraq war the 19901991 recession followed the oil price spike induced by the gulf war and the 2001 recession followed sharp rise in oil prices from 1999 to 2000 policymakers are concerned that the recent rise in oil prices could again spillover into the wider macroeconomy the coincidence of recessions and oil shocks does not prove that oil price changes have any effect on the economy to make that case statistical methods to hold other economic factors constant must be used this report surveys the econometric literature on oil shocks to provide quantitative estimates of how large an effect oil price changes have on economic activity it also reviews the statistical robustness of these findings and discusses some of the limitations of these types of statistical analyses economic theory suggests that oil shocks lead to higher inflation contraction in output and higher unemployment in the short run it is the rise in energy prices rather than high energy prices that causes these macroeconomic problems effective policy responses are difficult because expansionary policy would exacerbate the inflationary pressures whereas contractionary policy would exacerbate the contraction in output there is fair degree of consensus surrounding the range of estimates for comparable studies the cumulative effect of 10 increase in oil prices during onequarter 3 month period would be to reduce economic output by 0211 over the next year from its baseline level the magnitude of these estimates suggests that normal fluctuations in the price of oil would cause only minor fluctuations in economic growth however the estimates suggest that major oil shocks in which oil prices rise for several consecutive quarters often by more than 10 per quarter could lead to recessions all else equal some of the findings are not statistically robust few studies dissent from these findings many studies find that the effects of oil on economic activity are waning for example 2004 study found that 10 increase in oil prices would only reduce gdp by 02 surprisingly many studies found oil to have had stronger economic effects before the mid1970s although the major postwar oil shocks occurred since the mid1970s the studies suggest that the relationship between oil prices and economic activity is not simple linear one eg episodic oil price declines have negligible economic effects but there is straightforward way to identify more accurate relationship this report will be updated as new research becomes available

volatility changes in energy prices are more important to the economy than changes in the price of most other goods energy shocks can have macroeconomic consequences in terms of higher inflation higher unemployment and lower output historically energy price shocks have proven particularly troublesome for the us economy sharp spikes in the price of oil have preceded nine of the 10 postwar recessions including the latest one but since the current economic expansion began in 2001 energy prices have spiked on several occasions without causing recession economic theory suggests that economies suffer from recessions due to the presence of sticky prices if markets adjusted instantly then recessions could be avoided whenever economic conditions changed price and wage changes would automatically bring the economy back to full employment in actuality however there are menu costs 1 information costs uncertainty and contracts in our economy that make prices sticky as result adjustment takes time and unemployment and economic contraction can result in the interim when oil prices rise suddenly it directly raises the energy portion of inflation measures such as the consumer price index energy prices make up about 9 of the consumer price index as result the overall inflation rate is temporarily pushed up because other prices do not instantly adjust and fall if other energy prices rise at the same time as has often been the case then the effect on overall inflation will be magnified because energy is an important input in the production process the price shock raises the cost of production for many industries transportation accounts for majority of oil consumption in the united states but it is also used for heating and industrial uses such as plastics because other 1 products with high menu costs are those which are costly to reprice and therefore have sticky prices restaurant menus periodicals and catalog items are examples of products with high menu costs

and producers respond by cutting back production which causes the contraction in output and employment all else equal there may also be adjustment costs to shifting toward less energy intensive methods of production and these could temporarily have negative effect on output typically the effect on output occurs over few quarters2 the magnitude of an oil shocks effect on the economy should depend on how much oil that economy uses as the ratio of energy use to gdp in the united states has declined over time one would expect the economic effects of an oil shock to lessen this may help explain why the recent oil shock has had smaller economic effect than in the past the effects described thus far can be thought of as occurring on the supply side of the economy oil shocks may also affect aggregate demand when energy prices rise they involve an income transfer from consumers to producers since produ cers are also consumers aggregate demand is likely to fall only temporarily as producers adjust their consumption to their now higher incomes this adjustment is likely to be longer when the income recipients are foreigners than when they are americans second effect on demand can be expected to occur because the rise in energy prices will probably push up the overall price level because other prices do not fall immediately in the face of decline in demand the increase in the price level will reduce the real value of the available amount of money in the hands of buyers and this reduction in the real money stock will also reduce spending third effect on demand can occur if the rise in energy prices increases uncertainty and causes buyers to defer purchases this effect is also likely to be of short run nature the magnitude of all three effects will depend on how much energy prices rise and how long they remain high rising oil prices also affect the international balance of payments in the short run if the cost of us oil imports increases following price rise this constitutes transfer in purchasing power from us consumers to foreign oil producers how this affects the current account deficit measure that primarily consists of the trade deficit depends in turn on how foreign oil producers decide to use this purchasing power if they use it to purchase us goods then us exports would increase and there would be little effect on the current account deficit if they use it to purchase us assetswhether corporate stocks treasury bonds or by simply leaving the revenue in us bank accountthen it would represent an inflow of foreign capital to the united states which would increase the current account deficit for those oilexporting countries that maintain floating exchange rate against the dollar the dollar would be likely to depreciate following an oil shock relative to their currencies but many of the major oilexporting countries maintain fixed exchange rate against the dollar for this reason the value of the dollar would be unlikely to be greatly affected by an oil shock in the short run in the long run however the real value of the dollar must fall to pay for the more expensive oil imports against countries who fix their nominal exchange rate to the dollar this will occur through relative price adjustment ie higher inflation in oil producing countries than in the united states shortrun exchange rate adjustment may also occur more slowly because world oil market transactions are made using the us dollar 2 if rising energy prices affect the economy through this transmission mechanism then falling energy prices should have the opposite effect on the economy they should temporarily lower inflation and raise output all else equal many of the studies to follow find that this is not true however

temporary that is once prices adjust the economy returns to full employment and its sustainable growth path3 this observation yields an important insight it is not the level of energy prices that affects economic growth and inflation but rather the change in energy prices thus if policymakers wish to mitigate the effect of energy prices on output and inflation they shou ld be concerned with rising energy prices and should not be concerned with high energy prices even if the high prices are permanent the only permanent macroeconomic effect of higher energy prices is their negative effect on the terms of trade the terms of trade is measure of standard of living that refers to the labor and capital embodied in us exports that can be exchanged for the labor and capital embodied in foreign imports 4 it means that the united states has to give up more of the goods it produces than previously to obtain barrel of oil permanently higher energy prices lead to onetime permanent decline in the terms of trade and the standard of living of us consumers all else equal g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g11g150g153g149g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 historically formulating an effective policy response to oil shocks has been difficult expansionary fiscal or monetary policy increases aggregate demand and inflationary pressures in typical downturns monetary and fiscal policy can safely become expansionary without triggering significant increase in inflation because the fall in demand reduces inflationary pressures in oil shocks policymakers must be simultaneously concerned with the fall in economic activity and the rise in prices by tackling one problem they risk exacerbating the other for example if policymakers use expansionary fiscal or monetary policy to offset the fall in output prices may rise further and inflationary expectations could become embedded key concern for policymakers is whether the rise in prices remains isolated in energy prices or whether they spread to other goods often referred to as core inflation this was the problem in the 1970s when inflation which was already rising before the oil shocks continued to accelerate following the oil shock of 1973 until it reached double digits in 1974 once the public came to expect higher inflation the subsequent expansionary policy measures had less and less of positive effect on aggregate demand making the purported tradeoff between inflation and unemployment less and less favorable following the second oil shock of 1979 federal reserve that was determined to stamp out doubledigit inflation chose instead to tackle the inflationary pressures caused by the oil shock by raising interest rates this decision exacerbated the effect on output contributing to the most severe economic contraction since the great depression another reason why policy responses have been unable to prevent oil shocks from leading to recessions historically is because policy changes are hampered by lags in policy recognition implementation and effectiveness because oil shocks are typically unpredictable events policy cannot be modified far enough ahead of time to prevent downturn 3 this point is not always explicitly made in the time series analyses reviewed below which tend to end their estimates at the last time lag that yields statistically significant data or arbitrarily cut off the estimates after few lags to meet statistical criterion concerning the limit on the number of variables allowed 4 see crs report rl32591 us terms of trade significance trends and policy by

shocks which has attempted to quantitatively estimate how much of an effect oil prices have on macroeconomic variables such as gdp growth inflation and unemployment technical terms are defined in glossary at the end of the report5 g7g138g155g149g162g561g21g157g158g141g146g142g156g561 darby had one of the earliest econometric studies that attempted to estimate the economic effects of oil shocks 6 his study aimed to determine what had caused the 19731975 recession he hypothesized that it could have been due to four causes the removal of the nixon price control regime because gdp was overstated during the regime the breakdown in the bretton woods exchange rate regime the slowdown in money gr owth contractionary monetary policy or the oil shock he estimated that the 1973 oil shock caused total cumulative decrease in gnp of 25 although the oil shocks effect on the economy was statistically significant statistical tests could not rule out the possibility that it was the removal of price controls rather than the oil shock that caused the recession the next year hamilton published what many would consider to be the seminal study on oil shocks7 he drew attention to the fact that all but one of the postwar recessions had been preceded by sharp rise in the price of oil and set out to demonstrate statistically that contrary to conventional wisdom it was these oil price rises that caused the recessions he demonstrated that oil prices to use term from economics grangercaused gnp8 to prove that oil prices and gnp were not both being determined by some third variable he demonstrated that other macroeconomic variable grangercaused oil prices he estimated that 10 increase in the price of oil in this quarter would increase gnp by 004 in the next quarter then decrease it by 007 after two quarters another 05 after three quarters and 06 after year compared to the level gnp would have reached had the price of oil been constant 9 considering that during the major oil shocks prices rose by 20 in some quarters and rose for several quarters in row these estimates suggest the effect of oil shocks on the economy are quite large however statistical tests suggest that his equation was misspecified or the relationship changed over time and 5 broader literature review can be found in donald jones paul leiby and inja paik oil price shocks and the macroeconomy what has been learned since 1996 energy journal vol 25 2 2004 p 1 6 michael darby the price of oil and world inflation and recession american economic review vol 72 4 september 1982 p 738 the study covered 1957q11976q4 the regression results had an rsquared of 09984 and the oil price variables were jointly significant at the 5 level 7 james hamilton oil and the macroeconomy since world war ii journal of political economy vol 91 2 1983 p 228 the regression covered the period from 1948q2 to 1980q3 and the oil variables were jointly significant at the 1 level 8 granger causation is statistical test of causation based on the predictive power of past information in this case oil grangercauses gnp if past values of oil increase the predictive power of future values of gnp beyond what is predicted by past values of gnp and past values of any other variables included in the equation oil is said to grangercause gnp if the predictive power it adds is statistically significant of cour this test is not definitive and is subject to many of the shortcomings such as omitted va riable bias described below in the caveats section 9 quarterly data have not been annualized thus cumulative effects for one year can be roughly calculated by adding up quarterly effects technically the estimates presented in the report are only mathematically accurate over small changes but this report uses 10 changes for

grangercaused gnp after 1973 he estimated that it had much smaller effect on gnp from 1973 to 1980 when the first two major oil shocks occurred hamilton was one of the first to note that oil affected gnp with lagthe effect on gnp was nearly ten times larger after four quarters than it was after two quarters g7g161g157g142g151g156g146g152g151g156g561 during the late 1980s and early 1990s standard regression specifications longer showed oil shocks to have substantial effect on economic growth several papers were written attempting to explain why using more sophisticated and complex mathematical relationships and statistical techniques knut mork was one of the first authors to find that in standard regression when extended through 1988 and controlling for other macroeconomic factors the effect of oil price changes on the growth rate of gross national product gnp was now small sand statistically insignificant 10 in the mid1980s there had been series of oil price declines and mork hypothesized that unlike oil price increases price declines had little effe ct on the economy his regressions confirmed his hypothesiswhen the distinction between price increases and decreases was made the effect of price increases on gnp growth doubled whereas price declines had small and statistically insignificant effect he estimated that 10 temporary increase in the price of oil in this quarter would lower the gnp growth rate by 031 percentage points after one quarter another 015 percentage points after two quarters 049 percentage points after three quarters and 049 percentage points after four quarters 11 lee and ratti reconfirmed that when newer data is added the effect of oil price increases on economic growth using the standard linear relationship between oil price changes and economic growth becomes statistically insignificant12 they claimed that the real oil price has not lost predictive power for growth in real gnp if appropriate account is taken of oil shocks and the variability of real oil price movement the basic idea is that an oil shock is likely to have greater impact in an environment where oil prices have been stable than in an environment where oil price

increases and decreases reduce gdp growth and these results are statistically significant 10 increase in oil prices reduces growth by cumulative 05 percentage points and surprisingly 10 price decrease reduces growth by cumulative 08 percentage points 11 balke et 2002 used statistical tests to determin what third variable statistically explained why oil price increases had larger effect on growth than price decreases they concluded that interest rates could explain the asymmetry they hypothesized that the role played by interest rates could reflect the pricing in of oil shock effects by

of as being measure of how different given oil price movement is from the prior patternp 42 in the regression along with an oil price change variable their results become statistically significant similarly ferderer believed that oil price volatility was the missing factor that could explain oils macroeconomic effects and added variable to capture volatility to his regressions that previous studies lacked13 he argued that volatility could be costly in terms of shifting resources across sectors and causing investment uncertainty he measured volatility as the standard deviation of daily prices using industrial production growth as proxy for economic growth in order to study the data over monthly intervals he found that monthly oil price changes could statistically explain 57185 of the fluctuations in industrial production and oil price volatility could explain an additional 117161 of the fluctuations by contrast monetary policy could explain only 116120 of the fluctuations in industrial production he confirmed morks findings that oil price increases had greater effect on the economy than price decreases hooker found that oil prices longer grangercause economic growth or unemployment after 1973 even though all three oil shocks occurred during this period 14 his results held for variety of structural specifications in reply to hookers work hamilton suggested that the relationship was not statistically significant after 1973 because many of the price increases since 1986 came on the heels of even larger decreases15 hamilton doubted that these types of price increases would affect the economy he devised net oil price increase variable to control for this phenomenon but still found smaller economic effects since 1973 and still did not find that his new variable the net oil price increase grangercaused economic growth hamilton has posited that the reason standard regressions do not find that oil has strong effect on economic growth is due to misspecification if the effect of oil on the economy is best represented by nonlinear mathematical relationship then standard linear regressions may pick up very weak and misleading effects in later paper hamilton demonstrated that nonlinear specifications suggest that oil has stronger effects than linear specifications 16 unfortunately since there is an infinite number of nonlinear specifications to choose from there is easy way to identify the correct one hamilton also noted that regression results may be hampered because the oil price can longer be treated as exogenous that is it can now be driven by demand or supply using the net oil price increase measure proposed in his earlier work 1996 he found that 10 increase in the price of oil when it is not following prior price decrease in the current quarter will lower gdp in the next quarter by 013 another 013 two quarters later 022 13 j peter ferderer oil price volatility and the macroeconomy journal of macroeconomics vol

effects is 02 percentage points smaller than in hamilton 198317 recent paper by jimenezrodriguez and sanchez updates morks hamiltons and lee et als respective work18 using standard vector autoregression methods the authors find that 10 increase in the oil price reduces gdp growth in the us by cumulative 039 percentage points after eight quarters using morks variation they find that 10 oil price increase reduces growth by 046 percentage points after eight quarters but 10 decrease increases growth by only 011 percentage points using hamiltons net oil price measure increases the effect of 10 price increase to 054 percentage points after eight quarters using lees method which focuses on price volatility yields the largest results the 10 price increase now reduces growth by 061 percentage points after eight quarters these results are somewhat smaller than the earlier studies had yielded problem with many of these timeseries studies is that they assume that the relationship between oil prices and gdp is constant over time but since energy use as share of gdp has fallen over time one would expect oil prices to have smaller effect on gdp as time passes huntington takes this into account and using panel data for 14 countries estimates that 10 increase in oil prices in 1998 latest year would reduce us gdp by 023 19 hooker attempted to estimate how oil shocks affect inflation when controlling for other macroeconomic variables such as unemployment and price controls20 he found that the effects of oil price increases were much greater before 1981 than after that date after 1981 he found that oil price increases had only small effect on the core inflation rate excluding food and energy as measured by the personal consumption expenditures deflator he estimated that 10 increase in the price of oil in the current quarter would lower core inflation by 1 percentage point in the next quarter and raise it by 05 percentage points two quarters after the increase thus he finds positive net effect on inflation an international monetary fund study uses vector autoregressions to estimate the effects of an oil shock on number of economic variables it estimates that 10 per barrel increase in oil prices would reduce gdp by 025 after one year with the negative effect eventually peaking at 05 of gdp relative to its baseline the effect is not statistically significant however it would raise inflation by 03 percentage points immediately with the effect falling by half after two years it 17 these results are updated in keith sill the macroeconomics of oil shocks federal reserve bank of philadelphia business review 2007q1 p 21 he finds that 10 increase in the net oil price reduces gdp an effect that peaks year and half later at about 15 of gdp the effects are only statistically significant and negative for some quarters however the author also finds that the net oil price does not have statistically significant effect on headline inflation applying these estimates to recent oil prices he calculates that gdp was 32 lower than it would have been in the absence of rising oil prices between 2004 and 2006 18 rebeca jimenezrodriguez and

the remarkable historical coincidence between oil shocks and recessions strain of research has suggested that there might nonetheless be some third force responsible for the recessions in particular the research has tried to separate the effects of the oil shocks on the economy from the effects of simultaneous changes in monetary policy some of the research has concluded that had it not been for the changes in monetary policy the oil shocks would have had little effect on economic growth in an early paper gisser and goodwin tried to capture the effects of monetary policy fiscal policy and oil price changes on economic growth inflation and unemployment 22 they measure monetary policy by the growth rate of the money supply and fiscal policy by the full employment measure of federal expenditures they estimated that 10 increase in the price of oil in the current quarter would reduce gnp growth by 02 in this quarter another 001 in the next quarter 002 after two quarters 03 after three quarters and 05 after four quarters similarly 10 increase in the price of oil is estimated to increase the inflation rate as measured by the gdp deflator by 01 this quarter and an additional 02 after one two three and four quarters 10 increase in the price of oil is estimated to increase the unemployment rate by 16 this quarter decrease unemployment by 04 after one quarter increase unemployment by 02 after two quarters 24 after three quarters and 32 after four quarters the unemployment estimates seem questionably large given the much milder estimated effects on growth monetary policy is estimated to have mu ch larger effect than the oil shocks the effect of 10 change in the money supply is estimated to be about twice as large as 10 change in the oil price for gnp and about six times as large for the price level and unemployment the effects of fiscal policy on gnp and unemployment are smaller than the effects of oil price changes although larger than the effects on the price level the authors also demonstrated that oil grangercaused gnp the price level and unemployment contrary to other studies they also found that after controlling for monetary and fiscal policy there was structural break in the oilgnp relationship after 1973 however they do confirm that there was break in the oilprice level and oilunemployment relationship dotsey and reid attempted to synthesize the work of romer and romer which claimed that contractionary monetary policy was the cause of postwar recessions with the work of hamilton surveyed above which claimed that the recessions were caused by oil shocks 23 they estimated 21 international monetary fund how will the current oil price shock affect global imbalances world economic outlook april 2006 ch 2 the estimates span the

of 07 percentage points over the next four quarters similar to mork they estimated the effects of price increases and decreases separately and found that price decreases had smaller and statistically insignificant effect on growth by contrast 1 percentage point increase in the federal funds rate was estimated to reduce gdp growth by 01 percentage points over the next four quarters they also estimated the effect of oil price increases on unemployment and found that 10 increase in oil prices would increase the unemployment rate by total of 04 percentage points over the next 24 months bernanke et were interested in finding out what effects monetary policy changes had when they were unanticipated 24 they chose to study oil shocks because these are one of the only macroeconomic phenomena that most economists would agree are both unanticipated and exogenous first they estimated the effect of 10 increase in the price of oil when monetary policy responds as it has historically they estim ated that over 24 mont hs gdp would fall by 31 and prices would rise by 009 relative to baseline to separate the effects of the oil shock from the effects of the change in monetary policy they then estimated counterfactual example where monetary policy does not respond to the oil price increase which they represented with constant federal funds rate in this case gdp was estimated to rise by 13 and prices by 013 they therefore concluded that oil price shocks have very little negative effect on the economy rather it is the monetary response to oil shocks that leads to the historical coincidence between oil shocks and recessions 25 the work of bernanke et raises an interes ting conceptual question while the effects of oil shocks and monetary policy can be statistically separated can they be separated in reality bernanke et attribute the tightening of monetary policy following oil shocks as the feds response to the increase in inflationary pressures that oil shocks are commonly believed to cause commenting on the bernanke paper sims points out that the assumption that monetary policy could remain unchanged in response to an increase in inflationary pressures is not sustainable policy and thus falls prey to the lucas critique see below it is unlikely that private individuals would have reaction to the implementation of an unsustainable policy making the statistical separation of oil price effects from monetary effects problematic 26 this would suggest that one can reasonably question whether there is practical distinction between attributing recession to an oil shock or attributing it to the monetary response to an oil shock hamilton and herrera pursue this line of reasoning in critique of the bernanke paper27 while bernankes regressions

regressions would imply that the federal funds rate would have to have been an improbable 9 percentage points lower in 1973 to prevent recession using the lucas critique it is unlikely that private individuals expectations would have remained unchanged in light of such significant policy change hamilton and herrera also argue that bernanke et underestimate the effects of oil shocks because they use too short lag length bernanke et assume that changes in oil prices affect the economy for the next seven months whereas hamilton and herrera suggest lag length of at least 12 months would be more appropriate since many works find the largest economic effects of oil price changes to come after three and four quarters in particular by using longer lag than bernanke they find that countering oil shocks with expansionary monetary policy has much larger effects on inflation since monetary policy affects inflation with significant lag

of oil shocks on employment since economic growth has strong effect on unemployment in the short run one would expect oil shocks to affect unemployment if they affect economic growth 28 carruth hooker and oswald estimated that oil shocks had larger effect on unemployment than economic growth29 they showed that oil shocks grangercaused unemployment unlike gdp30 up to the present 1995 and estimated that 10 increase in the price of oil would increase the unemployment rate by 02 percentage points although this is relatively small effect they found that the effect of oil price changes on unemployment before 1978 was more than three times larger they found that their model based on oil prices and interest rates forecasts unemployment more accurately than commercial forecasts davis and haltiwanger focused on oils effect on employment in the manufacturing sector broken down by industry 31 they hypothesize that oil price changes have distinct aggregate effects and allocative effects on manufacturing employment the aggregate effects on employment are caused by the slowdown in gdp growth that oil price increases cause the allocative effects on employment come from the fact that some industries are harmed more than othersand some are actually helpedby price increase thus some jobs are shifted from one industry to another so that the net allocative effect of an oil price change on employment is zero they found that unit standard deviation positive oil shock triggers the destruction of an extra 290000 production worker jobs and the creation of an extra 30000 jobs in the first two years after the shock after four years the net employment response to unit positive oil shock is 28 two papers already reviewed in this report investigated the effects of oil shocks on unemployment see gisser and goodwin 1986 and dotsey and reid 1992 29 alan carruth mark hooker and andrew oswald unemployment equilibria and input prices theory and evidence from the united states the

30 these results are curious since shortterm fluctuations in unemployment are usually thought to be caused by fluctuations in gdp otherwise the fluctuations would represent changes in the natural rate of unemployment and there has not been any wellknown link established between the price of oil and the natural rate of unemployment 31 steven davis and john haltiwanger sectoral job crea tion and

amounts to 410000 jobs or more than 3 percent of employment by comparison they estimated that unit standard deviation tightening in monetary policy leads to net loss of 140000 manufacturing jobs after two years looking at the data on an industry level they estimated that the effects differ greatly by industry depending on the characteristics of that industry for example categorized by the energy intensity of production the decline in employment was almost twice as large for industries in the 90 th percentile than industries in the 10th percentile because their study excluded the service sector which accounts for most employment their results cannot be meaningfully extrapolated to judge the effects of oil price changes on overall unemployment32 g21g152g150g142g561g5g138g159g142g138g157g156g561 quantitatively estimating the effect of oil shocks on the economy is more difficult than it sounds in the sciences statistical robustness is obtained by running numerous controlled randomized experiments in order to sift out randomness in the data to identify the true relationships between variables if uncertainty emerges concerning the role one factor plays one can change the experiment to isolate that factors effect in macroeconomics experiments are not controlled and they cannot be run over and over again since world war ii we have had only 10 experiments with recession and it is highly doubtful that the us economy is the same test case today as it was in say 1957 instead economists must hypot hesize the relationships between different economic factors expressed through mathematical relationships and compare the historical correlation of those variables to see if the hypothesis holds if the mathematical relationship chosen to represent the relationship is incorrect or changes over time or other variables that have an effect are missing from the regression then the estimates will be incorrect studies that attempt to identify more sophisticated relationships than the simple linear one can be accused of data mining to find the biggest or smallest effect possible there are some common pitfalls that lead to econometric studies giving biased or incorrect estimates for the relationship between variables some of these pitfalls are nearly impossible to avoid particularly in macroeconomics this report will review four such pitfallsomitted variable bias structural misspecification problems with endogeneity and the lucas critique these problems suggest that econometric estimates while useful should always be considered with caution in addition even when measured accurately there is question of statistical robustness g17g150g146g157g157g142g141g561g24g138g155g146g138g139g149g142g561g4g146g138g156g561 common problem that econometricians try to avoid is omitted variable bias if regression does not control for factor that affects ones dependent variable then the estimated effects of the explanatory variables that are included will be biased the importance of explanatory variables positively correlated with the missing variable will be overstated the importance of negatively correlated variables will be understated this is particularly important problem in economics 32 in an earlier paper loungani demonstrated that the reallocation of employment across industries led to an increase in unemployment only when the reallocation was caused by oil shocks prakash loungani oil price shocks and the dispersion hypothesis review of economics and statistics vol 68 3 august 1986 p 536

randomized in macroeconomics it is often infeasible to include all of the relevant factors in regressionthere are simply too many factors influencing the economy to capture them all most of the regressions reviewed in this report used oil and only few other key economic variables as explanatory variables yet look at the 2001 recession points to many additional factorsmany unquantifiable in naturethat hampered the us economy these include the effects of september 11 the corporate accounting scandals the large decline in the stock market and so on if these factors were not included in regression the regression would attribute their effects instead to the recent runup in oil prices and any other correlated explanatory variables overstating oils importance

relationship exists in reality likewise studies can identify relationships where relationship in fact exists regressions relate data series to one another according to some mathematical function if that mathematical function does poor job of describing the relationship in reality then the results will be artificially weak the problem is that there is an infinite number of mathematical equations that can be used to express relationship and often there is not strong theoretical reason for favoring any one as result econometricians most frequently assume linear relationship between the variables often after taking the natural logarithm of the data this assumption is made more out of convention than due to any strong reason for preferring linear relationship over any other 33 thus in most of the studies surveyed above 10 change in the oil price is estimated to have an effect that is 10 times greater than 1 change this assumption seems unlikely to represent reality accurately experience and common sense suggest that while the major oil shocks have had significant effects on the economy small and fleeting movements in the oil price have virtually impact yet linear relationship w ould scale these two events equally while theory can point to alternatives unfortunately representing the statement oil price changes only matter if they are steep sudden longlasting and do not reverse previous price movements in the opposite direction in mathematical form is neither simple nor straightforward all of the studies reviewed in this report used time series analysis to estimate the effects of oil prices time series analysis is vulnerable to special type of structural misspecification it must assume that the relationship between the explanatory variables and the dependent variable is constant over time for example 10 increase in the oil price must have the same economic effects in 1952 as it has in 2002 but if oil affects the economy through the production process oil shocks would be expected to have smaller effect on the economy if the economy became more energy efficient in terms of energy use relative to gdp historically energy consumption per dollar of gdp has dropped significantly over the past three decades with the economy now using less than half as much energy per dollar as it did in the 1970s in order to correct for such changes statistical tests are used to look for structural breaks the time series can then be divided into subsamples each estimated separately but if the series is divided the study loses degree of statistical robustness because it is based on fewer observations 33 there are many other problems of this type that make econometric estimates problematic for example the standard regression method is valid only if the error terms are assumed to be normally distributed otherwise different methods must be used

ways this makes econometric estimation difficult in the simple regression causation runs from the explanatory variables to the dependent variable for the simple regression method to be valid neither the dependent variable nor another explanatory variable nor some missing or unobserved variable can influence any explanatory variable this qualification seldom if ever holds in macroeconomics which means that more complex and less straightforward econometric methods must be used or the estimations will be invalid such methods exist but have shortcomings of their own and are not always used by the econometrician for example the exchange rate interest rates and fiscal policy all influence phenomena such as economic growth inflation and unemployment but in turn their values are determined by the very phenomena that they influence this is how markets reach equilibrium thus to determine the effects of change in monetary or fiscal policy on economic growth one cannot simply run regression in which economic growth is the dependent variable and the budget deficit and interest rates are independent variables even oil prices which might seem to be good candidate for exogeneity because of the role played by opec are likely to be endogenously determined although opec has some control over the supply si of the market price is also determined on the demand side which is influenced by factors such as growth in domestic income 34 one way of avoiding endogeneity problems in time series analysis is by using statistical method called vector autoregression which simply assumes that all variables affect each other two shortcomings have been raised with this method that are worth mentioning here first critics complain that vector autoregression is atheoretical the method eschews any attempt to identify relationships between variables in theoretical rms while this makes it more flexible method its critics argue that theory is not the same as the right theory econometrics will only lead to accurate results if the underlying theory accurately describes reality second there is tradeoff between the number of explanatory variables one can have and the number of observations with which one is working with time series data the number of observations is limited to how far back in time one is willing to go which raises another set of problems discussed in the previous subsection because all of the variables must be regressed on each other and because the use of time lags creates more variables in practice vector autoregressions can have only few explanatory variables as opposed to traditional macroeconomic models which have had as many as hundreds g14g158g140g138g156g561g5g155g146g157g146g154g158g142g561 many econometric estimations of macroeconometric phenomena fall prey to the lucas critique set out by nobel laureate robert lucas econometric estimates derived from historical data particularly when they include variables that pol icymakers can influence implicitly assume that the future will be similar to the past one of robert lucas main contributions to economics was the development of the theory of rational expectations in which he argued that contrary to much mainstream economic theory of the time economic theory should always be based on the 34 kilian argues that oil supply shocks are likely to have different effect on the economy than demand shocks and uses statistical methods to try to differentiate between the two he argues that the r ecent rise in price has been driven by demand not supply lutz killian not all oil price shocks

act rationally to maximize their self interests if people adjust their expectations when circumstances change the future is unlikely to be the same as the past thus many econometric estimates are inconsistent with rational expectations for example by looking at historical patterns one can use econometric analysis to estimate the effects of changes in the federal funds rate on economic growth for the estimated effect to be valid in forecasting future behavior one must assume that individuals do not change their behavior or learn from past mistakes taken literally this would lead to perverse predictions for example if individuals were fooled by monetary surprise ie an unanticipated and opportunistic change in monetary policy in the past this type of econometric modeling would predict that they would continue to be fooled indefinitely in the future furthermore when making predictions about the effects of policy alternatives one can assume policy variable to take any value yet if this value had occurred historically because of the role of expectations it could have changed all of the other estimated parameters in the regression if this were true the model would have little predictive power for example if policymakers had always responded to oil shocks by sharply tightening monetary policy an econometric model might suggest that oil shocks have little effect on inflation an econometrician could then use his model to demonstrate that an expansionary monetary policy could be employed to cope with oil shocks with little effect on inflation yet had this policy been employed historically expectations might have adjusted when people saw oil prices rise they would anticipate all other prices to rise to make oil shocks far more inflationary

taking estimates at face value tells only half of the story as well as worrying about the size of an estimate statisticians are concerned with its statistical robustness study may find that oil shocks have very large effect on the economy but if there is significant unexplainable variation in the sample one should be skeptical about the results this report has reported two common measures of robustness the statistical significance of specific explanatory variables and the rsquared of the study as whole statistical significance is determined by how much the sample data varies from the best estimate of the relationship between the dependent and explanatory variables an estimate is statistically significant at say the 1 confidence level if 99 out of 100 samples will be different from zer the rsquared measures how much of the variation in the dependent variable can be explained by the explanatory variable if none of the variation can be explained the rsquared would be zero if all can be explained it would be one g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 all of the studies reviewed in this report found oil shocks to have some effect on the economy there is fair degree of consensus surrounding the range of estimates for comparable studies the cumulative effect of onequarter 10 increase in oil prices was to lower economic growth by 0211 over the next four quarters compared with gdp under baseline in which the oil price does not change see table 1 the effect takes place over number of quarters with research typically finding weaker effects at first the magnitude of these estimates suggests that normal fluctuations in the price of oil would cau only minor fluctuations in economic growth however the estimates suggest that major oil shocks in which oil prices rise for several consecutive quarters often by more than 10 could lead to recessions all else equal only the

while oil shocks have historically had large negative effect on economic growth the effect is attributable to the monetary response to the shock rather than the shock itself hooker 2002 was unable to find oil to have any effect on core inflation although the magnitude of the estimates is large enough to make oil shocks policy concern the results are not statistically robust enough to silence all doubts oil prices longer grangercause economic growth in straightforward ways the effect of oil price changes on the economy was statistically insignificant in many studies some studies had low rsquared values which means that many of the determinants of economic activity remain unexplained studies which attempted to identify more sophisticated relationships than the simple linear one could be accused of data mining to find the biggest or smallest effect possible furthermore every study that explored the issue found that oils broad effects on the economy were waning and more recent studies tended to find oil to have smaller effects particularly puzzling was that many studies found oil to have stronger economic effects before the mid1970s despite the fact that all of the major oil shocks occurred since the mid1970s this report was limited to surveying studies that specifically focused on oils impact on the economy many macroeconometric studies not reviewed have focused on other determinants of economic activity such as monetary policy and have neglected the role of oil entirely it is fair to say that some economists remain unconvinced that oil plays crucial role in the business cycle all macroeconometric studies are prone to number of unavoidable pitfalls if they were reliable and if our understanding of the economy were better macroeconomic policy concerns would vanish it is not merely question of developing more sophisticated statistical techniques some pitfalls stem from the unpredictability of human nature that ultimately determines economic outcomes
