selected and reconnoitred and all must know the drill for its occupation 10202 hq protection 1 clear provision must be made for def force of unit hq at all times an ad hoc def force can be found by using the miscellaneous pers of the hq 2 often sp pl or tp or the integral sig tp has the task of hq def but this limits the pltp in its primary role compromise solution is to locate the sp pltp at unit hq so that it is part of the hq def during pltp rest periods resting subsubunits may also be located near or in unit hq the danger of all this is that the hq may grow too large with too much tfc in and out to permit proper concealment 3 on occasions it may be desirable to locate the hq near subunit for add protection but care must be taken not to create concentration that might endanger both the hq and the subunit good concealment and keeping the hq size as small as possible are also important elms of protection 4 the rsm unless otherwise dictated by the co is in charge of the hq

canada has agreed to the following nato fire support coordination measures fire support coordination line fscl fscl is line established by surface force commander to denote coordination requirements for fire by other force elements which may affect his current operations the fscl applies to fire of air ground or sea weapon systems using any type of ammunition against surface targets within an area of operations the associated surface force commander is responsible for establishing any fscl the establishment of the fscl must be coordinated with the appropriate air commander and other supporting elements attacks against surface targets short of the fscl must be conducted under the positive control or procedural clearance of the associated surface force commander commanders of forces attacking targets beyond the fscl must coordinate with all affected commanders in order to avoid fratricide and to harmonize joint objectives b fire line nfl nfl is line short of which indirect fire systems do not fire except on request or approval of the commander who established the line but beyond which they may fire at any time without danger to friendly troops the nfl is used to expedite the quick attack of targets beyond it by fire support units of higher levels without the delay of unnecessary coordination but also to guarantee that targets are attacked short of it without coordination with the responsible manoeuvre commander the commanders of division or brigade size forces normally establish the nfl on occasion the commander of battalionsized force may establish nfl c free fire area ffa ffa is specific designated area into which any weapon system may fire without additional coordination with the establishing headquarters the ffa is used to expedite fires and to facilitate the jettison of munitions when aircraft are unable to drop them on target area usually division or higher commander establishes42 bgl332001fp001the ffa it is located on identifiable terrain when possible or by grid designation when necessary d restrictive fire line rfl an rfl is line established between converging friendly forces one or both may be moving that prohibits fire or effects from fire across the line without coordination with the affected force the purpose of rfl is to prevent interference between converging friendly forces it will be established by the hq that controls both forces based on submissions from them this line is place on identifiable terrain usually closer to the stationary force restrictive fire area rfa rfa is an area in which specific restrictions are imposed and in which fire that exceeds those restrictions will not be delivered without coordination with the establishing headquarters the purpose of rfa is to regulate fire into an area according to stated restrictions rfa is established by manoeuvre battalion or larger ground forces or by an independently operating company usually it is located on identifiable terrain by grid reference or by radius in metres from centre point f fire area nfa an nfa is an area into which fires or the effects of fires are allowed the nfa is usually established by division or corps on identifiable terrain when possible the purpose of nfa is to prohibit fire or their effects in the area two exceptions are 1 when the establishing headquarters approves fire temporarily within the nfa on missionbymission basis and 2 when an enemy force within the nfa engages friendly troops the friendly force commander may engage the enemy to defend his force g airspace coordination area aca an aca is restricted area or route of travel specified for use by friendly aircraft and established for the purpose of preventing friendly aircraft from being fired on by friendly forces the purpose of the aca is to allow simultaneous attack of targets near each other by multiple fire support means one of which normally is air an aca is established by the fscc at brigade level and higher the area will be designated by timings grid references of centre line width on either side of this line and maximum and minimum altitude in feet an aca is placed on call and fire will not be delivered through it without the permission of the fscc that ordered its adoption 2 in addition to the above measures unit and formation boundaries also serve coordination function boundaries are used by the manoeuvre commander to indicate the geographical area for which particular unit is responsible they describe zone of action or sector of responsibility for manoeuvre unit normally they are designated along terrain features easily recognizable on the ground boundaries are both permissive and restrictive in nature they are restrictive in that fire may be delivered across boundary unless the fire is coordinated with the force having responsibility within theunit standard operating procedures vol 1 43boundary or unless permissive fire support coordinating measure is in effect that would allow firing without further coordination boundaries are permissive in that manoeuvre commander unless otherwise restricted enjoys complete freedom of fire and manoeuvre within his own boundaries normal unit and formation boundaries extended into enemy territory establish the lateral limits for coordination rear boundaries must also be respected summary 3 fire support is the collective and coordinated use of land and seabased indirect fire systems armed aircraft and offensive io in support of battle plan fire support involves the integration and synchronization of fire and weapon effects to delay disrupt or destroy enemy forces combat functions and facilities in order to attain operational and tactical objectives it plays key role in the dynamic forces of fixing and striking within the framework of deep close and rear operations 4 the activities of the fire support system must be closely integrated with the manoeuvre commanders concept of operations and plan the system must operate as one force and it must be responsive to the needs of the supported unit or formation commander fire support coordination which is the responsibility of the senior artillery commander enables the necessary advice planning and execution of fire support so that the right targets are attacked to achieve the manoeuvre commanders intended effects to effect the required coordination the artillery commander establishes an fscc within the operations centre of the supported unit or formation headquarters the coordination process is further refined by the use of fire support coordination measures which set conditions on the application of fire within designated areas 5 further detail on the subject of fire support may be obtained from the following reference manuals bgl371001fp0012 field artillery
