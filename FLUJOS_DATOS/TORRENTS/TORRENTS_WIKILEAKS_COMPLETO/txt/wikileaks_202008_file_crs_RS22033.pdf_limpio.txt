lightbulb that drops off considerably with increasing distance the focused beams of laser light remain quite powerful at extende d viewing distances because lasers remain powerful over large distances laser pointer can expose pilots to radiation levels above those considered to be flight safe for take offs and landings when seen from distances of up to two miles2 more powerful lasers sometime s used in outdoor light shows can distract pilots and affect vision from considerable distances for example one flight crew reported seeing afterimages after being hit by green laser from laser light show in vegas nv at the time they were flying at 31000 feet about 90 miles south of the laser source3 these higher powered laser devices can incapacitate pilots and inflict eye injuries when viewed at closer ranges the na tional transportation safety board ntsb documented two such cases in which pilots sustained eye injuries and were incapacitated during critical phases of flight4 in one of these events the pilot experienced burning sensation and tearing subsequent eye examination revealed multiple flash burns in the pilots cornea5 in few other documented incide nts pilots provided safety reports indicating that injuries were sustained from exposure to laser lights in one case copilot received burns on the outer coating of the eye and broken blood vessels6 in another incident pilot was struck several times by laser beam and was diagnosed as having burned retina7 in about dozen other cases pilots reported short term visual impairment that did not require further medical attention faa researchers have comp iled database of more than 400 incidents since 1990 in which pilots have been startled distracte d temporarily blinded or disoriented by laser exposure8 to date aviation accidents have been attributed to laser lights although there have been crashes caused by similarly debilitating glare and flashblinding from natural sunlight9 flight simulator studies conducted by

of laser illumi nation on operational and visual performance of pilots during final approachconcluded that enforcing already established limits to protect pilots from laser exposure when operating near airports provide s an adequate margin of safety10 lasers as possible terrorist weapons while none of the more than 400 incidents involving flight crew exposure to lasers over the past fifteen years has been linked to terrorism the department of homeland security and the fbi issued memo in december 2004 warning that terrorists have explored using lasers as weapons the memo indicated that while lasers are not proven methods of attack like explosives and hijackings terrorist groups overseas have expressed an interest in using these devices against human sight11 the memo went on to state that if laser weapons adversely aff ected the vision of both pilots during visual approach to landing there is pot ential risk of airliner crash the likelihood of such scenario has since been the topic of considerable speculation and debate while most would agree that incapacitating both pilots and downing an airliner by aiming handheld laser pointer into th cockpit is highly unlikely there is concern that military laser such as the chinesemade zm87 laser blinder or high powered industrial laser in the hands of terrorists could pose more significant threat there is also concern that terrorists may improvise an intense laser blinder by bundling several higher power ed handheld laser devices12 while these types of lasers may not be particularly appealing to terrorists because their effectiveness is highly uncertain they are relatively small and easy to conceal an faa report noted that laser attack could be quickly deployed and w ithdrawn leaving obvi ous collateral damage or projectile residue and would be difficult to detect and defend against the possible visual impairment startle distraction and th loss of spatial orientation created by such an attack could make landing an aircraft difficult at best13 while protecting aircraft against such attacks is daunting challeng several possible options are available to mitigate the risks posed by lasers possible options to mitigate f light crew exposure to lasers policymakers may consider variety of available options to mitigate the potential dangers of flight crew exposure to lasers options that may be considered include restricting the sale or use of certain laser devices amending criminal statutes associated with interfering with flight operations providing pilots with laser eye

of pilots during final approachexpanding and enforcing laser free zone s around airports and educating the public regarding the risks of lasers to aviation safety regulation of laser devices the regulation of laser devices is under the purview of the food and drug administration which establishes and enforces regulations for commercially available laser devices ba sed on safe exposure criteria derived from current medical knowledge14 lasers fall into five general categories class i class ii class iiia class iiib and class iv class i includes devices such as laser printers and dvd players that have enclosed lasers desi gned to prevent the escape of any harmful radiation class ii lase rs emit visible light and are cons idered too bright to view for extended periods but momentary viewing is not considered hazardous class iiia devices are hazardous if the beam is viewed direc tly but cannot produce reflected beam hazard unless viewed for extended periods at clos range most commonly available laser devices such as laser pointers and laser levels are either class ii or class iiia devices while fda regulations specify that lasers specifically manufactured for demonstration purposes such as entertainment artistic or advertising displays not exceed class iiia specifications this does not preclude more powerful lasers from being used in such activities furthermore alt hough not manufactured for use as legal laser pointers some class iiib lasers packaged as laser pointers can be purchased over the internet15 momentary exposure to class iiib laser can cause eye damage more powerful classiv lasers used in research medical indus trial and military applications can pose fire hazards damage skin and can cause significant eye damage even when viewed indirectly various safety precautions including eye protection are needed when working around these devices while not widely available these powerful lasers c ould potentially be used as terrorist weapon to attempt to incapacitate flight crew while official conclusions have been dr awn the recent rash of laser incidents may be attributable in part to the increasing availability and reduced cost of green laser pointers green lasers pose particular hazard s to pilots because they are perceived to be about 35 times brighter than equi valently powered red lasers due to the fact that humans are so much more sensitive to green light 16 one policy option that may be considered is whether to apply different standards fo r laser output based on the color wavelength emitted by the device current standards treat the output uniformly across the visible spectrum despite the fact that humans are much more sensitive to green light another option is to restrict the sale or tablish tighter controls on the use of certain laser devices the united kingdom restricted sales of class iiia laser pointer devices in response to several incidents involvi ng lasers direct ed at aircraft17 imposing similar ban or even more limited restrictions in the united states could pose significant challenges because these devices are widely available at low cost and are used in variety of applications such as laser pointers laser levels and laser gun sightshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22033crs5 18 title 18 us code 32 19 ronald smothers new jersey man pleads guilty in shining of laser at small jet the new york

etary of transportation norman mineta announces new laser warningrelevant criminal statutes besides regulating the availability and use of laser devices criminal statutes pertaining to the interference with flight crews may serve to deter malicious use of laser vices against flight crews malicious use of laser device that interferes with flight crew may be prosecuted under cr iminal

known case of its kind new jersey man pleaded guilty to violating this statute during december 2004 incident involving gr een laser pointer aimed at charter jet19 while existing federal terrorism statutes and various state statutes have been applied in cases involving lasers aimed at aircraft wmakers may consider whether specific statutes regarding malicious use of laser devices are needed or whether language is needed to prohibit certain outdoor uses of lasers on december 12 2005 the house passed the securing aircraft cockpits against lasers act of 2005 hr 1400 bill that would establish aiming laser pointer at an aircraft or its flight path as criminal offense punishable by fines of up to 250000 and imp risonment of up to five years laser eye protection the use of protective eye wear is strongly recommended to prevent eye injuries whenever there is probable risk of exposure to laser light20 however applying this recommendation to pilo ts may not be practical because lasers are available in variety of colors it may be difficult to find single solution that can provide eye protection against all laser th reats without significantly impeding vision including the ability to view cockpit displays and see certain aviationspecific lighting colors such as red obstruction lights an lternative approach is to equip aircraft with protective glare shields capable of signifi cantly reducing the brightness of laser shined into the cockpit however identifying an optical filter for use as glare shield that can protect against laser threats across multiple colors without sacrificing some capability to view the outside visual scene particularly at night may prove difficult while laser protective glare shields could be mounted on roll up shades or pull down visors and relatively easily installed they may be more costly than protective eye wear however they would not block the pilots view of co ckpit displays and ther efore may have some advantages over protective eye wear the military is researching the use of special visors whose lightblocking filters would only activate when laser threat is detected for the moment the dot has indicated that given the relatively small number of laser light incidents there is specific need to require protective eye equipment for pilots at this time21 however congress may consider whether further study to identify effective laser eye protection is warranted and under what ci rcumstances pilots may require laser eye protection enhancing and enfo rcing laser free zones around airports in 1995 the faa responded to growing concerns over ser light shows by defining flight safehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22033crs6 22 federal aviation administration faa order 74002e procedures for handling airspace matters ch 29 outdoor laser op erations june 3 2004 23 federal aviation administration advisory circular 702 reporting of laser illumination of aircraftexposure levels to lasers in specific z ones around airports the faa based these standards on the potential for temporary visual impairment from laser exposure relying on historic safety data scientific research and consultation with laser and aviation safety experts the faa established three airsp ace flight zones around airports for mitigating laser exposure 1 sensitive flight zones 2 critical flight zones and 3 laser free zones22 these zones were established as guidelines for evaluating the potential impact of outdoor laser usage working with laser operators to mitigate potential interference with aviation operations and notifying pilots regarding ser activity the laser free zone extends out 2 miles from each runway in all directions and also includes 5000 footwide strips extending 3 miles from the approach and depa rture end of each runway exposure from laser activity in these areas is to be restricted to level that would not cause any visual disruption these standards preclude the use of class iiia laser pointers in laser free zones however the widespread availability of these devices poses significant challenges to enforcing compliance options to further protect flight crews during critical phases of flight might include the promulgation of specific regulations or laws prohibiting or restricting the outdoor use of lasers in desi gnated laser free zones policymakers may also consider whether expanding the size of laser free zones around ai rports could further mitigate potential laser hazards in january 2005 responding to growing concer ns over lasers shined at aircraft the faa issued an advisory to pilots urging them to immediately report suspected laser illumination of their aircraft23 the advisory provides pilots with specific notification and reporting instructions designed to aid law enforcement in investigating laser incidents and the faa in issuing timely warnings to other pilots from homeland security perspective airport perimeter security patrols and surveillance could help to deter and detect laser attacks however preempting terrorist attack using lasers would likely be difficult because laser would be virtually unde tectable until shined at an aircraft and even then may be difficult to spot from th ground also given that takeoff and landing patterns extend for seve ral miles beyond the air port perimeter rather large area would have to be patrolled fo r this reason neighborhood watch programs in areas underlying flight paths could be of potential benefit in spotting and reporting suspicious activities public education product warning labels and product information shipped with laser devices could be enhanced to specifica lly warn of the dangers these devices pose to aviation safety while cu rrent product labeling on lasers inform operators of the eye hazards posed by lasers there may be widely held mispercepti ons that lasers cannot affect pilots vision because of the large distances the beam travels before reaching the aircraft the general public may also lack full appreciation for the visual demands during critical phases of flight and the poten tial consequences of visual distractions in the cockpit besides conveying this information in ma terials shipped with laser products such information could also be disseminated through public awareness campaigns additionally public education materials could convey strong messages regarding available criminal penalties and potential legal consequences of using lasers to maliciously target aircraft
