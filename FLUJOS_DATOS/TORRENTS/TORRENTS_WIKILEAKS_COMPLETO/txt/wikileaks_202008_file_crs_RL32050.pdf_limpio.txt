teacher recruitment challenges belmont ma recruiting new teachers inc 2000teacher recruitment and retention federal state and local programs introduction the recruitment and retention of high quality teaching force is critical to the future success of our nations sc hool system to address this issue very wide range of programs have been put into place at the federal state and local levels in recent years as congress works to reauthorize the higher education act hea this issue promises to be majo r part of the debate1 although there is widespread agreement that the nation has teacher supply problem learned observers disagree over whether the problem is matter of general shortage of qualified teachers or an uneven social and spacial distribution of good teachers since the early 1980s some researcher s have warned of coming teacher shortage driven by demographic change s that would simultaneously increase school enrollment and teacher retirement other analysts argue that an additional or perhaps more important factor contributing to the difficulty in staffing k12 teaching positions has been the rapid turnover of newly hired teachers in hardtostaff schools2 current estimates suggest that overa ll about onethird of teachers leave the profession within five years of being hired however in certain schools the five year attrition rate reaches 503 thus many policymakers posit that solutions to the teacher staffing problem 1 make as great an effort as possible to retain as to recruit new teachers and 2 make an extra effo rt in schools suffering the greatest loss of newly hired teachers in addition to the federal programs in the hea and elementary and secondary education act esea many policies and programs designed to address teacher recruitment and retention have been initiated at the state and local levels as well as by private foundations the purpose of this report is to review the range of current efforts nationwide and provide context fo r the issues that may arise during hea reauthorization description of current federal programs w ill be followed by review of nonfederal programs w ith over 14000 schools districts across thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32050crs2 4 voluntary credential available to teachers who possess bachelors degree and state teaching license and have taught for at least three yearscountry it is difficult to catalogue every prog ram in existence thus the goal of this review is to cover the major state policie s in existence and provide description of how selected programs work at the local level taxonomy of teacher recruitment and retention programs the federal programs desc ribed below provide significant amount of funds approximately 41 b illion in fy2005 in support of broad array of t eacher recruitment and retention programs the spectrum of activities allowed under the federal programs encompasses most if not all of the activities discussed in the review of nonfederal programs indeed some of the programs described in the nonfederal section of this report receive federal funds before getting into the descriptions of these programs brief ove rview of teacher recr uitment and retention programs may be useful recruitment efforts can be generally divided between 1 programs that try to attract individuals who are not currently considering career in teaching and 2 programs that provide incentives designed to influence job choice and professional development among those alr eady in or about to enter the teaching profession the first category of programs target either high school and college students or midcareer professionals who are not currently teach ing these efforts may involve early intervention in career choice such as familia rizing high school juniors and seniors with the teaching profession or later intervention in career change such as providing financial incentives andor alternate routes to teacher certification the second category of recruitment progra ms targets either students in teacher education programs or currently employed educational professionals both teachers and teachers aides some times called paraprof essionals since these programs are dealing with people who have already chosen teaching career they create incentives primarily financial in nature intended to guide the course of that career such as obtaining nati onal board certification4 taking job in hardtostaff school or completing an unfinished or advanced teaching degree program retention policies can also be divided into two types 1 those which are directly tied to recruitment policy and 2 standalone programs the best example of the former are scholarship programs that have service requirement for example such programs may provide co llege seniors with money to stay for fifth year of schooling in order to complete teacher education program in return recipients are required to work for specified number of years perhaps in subject areas experiencing an acute shortage or in hardtostaff schools an example of standalone policy is an induction program that attempts to give new teachers mentoring and other support during their first few years of teaching this induction may be related to recruitment fforts in that it may follow certain preservice activities such as summer training however it need nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32050crs3

additional 10 of the statewide average teacher salary south carolina and mississippi 7500 and 6000 annual supplemen ts respectively and california onetime 10000 bonus plus 20000 for teachers in
