iraq former regime weapons programs human rights violations and us policy summary after asserting that iraq had failed to comply with security council resolutions that required iraq to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction wmd the bush administration began military action against iraq on march 19 2003 and the regime of saddam hussein fell on april 9 since then us teams have been attempting to find wmd and the pre2003 war state of wmd production programs only minor finds of actual wmd have been made thus far and major report september 30 2004 by us experts performing postwar wmd searches the duelfer report has concluded that prewar us assessments of iraqs wmd capabilities were mostly incorrect but that analysis of saddams wmd intentions was probably accurate part of the prewar debate over us policy centered on whether iraqs wmd programs could be ended through weapons inspections during 19911998 special commission on iraq unscom made considerable progress in dismantling and monitoring iraqs wmd but was unable to verify iraqs claim that it had destroyed all its wmd and related equipment iraqs refusal of full cooperation with unscom eventually prompted usbritish military action series of air strikes designated as operation desert fox in december 1998 all inspectors withdrew and iraq was largely uninspected during 19982002 leaving uncertainty as to the status of iraqs wmd programs at the start of military action in 2003 many of the questions about those programs remained unresolved security council resolution 1483 adopted may 22 2003 lifted sanctions on iraq and provided for the possibility that inspectors could return to iraq although the united states not the united nations has conducted the postwar wmd searches on november 10 1994 iraq accepted undesignated land border with kuwait confirmed by resolution 833 as well as kuwaiti sovereignty the border monitoring effort begun after the 1991 gulf war ended after the 2003 war prior to the start of the 2003 war iraq did not detail the fate of about 600 kuwaitis still missing from the first gulf war and did not return all kuwaiti property taken usled teams in iraq have resolved some cases of missing kuwaitis since the fall of saddam saddam husseins regime was widely deemed noncompliant in other areas especially human rights issues he and his close associates are now undergoing legal proceedings that will lead to their trial on crimes against humanity since the fall of the regime us teams have confirmed at least 50 mass graves containing primarily shiites and kurds that saddam hussein had characterized as threat to the regime this report will be updated as warranted by developments please see crs report rl31339 iraq us regime change efforts and postsaddam governance

human rights violations and us policy saddam husseins regime had been considered threat to us interests since its august 2 1990 invasion of kuwait although there had been disagreements within the us government over whether that threat could be managed through containment the administration of george w bush asserted the threat could not be contained and needed to be removed militarily in an operation to change iraqs regime and replace it with democratic government in response to iraqs invasion of kuwait security council resolution 678 november 29 1990 authorized the use of force to expel iraq from kuwait the united states put together coalition consisting of about 500000 us personnel and 225000 nonus personnel from 35 nations of which about 100000 were from arabislamic nations the united states incurred about 611 billion in incremental costs of operation desert storm january 16 february 28 1991 which liberated kuwait but foreign contributors offset almost about 54 billion of the us costs saudi arabia kuwait and the united arab emirates contributed about 37 billion of that figure in the 2003 war to overthrow saddam hussein operation iraqi freedom oif us personnel in the invasion force were about 230000 joined by over 20000 forces from 34 other nations foreign nations pledged cash reimbursements to offset us incremental costs of oif after the 1991 war ceasefire was declared in security council resolution 686 march 2 1991 more permanent ceasefire resolution was security council resolution 687 april 3 1991 which required iraq in return for graduated easing of sanctions to end its weapons of mass destruction programs recognize kuwait account for missing kuwaitis return kuwaiti property and end support for terrorism iraq accepted the resolution iraq was required by resolution 688 april 5 1991 to end repression of its people in forty reviews at 60day intervals of iraqi compliance from the end of the gulf war in 1991 until august 20 1998 the security council maintained the comprehensive international sanctions on iraqs imports and exports imposed by security council resolution 661 august 6 1990 after the breakdown of the original weapons inspections regime in december 1998 two additional major resolutions 1284 of december 17 1999 and 1441 of november 8 2002 were adopted in an effort to resume disarmament efforts including resolution 1441 total of 17 resolutions required iraqs complete dismantlement of its wmd programs crs2 history of weapons inspections from april 1991 until december 1998 special commission unscom and the international atomic energy agency iaea attempted to verify that iraq had ended all its prohibited wmd programs and to establish longterm monitoring program of wmd facilities resolution 715 october 11 1991 the monitoring program accepted by iraq in november 1993 consisted of visitations and technical surveillance of about 300 sites under resolution 1051 march 27 1996 weapons inspectors monitored at point of entry and at enduse destination iraqs imports of any dual use items confrontations over access to suspected wmd sites began almost as soon as unscom began operations in april 1991 prompting adoption of resolution 707 august 15 1991 requiring unfettered access to all sites and disclosure by iraq of all its wmd suppliers during march 1996 october 1997 iraq impeded inspectors from entering iraqi security service and military facilities and it interfered with some unscom flights these actions which were not resolved by march 1996 side agreement between unscom and iraq governing prenotification of inspections of defense and security sites prompted resolution 1060 june 12 1996 and other council statements such as on june 13 1997 demanding iraqi cooperation resolution 1115 june 21 1997 threatened travel restrictions against iraqi officials committing the infractions and resolution 1134 october 23 1997 again threatened travel ban and suspended sanctions reviews until april 1998 19971998 crises six days after that vote iraq barred american unscom personnel from conducting inspections and two weeks later expelled american inspectors in response resolution 1137 november 12 1997 imposed travel restrictions on iraqi officials on november 13 1997 the house adopted hres 322 backing unilateral us military action as last resort the senate did not act on similar resolution sconres 71 because some senators wanted it to call for the united states to overthrow saddam hussein in november 1997 and february 1998 russia and secretary general kofi annan respectively brokered temporary compromises that enabled unscom to resume inspections the february 23 1998 uniraq agreement provided for access to eight presidential sites by inspectors and diplomats resolution 1154 march 2 1998 accepted that agreement threatening the severest consequences if iraq reneged iraq allowed presidential site inspections 1058 buildings during march 26april 3 1998 the travel ban on iraqi officials was lifted and sanctions reviews resumed iraq subsequently refused to implement an unscom plan for completing its work and in august 1998 restricted inspections the senate and house passed resolution sjres 54 pl 105235 signed august 14 1998 declaring iraq in material breach of the ceasefire the security council adopted resolution 1194 september 9 1998 demanding full unfettered inspections access and suspending sanctions reviews on october 30 1998 the security council offered an easing of sanctions if iraq resumed full cooperation with unscom but iraq demanded an immediate end to sanctions and ceased cooperation with unscom but not the iaea the security council adopted resolution 1205 november 5 1998 deeming the iraqi action flagrant violation of the february 1998 uniraq crs3 agreement on november 14 1998 with the united states about to launch airstrikes iraq pledged cooperation averting strikes but prompting president clinton to openly declare us policy of regime change operation desert fox and resolution 1284 after month of testing iraqs cooperation unscom reported on december 15 1998 that iraq was still obstructing its work all inspectors withdrew and 70hour us and british bombing campaign followed operation desert fox december 1619 1998 directed against iraqi wmdcapable facilities and military and security targets in an attempt to persuade iraq to allow resumption of inspections after almost one year of negotiations the security council adopted resolution 1284 december 17 1999 by vote of 11 0 russia france china and malaysia abstained it provided subject to vote of the security council for the suspension of most sanctions if iraq fully cooperates with new wmd inspection body unmovic monitoring verification and inspection commission the resolution called for inspectors to determine within 60 days of reentering iraq what wmd tasks remain and to issue reports every three months in january 2000 former iaea director hans blix was named head of unmovic in the absence of iraqs agreement to allow incountry inspections during 19992002 unmovics staff of about 60 all employees of the united nations and not their individual governments reviewed wmdrelated documents and imagery interviewed informants and scrutinized civilian imports to ensure that sensitive technologies entered iraq without approval axis of evil and us policy after the september 11 2001 attacks on the united states there was debate over whether to expand the postseptember 11 war on terrorism to iraq based largely on concerns that iraq might use wmd against the united states or provide wmd to terrorist groups on december 20 2001 the house passed hjres 75 by vote of 39212 calling iraqs refusal to readmit inspectors material breach of its international obligations and mounting threat to peace and security the resolution not taken up in the senate did not explicitly authorize us military action in earlymid 2002 the bush administration began to build case that the united states must act preemptively to change iraqs regime assertions that iraq possessed wmd and had active ties to terrorist groups including qaeda formed the core of the administration case for invading iraq however in several speeches senior administration officials including the president maintained that regime change would end horrific regime human rights abuses and pave the way for democracy in iraq that would spread throughout the region and deprive terrorist groups of fertile ground for recruitment after an internal debate the administration decided to work through the security council to give iraq final opportunity to cooperate with inspections in september 12 2002 speech before the united nations president bush implicitly threatened us military action unilateral if necessary if the united nations did not enforce existing resolutions on iraq four days later iraq pledged to admit unmovic inspectors without conditions reversing position taken during several meetings with the united nations in early 2002 on october 11 2002 congress completed work on resolution hjres 114 pl 107243 authorizing the use of us armed forces against iraq the resolution was adopted by vote of 296133 in the house and 7723 in the senate crs4 resolution 1441 after several weeks of negotiations on november 8 2002 the security council unanimously adopted resolution 1441 that 1 declared iraq in material breach of preexisting resolutions 2 gave iraq until december 8 2002 to provide full declaration of all wmd programs 3 required new inspections to begin by december 23 4 declared all sites including presidential sites subject to unfettered inspections 5 gave unmovic the right to interview iraqis in private including taking them outside iraq and to freeze activity at suspect site 6 forbade iraq from taking hostile acts against any country upholding resolutions provision that appeared to cover iraqs defiance of the fly zones and 7 provided for the security council to consider how to respond to iraqi non compliance this was interpreted by france and some other countries as requiring second resolution to authorize force although the united states disputed that interpretation iraq accepted the resolution on november 13 2002 in defiant letter and inspections began on november 27 2002 blix said the inspectors received full access in their inspections of about 450 sites over 300 by unmovic and 140 by the iaea on december 7 2002 iraq submitted its required declaration but after comparing the iraqi declaration to us intelligence assessments the bush administration said shortly thereafter that there were material omissions that constituted further material breach of iraqs obligations blix criticized the declaration as offering little new information but he did not call it material breach in briefings on the inspections to the security council on january 27 february 14 and march 7 2003 blix and iaea head mohammad baradei said that iraq had not fully complied with resolution 1441 but that iraq had been providing more active cooperation after february 2003 and that there had been some substantive disarmament destruction of samoud ii missiles maintaining that the inspections process would not lead to iraqs full disarmament the united states britain and spain called for security council vote on resolution to set short deadline for iraq to clearly demonstrate full cooperation and voluntary disarmament or face use of force after few weeks of unsuccessful diplomacy on march 17 2003 the three countries withdrew their draft resolution that night president bush issued an ultimatum for saddam hussein and his sons uday and qusay to leave iraq or face military action at the same time secretary general annan ordered the inspectors out of iraq saddam rebuffed the ultimatum and on march 19 us military action operation iraqi freedom began on april 9 2003 the regime vacated baghdad postwar wmd search with all of iraq under the control of usled forces as of midapril 2003 us militaryled mobile exploitation team met began to search for and catalogue any wmd uncovered after about month of operations the teams announced confirmed finds of wmd stockpiles although they did discover chemical weapons protection equipment and some other equipment in may 2003 the met turned over its mission to larger about 1500 personnel iraq survey group isg the isg is led by the us military the groups head is brig general joseph mcmenamin who replaced majgen keith dayton in july 2004 but consists partly of civilian technical experts including some from other countries who served in previous inspection missions in iraq the chief wmd investigator of the group holds the title of special advisor to the director of central crs5 intelligence on iraqs wmd1 the first special advisor was former unscom nuclear inspector david kay he was replaced in january 2004 by former unscom deputy chief charles duelfer the isg is also tasked with uncovering information on the relationship if any between saddam husseins regime and qaeda and cataloguing findings of mass graves and other human rights abuses by the saddam regime unmovic is still in existence but neither it nor the iaea have been given formal role in the postconflict wmd search in iraq even though both bodies have said they would like to assume postwar role to formally complete the disarmament work in iraq begun in 1991 for the first few months after saddams fall the search effort focused on investigating and exploiting about 1000 previously suspected wmd sites process that yielded few results after that time the isg focused on identifying and interviewing iraqis who could provide information on previously unknown sites and documents or who had direct knowledge of iraqs wmd programs on october 2 2003 kay visited washington to present to members and others the highlights of his interim progress report the major findings which did not include an announcement of findings of weapons but did say evidence of hidden programs was found were presented in his congressional testimony2 in late october 2003 press reports said the administration was shifting some personnel and other resources from the wmd search to counterinsurgency missions against an increasingly active and sophisticated resistance kay has said this shift of resources contributed to his decision to resign before completing the wmd search3 in congressional testimony senate armed services on january 28 2004 kay referred to the failure to find actual wmd weapons saying us prewar intelligence on iraqs wmd was almost all wrong and adding that it is highly unlikely that there were large stockpiles of deployed militarized chemical and biological weapons in iraq he also testified that iraq concealed information and activities and therefore clearly violated resolution 1441 and that iraq certainly had the intentions at point to resume their programs on march 30 2004 duelfer briefed the senate intelligence committee and the senate armed services committee on the continuing wmd search effort he told members that the isg had made new breakthroughs but that some new information suggested that iraq might have been developing capability to make wmd on short notice he also said that the isg would focus on iraqs intentions 1 the title of the position is the director of central intelligences special advisor for wmd in iraq 2 statement by david kay on the interim progress report on the activities of the iraq survey group before the house permanent select committee on intelligence the house committee on appropriations subcommittee on defense and the senate select committee on intelligence 3 zakaria tabassum us weapons hunter wont return to iraq reuters news wire jan 15 2004 crs6 and the whole range of questions about what happened to iraqs wmd programs4 blix who retired from unmovic on june 30 2003 has since criticized the united states for being impatient about his mission and in his view failing to weight intelligence information that contradicted the prevailing us judgment on iraqs wmd three us personnel from the isg were killed in bombing in late april 2004 as they were investigating tip on hidden chemical facility september 30 2004 isg report5 on september 30 2004 the isg released its comprehensive report referred to heretofore as the duelfer report on its findings based on its work in iraq since the fall of saddam the report largely restated previous isg findings that iraq lacked actual wmd stockpiles and production efforts but retained the intention to erode and evade international sanctions to position itself to eventually resume wmd production according to the report saddam believe that iran remained vital threat to iraqs national survival and that wmd could deter iran and that the us perception that iraq retained wmd could deter potential us attack on iraq the report detailed saddam regime efforts to use loopholes in the unrun oilforfood program and other trade agreements to buy political support around the world for the lifting of sanctions and to procure dual use items that could be used to resume wmd efforts the specific findings of the duelfer report in each wmd category are discussed in the corresponding sections below the duelfer reports findings on the alleged abuses of the oilforfood program will be discussed in crs report rl30472 iraq oilforfood program international sanctions and illicit trade postwar falloutinvestigations the early isg findings coupled with the apparent discrepancy between prewar assertions and ontheground wmd findings prompted number of inquiries shortly after the fall of saddam hussein then cia director george tenet said the cia had begun to compare its prewar intelligence to actual ontheground wmd findings on wmd to determine the quality of the pre war assessments the us intelligence communitys assessment of iraqs prewar wmd was outlined in an october 2002 white paper entitled iraqs weapons of mass destruction programs referred to below as the cia white paper which was based on classified national intelligence estimate nie there have been six inquiries andor research efforts into prewar intelligence on iraq including the internal cia inquiry and an inquiry announced by the bush administration february 2 2004 by separate ninemember bipartisan commission to look into us intelligence performance on iraq iran libya and north korea that commission headed by former senator charles robb and appeals court judge laurence silberman has begun meeting and is to report its findings in march 2005 the congressional inquiries include the senate intelligence committee the senate armed services committee and majority and minority inquiry at the house 4 pincus walter weapons inspector testifies on hill suspected iraqi bid to produce arms on short notice noted washington post march 31 2004 5 comprehensive report of the special advisor to the director of central intelligence on iraqs weapons of mass destruction the text of the nearly 1000 page report can be found at httpnewsfindlawcomhdocsdocsiraqcia93004wmdrpthtml crs7 intelligence committee report by the senate intelligence committee product of that committees inquiry was released july 9 2004 it was highly critical of the intelligence communitys prewar assessments6 citing the community for misinterpreting ambiguous evidence to fit preconceived presumption about iraqs wmd group think p18 the report said the committee did not find evidence that administration officials pressured cia analysts to skew their judgments and the report did not examine how senior policymakers portrayed or used the intelligence assessments the report also asserted that the intelligence community suffered from lack of sources close to the regime and relied too heavily on information from iraqi exiles who had an interest in whether the united states took military action against saddam hussein some senior officials including secretary of state powell and then cia director george tenet in speech given at georgetown university february 5 2004 available online at httpwwwciagovciapublic_affairsspeeches have cited information from the isgs october 2003 interim report to assert that wmd programs were present in prewar iraq and that us prewar intelligence was not necessarily completely wide of the mark late october 2003 press report quoted general james clapper head of the national imagery and mapping agency as expressing his own view that iraq might have moved some wmd materiel to syria prior to the march 2003 start of the war although other us officials have presented evidence to credit that theory7 some believe that the few chemical munitions found in iraq since may 2004 discussed further below might yet demonstrate that iraq had more substantial wmd stockpiles although the duelfer report casts doubt on that possibility the failure to find substantial wmd in iraq has led to renewed debate over the justification for the 2003 invasion secretary of state powell told journalists on february 2 2004 that he does not know whether he would have recommended invasion of iraq had he known what he now knows about the state of iraqs wmd programs8 and he has since pressed the cia to account for why the information given him for his february 5 2003 presentation has proved wide of the mark most other senior officials including the president say that the duelfer reports findings that saddam retained intentions to restart wmd programs provides justification for the war the following summarizes outstanding issues on iraqs wmd us assessments and us postwar findings 6 report of the select committee on intelligence on the us intelligence communitys prewar intelligence assessments on iraq july 9 2004 7 jehl douglas iraqis removed arms material us aide says new york times oct 29 2003 8 kessler glenn powell arms doubts might have affected view on war washington post feb 3 2004 crs8 nuclear program from 19922003 successive administrations asserted that iraq retained the expertise about 7000 scientists and engineers and intention to rebuild its nuclear program the cia white paper said that iraq if left unchecked probably will have nuclear weapon during this decade the white paper pointed to iraqs efforts to procure aluminum tubes that could be used in nuclear weapons program iaea chief mohammad baradei said march 7 2003 that the iaea believed the tubes were for use in conventional rocket programs although their importation was not legal under the international sanctions regime then cia director tenet asserted in february 2004 that the issue of aluminum tube procurement is still open because the tubes found thus far do not match precise iraqi specifications another allegation contained in president bushs january 2003 state of the union speech but not in the white paper said iraq had tried to buy large quantities of uranium from africa niger but the iaea said in march 2003 report that documents alleging this procurement of uranium from niger were not authentic the white house stated in july 2003 that the allegation should not have been included in the state of the union speech because of cia doubts about that information although some british officials maintain that the allegation may still be valid the iaea said on january 27 2003 that it had found evidence iraq had restarted nuclear program repeating that assessment on march 7 2003 during 19911994 despite iraqs initial declaration that it had nuclear weapons facilities or unsafeguarded material unscomiaea uncovered and dismantled previouslyundeclared network of about 40 nuclear research facilities including three clandestine uranium enrichment programs electromagnetic centrifuge and chemical isotope separation as well as laboratoryscale plutonium separation program inspectors found and dismantled in 1992 iraqs nuclear weapons development program and they found evidence of efforts to develop radiological weapon dirty bomb which could scatter nuclear material unscom removed from iraq all discovered nuclear reactor fuel fresh and irradiated following the defection of hussein kamil saddams soninlaw and former wmd production czar in august 1995 iraq revealed it had launched crash program in august 1990 to produce nuclear weapon as quickly as possible by diverting fuel from its reactors for nuclear weapon the iaea report of december 1 1995 said that if its crash program had succeeded iraq estimated it might have been able to assemble nuclear explosive device by december 1992 in 1997 the iaea said that iraqs nuclear program had been ended and that it had relatively complete picture of iraqs nuclear suppliers may 15 1998 security council statement reflected usrussian agreement to close the nuclear file if iraq cleared up outstanding issues nuclear design drawings documents and the fate of some nuclear equipment an iaea report of july 1998 indicated that some questions still remained and the united states did not agree to close the file in may 2000 the iaea destroyed nuclear centrifuge that iraq had stored in jordan in 1991 in january 2002 as it had in each of the past three years iaea inspectors verified that several tons of uranium remained sealed acting under iraqs commitments under the 1968 nuclear nonproliferation treaty crs9 postwarduelfer report findings the september 30 2004 duelfer report largely reiterated but also expanded on early findings released by the isg the duelfer report said the isg had discovered further evidence of the maturity and significance of the pre1991 iraqi nuclear program but found that iraqs ability to reconstitute nuclear weapons program progressively decayed after that date and that the isg found evidence to suggest concerted efforts to restart the program the report adds that the isg found limited number of post1995 activities that would have aided the reconstitution of the nuclear weapons program once sanctions were lifted the report referred specifically to regime efforts to retain nuclear scientific talent in their jobs there were some unconfirmed press reports in october 2004 that equipment from iraqs nuclear sites was looted after the fall of the regime raising questions about whether or not us forces had properly secured the sites as the regime fell in april 2003 chemical weapons during its 19911998 tenure unscom destroyed all chemical weapons materiel uncovered 38500 munitions 480000 liters of chemical agents 18 million liters of precursor chemicals and 426 pieces of production equipment items the destruction operation formally ended on june 14 1994 in february 1998 unscom discovered that shells taken from iraq in 1996 contained 97 pure mustard gas indicating it was freshly produced however the fate of about 31600 chemical shells and 550 mustard gas bombs remains unknown unscoms main outstanding chemical weapons questions centered on vx nerve agent which iraq did not include in its initial 1991 declarations and of which stockpile was ever located iraq did not prove it destroyed the chemical precursors by 1995 unscom had uncovered enough circumstantial evidence to force iraq to admit to producing about 4 tons of vx but unscom believed that iraq had imported enough precursor about 600 tons to produce 200 tons of the agent in late june 1998 unscom revealed that some unearthed missile warheads tested in us army lab contained traces of vx contradicting iraqs assertions that it had not succeeded in stabilizing the agent separate french and swiss tests did not find conclusive evidence of vx in march 2003 iraq proposed technical method to prove its assertions that it destroyed its vx in 1991 about 170 chemical sites were under monitoring iraq did not sign the chemical weapons convention effective april 29 1997 the october 2002 cia estimate said iraq is expanding its infrastructure under cover of civilian industries that it could use to advance its chemical weapons agent production capability and that the totality of evidence strongly suggest that iraq maintains stockpile of chemical agents probably vx sarin cyclosarin and mustard british assessment released september 2002 said iraq had distributed chemical weapons to its field units and could deploy chemical weapons on 45 minutes notice in january 2003 during the prewar round of inspections unmovic found 16 chemical artillery munitions believed empty iraq included an iraqi air force document in its december 7 2002 declaration that indicated that 6500 chemical bombs were unaccounted for 13000 bombs the document says were used versus 19500 bombs iraq previously said were used an unmovic workplan crs10 submitted march 7 2003 said unmovic had found in iraq previously undeclared cluster munitions that could deliver chemical or biological agents postwarduelfer report findings within weeks of beginning their searches of postsaddam iraq us teams found chemical weapons protection gear and antidote vaccinations atropine but chemical weapons stockpiles or precursor materials were found casting substantial doubt on the british assertion that chemical weapons had been distributed to field units in may 2004 insurgents attempted to detonate munitions against us forces munitions that were subsequently determined to contain sarin nerve agent and mustard gas at least dozen additional shells containing chemical weapons were discovered in june and july 2004 by polish troops some of the shells contained cyclosarin nerve agent far stronger than sarin the origin of the munitions is not known but they are believed by many experts to be left over shells from the iraniraq war or other munitions not discovered by 19912003 arms inspections us officials continue to be concerned that iraqs insurgents are seeking chemical munitions left in iraq and technical assistance from iraqi technicians who were involved in iraqs chemical weapons programs9 the duelfer report noted the finding of small number of old abandoned chemical munitions but added that the isg judges that iraq unilaterally destroyed its undeclared chemical weapons stockpile in 1991 and that there are credible indications that baghdad resumed production of chemical munitions thereafter policy isg attributes to baghdads desire to see sanctions lifted or rendered ineffectual or its fear of force against it should wmd be discovered the report added that iraq conservedd the knowledge base needed to restart cw chemical weapons program conduct modest amount of dualuse research and partially recover from the decline of its production capability caused by the effects of the 1991 gulf war and unsponsored destruction and sanctions according to the report iraqs historical ability to implement simple solutions to weaponization challenges allowed iraq to retain the capability to weaponize cw agent when the need arose biological weapons according to unscom there were more unresolved questions about iraqs biological weapons than about any other wmd category unscom said it considered iraqs biological declarations during 19911998 neither credible nor verifiable iraq did not initially 1991 declare any biological materials weapons research or facilities and biological weapons stockpile was ever uncovered unscom focused its investigation initially on the major biological research and development site at salman pak but iraq partially buried that facility shortly before the first inspections began in august 1991 iraq admitted that it had biological weapons research program 9 gertz bill iraqi insurgents seek saddams chemical arms washington times june 25 2004 crs11 in july 1995 iraq modified its admission by acknowledging it had an offensive biological weapons program and that it had produced 19000 liters of botulinum 8400 liters of anthrax and 2000 liters of aflatoxin clostridium and ricin according to unscom iraq imported total of 34 tons of growth media for producing biological agents during the 1980s of which 4 tons remained unaccounted for iraq did not give unscom information on its development of drop tanks and aerosol generators for biological weapons unscom had 86 biological sites under longterm monitoring unscom discovered and dismantled the hakam facility on june 20 1996 the october 2002 cia white paper said that all key aspects research and development production and weaponization of iraqs offensive biological weapons program were active and that most elements are larger and more advanced than they were before the gulf war the white paper added that iraq was developing unmanned aerial vehicles that probably could be used to deliver biological weapons very little new was

two trailers discovered in iraq in april 2003 were those purported biological labs although biological agents were found in them kay said in january 2004 that the trailers were likely used to produce hydrogen gas or possibly rocket fuel but cia director tenet said in his georgetown speech that more study is needed according to the duelfer report the isg judges that in 1991 and 1992 iraq appears to have destroyed its undeclared stocks of bw biological weapons and probably destroyed remaining holdings of bulk bw agent however isg lacks evidence to document complete destruction the report adds that the isg judges that iraqs actions between 1991 and 1996 demonstrate that the state intended to preserve its bw capability but that the isg found direct evidence that iraq after 1996 had plans for new bw program or was conducting bwspecific work for military purposes the isg also found network of labs and safehouses run by iraqs intelligence services containing biologicalcapable equipment on the specific issue of the alleged trailer bw production vehicles the duelfer report says that in spite of exhaustive investigation the isg found evidence that iraq possessed or was developing bw agent production systems mounted on road vehicles or railway wagons the report adds that the isg judges that the two trailers found were almost certainly designed and builtexclusively for the generation of hydrogen crs12 ballistic missilesuavs resolution 687 required the destruction of all iraqi ballistic missiles with range greater than 150 km after seven years of inspections unscom accounted for 817 of 819 sovietsupplied scud missiles 300 km range 130 of which survived the gulf war as well as all 14 declared mobile launchers and 60 fixed launch pads during the 1990s us analysts believed iraq might have been concealing as many as 12 scudlike missiles and that it was manufacturing propellants for missiles of ranges longer than those allowed there was also evidence of iraqi cheating on missile issues in december 1995 after jordan reported seizing 115 russianmade missile guidance components allegedly bound for iraq unscom said iraq had procured some missile components since 1991

well as 2000 permitted missiles the october 2002 cia white paper said that iraq has developed ballistic missile capability that exceeds the 150 km range limitation established by security council resolution 687 iraqs december 7 2002 declaration said some flight tests of these missiles did exceed the allowed range by about 50 km and blix ordered the destruction of the samoud about 120 missiles and related production equipment iraq began the destruction by the deadline of march 1 2003 and about half of the missile force was destroyed by the time the war started iraqs fatah program was being studied to see if its range exceeded allowed limits some of these missiles were fired by iraq into kuwait during the 2003 war although there were confirmed firings of scudrange missiles which were banned under resolution 687 most iraqi missiles fired were intercepted by us or kuwaiti patriot systems postwarduelfer report findings according to the duelfer report desert storm and subsequent resolutions and inspections brought many of iraqs delivery programs to halt and that the isg has uncovered evidence iraq retained scudvariant missiles and debriefings of iraqi officials in addition to some documentation suggest that iraq did not retain such missiles after 1991 the report adds that the isg assesses that saddam clearly intended to reconstitute long range delivery systems and that the systems potentially were for wmd according to the report iraq did develop the samoud and fatah missiles discussed above and was pursuing series of new small uav systems the report adds that the isg uncovered iraqi plans or designs for three longrange ballistic missiles with crs13 ranges from 400 to 1000 km and for 1000 km range cruise missile although none of these systems progressed to production and only one reportedly passed the design phase the report added that the isg found evidence that russian experts helped iraq develop the samoud and that iraq imported missilerelated equipment from belarus poland russia and serbia human rightswar crimes issues us and human rights reports after the 1991 gulf war repeatedly described saddam husseins regime as gross violator of human rights international organizations estimate that more than 400000 iraqis were killed by regime security forces during saddams rule but some estimates are as high as 1 million in 1994 the clinton administration said it was considering presenting case against iraq to the international court of justice under the 1948 genocide convention then rapporteur for iraq max van der stoels february 1994 report said that convention might have been violated by iraqs abuses against the shiite marsh arabs in southern iraq including drainage of the marshes where they live in february 2002 iraq allowed the human rights rapporteur for iraq andreas mavromatis of cyprus to visit iraq the first such visit since 1992 on october 20 2002 sensing the united states was trying to build case to oust him from power militarily saddam hussein granted an amnesty and released virtually all prisoners in iraq he called the move gratitude for his purported 100 victory in referendum opponent on his leadership on october 15 2002 some in the bush administration have blamed some of the postwar unrest in iraq on criminals released by saddam during this amnesty us state department documents also discuss reports of women who were raped by iraqi personnel while in custody in an effort to extract information and force confessions from their family members10 some human rights groups such as amnesty international have reported that the former regime beheaded over 200 women accused of prostitution detainees both male or female were routinely and systematically tortured including by electric shock and burnings according to administration documents us and other accounts say the former regime conducted decadeslong campaign of murder execution and arrest of shiite religious leaders and that the families of supporters of shiite islamic political parties were often denied food ration cards shiite religious commemorations broadcasts and publications were banned it was widely alleged that saddams elder uday who served as sports official threatened or beat athletes following soccer game defeats and that he dismissed hundreds of members of the iraqi union of journalists for not praising the regime sufficiently postwar findings about 270 mass graves have been reported by iraqis and us investigators since the fall of the regime but about 50 have thus far been confirmed by iraqs human rights

and was interrogated although us officials have publicly said saddam was uncooperative according to us commanders in baghdad documents captured with saddam have led to the arrests of several former officials at his arraignment hearing on july 1 2004 saddam was charged with seven major crimes against the iraqi people and humanity some of which are the same as those alleged crimes that the united states had researched previously the seven formal charges against saddam include 1 invading kuwait 2 killing iraqi religious in 1974 3 using chemical weapons against the kurds at halabjah 4 killing

authorizing military action if iraq enhanced numbers or quality of armament its forces below the 32nd parallel including any movement of air defense equipment into the zones the several years prior to the 2003 war were characterized by occasional us strikes on iraqi military emplacements during march 2000march 2001 iraqi air defenses fired at or targeted allied aircraft enforcing both zones on 500 occasions in many cases provoking us strikes on the activated missile batteries on february 16 2001 the united states and britain struck parts of that network north of the southern fly zone although the striking aircraft did not go beyond the zone during 2002 iraqi air defenses and related infrastructure were bombed about 60 times in response to about 200 provocations during the runup to the war the target list was expanded to include systems such as surfacetosurface missiles that could be used against us forces postwar redeployments and residual military issues with saddam husseins regime overthrown us officials said in midapril 2003 that fly zone enforcement had ended and many of the us aircraft involved in those operations have now been redeployed the defense department announced in september 2003 that the united states has drawn down its personnel in saudi arabia estimated at about 6000 before the war to the few hundred that were there prior to the 1990 invasion of kuwait those forces had been source of some strain in light of the resentment of saudi citizens to the presence of nonmuslim forces in the kingdom many of those forces were redeployed to new us air command center
