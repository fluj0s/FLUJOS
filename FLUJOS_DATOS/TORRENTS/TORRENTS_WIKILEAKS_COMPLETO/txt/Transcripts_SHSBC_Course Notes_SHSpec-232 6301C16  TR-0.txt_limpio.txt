6301c16 shspec232 tr0 the original tr0 was to teach the auditor to be there and to be aware however in doing tr0 students have begun to confront with that definition the original definition and tr0 are still valid additives have arisen you can make someone confront with professional attitude an auditing attitude an interested attitude good coaching depends on spotting what the student is doing and running it out flunking it without either flunking so much that the student goes into apathy nor so little that the student never improves the purpose of tro is to enable the studentto stand up to the duress of auditing it disturbs pc to have an auditor whose confront is very unnatural and who shatters under an upset in session upsets are often assignable to faulty tr4 an auditor who q and as gives pcs withholds by not simply acknowledging one q and equals one missed withhold the pcs statement has not been acknowledged just acknowledged the reason some auditors take long time to learn not to q and isnt really outtr4 it is outtr0 the auditor cant stand up to the session whenever something in the session looks odd the auditor retreats tr0 is out the coach must have considerable perception to coach tr0 on useful gradient he has to see confront go out look at something the student is doing and punch the button lrh has noticed auditors who q and in the presence of an arc break because there is too much there to confront this is as disastrous as it is likely to happen coaching gradient on this would start with the coach shaking his hand in front of the students eyes somewhere on the gradient the student will demonstrate his ability to dodge flying emeter cans while still confronting for an auditor to freeze and go totally silent is worse for the pc than auditor q and it is noauditing situation we should give at least fifty percent of our coaching time to the fellow who goes into wood good coach can recognize the difference between someone confronting and someone going into solid granite the next worst thing to going wooden is fleeing this amounts to the same thing dont think someone is doing tr0 because he has gone into apathy you can add aliveness to being aware this point is easy for coach to miss someone whose tr0 is granite wont be able to handle what comes up in session because he is not really confronting when you find an auditor who is having trouble with tr0 you know what kind of response he is getting in auditing because when something happens in session the auditor flees good auditing as opposed to bad auditing will show up most clearly under duress tr0 is the first thing to go the auditor will start making mistakes which is one thing you cant afford to do if the auditors tr0 is poor the auditor will make wrong judgments matter how well he is taught there is gradient of bad tr0 consisting of three grades 1 tr0 of doing the drill not associated with anything 2 the person who clams up and cant act 3 obsessive motion as form of and all three of these must be cured with coaching there is something else you could do different from tr1 or tr2 talking confront you see if the student can go on counting while you throw the cans at him or whether he loses count auditors must be trained to expect arc breaks and to keep going because auditors get arc breaks as well as getting wins and results lrh was aware recently of thinking less swiftly when pc arc broke he analyzed the phenomenon as his not wanting to confront it because it was counter to his intention for the session so he experienced small impulse not to confront it this gave lrh subjective reality on how an auditor could go from there to not thinking and making goof r212 arc breaks can be sudden violent and apparently inexplicable so tr0 must be beefed up in order to cope with this how much and how long should you run tr0 until the student comes to the independent conclusion that he can do tr0 and has the ability to do tr0 while doing all the other trs and until he can maintain tr0 when everything is going wrong and there is lots of duress bad tr0 leads to and lack of comprehension of what is going on and noauditing for the pc it takes awhile for someone to learn r212 if he is learning his trs at the same time you are liable to have mess on your hands coaudit with r210 see p 359 above can be done but only because guidance is very stringent and they dont have very much responsibility for tr1 go get good recording of lion roaring and then play it with the student putting intention into the middle of the speaker the degree of arc breaks the pc will have on r212 is proportional to the outness of the auditors trs bad trs lead to bad judgment if the auditors trs are perfect he will never have them tested by violently arc broken pc psychiatrists are trying to make the third dynamic safe by protecting it from the first dynamic ie from the patient he is curing motion he is totally sold on the idea that insanity equals motion he tries to get the patient into quietness into apathy
