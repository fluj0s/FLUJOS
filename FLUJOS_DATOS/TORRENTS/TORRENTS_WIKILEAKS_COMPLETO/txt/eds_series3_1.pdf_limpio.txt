ihave hadmany letters andreports from scientologists over thepast couple ofyears telling meoftheir wins and successes with book oneseminars andcoaudits yetthere wasnt theexpected flow from book

andthesuccesses andbugs that people were running into were looked into thefirst thing that showed upwasdifficulties being caused byquickying inonearea they first ofalldropped outhaving book one
