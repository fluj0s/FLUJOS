information was collected from 22 cities in 19 countries about how cocaine and other coca products are used who uses them wh at effects they have on the users and the community and how governments have responded to the cocaine problem the information collected represents the largest body of current knowledge on cocaine use at global level this briefing kit contains inform ation sheets which

was made possible through the generous contribution of the italian ministry of interior the project produced country profiles on cocaine from 19 developed and deve loping countries key informant study reports from drug users and others with an extensive knowledge of cocaine use from 19 cities on almost every continent natural history study report on four sites in south america and africa the research methods developed for the project can now be used to collect information on cocaine in other countries and information on other drugs and to monitor trends in the future it is not possible to describe an average co caine user an enormous variety was found in the types of people who use cocaine the amount of drug used the frequency of use the duration and intensity of use the reasons for using and any associated problems they experience however three general patterns of use we re found across the participating countries 1 the snorting of cocaine hydrochloride by far the most popular use of coca products worldwide 2 the smoking of coca paste and crack and the injection of cocaine hydrochloride are minority behaviours and tend to be found among the socially marginalised 3 the traditional use of coca leaves among some indigenous populations in bolivia ecuador peru northern chile and argentina as well as some groups in brazil and colombia generally cocaine users consume range of othe r drugs as well there appears to be very little pure cocaine use overall fewer people in partic ipating countries have used cocaine than have used alcohol tobacco or cannabis also in most countries cocaine is not the drug associated with the greatest problems health problem from the use of legal substances particularly alcohol and tobacco are greater than health problems from cocaine use few experts describe cocaine as invariably harmfu l to health cocainerelated problems are widely perceived to be more common and more severe for intensive highdosage users and very rare and much less severe for occasional lowdosage users majority of health consequences may not be di rectly attributed to cocaine use cocaine often contributes to or exacerbates the conditions reported rather than causing them there are widespread myths be t few scientific studies of the relationship between cocaine and sexual behaviour one finding was that sexual problems seem to occur among highdosage regular cocaine users range of mental health problems are associated with cocaine use though they are mainly limited to highdosage users there is complex relationship between cocaine use and crime particularly theft and violence use of coca leaves appears to have negative health effects and has positive therapeutic sacred and social functions for i ndigenous andean populations responses to cocainerelated health problems are poor ly coordinated incons istent often culturally inappropriate and gene rally ineffective education treatment and rehabilitation progra mmes should be increased to counterbalance the current overreliance on law enforcement measur they should not necessarily concentrate exclusively on cocaine bet should be integrated into mix of strategies to deal effectively with range of drugs in many settings educational and prevention programmes generally do not dispel myths bet sensationalize perpetuate stereotyping and misinformation most treatment services are poorly coordinated of ten being culturally inappr opriate and ineffective in achieving rehabilitation those most likely to be denied access when seeking treatment are the poor and heavily dependent in most settings people who have enough money to pay for cocaine and who are familiar with supplier are able to obtain the drug despite its illegality in many settings cocaine users complained bout the level of corruption among law enforcement officials and alleged abuses of human rights users made it clear that such abuses and exploitat ion would generally not be effective in changing their drug use behaviour coca paste use may be increasing in andean count ries and crack use appears to be increasing in nigeria and brazil cocaine injection rates appear to be relatively stab and at low levels relative to the injection of other drugs most countries believe there needs to be more assessment of the adverse effects of current drug policies and strategies some countries have shifted the focus of their drug policy to broad ra nge of goals in which abstinence is appropriate for nonusers and some users of coca products while other users are encouraged to use the drug as safely as possible please contact for further information hans emblad tel 791 4315 mario argandona tel 791 4309 andrew ball tel 791 4792 programme on substance abuse world health organization 20 avenue appia 1211 geneva 27 switzerland fax 791 4851 background the whounicri cocaine project is the largest study on cocaine ever undertaken between 1992 and 1994 information was collected from 22 sites in 19 countries about how cocaine is used who uses the drug what effects cocaine has on users and how governments have responded to cocaine use from the coca leaf chewers of the andes to the crack smokers of new york and lagos from cocaine injectors in sao paulo and san francisco to cocaine sniffers in sydney and cairo the project has examined cocaine use and users across broad spectrum of cultures 11 beginnings the who initiative on cocaine was announced by dr hiroshi nakajima directorgeneral of the world health organization in speech to the world ministerial summit to reduce demand for drugs and to combat the cocaine threat in london in april 1990 dr nakajima stated clearly that this initiative along with much of whos work in the area of psychoactive substance use was focused specifically on demand reduction rather than on law enforcement measures which attempt to reduce illicit drug supplies the initiative was developed by the who programme on substance abuse psa during series of meetings in 1991 in collaboration with the united nations interregional crime and justice research institute unicri the whounicri cocaine project was designed to collect uptodate information on patterns and trends in cocaine u and related problems from selection of countries around the world and to investigate the effec tiveness of policies and strategies which address cocainerelated problems 12 participating countries countries taking part in the project see table 11 were placed in the following categories type i countries which grow coca or pro cess coca products and which now have cocaine related problems type ii nonproducing countries which have substantial numbers of cocaine users and cocaine related problems type iil countries in which cocaine use and problems are not so widespread but are causing increasing concern type iv countries in which cocaine use has not appeared as major problem table 11 1 type i type ii type iii type iv bolivia canada australia egypt brazil mexico italy maldives colombia usa netherlands nigeria ecuador s pain re public of korea peru sweden the russian federation zimbabwe such broad mixture of countries has never before been studied together in drugsrelated research project participating countries included both devel oped and developing and included countries on all continents except antarctica the projects reports allow nations with major cocainerelated problems to learn from countries with fewer problems and vice versa 13 types of coca products throughout these summary papers several coca products are mentioned cocaine is often used to refer to all coca products especially when used in the phrase cocainerela ted problems when used with the other terms below cocaine refers to cocaine hydrochloride the while powder form of cocaine prepared from coca leaves it is water soluble and burns at very high temperature this allows it to be snorte d swallowed or injected but not smoked coca leaf refers to leaves of the coca bush of the genus erythroxylum which are chewedsucked used as an infusion or smoked by some groups in andean countries coca paste is paste prepared from coca leaves as part of the process of manufacturing cocaine hydrochloride it is not soluble in water though it is soluble with kerosene or petrol and is usually smoked with tobacco or cannabis it is almost exclusively found in south america crack or cocaine freebase is brown or beige crystal produced by heating cocaine hydrochloride with other chemicals it is smoked and has become very popular in north america 14 summary papers there are seven summary papers in this series to provide some insights into this important and innovative research project and its major results 1 introduction and background 2 project methodologies 3 patterns of use 4 consequences of use 5 responses to health problems 6 conclusions 7 recommendations in addition range of site and country summary reports is included project methodologies the whounicri cocaine project has broken new ground in the way it has collected information across national borders across cultures and across subcultures more than 40 leading researchers from around the world were involved in designing and implementing the project due to the difficulty in obtaining reliable information on sensitive topic ch as cocaine use the project has used range of methods for collecting information including in depth interviews with hundreds of cocaine users and others review of the scientific literature nd an analysis of existing data from participating countries results of this research can also be u sed as baseline information so that any future repetition of the projects can provide information on trends over time the project involved three related research approaches carried out from 1992 to 1994 these projects produced country profiles on cocaine from 19 countries key informant study reports from drug users and others with an extensive knowledge of cocaine use from 19 sitescities the natural history study report these reports attempt to synthesize vast amount of information to provide the findings outlined briefly in these summary papers the research methods developed for the project can now be used to collect information on cocaine in other countries and information on other drugs 21 country profiles the country profiles bring together set of info rmation that was often inaccessible in the past allowing researchers policy makers and others with in each participating country to gain clearer picture of the cocaine situation across their country the profiles also provide set of 19 nationa l reports which low governments to compare the cocaine situation in their country with the situation in other nations researchers assembling the country profiles on cocaine were asked to 1 describe the social and cultural context of cocaine use 2 present national data on rates and trends of cocaine use and related problems and characteristics of cocaine users 3 assess cocaine and its trends in relation to other substance use 4 describe healthrelated problems associated with each coca preparation eg coca leaf coca paste cocaine hydrochloride crack nd the extent to which people with cocaine related problems are using health care services 5 describe cocaine treatment procedures and services 6 describe activities designed to preven t cocaine use or related problems 7 describe cocaine control measures 8 identify issues for the future for many of the countries participating in the proj ect this was the first time that detailed answers were attempted to such complex research questions one result of the project in several developing countries is the assembly of country profiles which may assist in the establishme nt of appropriate drugs data collection systems 22 key informant studies the key informant studies attempt to address the normous variation which exists for example between coca leaf chewing in bolivia and crack use in new york these studies involved indepth interviews with hundreds of cocaine users pe ople who can provide information from their own experience of using cocaine in addition the r esearchers interviewed group they call noncocaine using intermediaries people who have close contact with cocaine users the third group interviewed were professionals people who work with cocaine users or work to prevent or resolve cocaine related problems in prevention and treatment settings in government or in law enforcement question areas for these interviews included demographic details such as age sex location residence patterns of cocaine use availability of cocaine consequences of cocaine use responses to cocaine use these three groups of interviews were carried out in 19 sites mostly cities across the participating countries see table 21 because range of different interviews was carried out at each site researchers are able to compare the answers of fo r example users and police to the same questions this allows researchers to gain more comprehensiv picture of what it is like to use cocaine in these sites it also allows researchers to learn about the myths and stereotypes which arise about cocaine use many researchers involved with these studies note that the key informant study provided them with the first opportunity to systematically collect in formation on patterns and consequences of cocaine use also for some researchers th is was the first time they had asked questions of cocaine users and this was felt to be significant advance over previ ous methodologies they plan to use similar studies to track drugs and drug use trends and new pr oducts and to examine other drugs regions and subcultures table 21 the 19 sites of key informant studies were north america south america pacific flagstaffarizona usa cochabam ba bolivia sydney australia mexico city mexico lima peru new york ny usa medellin colombia africa providence rhode island usa quito ecuador harare zimbabwe san francisco california usa rio janeiro brazil ibadan and lagos nigeria vancouver british columbia canada sao paulo brazil middle east asia europe barcelona spain cairo egypt seoul republic of korea st petersburg the russian federation 23 natural history study in this project new qualitative techniques have b een applied during both sampling and analysis to provide an indepth study of the various coca produc ts and methods of use the project interviewed 311 cocaine users 182 coca leaf and coca paste users and cocaine snorters in cochabamba 50 crack users and cocaine snorters in ibadan 43 crack users and cocaine injectors in sao paulo 36 crack users and cocaine injectors in rio janeiro snowball and targeted sampling was used to recru it users of coca products to the study users were interviewed about their experiences using sem istructured questionnaire designed to collect information on sociodemographic and biographical asp ects history of the use of other drugs the culture of use the nature of use contexts of use and supply functions effects and consequences of use in each of these centres the project examined the natural history of cocaine use patterns focusing on four groups those who are in drug treatment and who mainly use cocaine those who are not in drug treatment who use cocaine or have history of cocaine use but where cocaine is used in the context of polydrug use those who are not in drug treatment and who use cocaine control group of those who are in drug treat ment and who do not currently use or have previously used cocaine patterns of use people across the andes mountains in south america discovered the stimulating properties of the coca bush 7000 years ago the bush was cultivated and adapted to nearby environments and the use of coca leaves was made sacred in the aymara nd quechua cultures hundreds of years before the inca conquest in the fifteenth century during th inca period production and distribution of coca leaves were controlled by the state coca was used in rituals as state gift to faithful s ubjects and as physical stimulant for work in the mines the main alkaloid of the coca leaf cocaine was is olated about 1860 and was synthesized to be used in manufacturing popular patent medicines bevera ges and tonics particularly in europe north america and australia until the early years of this century concern about cocaine use began in many countries in the 1910s and 1920s centred on dependence on the drug and subsequent moral ruin particularly among the young laws restricting the availability of cocaine saw drop in consumption in most of the countries surveyed from the 1920s until the 1960s from that tim cocaine use along with the use of many other now illicit drugs such as cannabis becam popular among young people in many developed nations and in the cocaproducing countries of south america cocaine use has now also become popular in some developing nations in africa the increasing attractiveness of cocaine in the past two decades may be related to the glamour of illicit drug use in general increased international travel zeitgeist cocaine use fits the spirit of the fastchanging 1980s and 1990s increased wealth allowing more people access to what they believe is the most gla morous of all illicit drugs widespread poverty or social disadvantage in countries such as the usa at time when cheap coca preparations like crack have become widely available 31 wide variation among users one of the clearest findings of the whounicri cocaine project is that it is not possible to describe an average cocaine user coca product users vary from traditional coca chewers in bolivia and peru for example to gay nightclub cocaine sniffers in sydney to coca pasteusing sex workers in colombia to homeless young cocaine injectors in xico to wealthy nigerian crack users who are said to be in the last lane of success cocaine users are found in both sexes in all ag from children to the very old married and unmarried across wide geographic areas among ll ethnic groups and across all socioeconomic classes some centres believe cocaine users are rgely heterosexual while reports from sydney providence and st petersburg note that cocaine u is common within homosexual andor bisexual populations also while most users are reportedl unmarried sites such as quito and vancouver suggest marital status has little or bearing on co caine use more people use cocaine in urban areas than in rural areas participating countries outside north america and sp ain report that many cocaine users tend to be young 2035 and male in most countries between 1 and 3 of the population have ever tried cocaine the exceptions to this ar the usa where 11 have tried cocaine and peru where over 26 have chewed coca leaves similar rate is likely to be found in bolivia but this information was not confirmed by researchers the information from participating countries does not demonstrate an explosion of cocaine use throughout the world but diffusion of cocaine use to most countries has occurred an enormous range of difference was also found in the amount of drug used the frequency of use the duration and intensity of use and the reasons for using however four general patterns of use are found across the participating countries 32 snorting cocaine by far the most popular use of coca products worldwid is the snorting of cocaine hydrochloride this is viewed as glamorous leisure activity of the soci elite in many countries it is often associated with majority ethnic groups the welleducated i ntellectuals such as artists and academics and wealthy professionals such as business managers snorting cocaine was also most identified with casual recreational lowdosage users who take cocaine for leisure or diversion at social gatheri ngs or during sessions of sexual intercourse casual users often start taking cocaine because they believe it enhances their status makes the m more sociable relaxed and stimulated cocaine is also sometimes used to obtain specific effect in specific situation such as to stay alert or to increase energy for example at nightclubs and dance parties most participating countries and sites did not report significant cocainerelaxed problems among this group of users however the majority of people in each participa ting country reject cocaine use believing it to be harmful and morally weak indulgent behaviour the snorting of cocaine has increased in most of the participating countries in the past five years but now appears to be stabilising or declining in the usa australia canada the netherlands spain and mexico but increasing in brazil and peru 33 smoking crackpaste the second pattern involves the smoking of coca p aste and crack these are very much minority behaviours in the countries surveyed and are ma inly seen among the unemployed the homeless the poor and other minority and socially isolated groups such as sex workers and street youth users of these coca products are mostly seen as morally generate and delinquent are often actively discriminated against and are sometimes threatened with violence including death in some countries and sites coca paste referred to as pasta pasta basuca or basuco is almost exclusively used in south american countries though it was reported in the korean key informant study while basuco is smoked in quito it is unclear whether it is exactly the same as the coca paste smoked elsewhere or different product it is used by for example 3 of university students in bolivia 56 of the population in peru and around 1 of the population in ecuador and colombia paste use appears most common among the young and unemployed who cannot afford to buy cocaine hydrochloride it is said to involve daily use and often continuous and uncontrolled smoking therefore it is often considered to be more harmful than cocaine snorting coca paste use may be increasing in andean countries in particular in ecuador crack is used extensively in some cities in north america it is also reportedly used at low levels in many other countries around twothirds of the 19 s ites reported crack use while crack is usually manufactured from cocaine hydrochloride reports from sao paulo refer to two different types of crack pedra made from coca paste and casca made from cocaine hydrochloride generally crack is smoked in pipes but in barcelona users refer to plata or chino which means chasing the dragon by burning the drug on slip of aluminium foil and inhaling the vapours while sites such as cairo cochabamba harare li ma quito and sydney report little or evidence of crack use it has recently become as popular as or perhaps more popular than cocaine snorting in centres such as flagstaff ibadan providence some sections of san francisco and sao paulo other cities such as mexico city st petersburg seoul and vancouver describe crack as minor problem but potential concern for the future the image of crack smokers in the usa and canada is similar to that of coca paste smokers in south american countries in both cases the drug is believed to be highly addictive and associated with violent behaviour and criminal delinquency crack users are also often compared to cocaine injectors crack use is almost universally regarded as more harmful than snorting cocaine in same centres it is seen as more harmful than cocaine injection crack use appears to be increasing in brazil and nigeria and among groups such as sex workers and opiat users in the netherlands 34 cocaine injection while intravenous injection of cocaine is reporte d by majority of centres injecting remains minority practice in most sites outside the united states cocaine hydrochloride is infec ted either as solution or in mixture or cocktail eg combined with heroin as speedball or with methadone cocaine injection is identified with the unemployed or other lower socioeconomic status groups and socially isolated populations such as street youth sex workers and heroin injectors majority of respondents including cocaine users themselves see injecting as more likely to be problematic than cocaine sniffing though sydney reports that problems are less common for homosexual nightclub users than they are for other groups such as sex workers and heroin injectors injection is of particular concern due to the sp read of bloodborne viruses such as hiv the virus which causes aids and hepatitis b and c these inf ections can spread via needle sharing and unsafe sex among injecting drug users and from injectors to noninjectors drug injectors are extremely marginalised in most countries and are regarded with contempt as junkies injec tion rates appear to be relatively stable in the count ries surveyed and falling in some countries due to fears of being infected with hiv there are isol ated pockets such as rio janeiro brazil and sao paulo where cocaine injecting has become very common though move to crack use now appears to be gaining popularity in these centres 35 coca leaves the final pattern is the traditional chewing of coca leaves among various indigenous populations in argentina bolivia northern chile ecuador and peru as well as some groups in brazil and colombia coca cultivation is the basis of the subsistence economy of many peasant communit ies in bolivia and peru consumption of coca leaf is fully integrated into the andean cultural tradition and worldview for most users coca leaf retains its sacred character its main uses are increased energy for work and to fight fati gue and cold while it reduces the sensation of hunger coca leaf is not considered food medicinal in infusions syrups and poulti ces to diagnose and treat culturally delimited diseases considered to have supernatural cau ses which express interpersonal conflicts or conflicts within social structures sacred to communicate with the supernatural world and to obtain its protection especially in offerings to pachamama personification and spiritualization of the earth social to maintain social cohesion and c ooperation between community members used in all community ceremonies reciprocal exch anges of work and sociability relations the traditional method of using coca leaf called acullico consists of keeping salivasoaked ball of coca leaves in the mouth together with an alkaline substance that assists in extracting cocaine from the leaves preparing the bal takes 10 to 20 minutes after which the ball is sucked for two to three hours during work acullico structures periods of work and rest in normal day three balls would be used equivalent to 25 grams of coca leaf if the work takes longer or is more arduous than usual more leaves will be used both men and women perform acullico use is very stable beginning in adolescence when starting work and may not be interrupted throughout life in towns consumption is less and the traditional culture of the coca leaf is adapte d to modern society as result of these processes some traditional uses have become irrelevant or have been lost 36 less common cocaine patterns one report from harare suggested that cocaine coul d be drunk in solution reports of oral use like this are vague and are often based on speculation rath er than observation cochabamba reports the use of cocaine in the form of eye drops and nasal drops reports from cochabamba mexico city new york and sydney refer to applications of cocaine to genital mucous membranes during sex to delay or prolong orgasm 37 cocaine and other drugs generally cocaine users consume range of other psychoactive drugs as well there appears to be very little pure cocaine use and few people initia lly experiment with cocaine most cocaine users have prior history of drug use and often an extensive history of polydrug use globally cocaine users tend to smoke tobacco and drink alcohol freque ntly smoke cannabis and to lesser extent take benzodiazepines and other illicit drugs countries such as australia brazil canada mexico the netherlands spain sweden and zimbabwe note the u of alcohol with cocaine either to moderate the effects of cocaine or to reduce negative afte reffects these and other countries report the use of cannabis to reduce negative cocaine reactions aust ralia nigeria and the russian federation report that alcohol and tobacco are used with cocaine to enhance the pleasurable effects of the drug australia and the republic of korea note the use of amphetamine and cocaine together to enhance the effects of each drug and the netherlands reports the use of speedballs combination of heroin and cocaine injected together in south american countries coca paste is often smoked with tobacco or cannabis with alcohol and sometimes with hallu cinogens the majority of coca leaf chewers in peru do not use it with any other substances while about third regularly mix it with alcohol and tobacco use overall fewer people in participating countries have used cocaine than have used alcohol tobacco or cannabis also in most countries cocaine is not the drug associated with the greatest level of harm other illicit drugs viewed as more problematic than cocaine are amphetamines australia brazil republic of korea sweden inhalants bolivia brazil benzodiazepines brazil heroin egypt the maldives cheaper and more available drugs the russian federation the general public in most of the countries surveyed are reportedly poorly info rmed about cocainerelated harm or drugrelated harm in general specifically there is little knowledge about the role played by drugs such as alcohol in causing problems usually associated with cocaine use 38 continuum of use continuum can be identified for cocaine use ra nging from experimenting with low doses of cocaine once or twice with often negative consequences to compulsive or dysfunctional use which usually results in serious relationship work legal and h ealth problems although the consequences of cocaine use are provided in more detail in summary paper 4 brief description of this continuum of use appears below it should be noted that this continuum does not apply to the chewing of coca leaves 381 experimental use low doses of cocaine are tried one to several times on an intermittent basis often among younger people such as adolescents and young adults other drugs such as alcohol and cannabis are often tried prior to cocaine being used 382 occasional use this is the most typical pattern of cocaine use in which the drug is used as an aid in social intercourse acute sensations such as euphoria nhanced selfconfidence and greater energy are experienced negative effects may include anxiety irritation panic attacks as well as accidents and injuries which may occur due to the users excitement and poor judgement mild withdrawal syndrome follows even small acute doses usua lly comprising fatigue depression and agitation however there are generally few problems associated with this pattern of use 383 situationspecific use cocaine is used to obtain particular effect in specific situation eg to focus attention or incre ase energy in some occupations or to augment sexua l performance while this use is occasional few problems are likely but tolerance develops to the drugs effects if it is used often requiring larger doses to maintain the desired effect and potentially leading to more frequent use snorting cocaine is most identified with these firs t three categories though cocaine injecting and using paste and crack are also found in these types of use 384 intensive use this is where cocaine use becomes an integral part of the users lifestyle it is similar to the next category but the user is able to maintain leve l of control and social functioning is maintained intensive cocaine users and to lesser extent occasional and situationspecific users use rituals or rules to help them control their drug use intens ive users are often reported to start taking cocaine because of peer pressure or as an escape from unfavour able circumstances majority of intensive users are reported to have poor selfimage and negative view of cocaine use injection crack and coca paste use are also more identified with in tensive cocaine users though some snort cocaine 385 compulsivedysfunctional use an uncommon type of use is where some intensiv users lives become totally focused on obtaining and using the drug high doses and routes of administration such as smoking or injecting which can deliver large amount of drug to the brain very quickly combine to produce rapid and maximal effect the drug is administered repeatedly in an attempt to maintain the initial effect s of exhilaration and enhanced selfconfidence this sequence known as run cannot be sustaine d and is followed by period of physical and emotional exhaustion the crash prolonged peri od of sleep then fatigue and depression the user often repeats the cycle to relieve the negativ feelings from the crash these compulsive or dysfunctional users often have serious relati onship work legal and health problems consequences of use cocainerelated problems should be kept in perspective in all participating countries health problems from the use of legal substances particularly alc ohol and tobacco are greater than health problems from cocaine use also in many countries chroni c problems related to poverty hunger infectious diseases war and social disorder overshadow any health problems related to cocaine use most participating countries agree that occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems though there is evidence of increasing cocainerelated health problems in some parts of north america because of the great differences between the ways that coca leaves and all other coca products are used and viewed coca leaf chewing will be dealt with separately at the end of this paper 41 consequences and patterns the intended consequences of using cocaine are uphoria stimulation confidence and for some enhanced enjoyment of sex about 5075 of cocaine users in each site surveyed for these reports said that using cocaine is harmless and benefici to them cocainerelated problems are widely perceived to be more common for intensive high dosage users and either unknown or very rare for occasional lowdosage users occasional highdose users or binge cocaine users may be at risk of acute physical and mental heal th problems increases in problems also may be related to particular ways of using such as smoking or injecting and to general impoverished lifestyles 42 physical consequences few informants describe cocaine as invariably harmful to health use of cocaine leads to feelings of enhanced energy and may lead to greater stamin confidence and creativity though users have mixed feelings about the effect of cocaine use on work the most common acute problem related to cocaine use is overdose though these overdoses are often combination of cocaine with other substances such as alcohol and minor tranquillisers death due to cardiac arrest is cited but it is very rare negative physical consequences most commonly re ported from cocaine use include appetite and weight loss sinus problems perforated nasal septum scarring and collapsed veins with injection and cardiovascular pulmonary or nervous system damage cocaine use in pregnancy has been associated with birth defects including anecdotal accounts of deformed children cocaine use is associated with impulsive acts which can lead to accide nts however cocaine users are not thought to be generally at higher risk of accide nts with the possible exception of road accidents among highdosage regular users who drive trucks the usa country profile notes there are widesp read myths but few scientific studies of the relationship between cocaine and xual behaviour respondents in twoth irds of the sites agreed that low doses of cocaine intensify sexual pleasure and performance and prolong orgasm particularly in males most sites also report that males regularly ffer cocaine to seduce females or less often other males as it is thought to reduce inhibitions some barcelona and new york informants believe claims that cocaine use enhances sex are myth reports from around half the sites stress that prolonged and high doses of cocaine can produce diminished libido and impotence though alcohol use may also play role in this regular highdose male users reportedly encounter difficulty achieving erection and orgasm small number of centres such as ibadan and sao paulo claim that cocaine regularly suppresses sexual behaviour the sexual behaviour of users warrants fresh study to eliminate sexual and gender stereotypes cocaine use is associated with increased rates of sexually transmitted diseases and increased hiv transmission both sexually and via needle sharing even occasional cocaine use can lead to impaired judgement increased risk of unsafe sex and chaotic sexual behaviour although rare this behaviour can lead to the transmission of hiv or other sexua lly transmitted diseases also the spread of hiv hepatitis b and c and other bloodbor ne infections is particular concern among injecting cocaine users access to injecting equipment varies enormously across the participating countries wi th the result that injectors in some areas consistently u new or cleaned needles and syringes while others face great difficulties in acquiring sterile equipment majority of the health consequences above may not be directly attributed to cocaine use for example cocaine does not in itself induce weight loss rather users may experience appetite loss or may lack sufficient resources to ensure health diet these factors would in turn foster undernutrition and weight loss cocaine often cont ributes to or exacerbates the conditions reported rather than causing them also particular coca products may be linked with conditions not necessarily caused by cocaine use bolivian users of coca paste for example often have bronchitis poor nutrition and tooth caries but this may be due to the multiple products which make up the paste or to its combination with alc ohol and tobacco in pitillos and tocos cigarettes and pipes of coca paste or the precarious lifestyle led by many paste users these findings rai important considerations for drug policy as well as negative physical consequences the ke informant studies provide reports of positive effects few respondents in cochabamba mexico city and sao paulo suggest that cocaine is sometimes used as an analgesic us ually for toothache anecdotal reports from rio janeiro indicate that some women inject cocaine to relieve preme nstrual tension or pain some respondents believe wrongly that cocaine is useful contraceptive or prophylactic against sexually transm itted diseases some sao paulo and sydney respondents claim cocai ne use reduces alcohol intoxication and harare and sao paulo informants report that taxi drivers garbage collectors and other labourers use cocaine to increase work capacity and ward off sleep two respondents in medellin indicate that coca products are used to treat evil eye culturespeci fic disorder which is attributed to witchcraft 43 mental health consequences range of mental health problems are associated w ith cocaine use though they are mainly limited to highdosage users respondents in flagstaff and sao pa ulo conclude that crack use is most likely to produce mental health problems the key in formant studies found that cocaine users and intermediaries with knowledge of the cocaine scen were less likely and professionals were more likely to report that cocaine influences mental health the most commonly mentioned mental health consequences of cocaine use include paranoia especially among crack users memory loss pression anxiety loss of cognitive skills or intellectual capacity apathy mood swings aggression social withdrawal and low sel festeem small number of respondents reported hallucinations psychosis sociopathy and obsessivecompulsive behaviour while these conditions may be very problema tic while they last they are usually transient also it is difficult to discover what role cocaine has in bringing on these mental health problems and what roles are played by preexisting psychological conditions and the use of other drugs many respondents believe cocaine use has nega tive effect on school studies and concentration though opinion is divided on cocaines effects on creativ or artistic ability overall slight majority of consultants and centres believe that shortte rm and lowdosage cocaine use enhances creative potential but many others either disagree or ve too little information to make decision few mentioned the types of artistic or creative end eavour with which cocaine might be linked but providence and seoul reported the use of cocaine to enhance musical performance longterm intensive use is also associated w ith psychotic symptoms such as delusions and aggression the canadian country profile notes that most cocaine users who experience serious or chronic problems are frequent users and that only minority of cocaine users exhibit patterns of use that could develop into more substantial difficulties cocaine users are reported to be i nvolved in disproportiona number of attempted suicides and possibly suicides domestic violen ce is reported among some cocaine users but again it is difficult to identify the sp ecific role of cocaine use cocaine dependence is another concern to health authorities however most respondents state that cocaine dependence is rare and that most cases i nvolve drugs other than cocaine vulnerability to dependence is related to range of factors includi ng intensity of use and form of coca product with crack and coca paste being perceived as highly addi ctive as well as personality characteristics such as selfesteem and selfcontrol using other drugs together with cocaine increases the risk of dependence on one or more of the drugs being used 44 social consequences the most frequently mentioned problem associated w ith cocaine use is perceived increase in crime particularly theft and violence cocaine use is said to disrupt families contribute to unemploym ent or decreased productivity promote juvenile delinquency increase prostitution and promote corruption particularly within law enforcement agencies crack and coca paste use are associated with viol ence unemployment and social marginalization what is not clear is whether the drug use causes une mployment and violence or whether all of these social problems are caused by the often systemic or societal problems related to poverty and soc ial marginalization the key informant studies also show that the rela tionship between cocaine use and violence is very complex half of all centres profess knowledge of link between cocaine use and aggression or state that informants hold very mixed opinions on this issue only cairo flagstaff harare medellin quito and seoul assert that cocaine use frequently pr omotes violence more surprising is the disparity between what users and intermediaries say about violence and what is said by professionals us ers and intermediaries who are generally stressing the pos itive aspects of cocaine use are more likely to think cocaine use promotes violence professionals who invariably stress the negative aspects of cocaine use are least likely to associate use with violent behaviour majority of consultants in barcelona cochabamba rio janeiro sydney nd vancouver conclude that cocaine consumption has correlation with violent behaviour legal problems are rated as more common and more severe for highdose longterm users but are uncommon among casual users chief concerns mentioned by informants are drug possession trafficking or sale or crimes such as fraud assault robbery or sex work committed to obtain funds to purchase cocaine consultants in quito mexico c ity and providence note that users ability to manage legal problems often varies with the users socioeconomic status arrest is common for poorer or minority users while wealthier individuals nd those with political influence are regarded as virtually immune from police action obtaining cocaine and coca products in those c ountries where possession use and supply are illegal poses many hazards including the potential for fraud ex tortion or assault the greatest threat to most users is the threat of police involvement coca products purchased on the black market are often adulterated or cut with ra nge of additives from sodium bi carbonate aspirin laxatives or amphetamines to sugar flour pow dered milk and powdered brick most respondents and centres report that cocaine u has negative effect on the users financial status many also note that intensive and uncontro lled users face the strong possibility of dismissal from work and longterm unemployment leaving such users destitute however half of all centres state that financial effects vary depending on the characteristics of users and consumption patterns for example respondents in vancouver report th at occasional users suffer little or financial distress even after many years of use few respondents pointed out that cocaine comprises profitable industry for producers and distributors and some communities many countries find that cocaine use leads to nega tive effects on social interaction with regular cocaine users becoming increasingly isolated distrustful and focused on finding and using more cocaine however people may become intensive users because of social isolation and family problems informants in barcelona providence sydney and vancouver find that cocaine use has an extremely positive influence on social interaction leading to occasional users being talkative engaging and popular similarly while most centres state that cocaine use leads to breakdowns in relationships with family and friends many informants believe occasional or controlled cocaine use has consequences for these relationships some respondents note that families may be ashamed of users and reject t hem while others suggest that intensive users may act in more suspicious aggressive or violent manner so that partners and family members may begin to fear and isolate the user flagstaff and sydney users predict that partnerships are more vulnerable if both partners are cocaine consumers due to the potential for competition for access to cocaine to provoke conflict 45 consequences of coca leaf use all users of coca leaf value its beneficial effects of additional energy and therapeutic uses as well as its ritual and symbolic importance those users who form part of the traditional andean culture stres s its sacred culture respondents in cochabamba emphasize that indigenous peasants chew large quantities of coca leaves for decades yet manifest ill effects from exte nded use the colombian report notes that the acullico habit see 35 in previous summary paper has not been reported to ad to any noti ceable mental or physical health damage it is likely that similar results would be found for users of nat ural coca products such as chewing gum and tea bags cochabamba informants note that coca provides fi nancial benefit to indigenous peasants by assisting them to enhance production in farming fishing and mining medellin informants note that shamanic healers employ coca leaf in religious rituals specifically to intensify their powers while it is possible that there are some health probl ems associated with coca l eaf use that are so far unrecognised this seems unlikely it may be of more interest to discover whether there are positive health effects from coca leaf chewing and whet her these effects are transferable from traditional settings to other countries and cultures responses to health problems although many countries have devel oped comprehensive national drug strategies the reality is that responses to cocainerelated health problems are poor ly coordinated incons istent often culturally inappropriate and generally ineffective these responses can be categorised as prevention of cocaine use and cocainerelated problems including education about the health and other effects of cocaine use treatment of cocainerelated problems especially those related to acute intoxication binges and dependence controlling the availability of cocaine thr ough law enforcement crop substitution and other efforts many professional and intermediary consultants as we ll as cocaine users identify strict limitations to drug control policies which rely almost exclusiv ely on repressive measures many key informants believe that current national and local approach which overemphasize punitive drug control measures actually contribute to the development of heathrelated problems 51 prevention and education despite broad range of educational and preven tion approaches most programmes do not prevent myths but perpetuate stereotypes and misinfor m the general public such programmes rely on sensationalized exaggerated statements about co caine which misinform about patterns of use stigmatize users and destroy the educators cred ibility this has given most education campaigns naïve image and has reduced confidence in the quality and accuracy of these campaigns activities to prevent problems related to cocaine use are almost nonexistent programmes to prevent the use of cocaine are minimal in most countries in brazil for example little is formally document ed about the nature of prevention activities which are ca rried out by nongovernmental organizations such as rotary and lions clubs churches trade unions and so on fearbased mass media campaigns are carried out in bolivia brazil colombia and ecuador 511 mass media campaigns the usa and dutch country profiles differ radically in their overall approach to the use of mass media campaigns the us researchers believe that ne wspapers radio and televi sion play an important role in reducing the demand for drugs the dutch report states that publicity campaigns have proved to be ineffective in preventing drugrelated probl ems particularly when they emphasize dangers warnings or sensational facts the dutch have therefore rejected the mass media approach information and education is provided to at risk groups by outreach and youth workers many prevention campaigns are not based on an ad equate understanding of the needs of the target groups they often fail to recognise the need to involve members of the target audience in the planning production and implementation of information and education materials users of cocaine generally regard health and othe r relevant professionals as being illinformed about the real nature and extent of cocainerelated probl ems for example health professionals interviewed for this study were often unaware of the predomin ant patterns of cocaine use in combination with other drugs 512 education programmes education programmes need to be comprehensive and not just focused on cocaine or on illicit drugs comprehensive programmes avoid stigmatizing these drug users and encouraging cocaine users to simply switch to other drugs centres in ibadan lima and sydney identify many governmental and private agencies which sponsor national regional and local educational campaigns drug education is widespread in schools in some participating countries but these efforts are not integrated with efforts outside school and their cove rage and intensity are usually low for example only 20 of educational institutions in colomb ia provide drug education though the usa and several australian states claim that virtually all schools have instituted drug prevention programmes the dutch drug education system is unusual in that it can provide drug and alcohol education as part of general information to school students about healthy behaviours and social skills to equip them to cope with the risks of life in general school st udents are expected to make responsible choices organizations are expected to spend government funding responsibly by developing implementing and evaluating health education programmes and municipalities are expected to develop health promotion activities for the general public consequen tly schools are free to decide how to carry out their own programmes 513 educational materials wide variety of education and information materi als is mentioned in the reports from participating countries these include the expected bulletins pa mphlets booklets books advertisements videos and magazines as well as the less common computer software psychodrama on television radio programmes and jingles and periodic seminars most of these materials appear to be superficial luri d excessively negative and ineffective in reaching subgroups such as homosexual users youths and pregnant women cultural irrelevance of educati on and information materials is major problem particularly the supply of materials from the usa in other countries without attempti ng to assess their cultural relevance or specific effectiveness there is general lack of evaluation of the eff ectiveness of prevention activities even in developed countries where national coordination exists from drug education and prevention activities such as canada little or funds are allocated to evaluati on majority of prevention campaigns are rated as poor or at best only moderately successful only professional consultant s engaged in prevention describe prevention campaigns as successful some campai gns are regarded as tokenistic or politically motivated and the use of outdated methods ch as informationonly approaches is common 514 prevention among special populations prevention of the spread of hiv among cocaine inject ors is considered by several countries to take higher priority than preventing any other problem s associated with cocaine use however most countries provide drug education to cocaine in jectors though information about not sharing needles is provided to the general public in several countries education programmes for special populations such as prisoners and pregnant women are available in only few countries australia mexico the netherla nds and peru provide ducation usually on drug injecting and hivaids to prisoners colombia mexico and the russian federation provide education to pregnant women and workbased education programmes are reported in australia colombia nigeria and the usa though coverage and intensity are not regarded as optimal 52 treatment most treatment services are poorly coordinated of ten culturally inappropriate and ineffective in achieving rehabilitation unlike heroin for wh ich methadone is an acknowledged effective management approach cocaine dependence has standard treatment virtually countries offer specialized treatment for cocaine dependence or other related problems most participating countri have private treatment facilities available for wea lthy cocaine users and free or lowcost public or nonprofit treatment services that are underfunded and overwhelmed by demand cocaine users often cannot name any type or location of cocaine treatment in general the few cocaine users who seek treatment are motivated mo re by poor health disrupted work and personal relationships than by concern fo r legal consequences those most likely to be turned away when seeking treatment are poor and heavily dependent th majority of people who suffer cocainerelated problems eventually recover without receiving any formal treatment 521 abstinence orientation formal treatment approaches tend only to try to make users stop using rather than assisting users to reduce the harm from their cocaine use these abstinence models are s een as inflexible by some key informants harm reduction efforts could include stra tegies to reduce or control drug use or to snort cocaine rather than use crack or coca paste or inject cocaine most treatment services rely on detoxification psychotherapy nd counselling to promote rehabilitation few programmes offer broader treatment services such as pharmacotherapy group or family therapy occupational sports or physical therapy behaviour modification and spiritual counselling acupuncture is available at more than half th 19 sites surveyed as are range of nonmedical services such as religious communities faith healing and indigenous treatment options in centres such as cochabamba ibadan medellin rio janeiro sao paulo and st petersburg compulsory or involuntary treatment is common most users being treated for cocaine use are compelled to enter treatment by police or courts or coerced by family and friends the effectiveness of these approaches needs to be investigated accessibility of services to women and soci ally disadvantaged groups such as the homeless street youth and sex workers is poor in many countries single treatment is effective for problems associat ed with cocaine use rvices need to take an integrated approach and provide range of options which individual cocaine users will find helpful some countries have outlined coherent model structure of treatment services as follows 1 hospital accidentemergency units 2 detoxification services 3 ambulatory care centres 4 inpatient treatment centres psychiatric hos pitals specialist substance abuse treatment centres 5 therapeutic often drug free communities 6 social rehabilitationselfhelp groups for most countries this is clearly an idealised st ructure and drug treatment services are consistently described as poorly coordinated underresourced with equipment and materials and lacking appropriately trained staff 522 training issues virtually all sites report that treatment staff lack adequate training and expe rtise in cocaine and drug treatment many professionals engaged in treating u sers are regarded by key informants as uninformed about the spectrum of cocaine use and the best appr oaches for treatment so that those engaged in care have little insight into the true range of patterns and consequences of cocaine use abuse of those in treatment is found in more than 25 of participating countries with abuses including financial and sexual exploitation neglect assault nd psychological abuse some treatment centres are overzealous in their application of major psychiatric drugs major tranquillisers such as phenothiazi nes and tricyclic antidepressants while some pharmacol ogical treatments eg benzodiazepines can assist in cocaine withdrawal and help manage craving mo re research is needed into their appropriate use research is also needed to develop new pharmacological agents for this purpose the role of selfhelp groups such as narcotics anonymous is seen as valuable in some countries but generally ignored in others however many informants assert that selfhelp groups emphasizing religious orientation alienate or antagonize number of potential beneficiaries the role of non professionals in treatment especially exusers is unclear programmes based on religious models or beliefs are widespread though their effectiveness is of ten not evaluated or critically examined and is therefore unknown cocaine treatment for prisoners is often different to treatment offered to the rest of the community several countries have cocaine treatment for pris oners and where such services do exist they are minimal programmes typically involve workbased activities like police or staterun farms sometimes combined with therapeutic community with supportive counselling from professionals or volunteers often clergy and self help groups 53 availability and supply control most people who have enough money to pay for cocaine and related products and who are familiar with supplier are able to obtain the drug despite its illegality in most of the countries surveyed possession use sale supply trafficking importing and production of cocaine coca paste and crack is illegal in all participating countries except bolivia colombia peru the russian federation and spain where possession of small amounts for immediate personal use is not penalized possession and use of coca leaves is legal in bolivia and in peru above 1000 metres cocaine is occasionally obtained through gifts or ba rter for merchandise or sex obtaining cocaine and coca products in those countries where possession use and supply are illegal poses many hazards including the potential for fraud extortion or assault the greatest threat to most users is the threat of police involvement coca products purchased on the b lack market are often adulterated or cut with range of additives 531 law enforcement law enforcement targets users dealers and traffick ers but is thought to focus its efforts on users users of minority background or low socioeconomic status are the ones most subject to arrest and prosecution while wealthier users are virtually immune to prosecution or rarely imprisoned prohibitionist drug policy and enforcement are view ed as repressive and ineffective and police are widely regarded as corrupt law enforcement activiti are likely to encourage corruption violence the adulteration of coca products and black market activities in many countries there is large discrepancy between law enforcement and health aut horities about the risks of cocaine use education of police should be part of comprehensive drugs training programmes for professionals in many sites cocaine users made complaints about the level of corruption among law enforcement officials and alleged abuses of human rights users made it clear that such abuses and exploitat ion would generally not be effective in changing their drug use behaviour conclusions 61 methodology the whounicri cocaine project is the largest st udy on cocaine ever undertaken the project used range of methods for collecting information including indepth interviews with hundreds of cocaine users and others review of the scientific litera ture and an analysis of existing data from participating countries the research methods devel oped for the project can now be used to collect information on cocaine in other countries and information on other drugs these projects produced country profiles on cocaine from 19 countries key informant study reports from drug users and others with an extensive knowledge of cocaine use from 19 cities the natural history study report from four sites for many of the countries participating in the proj ect this was the first time that detailed answers were attempted to complex research questions on dr ugrelated topics in several developing countries the assembly of country profiles assisted the establishment of appropriate drugs data colle ction systems many researchers involved with these st udies note that the key informant studies provided them with the first opportunity to systematically collect information on patterns and consequences of cocaine use they plan to use similar studies to track drugs and drug use tr ends and new products and to examine other drugs regions and subcultures 62 patterns one of the clearest findings of the whounicri cocaine project is that it is not possible to scribe an average cocaine user an enormous range of difference was found in people who use cocaine the amount of drug used the frequency of use the dur ation and intensity of use and the reasons for using however three general patterns of u are found across the participating countries 1 by far the most popular use of coca products worldwide is the snorting of cocaine hydrochloride most participating countries and sites did not report significant cocainerelated problems among this group of users 2 the smoking of coca paste and crack and the injection of cocaine are very much minority behaviours in the countries surveyed and are mainly seen among the unemployed the homeless the poor and other minority and socially isolated groups such as sex workers and street youth users of these coca products are often seen as morally degenerate and delinquent 3 the final pattern is the traditional use of coca leaf among various indigenous populations in argentina bolivia northern chile ecuador nd peru as well as some groups in brazil and colombia consumption of coca leaf is fully inte grated into the andean cultural tradition and worldview for most users coca leaf retains its sacred character its ma in uses are for increased energy and for medicinal sacred and social functions generally cocaine users consume range of other dr ugs as well there appears to be very little pure cocaine use and few people begin their drug use careers with cocaine most cocaine users have prior history of drug use and often an extensive history of polydrug use overall fewer people in participating countries have used cocaine than have used alcohol tobacco or cannabis furthermore in most countries cocaine is not the drug associated with the greatest problems continuum can be identified for cocaine use which includes experimental use occasional use situationspecific use intensive use compulsivedysfunctional use experimental and occasional use are by far the most common types of use and compulsivedysfunctional is far less common compul sive or dysfunctional users often have serious relationship work legal and health problems 63 consequences in all participating countries health problems from the use of legal substances particularly alcohol and tobacco are greater than health problems from cocaine use also in many countries chronic problems related to poverty hunger infectious diseases war and social disorder overshadow any health problems related to cocaine use most participating countries agree that occasional or experimental cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems the intended consequences of using cocaine are uphoria stimulation confidence and for some enhanced enjoyment of sex few informants describe cocaine as i nvariably harmful to health cocainerelated problems are widely perceived to be more common for intensive highdosage users and either unknown or very rare for occasional low dosage users however an apparent paradox lies in the finding that greater levels of cocainerelated problems can arise at the same time tha t overall levels of use are falling this increase in problem s may be related to changes in the route of administration or to an increase in cocaine use by marginalized groups while cocaine use is fall ing among wealthier people negative physical consequences most commonly re ported from cocaine use include appetite and weight loss sinus problems perforated nasal septum scarring and collapsed veins and cardiovascular pulmonary or nervous system damage there are widespread myths but few scientific studies of the relationship between cocaine and sexual behaviour cocaine use is associated wit h increased rates of sexually transmitted diseases and increased hiv transmission both xually and via needle sharing majority of these health consequences may not be directly attributed to cocaine use cocaine often contributes to or exacerbates the conditions reported rather than causing them this raises important considerations for drug policy and suggests n eed to reassess the process for conducting clinical evaluations of cocaine effects range of mental health problems are associated w ith cocaine use though they are mainly limited to highdosage users the most commonly mentioned mental health consequences of cocaine use include paranoia especially among crack users memory toss and delayed response depression especially among coca paste users anxiety loss of cognitive skills or intellectual capacity apathy mood swings aggression social withdrawal nd low selfesteem small number of respondents reported hallucinations psychosis sociopa thy and obsessivecompulsive behaviour while these conditions may be very problematic while th ey last they are usually transient also it is difficult to discover what role cocaine has in br inging on these mental health problems and what roles are played by preexisting psychologica conditions and the use of other drugs the most frequently mentioned problem associated w ith cocaine use is perceived increase in crime particularly theft and violence cocaine use is said to disrupt families contribute to unemploym ent or decreased productivity promote juvenile delinquency promote corruption particularly within law enforcement and increase prostitution crack and coca paste use are associated with viol ence unemployment and social marginalization what is not clear is whether the drug use causes une mployment and violence or whether all of these social problems are caused by problems related to poverty and social marginalisation use of coca leaves appears to have negative physi cal effects and may have therapeutic value as tonic 64 responses although many countries have deve loped comprehensive national dr ug strategies responses to cocainerelated health problems are poorly coordinate d inconsistent often culturally inappropriate and generally ineffective in view of the current w levels of cocaine problems in most countries key informants believe that the responses to existing cocaine problems should be integrated into the national and local responses to ot her substancerelated problems the studies identified strict limitations to drug control policies which rely almost exc lusively on repressive measures current national and local approaches which overemphasize punitive drug control measures may actually contribute to the development of heathrelated problems an increas in the adoption of more humane compassionate responses such as education treatment and rehabilitation programmes is seen as desirable counterbalance to the overreliance on law enforcement measures despite broad range of educationa l and prevention approaches this project has determined that most programmes do not prevent myths but perpetuate stereotyping and misinformation in the general public most treatment services are poorly coordinated often culturally inappropriate and ineffective in achieving rehabilitation those most likely to be turned away when seeking treatment are poor and heavily dependent most people who have enough money to pay for cocai ne and related products and who are familiar with supplier are able to obtain the drug despite its illegality in most of the countries surveyed users of minority background or low socioeconomic stat us are most subject to arrest and prosecution while wealthier users are virtually immune to pr osecution or rarely imprisoned respondents were concerned about the level of corruption among w enforcement officials and alleged abuses of human rights users made it clear that such abuses and exploitation would gene rally not be effective in changing their drug use behaviour 65 the future most authorities agree that it is unrealistic to expect to eradicate the use of cocaine and other drugs however if substance use wilt continue harm from that drug use need not be inevitable in most participating countries minority of people start us ing cocaine or related products use casually for short or long period and suffer little or negative consequences even after years of use this suggests it is possible to reduce if not entirely eliminate harmful cocaine use predictions about future trends in cocaine use fall into two patterns the first sees the use of cocaine stabilising or declining slightly especially among the middle class the second sees cocaine use spreading downwards from higher to lower social classes coca paste use may be increasing in andean countries in particular in ecuador and crack use has become as popular as or more popular than cocaine snorting in centres such as flagstaff ibadan providence some sections of san francisco and sao paulo yet cairo cochabamba harare lima quito and sydney report little or evidence of crack use other cities such as mexico city st petersburg seoul and vancouver describe crack as minor problem but potential concern for the future cr ack use appears to be increasing in brazil and nigeria and among groups such as sex work ers and opiate users in the netherlands injection rates appear to be relatively stable in the countries surveyed and falling in some countries due to fears of being infected with hiv there ar isolated pockets such as rio janeiro brazil and sao paulo where cocaine injecting has become very common though crack use now appears to be gaining popularity in these centres the largest future issue is whether international organisations such as who and the united nat ions drug control programme and national government s will continue to focus on supply reduction approaches such as crop destruction and substituti on and law enforcement efforts in the face of mounting criticism and cynicism about the effec tiveness of these approaches countries such as australia bolivia canada and colombia are now in terested in examining range of options to legalize and decriminalize the personal use and possession of cocaine and other related products there needs to be more assessment of the adverse effects of current policies and strategies and development of innovative approaches another related question concerns the implementa tion of harm reduction approach to drug policy prevention education and treatment in such an pproach focus shifts away from abstinence as the only goal to broad range of goals in which abs tinence is appropriate for nonusers and some users of coca products while other users not prepared to abstain are encouraged to use the drug as safely as possible this approach is already government policy in several participating countries and many other countries are considering ways in which risk reduction approaches can assist in the control of problems related to drug use anticipating and managing negative consequences of substance use are only possible with accurate relevant information about the motivations which drive drug use and the risk factors which predict harm comparisons between negative and positive consequences of cocaine use can assist in improving health by allowing at risk groups to make informed decisions about initiating or continuing use reducing risks also requires information on whether cocaine causes or merely compounds problems for people who are poor and socia lly marginalized another key factor to be explored is the cultural context in which cocaine u occurs to ensure that education and information materials are culturally relevant finally some countries call for fresh sophisticated and objective research on the motivations underlying drug use shortterm and longterm sequences of cocaine use alternative and more effective treatments for dependence and use in rural areas recommendations 71 general recommendations 11 who should encourage all member states to ensu re that cocaine issues are incorporated into comprehensive national drug strategies and health plans 12 who should develop programme of activiti over fiveyear period within strategic framework aimed at reducing the level of cocainerela ted harm throughout the world and for this to be reflected in the work plan of the programme on substance abuse 13 within this proposed programme of activities who should recognize south america as priority region with particular attention to re ducing adverse effects of smokable and injectable methods of coca product administration 14 within the proposed programme of activities who should recognize second priority to provide support and assistance to countries such as those in the west coast region of africa with demonstrated evidence of emerging problems related to coca product use 15 as increases in domestic cocainerelated problems are related to changes in trafficking routes who should establish with the united nations dr ug control programme and other international organizations coordinated exchange of information on change in patterns of cocaine trafficking in order to identify early countries where cocainerelated problems are likely to develop or escalat 16 who should encourage member states to assess the impact of legislation and other drug control measures on health and social wellbeing in their countries 72 education and prevention recommendations 21 the aim of education about cocaine and re lated products should be to increase understanding about known highrisk patterns of cocaine use in pa rticular the intensity of use drug combinations and the potentially greater levels of harm associat ed with smokable and injectable methods of coca product administration 22 public education campaigns should be cultura lly appropriate and based on the results of sound research rather than myths and stereotypes about th nature and extent of cocainerelated health effects 23 who should encourage demonstration project s with innovative approaches to the prevention of cocainerelated harm particularly those whic h enhance health promotion activities of primary health care workers and which involve commun ity participation who should promote the development and implementation of strategies such as syringe exchange and safe sex measures to reduce specific health risk s such as the transmission of infectious diseases 24 who should encourage policymakers to pl ace less reliance on massmedia information campaigns especially those featuring exaggerated or sensationalist messages or campaigns which are culturally inappropriate 73 treatment recommendations 31 who should produce guidelines to promote better management of emergency care for cocaine users with acute adverse reactions nd best practice approaches for longer term management of cocaine related dependency 32 in these guidelines particular atten tion should be paid to the role of pharmacological agents in the management of cocaine withdrawal and dependence compulsory versus voluntary admission to treatment therapeutic communities because of their widespread utilization traditional or indigenous healing practices 33 who should encourage governments at nati onal regional and local levels to create appropriate regulatory frameworks to ensure that all drug treatment services respect and protect t he rights of their clients 34 who should encourage member states to ex amine costeffective ways to increase access to existing drug treatment services for groups with special needs such as prisoners ethnic norities street children sex workers and other socially marginalized groups 74 research and data systems recommendations 41 whopsa should encourage member states and other research bodies to adopt and implement the methodology used in the whounicri cocaine project for undertaking cocaine and other drug research at the local level 42 whopsa should research the impact on hea lth at individual and population levels of different legislation and drug control measures 43 whopsa should investigate the therapeutic benefits of coca leaf australia introduction australias country profile cp and the sydney ke informant study kis reveal limited cocaine use and few userelated problems most are recreational cocaine hydrochloride users very few are inte nsive injecting users use tends to accompany polydrug experience patterns of cocaine use the cp and kis identify two patterns of cocaine th first is recreational use and notably among higher socioeconomic groups the second is more intens ive use by injectors mostly among lower socioeconomic groups sydneys kis found minimal crack use the majority are aged 20 to 34 and male the cp also reports higher rates of experi mentation with use among students and recreational drug users but heavier use among prison inmates str eet youth and sex workers the kis suggests that most initiate use through friends work colleagues or personal relationships data indicate low use prevalence the cp reports the use frequency of once month to once or twice year for the general population at about 1 rates are comparable for males and females polydrug use is common greater use prevalence was indicated for such substances as tobacco alcohol cannabis and amphetamines the kis contends that polydrug use was much more prevalent among injectors while alcohol use is more strongly linked to intranasal users access is also notable factor prevalence is higher in urban areas particularly in state capitals the geographic distributi on for cocaine use is reproduced here from the cp lifetime prevalence of cocaine use among th general population by city

ted to higher use rates in this location the cp attributes limited supplies with lack of proximity to cocaine producing countries and trafficking routes however increases in drug seizures in 1992 and

negative consequences were indicated in ither the cp or kis psychological complications are associated with use pattern higher income intranasal users exhibit few cases of depres sion or paranoia and higher self image with use in jectors evidence low esteem and more cases of aggression or withdrawal symptoms outcome is similar for health reports agree that few problems are attributable solely to cocaine most effects are minor such as dry mouth enla rged pupils sweating increased and irregular pulse and respiration excitability or irritability more extreme complications may be noted for intensive polydrug injectors including greater risk of infectious diseases including hiv the cp indicates that cocaine injectors are much more likely than are noninjectors to be exposed to hiv through shared needles or unsafe sex both cp and kis stress that users are wellinformed on hiv and that needle exchange and condom use levels are high still ll cocaine users face risk from polydrug intoxication and unsafe sex nevertheless the cp found few seri ous complications from use in its review of mortality and morbidity indicators responses cocainespecific treatment programmes are available though the cp notes broad range of care for alcohol and other drug depe ndency including public and private care which employ both psychosocial therapy and pharmacological intervention selfhelp groups such as alcoholics anonymous and narcotics anonymous were describ ed however kis consultants had little or knowledge about care the cp outlines an extensive range of preventi on

other guides target special user groups drug education is required in public schools and similar programmes are offered in private and religious institutions though none ffer component specific to cocaine legislation focuses on the federal crimes act it distinguishes between use trafficking and commercial possession by quantity of cocaine seized commercial possession receives li fe imprisonment while trafficking draws 25 years small quantities and first time offences receive variable penalties the cp indicates that nsw police policy is to direct users to treatment still few kis consultants report some sporadic cases of police harassment especially of injectors both the cp and kis report that crack freebasing and injecting are all minimal in australia but recommend monitoring of these products and routes of primary concern is that australia could become trafficking route increasing supplies and availability the reports call for cocainespecific treatment and prevention to compensate for potential growth in trafficking kis results spur recommendations to target hivaids intervention for atrisk populations such as sex workers and injecting cocaine users bolivia introduction the cochabamba centre particip ated in the natural history study and completed country profile cp for bolivia and key informant st udy kis for cochabamba bolivia represents key site for both production of coca and coca products and for traditional coca leaf chewing patterns of cocaine use bolivias quechua and aymara peasants ve used coca since 12 000 bc controversy erupted after the spanish conquest as to whether coca is divine plant or from the devil but it did not pose legal problems until 1975 cultivation and use of coca leaf for chewing and in wine tea and toothpaste remains legal nd widely accepted in the population however production and use of cocaine hydrochloride coca paste and crack are illegal and socially disparaged the cp identifies six types of users the first are quechua and aymara who chew leaf and exhibit dependence or problems the second are mine workers of whom 96 chew leaf during work and ritual third is the urban marginal population rural migrants who enter urban slums and smoke coca paste intensivel fourth comprises about 500 000 working children and street children aged 7 to 18 f ears limit their consumption level but children as young as 7 maybe users the fifth includes urban professionals and others with stable incomes who are mostly recreational users lower economic tiers are more likely to smoke paste while the wealthier sniff hydrochlorid some make ophthalmic nasal or genital application for medicinal or sexual reasons but crack smoking and leaf chewing are quite rare in this group the sixth group is based in co chabamba where the economic mainstay is the production of coca and side products most reside nts here chew leaf but reject use of coca paste and cocaine hydrochloride lifelong yearly and monthly prevalence of coca paste and hydrochloride in the population of 13 bolivian cities 1992 percentage data coca paste hydrochloride at least once during hisher life 11 13 yearly prevalence 02 01 last month prevalence 01 0 source dinapre 1992 note this table offers informati on for individuals aged 1250 the sa mple includes populations of over 30 000 inhabitants only users range in age from 680 paste users tend to be young while leaf chewers may be older male users tend to predominate consequences of cocaine use the cp and kis conclude that leaf chewers suffer adverse consequences the kis notes that leaf is chewed daily during the working week the effects of 710 gram doses last 2 to 3 hours use is curtailed on weekends and there are signs of withdrawal some urban nightclubs offer trays of leaves to patrons but here the ritual focus is lost even here though leaf chewers suffer withdrawal and qua ntity and frequency of use does not increase over time women who chew leaf continue use throughout pregnancy and evidence problems some kis consultants report that sex workers smoke coca paste and claim that such use may affect pregnancy offering anecdotal accounts of malformed children problem use and dependence are reported only for coca paste and hydrochloride the kis notes that recreational users take about 3 grams of paste pe r day or 0751 gram of powder per session for these who develop dependency the frequency and dosage increase the cp and kis both report use of alcohol with cocaine to balance the effects of each substance the kis also reports ties between dependence and criminal behaviour as crime is undertak to support use the cp cites the difficulty in assessing cocainerelated health problems because most users engage in polydrug use data do not specify total treatment admissions exclusively or primarily for treatment of cocainerel ated problems however cp and kis indicate greater dependence on coca paste than for hydrochloride paste smoking is more likely to contribute to bronchitis malnutr ition dental carries and interpersonal problems at home and at work responses both the cp and kis identify substantial problems with treatment while there are numerous public and private services these cover only 30 of the populati on bolivia has few psychiatrists and fewer still are trained to treat problems associated with cocaine use thus many centres employ untrained staff kis informants knew little about services but felt that most are ineffective various prevention programmes are reported but the cp concludes that none are very effective most fail to coordinate their efforts and none are tailored to unique user populations bolivia predicts that cocaine use will increase in the future consequently effective prevention programmes are needed and should be coordinated fo r public education medical personnel should also be trained in cocaine issues to improve treatment outcomes penalties for cocaine trafficking are 1025 years im prisonment both cp and kis report widespread police corruption many feel that only the little fish small traffickers are targeted while the fat fish largescale traffickers are comparatively i mmune and can pay bribes to escape prosecution brazil background brazils country profile cp uses data from special population surveys of students street children and patients and research on sex workers and others br oader population survey data are not available intranasal cocaine hydrochloride use predominates but cases of crack smoking appear among urban poor in areas such as sao paulo prevalence is attributed to brazils role as trafficking route to the u s and europe key informant studies kis in sao paulo and rio janeiro are summarized separately rio janeiro and sao paulo also participated at the natural history study patterns of cocaine use student surveys indicate that cocaine users total less than 1 of the general student population typically with intranasal use of 05 grams hydrochloride appearing among male students in their middle to late teens other forms of use such as crack smoking nd injected cocaine hydrochloride were found among street children especially in sao paulo where lif etime prevalence of cocaine use among street children increased from 252 in 1987 to 463 in 1993 past year cocaine use among brazilian street children was reported at 156 for males and 201 for females in 1993 compared to alcohol cannabis inhalants and most other drugs the use of cocaine is actually quite small however alcohol and cannabis are often used in combination with cocaine due to their greater prevalence in the surveyed populations the cp notes that cocaine hydrochloride was initially use d in recreational manner among the higher socioeconomic classes though use was considered socially unacceptable to the general population recent trends suggest increased use including injecting among the lower classes the cp reports that injecting resu lts from curiosity or from participation in illegal trafficking activities hospitalizations cited in the profile indicate that cocaine admissions were dominated by males between the ages of 18 and 30 larger numbers and increases in admissions occurred mainly for urban areas in southeastern and southern brazil surveys point to continued increase in cocaine use primarily in the major cities of sao paulo and rio janeiro this expansion includes growth in the frequency of injecting and crack smoking in sao paulo consequences of cocaine use the cp notes increases of brazilian hospital admissions due to cocaine use nevertheless suc h numbers are minor in relation to admissions for alcoholre lated problems larger percentages of cocaine complaints are reported in rio janeiro and sao paulo the majority of aids cases found in the southeastern part of brazil are also related to injecting of cocaine the cp directly attributes cocaine use to brazils status as transshipment point for trafficking from colombia and bolivia to the united states and europe socially use remains unacceptable but trafficking has become profitable industry for the very poorest residents of brazils urban centres responses the cp describes how the dynamics of responses to co caine use in brazil are impacted by the legal and political climate of the country primary drug laws outlaw trafficking and possession however more severe penalties exist for trafficking than for cases of possession trafficking draws 25 year prison sentence while possession often results in mandatory treatment if convicted offender is determined to be dependent however the profile outlines criticism of the law due to its lack of distinction between casual users intensive users and traffickers treatment programmes are handled in psychiatric hospitals or drug treatment clinics services offer broad treatment for drug problems and none are specific to cocaine additional treatment is available through therapeutic communities and at religious outpatient clinics the profile notes that treat ment varies from pharmacological to psychological to workbased and traditional or folk religion therapies most programmes are reimbursed or funded directly by the government the profile outlines complex hierarchy of agencies which administer the national policy on d rugs problems with this highly complex network have pr evented the effective development of national prevention and education programme this has left pr evention efforts in the hands of local religious labour or community groups since government approva l is necessary to coordinate largescale state or national programmes published materials ar limited and cebrid offers the only continuously published drug information bulletin in the country television campaigns were noted as heavily dependent on scare tactics most are developed in the united states and are not adapted to local audiences consequently messages have little cultural relevance primary issue for consideration raised in the cp is the heavy political focus on brazils position in the cocaine trade routes most political action is aimed at halting the trafficking problem throughout the country external influence on policy especially from the usa prevents effective action on drug prevention and education the cp also argues that highly exaggerated negative stereotypes promoted in media campaigns may actually heighten curiosity about drugs the cp stresses need to bala nce efforts in treatment and prevention with the trafficking focus rio janeiro brazil introduction the rio janeiro participating centre completed key informant study kis and contributed to the brazil country profile which is summarized separately key feature of the rio kis was the disparity between the wider population and the poor in rios 600 favelas or slums about onethird of rios 6 million residents live in slums drug use and trafficking reflect social and economic disparities dependence and other complications from cocaine injection were common and slums are centres for trafficking patterns of cocaine use the rio kis identifies four patterns of cocaine use the first is recreational where use focuses on social activity hedonistictransgressor use is ttributed to social rebellion commercial use refers to involvement in trafficking finally dys functional use reflects intensive and dependent or problem use cocaine use predominates among members of middle or upper middle classes and students and among poor residents of the favela sl ums cocaine hydrochloride is the main product employed and intranasal use dominates injecting is rarer and associated mainly with slums anecdotal reports indicate that some women inject cocaine to relieve preme nstrual tension or pain users often join networks most are males with vari ed education levels most use begins in the mid teens out of curiosity and peer influence most u is considered recreational taking place at dancing parties or discos average use was said to total 2 to 3 grams per week kis professional consultants felt that dependence fosters continued use while u ser and intermediary consultants suggest that pleasurable effects promote more use cocaine ffects were described as euphoria excitement and power and depression as the effects wear off alcohol is commonly used to enhance or reduce these effects pleasant sensations encourage tinued use and intensification of use while males predominate other groups were also described some felt that women use less cocaine but become masculine which in turn influences their sex drive child ren use occurs when they work as gobetweens for traffickers street ch ildren were also said to use cocaine cocaine is widely available and use is limited only by police action or lack of money only cannabis and alcohol are more accessible most purchases are made through dealers in the slums cocaine is sold in small parcels with an average cost of us 1000 crack is uncommon groups contribute money for purchases or theft and wages from trafficking are used to fund purchases the quality of hydrochloride varies substantially and consultants agreed that cocaine is invariably cut wi th substances such as sugar salt starch ma rble powder baking soda or boric acid consequences of cocaine use consultants agreed on the broad negative influence of cocaine on the community the disparit between the general public and the favelas was not ed by an acceptance of use and trafficking in slums the main impact is on work study and fina nces health effects were noted as weight loss respiratory problems and fatigue some mental health problems were reported including emotional instability paranoia and tension aggression associated with withdrawal was said to st rain family and social ties consultants disagreed on the effects of cocaine on sexual drive users and intermedia ries indicated an increase in sex drive with use while professionals note decrease much of this vari ation reflects distinctions between recreational and intensive use however there was an indica tion of lowered inhibitions which might promote homosexua l or group sex activity lowered inhibitions may contribute to an increased risk of hivaids thr ough unsafe sex some also described concerns about needle sharing among injecting drug users professi onals noted that the number of injecting drug users with hiv infection in rio is increasing responses several treatment services were noted including psychological support facilities self help groups outpatient and residential services consultants indi cated that most clients are intensive or heavy users facilities are staffed by health professionals religious members social workers or exusers who performed as counsellors some claim st aff exploitation of patients is common laws against trafficking and possession were describ ed as largely ineffective and corruption is seen as rampant respondents suggested that some police run the drug market most recommended more severe laws and enforcement against traffickers but feit cocaine use should be subjected to less stringent laws prevention programmes were considered ineffective most are media programmes produced in the united states and have relevance for brazilian cu lture programmes appear hypocritical as they focus on illicit drugs but ignore alcohol and t obacco recommendations suggested schoolbased programmes with better trained educators and culturallyrelevant and realistic campaigns sao paulo brazii introduction brazils country profile cp is summarized separately the sao paulo key informant study kis identified larger group of crack users than is f ound in other regions while other cocaine products are available cracks low cost and wide availability c ontribute to its extensive use among sao paulos large population of urban poor moreover crack smoking is vi ewed as clean alternative to the hivaids risks of injecting patterns of cocaine use the primary coca products reported by kis consulta nts were cocaine hydrochloride powder and crack powder is generally inhaled and used mainly by young wealthy or middle class males of note one consultant familiar with the prison system reporte d that injection is favoured and virtually endemic among prison inmates few other consultants describe extensive intravenous use of cocaine crack was identified as highly popular product among the urban poor in favelas or slums cocaine use was described as extensive for all social classes in sao paulo while the age of users varied from 13 to 45 consultants indicated that most are between the ages of 16 and 25 the kis describes cocaine use as groupbased most networks of 8 to 12 individuals involve members who are 18 to 25 years old predominantly male he terosexual and unmarried kis consultants contend that networks are formed through commonalities such as friendship or shared social classes the kis offers breakdown of user characteristics including gender age class education level occupation prior arrest residence pattern recreational activities marital status ethnicity and sexual orientation the kis found that clear differences in crack and hydrochloride use appear in association with socioeconomic class private recreational use of i nhaled hydrochloride is specific to middle and upper class user groups by contrast crack cocaine is smoked intensively by poorer individuals from the slums crack is made appealing to the poor because of its availability and low cost both crack and hydrochloride are purchased from passador or dealers in small packets of 05 to 10 gram which sell for about us 800 again crack is usually less expensive while powder varies more in price and quality hydrochloride is imported by tra ffickers while crack is produced locally in the city by heating mixtures of hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate while most transactions are for cash few kis consultants reported instances where women offer sex in exchange for cocaine consequences of cocaine use while kis consultants agree that cocaine has negative effects for the community they also i ndicated that the general public is misinformed about use most described social problems associated with cocaine use such as increased crime social aliena tion of users and family conflict some note the potential for health problems such as aids but most argue that the switch from inject ing to crack smoking reduces exposure to hiv most stress that so ciety exaggerates the negative characteristics of users cocaine was considered the scapegoat of society the effects of cocaine for users differed between hydrochloride sniffers injectors and crack smokers recreational users who inhale hydrochlor ide have better self image and experience few problems from use injecting users and crack smokers evidence more harmful effects of intensive use crack users and injectors are more likely to have low self esteem and stronger dependence all cocaine use may cause financial problems but recr eational users are less likely to face hardship unless frequency of use increases kis consultants so suggest that cocaine users may experience interpersonal conflicts but again these probl ems are far more common for crack users responses kis consultants characterize treatment services as inadequate services include public and private facilities offering wide range of therapeutic and psychotherapeutic treatments still private facilities were assumed to be too expensive for most problem users and public services are insufficient for the number of users with cocai nerelated use problems these limitations reduce confidence in the efficacy of care most consultants are aware of brazilian laws for trafficking and possession and cite 25 year prison sentence for such offences however most felt that the current system is inefficient and rife with corruption one offered the opinion that the actual ws in brazil are 1st with money you are free 2nd without it you are in jail prevention campaigns known to kis consultants we re those offered in schools and churches and media presentations imported from the united states all were described as poorly designed misleading and dependent on exa ggeration and scare tactics usa media campaigns were also deemed irrelevant to brazilian culture consultants of the kis did offer strategies that they felt would effectively deal with the growing cocaine problem in sao paulo these included the decriminalization of cocaine and promotion of responsible use expansion and improvement of both treatment and prevention programmes and the reorganization of police agencies to eliminate corruption above all consultants stressed that other drugs such as alcohol pose far greater problem for the health and wellbeing of residents than does the use of cocaine canada introduction canada compiled country profile cp and the pa rticipating centre in british columbia completed key informant study kis patterns of cocaine use the cp reports that cocaine is frequently combined with alcohol or cannabis cocaine hydrochloride is the main product used and crack is uncommon th cp notes that cocaine use peaked around 1980 the lifetime prevalence for hydrochloride and crack use is 3 the kis describes two types of user the first is recr eational use of hydrochloride used intranasally or smoked with tobacco or cannabis second is depe ndent steady or binge users dependent steady users tend to inject while binge users smoke crack or freebase the cp concludes that use focuses among unmarried males aged 25 to 34 and among male and female street youths still the kis stresses that use transects demographics except for the very young crack users may be younger than users of other routes and products the cp cites highest risk for use among aboriginal peoples street youth referees for drug and alcohol treatment and those convicted of cannabis possession it also found some regional variations in prevalence the highest levels of cocaine use are found in british columbia alberta ontario and quebec prevalence of drug use respondents to general survey on nonmedical use in british columbia in 1986 percentage data drug overall 1825 yrs 2634 yrs 35yrs alcohol 9521 9695 9951 9363 amphetamines 605 1527 1199 292 barbiturates 249 637 467 127 cannabis 3324 7146 7065 1625 cocaine 1121 2614 2966 339 designer drugs 069 240 159 018 hallucinogens 1043 2230 2533 414 heroin 102 175 216 054 inhalants 232 609 464 107 the kis notes that cocaine is easily obtained through phone call or visit to private residence many dealers deliver supplies most are introduced to cocaine by friend at party consequences of cocaine use the cp notes popular myths that cocaine use inev itably produces severe problems and that use is growing epidemically however use in canada does not typically cause even minor physical or social problems and use remains confined to small minor ity of individuals the few who suffer serious or chronic effects are usually intensive users health re ports are largely psychiatric in nature primarily paranoia anger anxiety and irritability the kis f ound that exaddicts list more negative effects of use recreational users report positive results claiming that cocaine provides energy for work or study and enhances creativity they consider violence nd paranoia to be rare except for addicts the cp reports that dependence is the most feared outcome of use crack is said to be highly addictive and to cause serious mental and physical damage violence and crime however cp and kis data reveal that dependence is very uncommon few recreational users intensify use over time or experience financial distress though addicts are of ten made insolvent by cocaine expenditures key risk is the spread of hiv the kis notes negative views of condom use and suggests sex workers earn more if condoms are not used responses the kis found contrasting views on care among professi onals and users professionals and exusers insist that goals must include abstinence while user s prefer that care includes detoxification reducing drug use and emphasis on improving or maintain ing health without requiring abstinence professionals also tend to see care as effective while users appear positive to extremely negative or uninterested the cp found that many resolve problem use by modifying patterns and cease use without formal care canadas drug strategy emphasizes prevention and education but policy still focuses on enforcement the drug awareness programme uses police to address school and community groups programmes target youths street kids dropouts aboriginal s unemployed women seniors and families federal programmes are specific to cocaine the kis reports that warnings on the dangers of drug use are ineffective the cp questions if education is preventing drug use or creating generation of sceptics who increasingly scoff at the sensationalized messages presented to them also needle exchanges face public opposition and government restri ction to some aids represents means to control drug use more than needle exch anges represent means to control aids trafficking penalties draw seven years to life imprisonment however the cp found that cessation of use is motivated by health family and occupationa l concerns rather than by legal fears the kis asserts that street level users and dealers are more likely to face arrest and prison than do private users and dealers cocaines illegal status elevates price promoting theft and prostitution prison rehabilitation programmes are also viewed as ineffective nondrug using kis participants recommend legaliz ing cocaine to reduce harm from contaminated forms and uncontrolled doses whereas some cocaine users support stronger legal sanctions against drug use and trafficking colombia introduction country profile cp was compiled for colombia and the medellin participating centre comple ted key informant study kis these provide informati on on the use and distribution of cocaine in one of the major cocaine producing countries in south america colombia has population of 33 777 550 and the medellin kis site is major industria l and commercial centre with 1 698 000 residents columbia is characterized by the use of cocaine hydrochloride through inhalation and the smoking of coca paste with either tobacco or marihuana the country maintains strong social sanctions against use significant cocainerelated violence was reported in the kis and cp patterns of cocaine use cocaine use is mentioned for all social classes of colombia and medellin the dominant pattern of use is inhalation of cocaine hydrochloride or perico among the wealthy and middle class lower socioeconomic classes were reported to smoke coca p aste or basuco however both the cp and kis indicated that basuco has gained in popularity among all levels of cocaine users due to its low cost and widespread availability typical cocaine users are between the ages of 15 and 30 with heaviest use in the 20 to 30 age range most initiate use in their late teens through friends the cp cites alcohol as common precursor to cocaine use the cp reports that males represent twothirds of all users and that most users are unmarried the percen tage of users of the two main coca products are indicated in the following tables taken from th cp the table indicates higher percentages of medellin residents engaged in use this is explai ned in both the cp and kis as result medellins status as major urban centre lower income th unemployed students and

hydrochloride costs col 2000 to col 4000 per gram quality is said to be poor and it is cut or adu lterated with substances such as flour talcum detergent bicarbonate anal gesics and ground brick dealers sell cocaine in various public arras consequences of cocaine use both cp and kis contend that major consequence of cocaine is violence taken against paste users society commonly regards such u sers as degenerates or disposab violence was described as common group called milicias populares apply terrori st acts against users pushers and dealers in popular neighbourhoods while rural gue rrilla groups punish users often with death although they are also said to facilitate production and trafficking responses the cp notes several treatment programmes supported by government private and religious sources these include detoxification hospitals outpatient cen tres therapeutic communities inpatient centres support groups and guidance and prevention centres the kis indicates that user knowledge about service availability is somewhat limited the cp nd kis both assert that paste users are more highly represented in therapy at these agencies prevention programmes mentioned in the cp consis t primarily of public sc hool education developed and supported by national government s educational materials discuss drugs in general and offer little direct information on cocaine the kis informan ts expressed little or knowledge of prevention campaigns legal responses outlined in the cp indicate that arr est is based on the amount of cocaine in possession quantities of gram or less are attributed to persona l use which is punishable by 30 days in jail and small fine larger amounts are attributed to trafficking which increases the penalty possess ion of less than 100 grams is punished by 1 to 3 years in prison larger quantities draw 4 to 12 year sentence kis consultants indicated that police are more likely to act against users than producers and traffickers corruption was described as substantial problem ecuador introduction ecuador compiled country profile cp and the participating centre in quito completed key informant study kis ecuador is notable as transshipment centr but is not currently engaged in largescale coca production patterns of cocaine use historically ecuador supported traditional coca leaf us this faded after it was declared illegal the country now operates as major transport site and laundering base for funds cultivation has recently emerged but is limited lack of police resources and alternative crops fosters potential for growth in t he industry marijuana remains the most commonly used illicit dr ug ecuador has large population of young people and the cp indicates that many experience financ ial and family problems which contribute to high consumption rates in this group still general use remains low though both cp and kis note potential for increased use as cocaine enters local mark ets social sanctions against use are high cocaine hydrochloride and coca paste base are available they are used in wide range of social classes and users experience less stigma the cp and kis s uggest such use may be sustained over time paste smoking is described as more prevalent since it is cheap and more available it is used almost exclusively by those with lower economic status and it yields more social rejection most users are males users range in age from 18 64 years coca paste smokers tend to be males around age 20 hydrochloride is more common for males in their 30s the cp reports total of 400 000 illegal drug users 30 000 of whom need treatment consequences of cocaine use the cp reports that hydrochloride use is associated w ith rare cases of suicide or depression but paste is associated with higher rates of hospitalization suicide depression and linquency kis respondents report many physical and mental health consequences of use but most are attributed to intensive use mainly paste smoking several also cite decline in social and family relations and religious ties responses inpatient and outpatient care are offered as are alte rnative therapies such as acupuncture urban centres operate telephone hotline for depende nce questions care may range fro m two months to five years prevention uses media and schoolbased campaigns possession use cultivation processing and distribution are all illegal penalties are imprisonment and fines the government is actively involved in suppression of cultivation and trafficking at this tim cocaine is not mainstay in the national economy egypt introduction egypt produced country profile cp and the cair participating centre completed key informant study kis for that site patterns of cocaine use before world war 1 the most common drugs in egyp t were alcohol hashish and opium cocaine briefly appeared at this time but was supplanted by opium cocaine reappeared in the 1980s but remains restricted to the wealthy it is often combined w ith other drugs since pure cocaine is extremely costly and supplies are limited the cp points out that egypt is not cocaine producing country but does represent consumer base and potential transshipment point one 1992 study found that cocaine was the least popular drug this is partly attributed to its high cost it is currently estimated that only 006 of the population has tried cocaine still the cp and kis indicate that dealers and users easily hide activities and some reports suggest that use is rising hashish remains the m ost traditional and popular drug in egypt the kis concludes that use is restricted to cocaine hydrochloride routes of administration include intranasal smoking injecting or rubbing cocaine on gums teeth and eyelashes males and females both use but male users are more common users range in age from 2060 years though use predominates in the 2035 year age gr oup the main determinant is wealth since cocaine is very expensive individuals typica lly use 0125 to 3 grams daily total use increases with dependence and users may shift from intr anasal to intravenous use or rub cocaine on mucosal surfaces to intensify the effect consequences of cocaine use both the cp and kis cite increased risk for physical and mental health problems particularly when use is intensive dependency is cons idered common and use is thought to pose increased risk for unsafe sex and needle sharing however many emphasize that cohol and other drugs pose greater risks for health responses the cp concludes that treatment capabilities are strong but are designed for general drug treatment care includes governmental public and private fac ilities many new centres have opened and now tend to be separated from psychiatric hospitals so that patients suffer less stigma kis respondents expressed dissatisfaction with the quality of care the cp describes national prevention programme whic h offers education early intervention and treatment recent legislation poses strict penalties for drug cultivation and trafficking but permits treatment options the total number of cocaine cases increased between 1988 and 1991 from 18 to 32 kis respondents pr oved poorly informed on cocaine laws maldives background the maldives compiled country profile cp but did not complete key informant study kis because very low levels of illicit drug use are found in the republic of maldives it is believed that the few drugs confiscated in the maldives are not meant for the local market but that the maldives serves as transit point for smugglers narcotic drug seizures in general have increased from 1126 kilograms in 1985 to 11 7511 kilograms in 1993 patterns of cocaine use the cp indicates that form of cocaine use exists at present surveillance data from 1992 indicate that the predominant drugs used are cannabis benzodiazepines and most recently heroin brown sugar however the total number of users is ex tremely small of the few hundred drug users in the country most reside in the capital male these nd to be students returning from studies abroad especially from india and sri lanka interviews with drug users found that none had ever seen cocaine except on television only 1 of drug users under age 24 express interest in experime nting with cocaine and only 2 of drug users over 24 years of age demonstrate an interest in trying cocaine introduction into drug use occurs exclusively through friends there is pushing or active marketing of illegal drugs and organized underground or criminal distribution system exists responses to cocaine use currently there is effort to treat or rehabilitate users to date authorities have received request s for rehabilitation or treatment drug prevention programme was recently initiated involving the distribution of pamphlets to school children and liv callin programmes broadcast on tv and radio also major initiative brought together all of the atoll chiefs to educate them to deliver preventi on programmes in their respective islands penalties for cocaine use are severe and include maximum of 22 years imprisonment and fine there is distinction between penalties based on different types or classes of illicit drugs and there is sentence reduction on the basis of first offende r status penalties are largely determined by the quantity of the drug seized rather than offenderbased attributes police report that drug enforcement is complicated by difficulty in accessing and surveillance of the many islands drug suspects are exempt from the current law whic h provides for more than 15 days detention without court appearance consequently it is po ssible to keep suspects under arrest or protective custody for indefinite periods pending trial mexico background mexicos country profile cp and key informant study

source ortiz 1993 sex was often associated with use and the kis re ports homosexual activity as common in use or to obtain drug typically use first occurs in the late teens through friends and prior history of alc ohol and marihuana use is usual the cp found that st udents tend to experiment more and have higher population of occasional users use rates are growing irsd data suggest growth in the population which has ever tried cocaine from 16 in 1986 to 16 in 1993 regions with histor of use are those closest to the us border and trafficking routes and tourist or industrial areas such as paz baja california and monterrey the cp suggests that migrants to the usa also gain exposur to use point supported by rates of returning migrants admitted for withdrawal symptoms in mexico cocaine is considered highly accessible in mexico purc hases usually total 1 to 2 grams at cost of 100 to 200 pesos the purity and quality vary with the users economic class wealthier users pay more but obtain higher quality hydrochloride cocaine is cut with products such as sugar or sodium bicarbonate consequences of cocaine use both cp and kis describe negative community attit udes about use though the cp also reports that some subgroups are more tolerant than are othe rs males the poor and young people aged 15 to 29 appear more accepting while use remains more discr eet for the wealthy and the hidden nature of use may strain social relations health effects noted in the kis were limited to sinus and nasal problems headaches and rare cases of heart and blood pressure problems the cp found that health records associate problems of overdose or interaction with use of alcohol or tranquilizers psychological effects like depression irritability or paranoia are more common with heavy use increased ri sk of hiv is tied to unsafe sex encouraged by the disinhibiting effects of cocaine one major conse quence of use is legal problems particularly as barrier to drug access however such problems appear greater for the poor the kis refers to police corruption as pervasive responses many treatment options are noted public care and ps ychiatric hospitals offer psychological social or medical interventions as do private care facilities and selfhelp groups such as narcotics anony mous and drug addicts anonymous the kis describes treatment facilities as targeted mainly at hard core addicts prevention includes school programmes and teacher training two nationwide programmes the programme for prevention education on addictions and the national programme against drug abuse address prevention from value and mental health pe rspectives kis consultants however were not familiar with prevention programmes legal codes focus on three areas addiction is not pr osecuted personal use of small amounts is minor offence drawing small penalty for first conviction larger possession of cocaine heroin or opium are prosecuted as trafficking and receive 10 to 25 years imprisonment depending on amount seized kis informants view police corruption as serious and widespread problem major recommendations in both reports concentrate on the need for further research into social and cultural factors in prevention and reduction in cocaine use and harm in mexican society republic of korea introduction korea produced country profile cp and the participating centre in seoul completed key informant study kis the reports agree that cocaine use remains extremely rare in korea but consultants report the presence of both cocaine hydrochloride and crack suggesting potential for increased use in the future patterns of cocaine use koreas kis found that cocaine use is very rare the cp concludes that methamphetamine poses mo re concern as it is favoured for its availability low pri ce potency and longterm effect the cp found that drugusing adolescents in detention used solvents cannabis or methamphetamine most adult drug users in seoul use solvents and cannabis but few use cocaine and other drugs adult drug use in seoul survey of 1422 seoul residents substance number of users cannabis 18 organic solvents 15 cocaine 8 methamphetamine 3 morphine 3 other drugs 110 kis data indicates that hydrochloride is preferred product but few report use of crack purchases usually total under 2 grams and cocaine is taken once or twice week the main route of administration is intranasal injection is rare as is smoking koreas cp found that cocaine is popularly seen as an expensive drug taken in large doses by wealthy north americans including koreans living in the united states use in korea tends to be restricted to uppermiddle class businessmen who travel abroad the kis describes users as wealthy college educated males aged 20 to 30 many are said to work in the entertainment industry the kis reports that initial use begins in this same 20 to 30 year age group most are introduced to cocaine by friend at private home party or hotel where they initially use less than one gram of hydrochloride intranasally for reasons of curiosity to experience pleasant sensation or merely because it is suggested cocaine supplies are extremel limited lt is easier to obtain cannabis benzodiazepines and amphetamines cocaine is also very expensive co sting us 450 to us 500 for 1 to 2 grams the cp mentions form of cocaine paste that is less costly than hydrochloride but this product is not clearly described while cocaine is usually purchased some may offer cocaine in exchange for r sex use generally occurs with close friends during sexual the netherlands l intercourse at pa rties and music activities after drinking or when under stress and combined with alcohol sedatives or cannabis consequences of cocaine use kis consultants report that use harms work performan ce finances physical health and mental health some may experience insomnia depression hopelessnes s and irritability however such effects are largely linked to heavy use others assert that use enhances creativity artistic sensitivity and performance all of the kis participants describe cocaine as addictive most try to curb use by substituting alcohol or avoiding use environments some become dependent and increase the quantity and frequency of use and vary pr oduct and route of administration shifting from hydrochloride to crack or from intranasal to injection use most users believe that there is little risk for hiv transmission since injection use is still quite rare and most report that injecting users do not share n eedles and that users in general practice safe sex however one professional felt that risk increases because sex partners may include prostitutes the kis reports that cocaine use might harm relationships with family and friends there is litt public acceptance of cocaine and users may suffer w selfesteem few also associate use with risk for violence destructive behaviour or accidents responses the kis reports that drug use is treated as legal problem and punishmentoriented policies are employed to control use some stress that such severe drug penalties pose barriers to treatment as users fear exposure and arrest both the cp and kis recommend treating cocaine as health issue the cp reports that in 1988 the ministry of health and social affairs initiated drug education programme targeting high school students still public drug prevention is hardly visible the korean public is ignorant about cocaine and drugs in general the cp warns that international policing efforts need to be carefully weighted to avoid linkage to the imperialistic or colonial foreign policies of some western nations the netherlands introduction the netherlands compiled country profile cp but did not conduct key informant study kis the country is notable for its active approach to treatment prevention and harm reduction patterns of cocaine use cocaine has been available in the country si nce 1870 dutch colonies in indonesia developed plantations which produced particularly potent variet of coca use declined in the 1930s but resurged in the 1970s while cocaine was once viewed as an lite substance it is now illegal and classified as hard drug having lost its positive image as use spread through social classes cocaine is now associated with opioid such as heroin users public opinion on cocaine varies somewhat on the basis of route of administration these are more diverse for cocaine than for other drugs as it is inhaled intranasally smoked freebased injected smeared on the gums or genital tissues or ingested intranasal use predominates and is favoured by half of all users the netherlands cp lists two user categories the first are those who usually sniff small doses of cocaine at social gatherings the second category freebases or injects to obtain stronger yet brie fer effects in daily or dependent manner nonopioid users indicate that only junkies inject though freebasing is accepted the cp notes that crack use is gaining popularity among heroin users sniffers use less cocaine than do injectors or freebasers on study in amsterdam indicates that 88 of first time cocaine users try the product with friends there is little information on the prevalence of cocaine use in the netherlands studies do indicat that in urban areas such as amsterdam and rotterdam less than 5 of those over the age of 12 have ever used cocaine figures are smaller in rural areas info rmation is available from ladis national alcohol and drug information system which is registration system recording data from centres providing treatment for persons with alcohol drug andor ga mbling problems in 1992 cocaine users represented 223 of all drug treatment cases ladis total and percentages of cocaine clients clients where cocaine

netherlands cp contends that most cocaine users do not engage in polydrug use although most opioid users also use cocaine both heroin and cocaine are used openly at home and in public elsewhere cocaine is considered social drug nevertheless the cp indicates that cocai ne and alcohol are often combined because cocaine neutralizes the ne gative effects of alcohol other drugs tend to be taken to enhance cocaine effects tobacco alcohol and cannabis are all used more frequently than is cocaine consequences of cocaine use rotterdam study describes diverse user styles and their relationship to consequences in burgundian use cocaine plays minor role and is luxury u sed at special social occasions use is discreet and cocaine is shared only with close friends another ty pe is an experience use style where cocaine is tried out of curiosity third type of use is situationa l or in select conditions eg work or to create special social occasion like that of burgundian use fourth use style is distinctive in this group cocaine plays significant role in lifestyle and such u sers retain social ties primarily with other cocaine users fifth hedonistic style involves unbridled pleasure seeking with intensive or binge use limited in time and producing health problems the sixth style is routine and involves stable long term use without negative consequences seventh pattern is polydrug use where opiates and cocaine are combined and use is associated with harddrug subculture with higher levels of dependence physical psychological nd financial problems and criminal behaviour the final use style is the cocainist who uses only cocaine but in compulsive or dependent manner and may experience more physical psychological and financial problems the cp associates such use with disrupte d childhood and suggests these users see themselves as addicts responses the netherlands is considered unique in their appr oach to drug treatment wide range of services are available and include programmes to treat dependen ce and userelated problems and to reintegrate the patient into society therapeutic communities play ma jor role in this effort most facilities treat opioid use problems and many offer methadone some larger cities offer treatment for cocaine including counselling psychotherapy group ther apy and family therapy drugfree prison units are also available for prisoners trying to treat their dependence prevention is integrated into school curricula from th primary levels the media is not extensively used since it is deemed less effective prevention progra mmes more often focus on risky behaviours such as alcohol smoking and other drug use and gambling goals include keeping occasional cocaine users from becoming dependent or from developing usere lated problems harm reduction is active and includes needle exchange programmes and condom distribution to prevent spread of hiv most programmes focus on heroin and there is need for more information which addresses cocaine nigeria introduction the country profile cp for nigeria and the key informant study kis completed with consultants from ibadan and lagos points to expanded use of co caine particularly crack

hydrochloride with tobacco or intranasal use most initiate use in the teens or early twenties with friends cocaine is described as highly available hydrochlorid and crack are sold in pinch 12 gram or chunk 1 gram quantities for 1 per pinch to 50 per chunk varying by the exclusiveness of the dealer and drug purity hydrochloride may be cut with sucrose consequences of cocaine use kis respondents only indirectly link use with health problems mainly from poor nutrition due to appetite loss and lost income some suggest use may also alter personality or produce paranoia but others note that users may feel more confident ert and talkative for some use negatively affects work study social relations recreational or religi ous activity few link use to road accidents though the cp points out that nigeria already has one of th worlds highest rates of road accident unemployed users may turn to crime to fund purchases and others ar financially ruined by use few may be more prone to irritability or violence responses most treatment is offered through government opera ted psychiatric hospitals and units in teaching hospitals patients and relatives ma ke financial contributions for care therefore kis respondents suggest that care is restricted to those who can afford it the kis professional consultants say t hat services lack staffing training and equipment there are community based outpatient services specific to cocaine care involves detoxifi cation and rehabilitation through counselling and psychotherapy the kis also describe traditional curing and faithhealing treatments the cp explai ns that nigerians attribute drugrelated problems to spells and seek lasting solution from faith and traditional healers employee assistance programmes and drugfree workplace policies are promoted as is drug demand reduction unit for education in schools the nati onal drug law enforcement agency also promotes demand reduction though none specifically target cocai ne most kis respondents view such prevention as ineffective cocaine seizures have increased dramatically from approximately 43 kilograms in 1990 to over 200 kilograms in 1992 penalties vary including maximum of 10 years imprisonment for use and 20 years for international trafficking courts have discreti on in sentencing mainly for first time offenders the cp reports that law enforcement officials view current policy as an effective deterrent but kis consultants consider prosecution ineffective the kis advocates employing exusers in treatment units and using clergy for spiritual rehabilitat ion most kis respondents also advocate combin ation of supply reducti on and demand reduction strategies few support legalization or decriminali zation and the treatment of use as health issue peru introduction peru compiled country profile cp and the li ma participating centre produced key informant study kis peru is notable as country for cu ltivation production and distribution of cocaine and for the traditional practice of coca leaf chewing of concern is rapid growth in coca paste smoking in some social groups patterns of cocaine use coca leaf has been used in peru since at least 5000 bc and is still used by indigenous quechuas and aymaras and by fishermen and miners leaf is used in traditional medicine and chewed during work cocaine hydrochloride is largely restricted to hi gher classes most hydrochloride users are described as educated while professionals who experience few userelated problems most engage in weekly or special occasion use of 15 grams in social groups at bars nightclubs parties and private homes cocaine hydrochloride is only rarely injected or used in nasal drop solutions while cocaine is an illegal drug use is not punished coca paste use has developed only in the last twenty years it is widely recognized and is smoked in cigarettes coca paste is describ ed as the main drug in peru followed by cannabis and alcohol the kis suggests that most paste smokers are uneducated members of the middle and lower class and of mixed ethnicity many are described as unemployed or students and most make daily use of paste totalling as much as 15 grams per day

common and that 104 of peruvian men have tried coca paste while 41 have tried hydrochloride ve ry few women report any use 15 report use of paste and 02 report trying hydrochloride coca leaf chewing is more common leaf has been used by 339 of men and 20 of women despite its prevalence the kis was unable to detail leaf use consequences of cocaine use the kis identifies trend towards increased use over time for both hydrochloride and paste informants consider paste more addictive and associate it more of ten with crime paste users are also described as manipulative and irritable with family and friends women who use paste during pregnancy are said to suffer problems including anecdotal accounts of deformed children responses the cp and kis describe variety of inpatient nd outpatient treatment facilities some traditional healers are also said to treat dependency the kis describes problems with treatment rgely associated with lack of trained medical and counselling staff and the jack of wellstructured and coordinated programmes prevention is taught in schools through mass media and in some prisons cedro the centre of information and education for drug abuse was recognized by most kis informants but most also note need for more government invol vement and better organization legal responses described in the cp and kis in clude fines and imprisonment penalties vary dramatically from two years to life depending upon offences associated with manufacture sale and trafficking personal use is not subjected to pro secution some kis respondents suggest that cocaine markets foster corruption russian federation introduction russia produced country profile cp and the st petersburg participating centre completed key informant study kis data largely reflect use patterns in st petersburg and reflect less about the country as whole results show incipient cocai ne use mostly recreational use of cocaine hydrochloride in select subgroups patterns of cocaine use cocaine entered russia after world war 1 most use was by previously privileged classes and the homeless and was spurred by alcohol prohibition problems emerged in the army and among children and teenagers the cp reports that in 1925 48 of those arrested had sniffed cocaine as stimulant or to stem hunger by the early 1930s homelessness declined and the cocaine epidemic faded there are epidemiological data on prevalence in russia but use appears uncommon largely because of cost most use occurs among the wealth students musicians and artists users range from 13 to 40 years old and most are male majority make intranasal use of hydrochloride but cocaine is sometimes smoked or injected the cp notes rare cases of exclusive cocaine use but both cp and kis indicate that most cocaine users have prior drug history cocaine is also used most often in combination with alcohol or tobacco to prolong its effect cannabis and homemade heroin are more available and cocaines cost restricts the prevalence of use many believe that cocaine does not lead to dependence consequences of cocaine use there is little social awareness of cocaine but elders are less tolerant of drug use since use is limited it is difficult to speak of any associations or importance of various coca products most initiate use out of curiosity and with friends and use tends to occur at parties dances or in casinos total use may increase over time fostering family or social conflict responses variety of treatment services are available for users of all types of drugs these include inpati ent and outpatient programmes as well as selfhelp groups and physician care in the kis some professionals believe that the problem with these programmes lie in inadequate provision with medication and the personnel schools offer prevention programmes and the city cent re for preventive medicine trains teachers in health promotion women in prenatal care are told about harm associated with use of alcohol tobacco and drugs the media also supports prevention programmes in russia it is illegal to sell warehouse produce or introduce minors to drugs penalties are one t ten years imprisonment law enforcement focu ses on trafficking and preventive work spain introduction spain compiled country profile cp and the pa rticipating centre in barcelona completed key informant study kis spain is notable as major drug distribution centre for europe making products such as cocaine heroin and cannabis highly accessible patterns of cocaine use limited use began in the 1920s and broadened somewhat in the 1970s it is now significant illegal drug personal use is not penalized but since 1992 public use can be fined it is still considered an elite drug of the beautiful people concern increased in the mid1980s as drug seizures and hospitalization for cocaine problems increased heroin continues to pose serious problems in spain while cocaine is considered relatively safe often recreational drug with the exception of the heroin subculture and of dysfunctional use situations cross sectional surveys estimate lifetime prevalence of cocaine use at 3 for the general population and 5 for those aged 15 to 29 1989 study on drug mo rtality found that 17 of blood and 26 of urine tests were positive for cocaine while these data suggest increasing use rates still re present small proportion of the population particularly in relati on to heroin use of note 90 of the 1989 drug mortality cases studied were attributed to heroin cannabis has the highest use rate and almost all cocaine users have taken hallucinogens cannabis and alcohol cocaine and alcohol are regularly combined only 3 of users have used crack both the cp and kis report that most use is initia ted with friends kis respondents in barcelona claim that initiation usually takes place around the age of 20 and most involves intranasal use only he roin users begin use by injecting use does not disrupt relationships except in cases of dependency users openly use cocaine usually in nightclubs or at parti use tends to be concealed only if employed at work typically one member of group of users conducts most purchases at private homes most users are males between 2529 years and repr esent all social and economic levels though most belong to the middle class the kis attributes cocaine access to spains role as european transshipment point the cost is us 7590 per gram cocaine use tends to increase over time although most appear to regulate use with relative ease most use is intranasal though some inject or smoke cocaine with tobacco the kis reports that both in jection and needle sharing is rare due to fear of hiv the cp notes nine patterns of use which are also outlined in an attachment to the barcelona kis thes include recreational use including experimental social and circumstantial subtypes instrumental use which incorporates situational elitist and commercial subtypes and dysfunctional use by dependent pure cocaine users and depe ndent cocaineexheroin and heroin users kis respondents in barcelona describe three user categories recreational users predominate characterized by social use of small amounts of hydrochloride on weekends they may also employ alcohol or cannabis but reject heroin an instrum ental category treats cocaine as key component of social activity and may make some use of he roin and exhibit greater dependence and physical mental economic or legal problems finally cocaine is the focus of dysfunctional users who use the substance daily and intensively along with heroin and other drugs few barcelona kis respondents cite some cases of crack use dysfunctional users tend to face greater social isol ation one key distinction is that recreational users ar likely to undertake group purchases of cocaine while more intensive users generally make personal or individual purchases consequences of cocaine use as noted the cp and kis agree that physical ntal economic social and legal consequences are directly associated with the pattern of use intensive use is most likely to yield rmful outcomes one kis respondent linked cocaine and alcohol as most i ndividuals engage in regul ar and even long term use without risk but small number suffer harm from prolonged and heavy use responses all citizens have the right to free medical attention including attention for organic problems and dependence resulting from the use of drugs still public healthcare network for drug dependence was not set up until 1985 treatment is now widely available in spain and includes hospital out patient and residential units there are only two centres focused on cocaine dependence and they are experimental drug treatment is offered in prisons but is not specific to cocaine most centres focus on heroin treatment since heroin use and treatment demand far exceed cocaine use and demand for services the kis users were uninformed on treatment and few seek assistance largely because most are recreational users who never become dependent primary drug prevention takes place in the schools with parents and professi onal organizations none focus on cocaine the four priority areas are community schools workplace and prisons the media play an important role in campaigns but many are poorly designed some programmes target highrisk populations such as prostitutes the homeless and str eet children harm reduction includes distribution of condoms and instruction on their use trafficking is illegal but use is not few may ngage in crimes to support habit courts can commute sentences to mandatory treatment the kis emphasizes that most users are well integrated into society and hold stable jobs so few expe rience the legal problems more common among heroin addicts sweden introduction sweden compiled country profile cp but did not complete key informant study for this project patterns of cocaine use cocaine entered sweden in three phases initial medicinal use began at the turn of the century during the 1920s cocaine gained popularity and some were hospitalized for userelated problems cocaine reentered during the 1970s slowly emerging as drug for the jet set and did not draw heavy use or trafficking efforts were taken to prevent the emergence of the problems experienced in other countries and use was depicted as uniformly negative when available cocaine is used mostly for recreational purposes use usually takes plac in social groups in private setting most users are young males and use is restricted to weekends it is usuall purchased in nightclubs and doses are small so that use is discreet the drug is said to be appealing because of its newness costliness and cleanliness access is limited and most use appears to be specific to the capital stockholm polydrug use appears common with amphetamine be ing the preferred drug amphetamines are far more affordable than other drugs including cannabis this is partly attributed to the collapse of communist block poland since then affordable and high quality amphetamines have flooded the swedish market consequences of cocaine use sweden does not have an extensive cocaine probl em although it is treated with restrictive law enforcement the total number of all drug addicts is reported at around 20 000 however recent survey of swedens population of 85 million identified only 500 cocaine users in the entire country partly because use remains limited other consequences of use are not described responses sweden developed schoolbased prevention campa igns to reduce the appearance of problems observed in neighbouring countries cocaine was incorporated here as one of many dangerous substances cocaine is considered to be as dangerous as is heroin and because of this image legal penalties are described as severe nevertheless co caine use has not been associated with increased crime or prostitution united states of america introduction the usa has unique heterogeneous general population that makes summarization of cocaine use patterns difficult this resulted in united states country profile cp that provides an annotated overview of scientific and surveillance literature produced in the country participating centres in flagstaff new york providence and san francisco also completed separate key informant studies which are described in separate summaries patterns of cocaine use cocaine use in the united stat has an extremely broad range of characteristics cocaine hydrochloride was historically used for medicinal purposes however in the early 20th century and again in the 1970s through the 1980s it regain ed broad popularity for recreational use the cp notes that current use is largely nonmedicina l mostly in the form of cocaine hydrochloride powder and smokable crack cocaine hydrochloride is generally inhaled intranasally or inje cted smokable cocaine can be smoked as crack or hydrochloride may be mixed with tobacco or marijuana an estimated 90 of us users inhale hydrochloride and approximately onethird smoke it surveys reviewed in the cp indi cate that use rose drastically in the 1970s and peaked in the middle 1980s use has continued to decline the number of occasional cocaine users for the raid to late 1980s totalled 59 million and monthly users numbe red about 29 minion users in 1992 comprised approximately 34 million occasional and 11 milli on monthly users however the total number of frequent users remained stable at 650 000 between 1988 and 1992 use predominates in impoverished inner city neighbourhoods among peopl between the ages of 15 and 34 similar patterns appear for all ethnic groups although male users outnumber female users use declined by 63 for adolescents the profile reports that cocaine availability has increased and prices have substantial ly decreased over the last two decades reports indicate that high quality cocaine is now available at lower cost than during peak use in 1985 consequences of cocaine use the us cp reports several areas of impact on u ser health major negative effects among heavy and chronic users were higher suicide rates heart and lung problems and difficulty with concentration and memory increased sexual stimulation and sexual dysfunction were identified but research in thi s area is limited the cp points out that complications caused by cocaine use during pregnancy has been exaggerated by the media research generally fails to support cocaine as the source of prenatal problems relative to other social factors such as poverty or poor prenatal care one consequence of use cited was dramatic increase in emergency room and private physician referrals for cocainerelated health problems this was most notable in major metropolitan areas most emergency room admissions were for detoxificati on unexpected drug reactions and chronic negative health effects of note 44 times the number of cocainerelated deaths ccurred in 1989 2332 reported cases in comparison to 1975 53 reported cases social consequence reported in the cp is the conn ection between crime and cocaine use it notes that twothirds of all females and onehalf of all males arrested test positive for cocaine increased criminal activity was noted for males with heavy use of cocai ne crack users may also experience more violent or psychotic events one of the most significant health consequences posed by cocaine use is its association w ith increased risk for transmission of hivaids of concern is needle sharing among cocaine and polydrug injectors and an enhanced potential for unsafe sex fostered by the disinhibiting effects of cocaine and by cases where sex is offered in exchange for cocaine harm reduction strategies particularly needle exchanges condom distribution and prevention campaigns are essential to stem hiv spread through all cocaine using populations responses the cp identifies more than two million hardcore cocaine users in the united states this was described as problematic since there are standard treatment programmes for cocaine dependence it was emphasized that intranasal users had more fa vourable treatment outcomes than do crack smokers also females were found to demonstrate better response to treatment than do males multiple drug us was common alcohol is the major drug used with cocaine the primary media responses mentioned in the profile focus on the war on drugs that centred on crack however the media offers negative exaggerate d and often racialized images of crack users this is especially apparent for women who are frequently portrayed as prostitutes and unfit mothers the cp contends that media prevention campai gns are founded on stereotype and myth the primary political response noted in the cp is the antidrug abuse act of 1988 which financed several programmes including research on development of medications for treatment of cocaine dependence flagstaff usa introduction flagstaff contributed to the us country profile but served mainly to contrast the rural us cocaine experience with more urban populations in the key informant study kis flagstaffs population of only 45 000 has an ethnically diverse composition of 66 anglo american 15 hispanic 9 native american and 2 african american user consu ltants in the kis were recruited from crack and injection users in an hivaids prevention study and all exhibited moderate to heavy use patterns more recreational use among the wealthy is lluded to but is not wellrepresented patterns of cocaine use the flagstaff kis notes two dominant products the more common is crack cocaine while cocaine hydrochloride or powder is less prevalent sm oking intranasal snorting and injecting are major routes of administration smoking is most popular while injecting is less common snorting was often described as an initial method that lead to smoking for more intense high cocaine is used in all subpopulations initial use tak place in the middle to late teens through friends or family and is often combined with other drugs such as marijuana or alcohol many associated crack use with single heterosexual black and hispanic ma of middle to lower income groups crack users were said to hold minor or jobs receive welfare or social security income or support habits with crime and range in age from 8 to 68 hydrochloride was also noted for high income groups who are more discreet in their use its use and distri bution were also tied to mexican immigrants notable characteristic of use here was its affiliati on with drug using networks described as based on ethnicity kinship or routes of administration networks are as small as 4 or 5 people or as large as 15 to 20 cocaine use within networks occurs mostly in private homes or rarely in local motels or public locations such as wooded areas outside of the town crack was described as highly accessible due to its in expensive cost and widespread availability the primary limitation is money it is purchased in us20 rocks occasionally sex or other goods are exchanged networks offer access to dealer who livers cocaine or has local place of access local dealers travel to nearby urban areas to obtain supplies consequences of cocaine use major outcome for users is economic disparity crack users are characterized as lost labour and candidates for crime posing serious problem for the community children and adolescents are also harmed by the widespread availability and low cost of crack some described economic benefits of sales for cash flow into the impoverished communities wher crack is found however this was considered minimal in light of continual use and dependency another major outcome of use is its effect on fam ily and personal relationships crack users were said to have few social ties and these become strained as use intensifies theft of belongings to pay for the drug and violence associated with cocaine crash as effects wear off further this deterioration arrest was also potential consequence but was d escribed as an obstacle ra ther than preventive barrier to use very few health effects were addressed in the kis the primary areas discussed were decrea sed sexual desire and loss of inhibitions which promote unsafe sex and risk for hiva1ds responses to cocaine use flagstaff user consultants had limited knowledge about treatment selfhelp groups and agencies mentioned were rated as inefficient due to poor access or high cost most felt that users fail to bene fit from the treatment kis respondents felt that u sers sec themselves as different and unable to succeed in treatment the kis also found that prof essionals have limited confidence in the outcome and indicate that care for cocaine is unavailable kis respondents describe prevention campaigns as fa ilures noting that media images are negative and provided inaccurate views of use public ser vice messages also fail to acknowledge the true complexity of rehabilitation for druguse problems consultants regard treatment and law enforcement as intimately connected since treatment is forced on most users by the legal system this fosters resentment and negative views of both law enforcement and treatment professionals law enforcement approaches as descr ibed by the consultants are believed to vary more for drug offences than for other offences penalties range from 25 years to life in prison however this is all negotiable especially if an arrestee snitches or informs on dealer or snother user legal measures are described in the kis as an annoy ance rather than discouragement new york usa introduction new york produced key informant study kis site report described here and with other participating centres contributed to the unite d states country profile summarized separately patterns of cocaine use new york with population of 7 million is often called the drug addiction capital of the country the late 1970s to the early 1980s witnessed increased use mostly through intranasal and intravenous routes crack appeared in the mid1980s peaking by the early 1990s most users have experienced userelated problems and the majority discontinue use over time the kis sampled for ethnic gender and educational diversity the area is centre for cocaine research and so professionals proved to be exceptionally wellinformed intranasal smoking freebasing and injection use of hydrochloride and crack are common cocaine is used in all economic and social groups but is particularly common among ethnic minorities and economically disadvantaged there is speculation that new yorks large market may be supported by users with large incomes although those with low economic status tend to experience more problem use those treated for cocaine problems arrested on cocaine related charges or who develop hiv infection through injection are very likely to be among socially andor economically disadvantaged groups crack smoking and injection are widely viewed as the more dangerous the kis identified vulnerability factors that incr ease the likelihood of problem use such as low self esteem lack of social and family support and inadequate employment or highwage jobs cocaine is used in streets shooting galleries nightclubs cars and homes individuals use cocaine alone or with friends sexual activity is commonly asso ciated with use the main age group is between 15 and 25 most begin with intranasal use try cocaine out of curiosity and then quit some who continue use may begin to increase dosage and frequency over time such users may develop dependence and shift to injection use or smoking virtually all cocaine users have prior drug hist ory and most use alcohol cannabis andor tobacco cocaine is used to offset negative effects of alcohol and cannabis such as drowsiness consequences of cocaine use violence is associated with cocaine distribution said to be managed by organized crime most violence is associated with street dealing and weapons possession new york estimates that t here are 200 000 injecting drug users most of whom probably inject cocaine approximately half have already contracted hiv while women have fewer problems with heroin almost half of those with problem use are said to be female women are also said to exchange sex for co caine or engage in sex work to obtain money to purchase cocaine males often introduce women to cocaine in order to obtain sex crack is seen as being particularly attractive and dangerous for wome n and crack use during pregnancy has increased responses numerous treatment services are available in new york including psychotherapy therapeutic communities hospitalization outpatient care and selfhelp programmes most respondents describe these treatment opportunities as insufficient and ineffective cocaine possession use and sale is illegal the w enforcement community is seen as punitive and unjust and kis consultants assert that the poor are more likely to be arrested and conclude that police should employ greater humanity in their approach to users most of the kis respondents were unfamiliar with drug laws new york is centre for debate over the legalizati on of cocaine and other drugs providence usa introduction the providence participating centre completed key in formant study kis for that site us country profile is summarized separately patterns of cocaine use providence respondents report that hydrochloride nd crack are the two main products available in southeastern new england use is often combined with tobacco alcohol cannabis heroin and pharmaceuticals form of cocaine noted by informants percentage data user intermedia professional hydrochloride 17 5 10 crack 17 5 8 iv use 12 5 6 leaf 3 1 2 use occurs in all ethnic and linguistic groups but frequency and intensity vary among groups heavy use is reported among hispanics africanamericans ca pe verdeans and portuguese some suggest that fishermen represent the heaviest users and that cocaine use is central to sex workers intranasal cocaine hydrochloride users are predominantly recreational and chronic users from the professional middle and working classes students musi cians and artists smokers more often belong to minority communities who prefer crack and other drugs due to their availability and low cast shooters or injecting users are often members of marginal underclasses who often use cocaine in cocktail with heroin or methadone the kis reports that cocaine prices have steadily decreased while demand has risen over the pa st five years cocaine is one of the cheapest and most av ailable illicit drugs on the street cannabis is reported to be more expensive and more difficult to obtain than either cocaine or heroin cocaine is purchased in 05 to 15 gram bags for 20 to 50 and must usually be purchased with case dealers rarely trade cocaine for sex but may barter for weapons quality varies greatly and most buy from relatives friends or neighbours within ethnic or social networks to ensure quality users are reluctant to buy from members of different ethnic or social group dealers have responded to market competition by utilizing beepers portable phones and fleet of cars with drivers operating during various times and shifts most users initiate use out of curiosity thrill seek ing or peer pressure most are introduced into use by close friend or family member and start in their early twenties although users from minority communities start in their early or midteens most initially inhale and later switc h to smoking or injecting consequences of cocaine use respondents describe positive effects of use such as stimulation and enhanced creativity with recreational use the influx of black market f unds into impoverished communities resulting from cocaine traffic is also reported as positive conseque nce of cocaine consultants admit however that problematic features of use outweigh advantages while dependence is concern to all users most emphasize that use rarely produces problems those at highest risk tend to be chronic tobacco smokers alcohol dependent or polydrug users kis respondents report an increase in unsafe sexual practices particularly among users who exchange sex for cocaine this pattern is more common among crack smokers while injection users are reported to be more monogamous than crack users the addition of cocaine to the repertoire of drugs used by heroin and methadone dependents face highe r risk for hiv transmission since the frequency of injecting and syringe use increases greatly despite local outreach and prevention programmes emphasizing the bleaching of needles less than half of the informants who inject drugs clean their needles between sessions responses to cocaine use kis consultants are unaware of treatment programmes specifically for cocaine they identify programmes for alcohol and heroin but suggest th inadequately address cocainerelated problems differences in education social class and ethnic background are viewed as major barrier to communication empathy and respect between users and treatment professionals respondents agree that services are less than optimal but view selfh elp as more effective for some users than is professional care consultants agree that law enforcement is more inclined to target users and small time dea lers rather than major dealers and traffickers users view police and law enforcement personnel as corrupt and as enemies hispanic and africanamerican users are thought to be the main targets of police action most professionals note that services can only be improved with increased local state and federa l funding consultants recommend increased availability of medical treatment services primari ly for adverse health consequences related to poor nutrition and sleep deprivation some also raise issues of legalization or of decriminalization of possession and use san francisco usa introduction the participating centre in san francisco completed key informant study kis patterns of cocaine use informants report that cocaine use in san francisco has declined especially within the last three years use is not confined to particular agegroup gender socioeconomic class profession sexual orientation or ethnicity all routes of administrati on can be found in all economic and social status groups nevertheless kis respondents agree that two clear patterns of use exist consultants describe one user category as middl eclass suburban while heterosexual users who usually snort cocaine hydrochloride such use is mostly recreational and typically takes place on weekends few such users experience negative effects crack smoking is most common among inner city poor who often use daily and report the most cocainerelated problems the key informants suggest that because of financial burden hardcor users and especially crack users experience financial losses injecting use is the least common route of administration in both urban and suburban users but is more popular in the homosexual community informants report that use begins between ag 18 and 25 for reasons of curiosity and self medication use sometimes increases in frequency and amount over time administration ma also shift from snorting to smoking or from smoking to injecting use although injecting is relatively rare the san francisco kis found that desp ite enforcement efforts cocaine is easy to obtain especially in urban areas suburban users must have contact to procure cocaine while crack rocks can be bought in inner city areas for increments of us 1 to us 100 informants report that the price of hydrochloride and crack has dropped dramatically in the last decade an eight h of an ounce now costs about us 140 informants also indicate that some intensive crack users might offer sex in exchange for cocaine consequences of cocaine use few informants identify positive c onsequences associated with cocaine use although some mentioned were weight loss possible increased creativity for artists constructive communication and conversation better driving ability some increased productivity at work though only for the short term increased concentration on menial tasks and increased imagination and vigour during sex other positive consequences included employment oppor tunities provided by the cocaine trade and an infusion of cash into otherwise impoverished and commercially depressed areas many report negative consequences of cocaine fo r health these include weight loss poor diet decreased immune system capacity nasal and upperrespiratory ailments mouth burns for smokers eye infections druginduced psychosis or mental health problems impotence and premature aging other broader negative effects of use include financ ial problems absenteeism or job loss selling or loss of possession relationship problems drug dependence and loss of quality time for other activities informants also report that cocaine has negative consequences for the community this includes gang warfare over drug profits the taking over or conve rsion of residences into crack houses increased street crime theft and use of firearms enhanced law enforcement presence and paternalism and t he spread of sexually transmitted diseases legal problems trouble dealers but have little impact on most users informants report some fear of legal problems but suggest that prosecution is rare adolescents and children are sometimes em ployed as runners in the cocaine trade because their outh tends to protect them from imprisonment responses to cocaine use san francisco key informants report that effective treatment programmes exist but are few in numbe r long waiting lists are reported for services twelves tep models are the most common approach and emphasize abstinence several informants claim th at women are deterred from treatment as workers stigmatize female users treatment is less availa ble for women and most fail to offer child care san francisco maintains an active needle exchange programme that distributes needles syringes bleach and condoms to injecting heroin and cocaine u sers informants report that as result of these efforts needle sharing is becoming much less common key informants believe that media campaigns such as the partnership for drug free america have promoted an inaccurate and powerful negative stereo type of cocaine users media campaigns create an us versus them mentality and cocaine use is inaccurately viewed as spr eading like an epidemic some informants suggest that the media has act ually increased cocaine use by glamorizing it law enforcement is viewed as exacerbating rather th an resolving problems key informants contend that law enforcement does not deter use or cure those it punishes some report that police have begun to use more flexible approaches conf iscating supplies without arresting users zimbabwe introduction the zimbabwe country profile cp and the harare participating centres key informant study kis indicate that cocaine use has emerged only in the last five years while still limited to the small segment of the population who can afford its high pace the cp concludes that cocaine represents the fastest growing drug problem in the country the cp supports this by pointing to notable increase in cocaine seizures between 1989 and 1993 patterns of cocaine use the cp and kis suggest that cocaine supplies remain scarce in zimbabwe users tend to buy it w hen available but often buy more available substances such as cannabis alcohol and tobacco the cp and kis report that cocaine hydrochloride is the most wi dely used cocaine product but some cite incipient crack use the harare kis reports that hydrochloride is typically sold in quantities of one to two grams for zim 150 to zim 500 varying by purity this price exceeds the monthly income of virtually all residents other than wealthy professionals in business and the entertainment industry the kis reports that cocaine may be used only s poradically or as often as twice day depending on supplies and access to money most use one to two grams per session but few become dependent and increase use frequency and dosage few may smoke cocaine if they develop nasal problems from sniffing but most use tends to be intranasal few had heard of injecting but none had seen such use one kis consultant claimed that cocaine may be drunk kis consultants describe most cocaine users as single while male heterosexuals in their late twenties or early thirties most are also wealthy and highly ducated the cp reports that cocaine use is more common among whites asians and coloured groups and uncommon for the majority blacks largely because these users enjoy higher socioeconomic status and can afford cocaine cocaine is purchased through sophisticated underground networks few may engage in crime or prostitution to gain funds for purchases consequences of cocaine use kis consultants claim that cocaine improves artistic and creative ability and job and study performance by producing energy and excitement it is employed to enhance sex to relieve depression tension pain and fatigue for curiosity or for pleasure still some describe depression and craving sensa tions following cocaine use and note risks of dependence the most harmful effect is said to be on mental health including paranoia the cp cites some risk of cardiac arrest weight loss and heightened risk of sexually transmitted disease inc luding hiv the cp reports that use initially enhances relationshi ps since it fosters sociability however intensive use may lead to irritable and irrationa l behaviour and interpersonal problems however kis respondents report that violence is unc ommon the kis and cp agree that prolonged and intensive use may harm family relations spur ar guments or financial problems theft fraud and prostitution responses to cocaine use the cp and kis report that at present there ar treatment services available exclusively for cocainerelated problems drug treatment is provided in psychiatric units of general hospitals and in two private clinics in harare which offer residential and outpatient care for those who can afford it kis consultants describe public hos pitals as overcrowded and private facilities as expensive consequently few seek assi stance except in life threatening cases the cp describes limited drug prevention programm in zimbabwe existing education covers all health issues including drug problems most are designed for health providers and law enforcement the cp reports that the maximum penalty fo r cocaine offences is six to seven years imprisonment courts may weigh mitigating factors in sentencing particularly for young or first time offenders the kis consultants contend that law enforcement approaches to supply control have had very limited success penalties noted in the cp are reproduced below penalties for drug offences in zimbabwe possession use dealing or trafficking drug minimum penalty maximum penalty cannabis fine of zim 20 10 years prison heroin 6 years prison 7 years prison mandrax fine of zim 1500 15 years prison cocaine fine of zim 1000 or 112 months in prison adjusted 1994 to 67 years prison of note most kis consultants support intensifying enforcement by adding stiffer penalties and using more sophisticated methods for drug detec tion at points of entry into the country still others recommend enhanced approaches to treatment and rehabilitation
