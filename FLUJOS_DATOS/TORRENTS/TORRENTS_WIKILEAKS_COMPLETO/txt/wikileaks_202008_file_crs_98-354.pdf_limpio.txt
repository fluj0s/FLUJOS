the house richard s beth specialist in the legislative process government and finance division special rule is house resolution that regulates consideration of specific legislative measure named in the resolution members and staff commonly refer to resolution of this kind simply as the rule fo r considering measure rule has two key functions 1 to enable the house to consider the measure specified and 2 to set terms for considering it the house committee on rules has jurisdiction to report resolutions that combine these two functions and this ability enables the leadership to use rules effectively to manage the floor agenda this report discusses how rules accomplish the first function on the second see crs report 98612 special rules and options for regulating the amendmending process by james v saturno for more information on legislative process see httpwwwcr sgovproductsguidesguidehomeshtml special rules and the system of privilege in general the house may bring to the floor for consideration only measures that have privilege privilege in this context means this right of measure to be considered the gene ral rules of the house establish several different means for bills and resolutions to obtain privilege one way commonly used for major legislation is for the house to adopt resolution making it in order to consider the measure such resolution conferring privilege on specified measure and regulating its cons ideration is called special rule because the regulations it prescribes supersede the general rules but only in application to the measure named special rules can be used in this way onl because they are themselves measures to which house rules automatically accord privilege by according this general privilege to special rules the house ensures that it w ill be able to take th em up and adopt them by exercising this ability to adopt special rules in turn the house is able to accord privilege to specific measures it wishes to consider special rules privilege nd forms of consideration general rules of the house establish several different forms of procedure for considering measures in general each means of conferring privilege makes measures privileged for consideration under specified procedure most speci rules make measure privileged for consideration in committee of the whole typical language in which rule grants privilege for consideration in committee of th whole is at any time after the adoption of this resolution the speaker may pursuant to clause 2b of rule xviii declare thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98354crs2 house resolved into the committee of the whole house on the state of the union for consideration of the bill number and official title alternatively rule may provide that measure be considered in the house under the onehour rule or under anot her procedure even for au thorization nd appropriation bills for which house rules require consideration in committee of the whole the special rule may override this requi rement typical language conferring privilege for consideration in the house is upon doption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider in the house the bill number and official title relatively few measures are automatically accorded privileged status by the general rules of the house to enable itself to c onsider such measure the house does not need to adopt rule but in current practice it of ten does so anyway for example the house may adopt rule providing that general appropriation bill be c onsidered in committee of the whole or that conference report be considered in the house even though house rules already make any such measure privileged for consideration under those procedures the reason for using rule in these cases may be to waive points of order or otherwise alter the terms of considerati on from those established by house rules the second key function of special rules this kind of rule usually retains the language granting privilege even though the measure needs such grant using rules to manage the agenda when the majority leadership wishes to schedule measure for consideration especially major legislation it often determines that rule is the most appropriate means of conferring privilege to get privilege conferred in this way the leadership requires coope ration from the committee on rules for that is the committee that possesses jurisdiction to repor t special rules when this cooperation exists as it normally does in contemporary practice it enables the leadership to exercise great flexibility in scheduling this function is principal reason for the importance of the committee on rules because it puts the co mmittee in the position of gatekeeper to the floor for many measures rules reported by the committee on rules are privileged for consideration in the house under the onehour rule this pro cedure permits the house to preclude the offering of any floor amendments by orderi ng the previous question as result when the committee reports rule that both grants privilege and regulates terms of consideration it normally limits the house to the choice of considering measure under the terms proposed or not being able to consider it at all because special rule is house resoluti on it takes effect only when adopted by the house in order to accord privilege to the m easures selected therefore the leadership and the committee on rules need the support of voting majority on the floor the leadership therefore can regulate the floor agenda effectively through rules when it can count on the support of the majority party for their adoption and when the committee on rules can structure them in wa that attracts majority support
