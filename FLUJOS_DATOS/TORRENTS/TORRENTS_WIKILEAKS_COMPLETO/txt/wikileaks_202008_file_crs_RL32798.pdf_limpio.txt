million in operation and maintenance om activities at selected proj ects shall be reimbursed from pma electricity receipts as credit to the corps om account rather than these receipts being placed in the treasury and appropriations used to cover the corps expenses as has been the historic practice if offsetting collections go into effect the difference between new budget authority and treasury deposits will decreaseto 29 cents per kilowatt hour kwh3 in comparison in 2003 the most recent year for which data are available average wholesale prices for nonfederal power were 40 kwh4 and retail prices5 were 742 kwh compared with the prevailing market rate for electricity access to federa l hydropower represents significant cost advantage this suggests that the pmas have been very successful in their mission to provide federal power at the lowest possible cost to customers however it also suggests that all other things equal pma power would remain competitive source of electricity even if rates were raised significantly over the past 20 years congress has re peatedly debated proposals to privatize the pmas or alter their rate structure while most of these proposals have not become law congress passed legisla tion in 1995 to sell the alaska power administration6 the presidents fy2006 budget request indicates that the administration will propose legislation to br ing pma electricity

permanent treasury borrowing authority of 445 billion at the end of fy2004 bpa had used 29 billion of this authority costbased rates treasury receipts are based primarily on cust omers rate payments it has been the policy of the federal government to market pma power at costbased rates the pmas are generally required to set these rates sufficiently high to recover specified annual costs and repay with interest g enerally below the governments cost of borrowing all reimbursabl federal investments as specified by authorizing legislation for example these rates must cover operation nd maintenance

and transmission facilities and to recover other agencies powerrelated expenses including om costs intere st costs and debt repayment bpas rates must also c over nonfederal bonds for energy

oyees were 192 million 1996 dollars for fy1992 through fy199613 however the pmas are now recovering this cost and are working toward recovering other costs identified by the gao the presidents budget request the presidents fy2006 budget request i ndicates that the administration will propose legislation to bring pma electricity rates closer to the average market rates throughout the country14 while legislation to implement this change has not been introduced in the 109th congress the administration suggests that such legislation could require pmas to increase their rates 20 per year until they reach market rates additional information on the proposal has not yet been provided however multiple bills to establish marketbased rates including hr1486 and s161 in the 106th congress have been introduced in previous years benefits of market rates proponents of the rate increase argue that it could correct market signals and maximize returns on the federal investment these factors are described below market signals as described above pmas co stbased rates are much lower than market averages on cost basis the pmas have some cost advantages compared to other utilities one of these advantages is that they market lowcost hydropower fuel cost operating expenses for hydropower average 075 kwh compared to 187 kwh for nuclear 226 kwh for fossil steam and 489 kwh for gas turbine plants15 in addition the pmas are gene rally not required to pay taxes or to generate return for investors16 these factors keep pma rates well below market rates proponents of the increas argue that the low cost of pma power distorts the signals consumers receive regarding the true value of power and that increasing the price of pma power would reduce or eliminate this distortion and prompt consumers to decrease their electricity consumptionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32798crs5 17executive office of the president budget of the united states fy2006 analytical perspectives gpo 2006 p 239

general accounting office federal power pma rate impacts by service area gaorced9955 1999 21the northwest power and conservation counc il estimates that typical households continuedreturn on federal investment the presidents budget states that increasing pmas rates w ould generate 32 billion17 in treasury receipts over the next 5 years and 124 billion over 10 years while there is general agreement that treasury receipts would increase there is likely to be disagreement regarding the size of this increase for number of years the congressional budget offices cbos budget options report has included its fi gure for treasury receipts based on full implementation of market ra tes in its fy2005 report this figure was 19 billion over 10 years18 therefore it is likely that cbo in its reassessment of the presidents budget will forecast significantly lower receipts than did the presidents request aside from the rate of implement ation in the first year for cbo and 20 per year for the presidents budget offi cials at cbo indicat there are other differences leading to the variation in estimates first the presidents figure assumes all of the revenue from bpa rate incr ease will become treasury receipts cbo assumed that bpa will c hoose to spend that money through its revolving fund second the presidents figures assume rger gap between costbased and market based rates than does the cbo figure19 drawbacks of marketbased rates opponents of proposals to increase pmas rates argue that providing lowcost power to encourage regional economic development remain s an appropriate role for the federal government furthermore they argue that the proposal would hurt individual electricity cons umers and regional economies increase in cons umer prices in general increases in rates paid by publicly and cooperatively owne d utilities are passed on to their customers the size of consumer rate increases would be based in part on how legislation defines market rates and how much of utilitys power comes from the pmas with the exception of the pacific northwest pma power acc ounts for less than 5 of generation in other states served by pmas in 1999 gao assessment of the costs of fully implementing marketbased rates for three of the four pmas found that most enduse consumers would see relatively sma ll rate increases around 05 kwh20 as percentage of energy prices however this is real increase and it could harm energyintensive industries bpa provide s 40 of all power in the northwest thus the rate increases consumers would face in that region could be much more substantial21 currently studies of this op tion are limited by pl 101101 whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32798crs6 21continued electricity bill would increase 24 per month once market rates are fully

22energy and water development appr opriations act of 1990 pl 101101 506prohibits the use of federal appropriations to study the effects of increasing pma prices to market rates22 regional economic effects as with individual consumer effects the regional implications of price increases are currently unknown and will depend on number of factors including regions reliance on pma power by that standard the pacific northwest would almost certainly be the hardest hit while detailed analysis has not been conducted the rthwest power and conservation council estimates that full implementation of th rate increase would increase annual electricity costs by 14 billion in the nort hwest such an increase would directly hurt electricintensive industries such as aluminum production and could also raise regional unemployment rates discussion while the administration has not yet propos ed legislation to implement this rate increase proponents and opponents are alread voicing their arguments federal encouragement of regional development was and still is in the view of many an appropriate role for the federal government particularly in rural areas where private incentives are lacking for those whose economy and way of life are tied to this system this marketpricing alternative is particularly distressing even so in time of tight federal budgets and energy supp lies certain taxpayer organizations environmental groups and private energy s uppliers argue that the federal government should maximize returns from its investme nts in electricity supplies and should encourage electricity conservation by increasing rates
