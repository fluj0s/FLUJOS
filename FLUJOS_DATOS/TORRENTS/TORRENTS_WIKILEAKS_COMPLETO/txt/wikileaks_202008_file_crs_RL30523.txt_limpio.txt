2003 the alcohol and tobacco and trade bureau published final rules that would prohibit manufacturers from making any substantive claims in labeling or in advertising regarding health benefits associated with alcohol beverage consumption unless specific criteria are met this publication follows several years of debate over whether statements of health benefits should be allowed to appear on alcohol beverages regulation of alcohol beverages fell under the jurisdiction of the department of treasurys bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms batf until it was renamed alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau ttb following the creation of the department of homeland security all alcohol beverage labels must undergo premarket approval by the bureau which will be referred to as ttb throughout this report the food and drug administration fda and the department of agriculture are responsible for the regulation of labeling on nonalcohol beverages food and meat products since 1987 fda and ttb have worked under memorandum of understanding which clarifies and delineates the enforcement responsibilities of each agency with respect to regulation of alcohol beverages found to be adulterated in general labeling requirements are specific to the food or alcohol beverage product being marketed since 1988 alcohol beverages have been required to carry government warnings about alcohol consumption and its impact on driving andor pregnancy in the last decade food products have been allowed to carry nutrient content and health claims if they meet certain regulatory requirements early in 1999 ttb announced that it would allow wine manufacturers to place health information on their labels for the first time however it subsequently proposed rules to prohibit such messages on alcohol beverages unless specific criteria are met ttbs initial decision to allow health messages on wine labels was based on the messages reference to the us dietary guidelines the guidelines state that if alcohol beverages are consumed it should be done in moderation the accompanying text outlines the hazards of excessive intake individuals who should avoid drinking and recent evidence that moderate drinking may be associated with lower coronary heart disease risk in some individuals three bills were introduced in the 106th congress in response to the initial ttb decision to allow health messages on wine labels the alcohol beverage labeling act of 1999 s 431 would have transferred all authority for alcohol beverage labeling from ttb to the department of health and human services the alcohol abuse prevention and treatment trust fund act of 1999 s 432 would have increased the rate of tax on wine and dedicated those revenues to programs for the prevention and treatment of alcohol abuse the alcohol beverage label preservation act of 1999 s 433 would have prohibited additional statements and representations related to alcohol beverages and health beyond the government warning already

would prohibit the appearance in labeling or advertising of any statement that makes substantive claim regarding health benefits associated with alcohol beverage1 consumption unless specific criteria are met this announcement followed several years of debate on whether to allow health benefit statements to appear on wine products for more than decade mandatory health warnings have appeared on all alcohol beverages alcohol consumption alcohol consumption is difficult to quantify accurately and there is universally acceptable classification system or standard for safe level of drinking the amount and type of alcohol beverages americans drink and changes in overall drinking levels are generally determined by monitoring product sales per capita consumption is not possible to determine so it is derived from sales data to represent an estimate of the average amount of alcohol consumed per person the result is apparent per capita consumption which is calculated by dividing alcohol sales or shipment data from every state and the district of columbia by the us population aged 14 years or older to determine the consumption expressed in gallons of pure alcohol the estimates attribute average consumption to all individuals in the population regardless of their actual consumption thus the data have limitations in determining actual consumption total annual per capita alcohol consumption rose from 1935 when consumption was 12 gallons to 1982 when consumption reached high of about 275 gallons before falling to level of 221 gallons by 1999 for the population 14 years and older2 beer makes the greatest contribution to apparent per capita alcohol consumption in the united states while wine has made the least almost all of the recent decline in alcohol use can be attributed to reduction in the use of distilled spirits 1 note several terms are used for beverages containing an alcohol content greater than 7 of volume alcohol beverages alcoholic beverages and beverage alcohol for purposes of this report the term alcohol beverages will be used 2 httpwwwniaaanihgovdatabasesconsum01txhtr crs2 in 2000 about 62 of all individuals surveyed reported being drinkers including 68 of men and 56 of women3 by level of alcohol consumed as self estimated and reported by current drinkers 71 reported light and 22 reported moderate consumption in 2000 7 of individuals aged 18 years and over described themselves as heavy alcohol users defined as five or more drinks on at least one occasion in the past month among current drinkers about 32 of individuals in this age group reported consuming five or more drinks on at least one occasion in the past year including 43 of men and 19 of women this level of alcohol consumption was most common among young adults 1824 years of age health effects of alcohol consumption considerable attention has been paid to the issue of the health effects of alcohol consumption excessive alcohol consumption can have widespread deleterious effects throughout the body with consequences that include neuropsychological and reproductive abnormalities and increased susceptibility to infection the adverse consequences of alcohol abuse may vary considerably depending on such factors as the amount consumed gender age and nutritional status of the individual the contribution of excessive alcohol intake to liver damage heart and cardiovascular disease high blood pressure and stroke mental impairment interference with normal endocrine function and dysregulation of immune defenses have been well documented4 chronic liver disease and cirrhosis which are frequently associated with alcohol abuse ranked as the tenth leading cause of death in 19975 particular concern focuses on early drinking which seems to increase lifetime risk of alcoholism6 an estimated 14 million adults either abuse or are physically dependent on alcohol7 the effects of excessive drinking are the primary basis for opposition to allowing health benefit statements on alcohol beverages described below however increasing attention has focused on epidemiologic data that suggests potential health benefits may result from moderate alcohol consumption decade ago numerous media reports introduced the american public to what was termed the french paradox8 the reports described how the french population while consuming higher fat diet

especially red wine by the french as defined in the scientific literature moderate alcohol consumption consists of 12 drinks day and is believed to be beneficial in reducing the risk of coronary artery disease cad recent published report from the harvard school of public health indicates that two drinks day will reduce the risk of heart attack in individuals by at least 259 research and debate continue on several possible metabolic pathways that may be affected by moderate alcohol consumption which may result in reducing the risk of cad the implications of epidemiological and experimental findings may hold valuable information for clinical practice and public health policies in the future while moderate drinking may reduce the risk of cad in some individuals other population subgroups such as pregnant women and individuals who are operating motor vehicles or heavy machinery are advised to avoid drinking alcohol beverages individuals with family history of alcoholism need to exercise caution in their decision to drink currently the epidemiological studies have suggested that moderate drinking is associated with improved cardiovascular health10 certain individuals who are at high risk of cad especially men over 45 postmenopausal women and smokers may benefit from the cardioprotective effects of alcohol beverages more than persons at low risk further study is needed to verify whether the relationship is supported by additional research scrutiny government guidance on alcohol over the years the use of alcohol beverages has been addressed in at least two governmentsponsored initiatives dietary guidance and health objectives the fifth edition of the dietary guidelines for americans released by the us departments of agriculture usda and hhs stated in its tenth rule that if you drink alcoholic beverages do so in moderation11 this wording or similar language has appeared in each edition of the dietary guidelines since the first one in 1980 the accompanying text for this rule has expanded over time and outlines the hazards of excessive intake of alcohol the text reports that current research suggests that moderate drinking is associated with lower risk for coronary heart disease in some individuals moderation is defined as more than one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men single drink would amount to 12 ounces of

public interest along with coalition of public health consumer safety and childprotection organizations and four members of congress petitioned ttb to improve the legibility clarity and noticeability of the congressionally mandated health warnings required on alcohol beverage labels16 in december 1999 ttb sent letters to fda ftc the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism and the surgeon general requesting review and comment on cspis petition while comments were received on the petition final decision on how to proceed has yet been announced despite signal from the agency that it would be forthcoming17 in february 1999 after several years debate over the wine industrys request ttb approved the use of health messages on wine labels18 the new label statements were based on the information in the dietary guidelines for americans that address alcohol beverage consumption either of these two messages were allowed 15 code of federal regulations section 27 ch 1 parts 430 531

health effects of wine consumption under existing law ttb believed it could only deny such labeling statements if they were false and misleading19 the wine labeling health effect statements were approved because they met the bureaus factual standards of not being false or misleading and health claim was made in ttbs view consumers were simply being directed to several sources of information about the health effects of alcohol consumption ttb based its decision in part on survey of current wine drinkers conducted by the substance abuse and mental health service administrations center for substance abuse prevention samhsa20 the survey findings were obtained through mall interviews and focus groups using three label messages the results indicated that for most of those surveyed drinking patterns would not be influenced by any label message tested the survey also revealed that the word moderate when associated with drinking had virtually meaning to most individuals surveyed in addition wine drinkers indicated that the amount of alcohol which constituted moderate was less than they considered to be moderate reaction to the ttb decision to allow the health effects statement to appear on the wine labels varied prior to the agency issuing its decision surgeon general and assistant secretary for health dr satcher in letter to ttb expressed his concern about allowing the wine label claim21 numerous health and consumer groups also opposed the label with concerns that ranged from the alcohol abuse issue to questions about the strength of the scientific evidence supporting the health benefits members of the 1995 dietary guidelines advisory committee indicated that the text submitted to the agencies for that edition of the guidelines was modified in the final publication and that they had intention of implying endorsement of alcohol beverage consumption for health benefits22 several bills introduced in congress were intended to relieve the bureau of jurisdiction over these products as result of the proposed rulesee below on the other side wine manufacturers who had requested use of the claim were pleased with ttbs decision members of the distilled spirits segment of the industry were also considering request to use similar label messages since the dietary guidelines text is not specific in its wording to 19 ibid 20 dhhs substance

to the announcement allowing wine labels to carry healthrelated messages the bureau announced in may 1999 that it would initiate rulemaking on this issue24 the announcement included the agencys intent to publish proposed rule for notice and comment within several months with completion of the final rule on alcohol beverage health statements within 2 years in the interim the agency indicated that wine makers would continue to be allowed to use the health statements that it already had approved with the understanding that the rulemaking might change the type of statement allowed ttb proposed the regulation for the health labeling of alcohol beverages in october 1999 25 the rule would prohibit the appearance on labels or in advertising of any statement that makes substantive claim regarding health benefits associated with the consumption of alcohol beverages unless such claims are properly qualified balanced sufficiently detailed and specific in addition the claims would have to outline the categories of individuals for whom any positive health effects would be outweighed by numerous negative health effects ttb also proposed to prohibit any advertisements that attribute health benefits to the consumption of alcohol beverages unless such statements are appropriately qualified in manner that is not likely to result in either consumer confusion or deception the bureau requested comments on the question of whether the negative consequences of alcohol consumption or abuse disqualify as misleading these products entirely from entitlement to any healthrelated statements it also sought comments on whether healthrelated statements on alcohol beverage labels and advertising that directs consumers to information sources such as the us dietary guidelines are misleading and whether ttb should continue to approve such statements the agency stated that the proposed regulation was intended to ensure that labels and advertisements do not contain statements or claims that would tend to mislead consumers about the potential health consequences of alcohol consumption the closing date for comments was february 22 2000 subsequently ttb announced that it would hold public hearings in five cities concerning health claims and other healthrelated statements on the labeling of alcohol beverages26 the public hearings were scheduled to be held in washington dc

march 3 2003 the department of the treasury published the final rule on health claims and related statements in the labeling and advertising for alcohol beverages27 the regulation requires that ttb evaluate health claims on caseby case basis to determine if such claims would tend to mislead consumers it codifies the bureaus longstanding position that any substantive health benefit claim is considered misleading unless it is truthful and adequately substantiated by scientificmedical evidence sufficiently details and qualified with respect to categories of individuals for whom the claim applies adequately discloses the health risks associated with alcohol consumption and outlines the categories of individuals for whom any level of alcohol consumption may cause health risks the rule requires that any such claim include appropriate qualifications and disclaimers about health risks associated with alcohol consumption in addition healthrelated directional statements that are not substantive health claims must nonetheless include disclaimer to clarify that the statement does not advocate the consumption of alcohol beverages for health reasons or some other appropriate disclaimer to avoid misleading consumers ttb will consult with fda as needed on the use of specific health claims on labels if fda determines that specific claim is drug claim that is not in compliance with the requirements of fdca ttb will not approve the use of such statements on labels the rule is scheduled to go into effect on june 2 2003 foods labeling claims and warning requirements in the early 1990s fda and usda undertook comprehensive overhaul of food labeling with primary focus on improving nutrition information and consistency across food labels for consumers the nutrition labeling and education act of 1990 nlea provided fda with the mandate to implement the labeling changes while usda agreed to implement similar changes under its existing authority the new labeling rules required for the first time that labels provide nutrition information and complete ingredient listing on most foods in addition food products were allowed to provide nutrient content and health claims under certain circumstances the requirements for the labeling claims and warnings on food products are numerous28 for purposes of this report only those provisions that are comparable to those for alcohol beverages are reviewed the following discussion generally applies to both labeling on the food products regulated by fda and the meat and poultry products regulated by usda food and meat

manufacturer wishing to make new nutrient content claim must first petition the agency fda then must review the petition and propose regulation for the new claim before it can become final regulation

regulation authorizing them has been issued by fda nlea created petition process requiring manufacturers to provide the publicly available scientific evidence that it believes established the basis for the diet and health relationship the petitioner also must provide information about the claim that will be made and the proposed wording nlea requires the agency to conduct review to determine whether the science supports the existence of the relationship fda was directed to authorize health claim when based on the totality of the publicly available scientific evidence from welldesigned studies there is significant scientific agreement ssa among qualified scientific experts that the claim is supported by the evidence this review is subject to notice and comment rulemaking in short health claim statements in labeling are to be specific affirmative statements that are accurate based on the totality of the scientific evidence and able to convince qualified individuals that the food substance when used in dietary context will have the stated impact on disease or other healthrelated condition health claims are not allowed if food contains certain components that are present at level that would represent health risk disqualifying levels were set for total fat saturated fat cholesterol and sodium the food and drug administration modernization act of 1997 fdama pl 97105 provided an alternative mechanism for the authorization of health claims in part because the interested parties recognized the timeconsuming resourceintensive nature of the nleamandated scientific review process fasttrack options were viewed as possible when the scientific work had already been done elsewhere fdama directed that health and nutrient content claims could be authorized under circumstances where an authoritative statement as had been issued by scientific body with nutrition research expertise of the federal government or the national academy of sciences the act identified four criteria for statements to be considered authoritative the statement has to be currently in effect concern relationship or nutrient level be published and can not be statement of an individual employee of the authoring organization the manufacturer planning to make the claim must notify the agency that claim will be made based on an as the notification must contain the exact wording of the claim and the as supporting it description of the determination that the requirements for an as are satisfied and balanced representation of the scientific literature to which the claim refers the substance that is the subject of the claim must also be safe and lawful and crs11 present at level in the food that is sufficiently high in an appropriate form to justify the claim fda then has 120 days to determine whether the claim meets the agencys criteria allowing it to be made alcohol beverage legislation several bills were introduced in the 106th congress that concerned alcohol beverages of which three bills relate directly to ttb labeling activities the alcohol beverage labeling act of 1999 s 431 would have amended the alcohol beverage labeling act of 1988 to grant authority to the secretary of health and human services for all functions that are exercised currently by the secretary of the treasury related to the 1988 act determination of the functions and related resources to be transferred would be made by the office of management and budget the personnel currently responsible for those functions at the department of the treasury would be transferred to hhs the bill was referred to the committee on commerce science and transportation related bill the alcohol abuse prevention and treatment trust fund act of 1999 s 432 would have amended the internal revenue code of 1986 to increase the rate of tax on wine and dedicate the resulting increased revenue to programs for the prevention and treatment of alcohol abuse the current tax rate on wine is considerably below that of beer and distilled spirits this bill was referred to the committee on finance third bill the alcoholic beverage label preservation act of 1999 s 433 would have prohibited additional statements and representations related to alcohol beverages and health the bill would have prohibited any alcohol beverage container from carrying any statement or representation relating to alcohol beverages and health other than the current government warning statements required by the 1988 act as outlined above it was referred to the committee on commerce science and transportation two other bills addressed the issue of alcohol shipments hr 2094 the state responsible alcohol access enforcement act would have allowed enforcement of laws prohibiting certain alcohol shipments and required ftc to conduct study and determine whether additional authority is needed to regulate the sale marketing and advertising of alcohol beverages in remote forms of commerce hr 2161 the alcohol shipment to minor prohibition act would have prohibited the shipping of alcohol beverages to minors both bills were referred to the committee on judiciary final action was taken on any bills on alcohol beverages in the 106th congress and bills that address these issues have been introduced since key issues concerning health claims on alcohol beverages the ttbs final regulation for the health labeling of alcohol beverages prohibits the appearance on labels of any statement that makes substantive claim regarding health benefits associated with the consumption of alcohol beverages unless such claims are properly qualified balanced sufficiently detailed and specific along with outlining the categories of individuals for whom any positive health effects would be crs12 outweighed by numerous negative health effects the final rule also prohibits any advertisements that attribute health benefits to the consumption of alcohol beverages unless such statement is appropriately qualified in manner that is not likely to result in either consumer confusion or deception the agency had sought comments on whether the negative consequences of alcohol consumption or abuse disqualify as misleading these products entirely from entitlement to any healthrelated statements and whether healthrelated statements on alcohol beverage labels and advertising directing consumers to authoritative sources of information are misleading warranting termination of their approval the agency has stated its intention to ensure that labels and advertisements do not contain statements or claims that would tend to mislead consumers about the significant health consequences of alcohol consumption feasibility in the current health claim regulatory environment it seems possible to interpret ttbs final rule in several ways the regulation seems to suggest that making such claims is possible if the manufacturer or the bureau can craft statements that adequately qualify the health messages to convey the level of substantiation andor provide an authoritative statement to support it however the difficulty of establishing such qualifying statements has been demonstrated by fdas recent experience with health claims when only limited or preliminary scientific evidence on relationship is available the challenge arises in determining when the scientific evidence available is enough to make any meaningful statement and then crafting the claim to be truthful and not misleading to consumers the claim generally needs to be coupled with disclaimer to provide context that clarifies the level of evidence supporting the claim the challenge arises in wording the claim and disclaimer so as not to mislead consumers the only way to adequately ascertain success in consumer interpretation and understanding is to conduct consumer research on the claim and disclaimer before they appear on the product the limited space on most packaging further complicates the extent to which adequate information can be provided for consumers use alternatively the ttbs rule might be viewed as suggesting an outright prohibition of any health claim for alcohol this view seems to be supported by the agencys solicitation of comments on whether negative health effects deny any entitlement to health claims in light of the agencys recognition of and request for comments on the negative consequences of alcohol use one of the bills in the 106th congress would have prohibited these claims on alcohol beverages however an outright prohibition might raise first amendment constitutional questions in 1996 the competitive enterprise institute cei filed suit against ttb to challenge the agencys delay in acting on ceis petition to issue rule allowing truthful statements concerning the health benefits of moderate drinking on alcohol beverage labeling and advertisements the case which had challenged the constitutionality of ttbs ban on information about the cardiovascular benefits of moderate alcohol consumption on product labels and advertisements was settled in 1998 by the district court granting the governments motion for summary judgment on ceis challenge to the denial of its rulemaking petition in 1999 fda lost case before the united states court of appeals for the dc circuit in pearson v shalala when the court held unconstitutional under the first amendment fda rules that prohibited four separate health claims related to dietary supplements the court decision required that fda not only allow the claims but also craft disclaimers to assure that consumers are not crs13 misled by them efforts are currently underway at fda to broaden the use of health claims with disclaimers to the health claims on conventional foods if health claims are to be allowed one option might be to consolidate or locate them together with the required warning labels placing the warning statement on the side or back of containers while the health information statement would likely appear on the front seems to have the potential for consumer confusion streamlined statement containing the most pertinent parts of both statements could be developed for example revised consolidated statement might read government warning 1 according to the surgeon general pregnant women and anyone operating car or machinery should not drink 2 learn about the health effects of alcohol beverages by consulting your family doctor or sending for the federal governments dietary guidelines for americans center for nutrition policy and promotion usda 1120 20th street nw washington dc 20036 or visit its web site httpwwwusdagovcnpp while consolidating the messages the regulations could continue to require the government warning statement and allow manufacturers to include the additional statement of health effects on voluntary basis allowing the current practice of directing consumers to the dietary guidelines or physicians for further information on health effects for all alcohol beverage products might be seen as consistent with existing policy for food labeling regarding authoritative statements however food labeling regulations prohibit claims on products that contain certain ingredients that are present at harmful levels similar policy does not currently exist for the alcohol content of beverages furthermore there is the difficulty of establishing harmful or unsafe levels of alcohol in addition identifying physicians as the source of additional information assumes that they are knowledgeable about both negative and potentially positive health effects of alcohol beverages and can advise their patients accordingly agency jurisdiction currently ttb has regulatory jurisdiction over all alcohol beverages and fda regulates other beverages and most foods separate agencies can establish separate standards for labeling the products in their jurisdiction so ttb policy does not necessarily have to be consistent with that of fda however different labeling requirements can be potentially confusing to consumers who might assume that labeling and other regulations are set by single agency or consistent across government agencies for example the nutrition information now required on food products is not available to consumers on alcohol beverages which can add significant caloric intake to the daily diet transferring alcohol labeling authority to fda as proposed in one of the bills from the 106th congress would promote consistency with the assumption that the agency would require comparable rules for all product claim messages alternatively options might include leaving responsibility for the labeling and claims standards to the discretion of ttb directing the two agencies to work together under the existing mou to achieve comparable claims requirements or requiring ttb to adopt the comparable rules to fdas nutrient composition and claims rules crs14 any proposal to transfer authority to fda raises the issue of the premarket label approval that is currently required for alcohol beverages this requirement would be departure from current fda policy in that food labels are not pre approved since fda does not currently have authority to review food labels prior to marketing continued requirements to do so for alcohol beverages would need to be addressed since it is tied to other responsibilities that ttb would be likely to retain another issue would concern the possibility of using structurefunction claims on alcohol beverages if such transfer in jurisdiction took place this type of claim which is currently allowed for foods and supplements is truthful not misleading statement on how substance affects the structure or function of the body and only requires the manufacturer to notify the agency that the claim will be made substantiation of the claim needs to be in the manufacturers possession but the level of scientific support required for structurefunction claim is considerably less than for health claim finally ftc is responsible for food advertising and has long sought to make advertising as consistent with labeling rules as allowed under its statutory requirements further research additional research andor consensus may be needed before the issue of health claims for alcohol beverages can be fully resolved since there are questions as to how well the research supports claim on the benefits versus the risks of alcohol beverage consumption legislation could be considered to require either additional research andor consensus review to determine the benefits of alcohol consumption this type of work could generate some type of authoritative statement on the relationship the bill language could be written to provide that claims would only be allowed if they were made in the same manner and under the same conditions as nlea and fdama claims including disqualifying levels of substances that present health risk finally the claim wording might also be required to state the limitation of the benefit ie benefit is only observed when total consumption is limited to 12 number of drinks per day depending on sex and age consumer behavior finally the eternal issue arises as to the impact that warning and health benefit labels have in general on consumer behavior consumers are well aware of the food label and nutrition facts panel following the education effort carried out by publicprivate partnership after nlea passage and the final rules were published consumer use of the food label especially the changes to improve it since 1990 have been examined by several researchers the public private partnership educational effort was organized to coordinate the efforts of many groupsorganizations with limited resources and its success in reaching consumers with the message has been well documented29 consumers are aware of and report using the nutrition facts panel ingredient information and claims in their purchases however less clear is the longterm impact of this knowledge on eating habits and dietary changes health claim statements on food product labels may in the end have very little impact on consumer behavior advertising statements and nutrient content flags 29 guthrie j b derby levy what people know and do not know about nutrition in americas eating habits changes consequences us dept of agriculture ag info bull no750 april 1999 p 243 crs15 across the front of packages may have more influence on consumer purchases and indirectly on food consumption than health claims similarly consumers are aware of the alcohol warning labels but it is unclear whether they have any effect on drinking habits the samhsa survey conducted on the possible addition of health benefit statements to alcohol labels suggests that the additional statements will not influence consumers drinking habits the literature on the impact of the alcohol beverage warning labels suggest that over time knowledge of the label statements increased consumer awareness30 however recent study on alcohol warning labels conducted by the center for science in the public interest found that the statements were difficult to notice due to the size lacked prominence and readibility of the statements which were serious barriers to their overall effectiveness31 nevertheless the long term impact of this knowledge on drinking habits is unclear awareness and an ability to repeat the messages whether the statements are warning labels or health messages does not necessarily translate into behavior change whether concerned with food or alcohol beverage products 30 wolfgan l charting recent progress
