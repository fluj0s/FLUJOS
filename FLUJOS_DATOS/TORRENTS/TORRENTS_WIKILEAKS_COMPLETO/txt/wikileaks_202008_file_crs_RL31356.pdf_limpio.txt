the broad category of trade arrangements under which membercountries grant one another preferential treatment in trade preferential trade arrangements include the following free trade areas ftas under which member countries agree to eliminate tariffs and nontariff barriers on trade in goods within the fta but each country maintains its own trade policies including tariffs on trade outside the region customs unions in which members conduct free trade among themselves and maintain common tariffs and other trade policies outside the arrangement common markets in which member countries go beyond customs union by eliminating barriers to labor and capital flows across national borders within the market and economic unions where members merge their economies even further by establishing

most significant example of group of countries that has gone from customs union to an economic union1 the process of forming an fta usually begins with discussions between trading partners to ascertain the feasibility of forming an fta if they agree to go forward then the countries undertake negotiations on what the fta would look like at minimum participants in an fta agree to eliminate tariffs and some other nontariff trade barriers and agree to do so over specific time period in addition the partner countries usually agree on rules of origin that is definition of what constitutes product manufactured within the fta and therefore one that is eligible to receive dutyfree and other preferential trade treatment rules of origin prevent products from nonmembers entering an fta market over the lowest tariff wall most ftas also include procedures on the settlement of disputes arising among members and rules on the implementation of border controls such as product safety certification and sanitary and phytosanitary requirements most recent ftas contain rules on economic activities besides trade in goods including foreign investment intellectual property rights protection treatment of labor and environment and trade in services the size and complexity of the fta will largely reflect the size and complexity of the economic relations among the participating countries us ftas with israel and jordan are relatively basic while the nafta the united states canada and mexico is very complex

tariffs and some nontariff barriers ftas permit the products of fta partners easier access to one anothers markets the 1989 fta between the united states and canada was formed arguably for this purpose developed countries have also formed ftas with developing countries to encourage them toward trade and investment liberalization ftas may be used to protect local exporters from losing out to foreign companies that might receive preferential treatment under other ftas for example some supporters of the uschile fta argued that us firms were at disadvantage visàvis their canadian competitors whose exports face chilean tariffs under the canadachile fta slow progress in multilateral negotiations has been another impetus for ftas for example when the 19861994 uruguay round negotiations got bogged down the impetus for the united states mexico and canada to form nafta seemed to increase arguably the surge in fta formation worldwide in the past few years has been result of the difficulties encountered in launching and implementing the doha development agenda round of negotiations in the wto 1 besides the arrangements described above under which member countries extend reciprocal preferential treatment there are trade arrangements under which one party agrees to extend nonreciprocal preferential treatment to the imports of country or group of countries unilaterally such arrangements involve primarily developed countries extending nonreciprocal preferential treatment to the imports from developing countries for example the united states employs the generalized system of preferences gsp the andean trade preferences act atpa the caribbean basin initiative cbi and the africa growth and opportunity act agoa the main objective of these nonreciprocal arrangements is to encourage economic development in developing countries

presidential administrations has had several interrelated objectives one has been to secure open markets for us exports second has been to protect domestic producers from foreign unfair trade practices and from rapid surges in fairly traded imports third has been to control trade for foreign policy and national security reasons fourth objective has been to help foster global trade to promote world economic growth in fulfilling these objectives us political leaders have formed and conducted trade policy along three tracks one track has been the use of multilateral negotiations to establish and develop rulesbased trading system the united states was major player in the development and signing of the general agreement on tariffs and trade ga tt in 1947 it was leader in nine rounds of negotiations that have expanded the coverage of ga tt and that led to the establishment in 1995 of the world trade organization wto the body that administers the gatt and other multilateral trade agreements the united states s continued this approach as leader in the latest roundthe doha development agenda dda us policymakers have used second track which can be labeled the unilateral track under this approach the united states threatens retaliation usually in the form of restricting trade partners access to the vast us market in order to get the partner to open its markets to us exports or to cease other offensive commercial practices and policies the united states has employed this approach primarily against foreign practices not covered by gattwto rules or because the multilateral dispute settlement process proved too slow and ineffective to meet us needs for several decades especially in the 1970s and 1980s the united states conducted its trade policy with japan unilaterally to get japan to amend domestic laws regulations and practices that prevented us exporters from securing what they considered to be fair share of the japanese market more and more however us trade policy is becoming dominated by third trackbilateral and regional negotiations to establish ftas the united states completed its first fta with israel in 1985 under president reagan it completed its second with canada under president bush in 1989 whose administration was involved in the process of expanding it to mexico process that was completed by the clinton administration in 1993 however even after the completion of nafta it was still unclear whether bilateral and regional ftas had become fixture in us foreign trade policymaking or anomalies to cement already strong economic relationships by 1994 it seemed apparent that ftas were indeed becoming fixture when the united states under the clinton administration led group of trade ministers from 33 other western hemispheric countries in agreeing to work toward establishing free trade area of the americas ftaa by 2005 in the same year political leaders from the united states and other membercountries of the asianpacific economic cooperation apec forum signed declaration in bogor indonesia to work toward free trade and investment in the region by 2010 for developed countries and by 2020 for all membercountries both of those efforts have flagged

similarly president clinton and singapore prime mini ster goh chok tong announced somewhat unexpectedly on november 16 2000 that their two nations would launch negotiations to complete free trade agreement and on december 6 2000 the united states and chile had started negotiations to establish an fta chile had long been mentioned as potential addition to nafta or as partner in standalone fta in the meantime many countries including th other major trading powers were actively negotiating free trade agreements the wto has reported that more than 200 ftas are in force for example canada formed an fta with chile as did mexico the eu has formed ftas with number of countries japan which had shunned the use of ftas formed an fta with singapore and is exploring the possibility of forming

the bush administration had affirmed the strategy of pursuing us trade policy goals through the multilateral trade system but gave strong emphasis to building bilateral and regional trade ties through free trade agreements lamenting that the united states was involved at the time in only two ftas while most of its major trading partners were negotiating many more thenustr robert zoellick stated early in the administration americas absence from the proliferation of trade accords hurts our exporters if other countries go ahead with free trade agreements and the united states does not we must blame ourselves we have to get back into the ga and take the lead we are certainly in position to do so indeed the united states will be pursuing number of regional free trade agreements in the years ahead though not to the exclusion of global talks and the wto process the fact that the united states can move on multiple fronts increases our leverage in the global round just as the clinton administ ration used the north american free trade agreement and the apec summit to help sq ueeze the european union to complete the uruguay round of gatt 2 zoellick also stated by moving on multiple fronts the united states can create competition in liberalization italics added that will increase us leverage and promote open markets in our hemisphere and around the world3 the bush administration

impact on the countries included in an fta and on the rest of the world it is an issue that economists have long studied and debated interest in the issue has peaked at various times in the postworld war ii period the first time was the formation of the european common market interest has peaked again with the current trends in ftas the debate has relied largely on theory since empirical data are scarce save for the experience of the european union the debate has also divided economists between those who strongly oppose ftas as an economically inefficient mechanism and those who support them as means to build freer trade economists usually base their analysis of the impact of ftas on the concepts of trade creation and trade diversion these concepts were first developed by economist jacob viner in 1950 5 viner focused his work on the economic effects of customs unions but his conclusions have been largely applied to ftas and other preferential trade arrangements his analysis was also confined to static onetime effects of these arrangements trade creation occurs when member of an fta replaces domestic production of good with imports of the good from another member of the fta because the formation of the fta has made it cheaper to import rather than produce domestically the creation of the trade is said to improve economic welfare within the group because resources are being shifted to more efficient uses trade diversion occurs when member of an fta switches its import of good from an efficient nonmember to less efficient member because the removal of tariffs within the group and the continuation of tariffs on imports from nonmembers make it cheaper to do so trade diversion is said to reduce economic welfare because resources are being diverted from an efficient producer to less efficient producer in most cases it appears that ftas lead to both trade diversion and trade creation with the net effects determined by the structure of the fta therefore even if two or more countries are moving toward freer trade among themselves in an fta the fta could make those countries and the world as whole worse off if the fta diverts more trade than it creates according to economic theory 6 see box below for illustrative examples of trade diversion and trade creation 5 viner jacob the customs union issue carnegie endowment for international peace 1950 new york 6 this

trade policymakers encounter circumstances much more complicated than what are depicted in economic theory many functioning and proposed ftas encompass more than two countries and involve range of products both goods and services making it much more challenging to evaluate their economic impact to provide an analytical framework some economists have developed sets of conditions under which they have concluded an fta would create more trade than its diverts they state that trade creation is likely to exceed trade diversion the larger the tariffs or other trade barriers among members before the fta is formed the lower the tariffs and other barriers in trade with nonmembers the greater the number of countries included in the fta the more competitive or the less complementary the economies joining the fta and the closer the economic relationship among the members before the fta was formed7 7 salvatore dominick international economics fifth edition englewood cliffs nj prenticehall 1995

static effects of trade diversion and creation ftas generate longterm dynamic effects that might include the following increased efficiency of production as producers face increased competition with the removal of trade barriers economies of scale that is decreased unit costs of production as producers can have larger production runs since the markets for their goods have been enlarged and increased foreign investment from outside the fta as firms seek to locate operations within the borders of the fta to take advantage of the preferential trade arrangements 8 until recently not many ftas were in operation therefore available data on their impact have been limited to the experience of the formation of the european common market and subsequently the european union most studies have concluded that the european community has resulted in more trade creation than trade diversion however in some sectors such as agriculture the net effect has been trade diversion because the eus common agricultural policy raised barriers to agricultural trade outside the eu 9 g8g22g3g156g561g138g151g141g561g157g145g142g561g25g22g17g561 basic principle of the general agreement on tariffs and

product originating in or destined for any other country shall be accorded immediately and unconditionally to the like product originating in or destined for the territories of all other contracting parties ftas by definition violate the mfn principle since products of fta member countries are given preferential treatment over nonmember products however the original ga tt signatories recognized that ftas and customs unions while violating the mfn principle improve economic welfare of all members if certain conditions are met to minimize trade diversion article xxiv of the ga tt requires that fta members shall not erect higher or more restrictive tariff or nontariff barriers on trade with nonmembers than existed prior to the formation of the fta furthermore article xxiv requires the elimination of tariffs and other trade restrictions be applied to substantially all the trade between the constituent territories in products originating in such territories in addition article xxiv stipulates that the elimination of duties and other trade restrictions on trade within the fta to be accomplished within reasonable length of time meaning period of longer than 10 years according to the understanding of the interpretation of article xxiv of the general agreement on tariffs and trade reached during the uruguay round member countries are required to report to the wto their

the agreement that governs trade in services under the wto provides for the preferential treatment of trade in services within ftas or similar regional trading arrangements article v lays out requirements of substantial coverage of the elimination of trade restrictions and the prohibition on the ex post facto imposition of higher restrictions on services trade with nonmember countries the wto formed the committee on regional trade agreements crta in 1996 to review pending and operating ftas and customs unions to determine whether they conform to wto rules under the ga tt and the gats however the rules are sufficiently ambiguous as to be subject to continuing debate within the crta for example the members have been unable to agree on what constitutes substantially all trade under article xxiv gatt or substantially all sectors under article v gats10 the number of ftas and customs unions worldwide has increased at rapid rate as of july 2007 380 ftas and customs unions had been notified to the gattwto some 205 ftas and customs unions are in force the remaining ftas and customs unions were largely superseded by other agreements involving the same participants11 yet none of the reports of notifications has been completed because crta members have not been able to reach consensus on any of them nevertheless the vast majority of the ftas have gone into operation for example the crta has not completed its report on nafta which went into effect in january 1994 the proliferation of ftas and disagreements on rules have crippled the wto review process and led wto members to place review of the rules on regional agreements on the agenda of the doha development agenda round the doha ministerial declaration which established the agenda for the new round states

over whether th ey promote or damage us economic interests and the economic interests of the world at large the differing views can be categorized into three main groups one group consists of those who oppose ftas because they assert ftas undermine the development of the multilateral trading system and act as stumbling block to global trade liberalization second group supports ftas because they believe ftas act as building block to multilateral trade liberalization the third category are those individuals and groups that are opposed to trade liberalization in general because they believe its impact on workers in importsensitive sectors or on the environment is unacceptable or because they assert it undermines us sovereignty among representatives of the first group of experts are international economists jagdish bhagwati and anne krueger who have strongly advocated that the united states and other national governments should not pursue ftas at the expense of multilateral

imported into developing countries and even on some laborintensive goods such as wearing apparel and agricultural products imported into developed countries consequently he asserts trade diversion will likely result when an fta is formed12 both bhagwati and krueger cite the rules of origin and other conditions of an fta s establishment for strong criticism bhagwati claims for example that the rules of origin in one fta more than likely do not coincide with the rules of origin in many of the other ftas furthermore he argues the schedule of implementation of the tariff reductions and other conditions for one fta will not match the schedule of other ftas the incongruity of these regulations across ftas has created what bhagwati sees as customs administration nightmare and calls the spaghettibowl phenomenon 13 in her criticism krueger claims that in order to meet the input thresholds of rules of origin requirements producers in one fta partner will be encouraged to purchase as many inputs as possible from other partner countries even if nonfta member can produce and sell the inputs more cheaply and even if the tariff rate on inputs from nonfta producers is zero importing inputs from within the fta to meet the rules of origin threshold allows the producer to sell the final product within the fta duty free under such circumstances imports of inputs are diverted from efficient producers outside the fta to less efficient producers inside the fta corollary to kruegers conclusion is that the higher the threshold established in the rules of origin the greater the chance that trade diversion will take place 14 range of economists policymakers and other experts embrace second view that ftas can enhance trade and should be pursued economist robert z lawrence argues for example that recent ftas involve much more economic integration than the elimination of tariffs nafta he points out has led to the reduction in barriers on services trade foreign investment and other economic activities not covered by the ga ttwto in addition under nafta mexico has affirmed its commitment to economic reform making its economy more efficient lawrence asserts that the theory traditionally applied to ftas by bhagwati krueger and others does not take into account these dynamic welfare enhancing characteristics of ftas which he believes are likely to outweigh any trade diversion that results from the elimination of tariffs 15 cato institute study by economist edward l hudgins argues that while it may be preferable to liberalize trade multilaterally countries should take any available avenue including bilateral or regional ftas even if they lead to some trade diversion furthermore hudgins asserts that ftas can be more efficient vehicles for addressing difficult trade barriers than the wto where the large membership requires compromise to the least common denominator to achieve consensus 12 bhagwati jagdish the wind of the hundred days how

move ahead with new trade rounds he claims16 economist c fred bergsten holds position similar to the one expressed in the cato study that in lieu of multilateral trade negotiations ftas are the next best thing and promote global trade liberalization bergsten has advocated establishi ng us ftas with new zealand and with south korea economist jeffrey schott argues that some us firms are being discriminated against because ftas are rapidly forming in which the united states is not participant therefore in his review the united states must negotiate ftas 17 bergsten and others have also advocated structuring ftas in manner that could serve as building blocks of global free trade system usin g the apec plan as model bergsten argues for an fta based on open regionalism that is establishing the road map for free trade and investment in the asianpacific region for 20102020 among the members but allowing other countries to join if they agree to accede to the conditions in order to minimize trade diversion he suggests that trade and investment could be implemented on an mfn principle perhaps conditional mfn in order to limit the free rider effects other countries and other regional groupings bergsten presumes would be willing to accept the conditions having been enticed by the trade and investment opportunities until most of the membership of the wto would be engaged in forming free trade area 18 heritage foundation report draws up similar proposal for global free trade association19 third group opposes ftas but also trade liberalization or globalization in general included in this group are representatives of importsensitive industries for example labor unions and representatives of social action groups such as some environmentalists who question the wisdom of trade liberalization whether done through multilateral negotiations or through bilateral and regional trading arrangements they assert that trade liberalization unfairly affects workers by exporting jobs to countries with lower wages and undermines the nations ability to protect the environment by allowing companies to relocate to countries with less stringent environmental regulations 20 for example the united auto workers uaw union has stated the following position regarding the free trade area of the americas ftaa such an agreement would provide broader protections for the rights of corporations further undermine the ability of governments in the region to regulate their economies in the interests of their citizens and intensify the downward pressure on workers incomes through competition for jobs and investments all of this would take place in the absence of any counterbalancing protections for workers consumers or the environment this is why the uaw has consistently opposed the direction of these negotiations the pos itions taken by the 16 hudgins edward l regional and multilateral trade agreements complementary means to open markets cato journal vol 15 23

many as significant trade policy vehicle for the united states and for other major trading nations over the last 1015 years the debate in us trade policy has shifted from should the united states form ftas to should the united states form any more ftas and if so with whom when and under what conditions congress has direct role in addressing those questions before any fta can go into effect the congress must review it as part of implementing legislation the 111th congress and the obama administration face the question of whether and when to act on three pending ftaswith colombia panama and south korea although the bush administration signed these agreements it and the leaders of the 110th congress could not reach agreement on proceeding to enact them during the presidential campaign thensen obama expressed skepticism about the agreements and about bush administration fta policy in general some members of congress have also raised concerns about the ftas in addition the trade promotion authority tpa expired on july 1 2007 meaning that any new ftas concluded would not likely receive expedited legislative consideration unless that the authority is renewed number of questions regarding ftas could arise one question pertains to the economic impact of an fta as with any trade liberalizing measure an fta can have positive effects on some sectors and adverse effects on others an fta may create trade for one sector of the us economy but divert trade away from others memb er of congress is placed in the position of weighing the effects on hisher constituency versus the overall impact on the united states and other trading partners because conditions can differ radically from one fta to another the evaluation will likely differ in each case furthermore members might take into account not only the immediate static effects of ftas but also th longterm dynamic effects which could play an important role in evaluating their contribution to us economy second broader question is whether bilateral and regional ftas are the appropriate trade policy strategy to promote us national interests economic specialists differ sharply on this question with some viewing the proliferation of ftas as leading to confusion and serving as stumbling blocks to the development of rulesbased multilateral trading system other specialists consider ftas as appropriate trade policy vehicles for promoting freer trade as building blocks to multilateral system and as necessary to protect us interests against the ftas that other countries are forming without the united states still others oppose trade liberalization in any form as counter to us interests third question is whether the office of the united states trade representative and other trade policy agencies have sufficient time and human resources to negotiate number of ftas simultaneously while managing trade policy in the wto and other fora others might find some us interests being shortchanged 21 httpwwwuawcom

concerns be included in ftas this issue has emerged in number of completed and ongoing fta negotiations fifth overarching question is what criteria should the united states employ in determining which countries would make appropriate fta partners for example to what degree should political factors be given weight over economic factors
