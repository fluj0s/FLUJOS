requirements to ensure the provision of fape originally enacted in 1975 the act responded to increased awareness of the need to educate children with disabilities and to judicial decisions requiri ng that states provide an education for children with disabilities if they provided an edu cation for children without disabilities3 however the statute contains specific pr ovision relating to which part has the burden of proof in due process hearing generally when stat ute is silent about th burden of proof the burden is placed on the party initiating the proceeding4 however this is not an absolute rule and other factors such as policy c onsiderations convenien ce and fairness may change the allocation of the burden of proof5 schaffer v weast the supreme court in 62 deci sion written by ju stice oconnor6 held that the burden of proof regarding an allegedly inade quate iep in an idea due process hearing rests with the party seeking the relief justice stevens filed concurring opinion while justices ginsburg and breyer dissented th supreme courts decision clarified split in the circuits on the issue brian schaffer who was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd as well as other l earning disabilities had attended private school til the seventh grade when his mother was told by that school that he should attend school that could more adequately accommoda his disabilities brian s mother contacted the local public school and requested an evaluation to determine his ligibility for special education and also applied to another private school the public sc hool found brian eligible for idea services and proposed an iep wh ich would give brian 153 hours of special education and 45 minutes of speech therapy each week brians parents requested due process hearing alleging that the proposed ie p was inadequate due to brians need for smaller classes and more intensive services and that he should be placed in private school the administrative law judge alj observing that the evidence was close assigned the burden of proof to the parents finding that deference was owed to educational professionals ultimately the alj held that the parents had not met the burden of proof and upheld the schools proposed iep on ppeal the district court agreed with the parents regarding the burden of proof and remanded the case to the alj who then found that the public school had failed to prove the adequacy of the iep about this time the school district offered the pa rents placement for brian in high school with special learning center the parents accepted this placement but the suit continued since the parents sought compensation for the privat school tuition eventually the case camehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22353crs3 7 377 f3d 449 4th cir 2004 8 slip

uasive reason to depart from the normal rule of allocating the burden to the party seeking relief7 the supreme court granted certiorari to resolve the issue regarding the burden of proof the supreme court in an opinion by ju stice oconnor first observed that absent some reason to believe that congress intended otherwise we will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies wh ere it usually falls upon the party seeking relief8 justice oconnor then examined various reasons dvanced to support the argument that the burden of proof should be on the school system first the court rejected the argument that the term due process in idea shoul d be interpreted in its constitutional sense which would require the appli cation of balancing test second it was argued that the court should rely on the district court decisions of mills v board of education9 and pennsylvania association for retarded children v commonwealth10 which were used by the drafters of the original idea statute justice oconnor rejected this argument accepting the reasoning of the fourth circuit that the fact that congress incorporated number of the procedural safeguards from these cases into the statute does not mean that congress intended to adopt the ideas that it did not incorporate into the statute third placing the burden of proof on the schools it was argued by the parents would further ideas purposes by ensuri ng fape the supreme court noted that assigning the burden of proof to school districts might encourage schools to put more resources into preparing ieps and presenting their evidence11 however this argument was also rejected by the cour t which stated that idea is silent about whether marginal dollars should be allocated to litigation and ad ministrative expenditure s or to educational services12 the expense of litigating due process complaint was noted and the court observed that congress has also repeatedly amended the act in order to reduce its administrative and litigationrelated costs13 examples of attempts to reduce these burdens where found in the new idea requi rement in pl 108446 for resolution session14 and the new findings concerning resolving differences in positive and constructive ways15 justice oconnor concluded that th parents in effect ask this court to assume that every iep is invalid until the sc hool district demonstrates that it is not the act does not support this conclusion16 the supreme court noted that the most plau sible argument advanced by the parents was that in the interest of fairness the burden of proof should not be placed on partyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22353crs4 17 slip op at 10 citing united states v new york nh hr co 355 us 253 256 n 5 1957 18 slip op at 10 19 slip op at 11 20 see eg m inn stat 125a091

adversary17 school districts were seen as having natural advantage regarding the information but justice oconnor did not find this to be determinat ive since congress addressed this when it obliged schools to safeguard the procedural ri ghts of parents and to share information with them18 the court noted that idea provide s parents with the right to review records to have an independent educati onal evaluation to have details about options considered by the school district as well as disclosure of evaluations and recommendations and to receive attorneys fees in the discretion of court if they prevail justice oconnor concluded that these protections ensure that the school bears unique informational advantage19 finally the court observed that several states have laws or regulations which always place the burden of proof on the sc hool district20 although the court noted the existence of these laws and regulations the majority held that since there was maryland law or regulation relating to the bur den of proof it was not necessary to decide whether the allocation of the burden of proof should be left to the states justice stevens concurred in the opinion of the court while justice ginsburg and breyer wrote separate dissents in his c oncurrence justice stevens observed that he joined the majoritys opinion not only for th reasons in justice oconnors decision but also because i believe that we should pres ume that public school officials are properly performing their difficult responsibilitie s under this important statute21 justice ginsburg dissented from the cour ts majority opinion she agreed that ordinarily when the statute is silent the burden of proof is on the person initiating the proceeding however she emphasized that other factors such as policy considerations and fairness may change the burden of proof this was the situation in schaffer justice ginsburg argued idea was described as imposing an affirmative obligation on public school systems who had greater expertise and thus were in better position than parents to demonstrate the adequacy of the iep she opined that placing the burden on the district to show that its plan measures up to the statutorily mandated free appropriate public educationwill strengthen school officials resolve to choose course genuinely tailored to the childs individual needs22 justice breyer dissented on different gr ounds he found both the majoritys and justice ginsbergs arguments to be reasonabl but stated my own view is that congress took neither approach it did not decide the burden of persuasion question instead it lefthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22353crs5 23 justice breyer dissenting at 3 24 id at 5 the matter to the states for decision23 justice breyer noted that idea was an exercise in cooperative federalism and that respecting the states right to decide this procedural matter here where education is at issue where expertise matters and where costs are shared is consistent with that cooperative approach24
