government and organization lecture given on 1 november 1966 thank you thank you very much we have lecture here today because ifor the sole reason that i havent put in an appearance lately that is the sole reason youre having lecture there isnt anything you dont know there isnt anything at all now there isnt anything you dont know anything there isnt anything you need to know you are allwise totally omnipotent totally omniscient got to get some misunderstoods in here and the last 0 ornery i mean i shouldnt yes well anyway ill define those words for you you know onmiscient thats knowing everything you see and onmipotent that is totally powerful and although you are all these things of course some of you havent totally made the grade so i thought id give you talk today on some changes in organization and as subject which is as far from most of your interests as an advisory council and i begin with word of warning that you had in actual fact better be interested in what these things are because youre looking at something that is governing your destinies and if you dont have good government you dont have good organization in view of the fact there isnt any such thing on the planet as good government at the moment that i know anything about why were in the field of total invention here and this will be brandnew scientology first we walk up to good government everybody admits when thoroughly pressed that benign monarchy is the best form of government but in view of the fact that benign monarchy cannot be succeeded why it possibly lacks great deal in its longevity over long period of time why governments that are set up as benign monarchs get unbenign monarchs sooner or later and they develop themselves nero or something and everything goes appetite over tin cup well man is so afraid of vicious turn in benign monarchy that he actually cant have one and he says then that he has to have other governmental forms but the highest governmental form is benign monarchy ive had royalistseven in this day and age there is such thing as royalistanarchists communists republicans democrats laborites tories all sitting wound in the same room and the only kind of government i could get them all to mutually agree upon was benign monarchy that was the form of government on which they would agree with this single proviso that there was way to succeed it once the benign monarch kicks the bucket why then what happens well catastrophe occurs because you get unbenign monarchs and he inherits all this power and he starts suppressing people in other words sooner or later any government which is set up on oneman proposition and so forth by inheritance runs the risk of having suppressive fill that role so man is attempting to prevent suppressives and in his effort to prevent suppressives he also prevents decent government now in the first place we can say that benign monarchy is the finest form of government but there is one thing wrong with it is benign monarch can wear all of his hats and by the very fact of being unable to wear his hats he of course can become so exhausted that he cannot govern effectively or on the other hand he gets so disgusted that he doesnt having been through all such cyclesnot just on this track but on earlier tracksi speak with some authority along this line im not saying i was always king i remember one time vividly being garbage man but the main thing in which you should be interested in this field is the fact that you have if you keep it in operation the mechanism which prevents governments from becoming unbenign if you go ahead and remedy hors combatgive you another misunderstood word its what used to happen to you when you were knight that is pardon its what happenedalways happened to the other fellow and when you let go of this data concerning suppressives and potential trouble sourcesif you let go of that technology if that technology goes out of control and that technology is not understoodthen you inevitably will have bad organizations and will eventually have an organization which will be better than the best of the earth governments which is pretty bad now the thing which makes government bad of course is it gets suppressive amongst it and one suppressive breeds another suppressive youll find out that suppressive wants nothing around him but suppressives and you eventually get your redtab generals who are advocating wars of attrition if you want to know the type of government with which you are dealing look at the type of war it fights and if it only fights wars of attritionwhich is to say grind away each other against each otherthen you know that nobodysnobody wants any victory victory is not being envisioned what they are looking for is simply method of knocking off as many troops as possible now once in while you rail against general or something like this you see and say hes not good general well actually what youre objecting to is he normally doesnt care whose troops he knocks off his or the enemys ive been taught very harshly along this line and the best military training is to do the most in the least time at the least expense and keep your own people from getting banged up you severely outlaw the fact that you bang up your own people your objective is to bang up the enemy and what youwhat you areyour objective is is to win thats the objectives of war and proper conduct of war i havent stated it textbook but thats it your objective is to win and you wish to win atin the least time at the least cost and at the least number of casualties amongst your own people and also if the problem of rehabilitation comes up into it actually with the least damage to the enemy because you always have to put the enemy back together again anyhow you see if youif you win this then is proper war and im not talking to you about war war being good bad or indifferent conflict is conflict and it does exist but i want to point out to you that the last four wars and the one that is running currently are all wars of attrition they have goal to win to actually conquer and absorb territory and it didnt matter in any one of those wars how many of your own troops got killed and there was strategy based on this but tremendous amount of sacrifice strategy you want to know what kind of government youre dealing with look at the kind of wars they fight tells you at once how manydirect indexhow many suppressives are in that government now all governments are body of beings against the individual now they can be less against and more for the individual the better they are and when theyre totally bad why then theyre totally against the individual and totally for the group now i wouldnt name any names or designate any specific government but government is suppressive to the degree that it is quote benefiting the group and is antagonistic toward the individual until the individual is totally out and the group is totally in that is the reductio to total suppression now it can go in total reverse for which the philosophy is anarchy where the individual is everything and the government is nothing and youll find out that doesnt work either so these are the two extremes where the individual is everything and the government is nothing and where the body corporate is everything and the individual is nothing those are the two extremes of the pendulum and as it swings between these two we find oddly enough that both ends of it can be totally suppressive when only the individual has any value and corporate body or organized body of any kind has any rights in the face of the individual you find then that any bully any bum any suppressive is then totally at liberty to knock anybody in the head there is restraint of any kind against any individual suppression of any kind whatsoever and on the other side you have the organized suppressives who are making very very sure that their suppressive organization completely crushes the individual when you organize something remember there are two extremes remember there is such thing as perfect government and that the individual is about as close as you will get to perfect entity or unit so therefore why any government at all well we have historical precedences and we find out that any body any group that existed without internal understandings and organizations and so on succumbed to any group that did so organize and that fact alone is actually why you have to have government why you have to have body corporate why you have to have an organization you got where you are today because you on the longago backtrack did not organize together with your fellow thetan as free being and you let any bunch of clunks that wanted to do people in form up into any kind of an organized body that could then overwhump the living daylights out of you one by one do you see that this is the missing item on the track the missing item on the track was organizations amongst decent people because they themselves have perfectly good intentions and because they themselves had idea of suppressing anybody else they of course didnt organize at all they felt totally omniscient omnipotent able to handle anything and everything all on their own two feet now i want to give you this one point this one point is you didnt handle it on your own feet you faced up and ran into organized groups and when you as an individual collided with the organized group whether they were well organized or badly organized you came cropper it is very interesting that any group of organized humanoids can defeat any individual thetan organized humanoids well of course anyanygiven enough ants they can tear down mountain if they go at it in an organized fashion so an organized body and organized beings can accomplish more and continue further than the individual now this doesnt necessarily hang one with compromise this hangs one with necessity of discovering something about the laws of organization and if one has discovered something about the laws of organization and if one then practices those laws of organization why then weve got chance to keep the road open and wrap it up but if its not organized we havent got dogs prayer do you understand now you say well one operating thetan can defeat oh yes its truein one battle in one instance but then one day hes doped off he didnt win that day and that was the only battle he had to lose see he won thousand he lost one and that was one too many well now if each one of you wanted to live as an armed camp or if each one of you livewant to live in total hiding why all right all right but as organized beings you dont have to be thatthat alert you can relax you can relax as long as the organization functions and as long as the organization itself does not become totally suppressive of the individual well now the only thing youre trying to prevent is harm to the individual youre not really even trying to prevent an individual being deprived of rights i notice these days we talk lot about rights i notice also that only dishonest people have rights honest men dont have any rights anymore if you get knocked over the head and robbed why you spend the next three days being interrogated by the police they never go out and find the guy who knocked you over the head why were you standing there the laws that are growing up these days if you leave your keys in the car you are liable to arrest why well youve put temptation in the road of somebody is the charge i dont know police body ought to be able to pick up these people that cant resist temptation i think thats what theyre being paid for but therefore our problem is simply to have an organization that can function that is minimally suppressive of the individual minimally restrictive but maximally effective how you work that out well theres i dont know how many policy letters written through 1965 and into 1966 which cover the basic patterns of organizations i think its the first time the whole subject has ever been reviewed i think many of those lawsthe first time theyve ever been brought forward and brought into view and the data is all there its final forms and so on are not necessarily in concrete as an organization is now there are certain things that an organization has to do an organization under benign monarch who is pretty pretty good does not have to have much saythe individual does not have to have much say why because nothing is being done which is contrary to you see his longrange good benefit nobody is suppressing him if it comes to such persons attention and so forth he normally takes care of that sort of thing so minimal say you see is necessary but when you start to turn over things to body corporate or governing group and so on this confidence in benign monarchy and so on is likely to get shattered because various things happen you do get little zones of suppression and so on and then it is safest for the individual to have say so you would say normallyyou would say normallythat in the absence of terrific whizbang of leader see that the individual should have say this is where democracy in its basic philosophy enters the scene now to expect the individuals by their individual opinion and that alone to guide the destinies of group or state is pure idiocy it makes every single individual anywhere involved in nothing but government and to hang around the neck of every citizen even the idea that he is responsible for all the rules laws and actions of government and that he must keep up his intelligence lineshaving more to work with than the dirty stuff they call newspapers these daysthat hes to keep open his intelligence lines so as to be brilliantly informed on every issue which comes forward boy youre going to get government which is just clown governmentits totally clown government now democracy is of course an absolute form its an attempted absolute form and there isnt any democracy practiced on the planet today and as far as i know there never has been any and there was democracy in ancient greece those were about fifty land owners when it was first kicked together that dictator or tyrant pericles i think his name was was trying to tell them they ought to take responsibility for the state he was either too busy or hed gotten disgusted see and he told these fifty jokers that they ought to form something called senate and ought to debate the affairs of state and decide them by majority rule as near as i remember that was the way it was boy if that sounds like democracy you name it they didnt even represent anybody in the state so they werent even republicanthey werent even republican you see i dont know how they say the greeks invented democracy but anyhow thats the way it is im sure later on they had something where the mob stood around and when they said hang him why guy got hanged you see now if youve ever had very much to do with mobs you wont want to be governed by one in the first place if you had to go around and collect the individual opinion of everyone you were governing before you could act it would be so many years between the incident and the action that government would occur now one neednt go so far as another greek institution whipped up by plato called communism oh you think ive got things reversed plato invented communism with commissars at the head of it read it some time and youll be very interested you see the purist is the russian hes the purist in government and hethe type of government of sparta and so on was tried for while and i notice sparta isnt there anymore and so on but platonian government is what exactly you have today in the kremlin very interesting now his type of governmentalthough aristotle talked about the pendulum that swung between the two extremeshis type of government is an extreme and at the other end of the extreme politically theres anarchy so you have the total body corporate and the individual just poor nut who is stepped on under the platonian forms and between those two you have something called republicanism now republicanism is representation of subgroups by an individual and there were coming somewhere into the mean now if you limit the type of person that can be chosen to represent that group if you limit the number or types if you would make it necessary for him to have certain accomplishments in other wordsin your case you would say well he had to have certain iq and he had to have certain grade or something like this you know youd say well nobody below grade iv can stand for assemblyman do you see and you had right to examine his auditing reports and credentials you see well youd be fairly safe you see then that individual grouped together with other individuals making body corporate of some kind or another like senate or an assembly or something like thatthat individual then being specialist in the issues at stake and not having also to carry on another job could then become sufficiently informed of what was going on and have enough time to think about it to actually govern do you see now thisthis then is probably the direction government will go under scientology if scientology has much influence upon government probably be representative form of government which is really republican government when they say this is republic or that is republic theyre talking through their hat they dont know their governmental forms theres never been planet as politically illiterate as this one economics are politics you know there is subject called economics really theres communist economics and democratic economics and other kinds of theyre bunch of mixed up kids but republic is where people are governed by theirby representative beings there is being chosen by the people to govern them or be part of the government you see and then that person governs without any further yikyak back and forth amongst the people do you follow but if some weighty issue which is going to change the form of government comes along why republican form of government is supposed to place it to referendum but thats simply to change the status quo were going to change the form of government were now going to have one representative for hundred thousand people instead of one representative for ten thousand people well theyd better have that to referendum because theyre shifting the form of government on which it had been agreed but this is essentially government by representation now there was country one time which got into lot of trouble with another country that isnt very informative fact is it because it could be said about any two countries that have ever existed but the first country was england and it got into lot of trouble with america and it was simply america at that time it was the colonies and they made fatal mistake they had taxation without representation and for england even upat this late date to be talking about being democratic form of government is somewhat funny because england does not permit the representation of her commonwealth in parliament up there in london tells the commonwealth dont you see that it must have representative forms of government but it itself is not representative do you understand the commonwealth for instance is not part of the parliament in london which governs its destinies and it was that omission which caused the american revolution there wasnt anybody part of the american scene who came over and sat with say and vote in parliament in london and the resentment of that was so extreme that they dreamed up whole bunch of other excessive this and that and eventually poor old george iii lost his american colonies its an error its not mistake by men its an error in technology now let point this out that there can be errors in technology which cause great political rifts for instance america would have been probably enormously better off if itd never cut loose from england you talk about bunch of inexperienced goons who took over the government at that time and laughingly carried on what waswhat was government keeripes one of the first things they passed after they revolted for the rights of man and everything elseyou know they revolted to make the individual freethe first thing they passed i think were the acts of sedition by which if you put the slightest criticism of anybody that were friends of theirs in the paper you could be clapped in jail forevermore and i dont know how many years that was law so they certainly were not fighting for individual freedom because their first action was to pass the acts of sedition do you understand they were not actually fighting because of excessive taxation because when they got in power they really went to town they were fighting for representation they felt they could not be heard and that causes an arc break and it is simply in the field of your technology right down the board when group feels it cannot be heard it arc breaks just like the individual who feels he cannot be heard arc breaks do you follow it is an arc break which also always precedes war you will find some time or another when hitlerjust to take the most recent and most savage conflict although there have been lot of brush fires sincehitler must have at one time or another probably very early in his career said something which wasnt acknowledged he said something he considered very important and that wasnt acknowledged and it wasnt acknowledged by lot of countries or just one country do you see and that gave him an arc break and then they later on said things which he didnt acknowledge and by piling up the arc breaks they eventually killed something like thirty million men and i think thats too many people to knock off because of an arc break they needed an emeter but governmentallygovernmentally thenas long as you are dealing with emergency situations the best government to have around is benign monarchy if you have total confidence and trust in the benign monarch because its all emergency anyhow see and theres time to consult anybody anyway well that is not really then type of government which can continue long because the benign monarch as an individual running body corporate of course can get tired he can get disgusted he can get overworked he can get this and he certainly cannot acknowledge everybody who speaks he hasnt got that many hours in the day do you see so this form of government is all right for very very tight operating period but unless it is backed up by body which is representative of the people being governed then you will get dissolution of the organization do you see now the nominal head of the state could back off to practically figurehead or emergency heavycavalrytype action in other words if things went too wrong why they could whistle him up do you see but ordinarily the thing would run along by asome representative body corporate and then you would have workable government now why body corporate well body corporate has great liabilities once you share the responsibility amongst number of individuals none of those individuals feel total responsibility for the situation so they really dont think fast enough they really dont think and act fast enough so you have to be careful never to have generalized body corporate they must be terribly specific in its representation the individuals in it must be representative of very definite specific zones or spheres we cant have well we could have senator from state thats all right because he of course can be heard by thethrough him the state is heard but remember hes senator for state theres horrible blunder that they pull in businessesand i dont know how businesses live and many of them dontand that is to have board of directors now you can get great big board of directors each one of whom nebulously represents the stockholders each one of whom represents wait minute whoa youve got crossrepresentation here so that nobody actually has any representation youd have to say this board member represents stockholders 1100 and this board member represents stockholders 100200 do you see then you would have representative form of government because that is body corporate representing and if it goes along that way is nothing more idiotic than body corporate doing representing for instance all the commissars in russia i think represent the russian people everything they say the russian people the russian people there arent any russian people theres such thing i dont know how many russians there are in russia i think its about one twohundredth of the number of people in siberia in that part of the geography the rest of them are tartars and mongols and slavs and godhelp uss now these nuts they all run around the people the people creeps jurisprudence goes appetite over tin cup when it says the people versus john doe oh creep i never heard of the guy im one of the people that is just generality that goes into suppression now the primary characteristic of suppressive is generality he speaks in generalities everybody says you are bum you know they are against you and you get off into that the people versus john doe its totally suppressive mechanism well maybemaybe somebodys mad at john doe but lets hear who is mad at john doe i dont care if its 150 people lets get them by name do you see we could even say the police chief is mad at john doe because he killed richard roe see police chiefs funny he doesnt like dead bodies you know something like that but that would be the truth of it the people are never against john doe similarly the people can never be represented by john doe or richard roe or anybody else if they are represented they could only be represented by one person which is why benign monarchy is the ideal form of government theres crossrepresentation they know who their representative is if they hold him in power simply by verbal support its the guy in charge do you see so its this aside from its ability to act rapidly that makes singleman government look very efficient because in actual fact the people are represented by one person whose name they know do you see but the second he gets body of advisersthe second he gets body of adviserswe cannot then say that that body of advisers represents the people because the people dont know them now we would have to segment off the entire governed group into segments if we had more than one representative then that representative would have to represent exact precise segments now maybe he represented them by appointment maybe he represented them by election maybe theyhe was nominated by theby some governing body and afterwards with somebody else voted upon by that section of the people but they know when they finish up who represents them now when too many of them are represented by one person then the distance becomes bit great and they feel that they are not represented do you see so again theyre not represented now he is their voice to be heard and they know that when they have bone to chew why they can write or speak to this representative and they knowregardless how clumsilythat he will say something about it or do something about it they have confidence in this and therefore they feel that the hat which theyre wearinggovernmenthas been deputized and is being cared for but now communications go two ways so supposing we had body corporate which was composed of representatives each representative representing exactly some geographical area and you know the people of that geographical area and supposing ill show you where modern government violates the living daylights out of theout of the formula and again rearc breaks everybody well lets takelets take forjust for fun the state of colorado see notice the united states in its great wisdom has two senators for the state of coloradoinstantly violates representation doesnt have senator for northern colorado and senator for southern colorado it has two senators for colorado pff silly violation now it has various electoral districts so they really tend to count on their representative because they do have representative for that electoral district now thats direct representation but lets take this thing and the state of colorado now happens to be governed on somewhat autonomous basis by another corporate body now that corporate body can receive orders from the central corporate body called the united states government so theres state government can receive orders from the federal government do you know that there is nobody in the legislative colorado assembly hall who has sign on him saying the united states government the united states government has representative in that state legislature they got bunch of covert agencies that sit around all around the state of colorado see and get more and more numerous but the truth of the matter is the assembly itself does not feel that it can address the united states government because it isnt sitting there do you see that some assemblyman matter how well he represents an exact section of the populationand they have one representative in that assemblyman he can spit and fume and damn and curse whats happening to the united states government but he really damns it and curses it much harder because he knows the united states government is never going to have an inkling of anything he is saying he knows hes never going to be heard even though they have senator because the senator actually doesnt represent the assembly and wouldnt in any event the assembly doesnt send package to the senator saying this is what we feel about the situation why dont you go into the senate and straighten this out there is direct line from the legislative assembly of the state through to the national legislative assembly in other words the communication lines are messed up and the communication lines dont repeat back now those are technical flaws in government there is subject called government theres subject and it is as precise as you can get but before you can do anything about the subject of government you have to have the technology of scientology in order to improve and detect the abilities of people and you have to have the entirety of our ethics technology in order to detect suppressives and if you dont have those things you couldnt form government anyway now you also need the communication formula you need to know about arc breaks and of course nobody knew anything about that so dont be too hard on them they had none of the technology necessary to form government so theyve been making do somehow now the proper way to have formed this up in colorado let us say is if they had to have two senators why he was north and south coloradosee one for north and one for south colorado theyd had to have divided the place in half people would have to have very accurate idea of who their representative was but if theyve got senator why have they got representative now youve divided peoples attention and their attention really doesnt divide well they shouldnt have senior and junior and representative and senator and dhrrhw you know lets get them all confused see certain section of colorado could be represented in the stateit could be represented in two different places you see it could be represented in the state of colorado the state legislature and it could be represented in the corporate body as far as that goes thats perfectly all right as long as then those people so represented could be heard in the places which were making the laws which affected thema line of protest existed line of ideas existed do you see be perfectly all right theres two zones and bodies making laws which affect them so therefore they had better be heard in those now how about the state of colorado well youll notice the federal government and the states arein the united statesyou might not know this but theyre at each others throats all the time they talk about states rights they even fought great war called the rebellion but the yankees call it civil war i have to be careful you know mary sues from texas i have to use these properly so we had great war occur in the united states over states rights and federal rights well how did it come about well the war came about because of the arc break occasioned by the fact that the state legislature could not be heard in the national body and the national body had representative in the state legislature so there was twoway communication formula so of course they got to war so then the study of government parallels the study of what breaks down governments now when an individual has way to speak to this huge sprawling thing called government and when hes just dog why what is the final frame of mind he goes into apathy about it he becomes inactive about it and you can longer then have any kind of representative government because hes just off the subject so what does it do it goes into dictatorship at either end of the extremitextremis it either goes into dictatorship by being total peopleversustheindividual as plato russia so on or on the other side it goes into total dictatorship where the dictatorship is not agreed to supported or anything else but is just every man is that dictator it goes one way or the other dog eat dog every man for himself dont you see itll go one way or the other now whatwhat do we find here then as middle road we find representative form of government as workable middle road providing the representation is specific and exact and isnt so large and so overwhelmingly huge that it cannotthe representation cannot be appealed to by the individual that can be pretty big because every individual isnt appealing simultaneously and when they all start appealing simultaneously why the representative knows hes got to do something in hurry so now do you get little better grip on how these things should be organized well the cause of war is incompetent government the cause of breakdowns between group and the society which surrounds it can also be incompetent government incompetent government but the group that surrounds it may be so incompetently governed that the inner group has to be almost perfectly governed to work its way forward we happen to be in that peculiar condition its not that we dont have flaws we have lots of flaws but i assure you of something that we are actually operating far far far far better than most bodies operate were pretty good were pretty good now the main thing to know is that we keep trying to be better were very far from selfsatisfied about the whole thing and what you see happening right now is an effort of betterment not an effort of failure but an effort of betterment you only better of course when you have down statistic or when you have too much work or too much this that or the other thing you dont bother to better those things which are already soaring into affluence in fact you better not try to better them if theyre already awfully good the more you tamper with them the worst off youre liable to be but you can reinforce an affluence by finding out what made it an affluence but you damn well jolly better be awfully awfully right before you move anything now the main thing here inwe get in representation is you have certain people who represent you now because you have qualification system persons have been with the org or they havent been with the org for long time you have system statistical system person is known to have high statistics or always has low statistics you have grade system of state of case and youve got the entire ethics technology of weeding out suppressives and you tend then not to desperately need an elective action do you follow things run well or they dont run well and as long as somebody is actively taking care of it why those of you who are doing other things arent necessarily interested along this line but this can be bettered this can definitely be bettered now somewhere up the line you will run into actual representationactual elective representation where probably certain nominees will be submitted for an elective action do you follow that sort of thing because as we get bigger itll be necessary to do this actually were pretty small today we all know each other but as we go forward as we go forward and get larger this will require refinement just at the moment it doesnt particularly require balloting and all that sort of thing because were all wearing this hat or that hat or the other hat and we already have system which tends to inhibit and does correct mismanagement where it occurs now you could get too safe with this system so therefore somewhere up the line very exact representation will have to occur as i say were not big enough yet to do much about that but well move it this far well move it this far well fix it up so that junior bodyno junior governing bodymay be ordered by senior body on which it is not represented and reversely that very senior governing bodies should not order junior governing bodies on which they do not have representative see now that gives us twoway comm situation now what weve done just now is totally reform the advisory council but totally sweep bang works like this the international advisory council would be made up of representatives of continental parts of the world and executives who represent types of divisions of organization big its about fifteenman advisory council now you say well how in the name of god can you ever get any government done with that many people well if you handle it exactly this way you will be in that nobody may bring up or make motion which has not beenhe cannot initiate you might say motion unless that motion has been formed into an issuable directive if he wants policy letter passed then he jolly well had better written the whole thing up he wants directive passed he jolly well better have written the whole thing up now we give the chairman of that bodywhichever is the chairmanwe give that chairman of the body the power of absolute veto the chairman says that is enough of that and that is enough of that unless threequarters of those present vote to have it continued takes threequarters to vote to continue this nonsense about whether or not distribution should do its own info packets or not get the idea the main trouble with these bodies is is they get some guy who keeps running on and on and on on some hobbyhorse and keeps discussing or reporting to such an endless degree that other business can occur and it becomes very tedious you see so if he is offering something which on first glance does not seem to be germane to the situation and so forth and is going to take up the corporate bodys study too long to study it it could be referred for special study to somebody else for report at the next ad council meeting after all theyre meeting once week you see nowthen that could be referred back when refined down do you see or it could be taken up and fixed up right there as it is or it could simply be shut off and cut off and thrown in the wastebasket and that is that unless he can get threequarters of the members present interested in his info packets hes had it do you understand now this makes for some of the efficiency of absolute dictatorship because absolute dictators can always get something done well in this particular case you can get something done and it doesnt leave the ad council afterwards with somebody some nebulous somebody having to write up all the bills or resolutions or directives that were passed because lookahere if they were wrote up afterwards those werent the ones that were passed were they do you see and thats what they have trouble doing getting something passed in ad council and then getting it written up and issued so well just put this more on legislative basis and this is the way by the way its done in the united states senate they dont do all things bad but therefore if somebody wants directive lets say that ad council is composed of continental representatives now these are representatives which represent the continental areas in other words they represent every organization and all the scientologists on that continent in that continental area they represent the lot see theyre specifically representative of the continental ad council but more importantly they represent all of the other orgs and they represent all of those people too so therefore somebody from part of that continental area some individual who feels he has been done in and he feels hes being done in by the local org or something like thatwell he in actual fact could write to his representative there in the international body now more important than this as this expands out he would find out by election that he had representative also in his local continental body and that would be the person to whom he would appeal do you see but were not that refined and it doesnt have to be that big so in this case i imagine that whoppers continental representative for western united states and so on will probably get himself quite aquite bundle of correspondence now he eventually sees theres some abuses out there or something like that or something should be taken up and so hell probably get something done now if you have to wait for an advisory council this is where the united states senator goes around the bend and up the pole hes not in charge of anything in the first place hes just in charge of somebody as corporate body but he himself can really do nothing and this makes him so stupidly helpless that hes silly now if an emergency situations develops any member of that ad council could issue what is called an urgent directive itd be an urgent bill really if you were talking about it governmentally but its an urgent directive its something thats got to be done right now right now it cant wait till tomorrow all hes got to do is get majority set of signatures hes just got to tear around to the various members and say hey can you sign this joe you know and he can get his directive out promptly and at once providing of course that the ad council then appoints board of investigation to investigate the situation to find out if that was the right answer or the wrong answer or if some other answer is needed or whether answer was required at all so as to wipe out that directive so that wedor modify the directive so we dont keep introducing arbitrary laws in from every quarter see his directive is only good until board of investigation has investigated it and written right directive do you see so that these emergency directions then have tendency to be wiped out they have to be wiped out these laws dont go forever furthermore unless policy change occurs an ad council law is only good for year anyway thats been into force for long time they all expire at the end of the year very often some very important things expire and nobody notices that theyve become customary in the meantime now the ad council then would be composed interon the international basisitd be composed of the continental representatives from each continental district andof which there are five and probably one from saint hill since it really isnt part of continental district and then to these are added bloke called divisional organizer now this fellow is the representative of every divisional secretary of that type of division in the whole world now this divisional secretary has the job that you always expect mary sue and i to do which is compile down to the last comma all of the materials and specifications well in the first place its gotten to be too big job one cant possibly do that and wear his hat too and these things are transient and the type of division requires certain things and it requires its policy letters it requires supplies it requires knowhow of various kinds it requires material it requires some kind of an internal training program to get things in and these things also change and are transient dont you see well take the distribution division man it cant go on with the same info packet forever it requires info packets and requires this and requires that and requires field staff member program well that field staff member program has to be changing all the time to keep it whizzing along and then congress programsthis guys also responsible for all the congress programs there are do you see and dating them and so forth in other words for that type of division hes responsible for every piece of its organizational materials and everything that applies to that type of division so if some secretary of that type of division in poughkeepsie or keokuk hasnt got any policy letters that cover soandso and soandso well they would write to this fellow to find it out if an org cant get its books it knows who to write to it writes to the divisional organizer dissem worldwide see and he would catalyze it and go ahead and do that and he would know exactly where orgs stand now he is judged by the statistics the composite gross divisional statistics of that type of division in the world so if his statistic is down why he obviously then would get into field of authority hed say and theres this org and that org and that org and let us say hes tech seches the divisional organizer techand he would say boy those three orgs are just pulling my statistic right out down through the bottom and that is finishing and therefore i demand change of secretaries in those orgs and i actually think you ought to change the org exec sec in those orgs and i think oh you know hed start getting very militant you see well hes member of the ad council thats the place for him to get militant he can give all the suggestions he wants to give but he cant give an order unless its okayed by the ad council it must have been passed by the ad council he must write it up in advance and it must be passed as bill and its actually issued on the divisional color flash of that division it applies only to those divisions he can get an order yes he can get anhe can get board of investigation on keokuk andand all of this yes he can do all these things but only by getting it passed by the ad council do you understand so he actually is not directly running that type of organization so then he doesnt operate as bypass of the org exec secs of those organizations and hco exec secs of those organizations and so he can function do you see now reversely we will have it fixed up so that aside from the continental representatives in continental advisory councils and so on there we will put in saint hill representativethat is ww representative right at the moment it will simply be the lrh communicator he is considered to be the representative so he could be talked right at right directly because he is the representative of the body which is the governing body dont you see he doesnt have any authority there guy will probablyhis ears will probably be pinned back most gorgeously many many times but nevertheless the governing body can be talked to and of course theyve got their own representative and they can pass things through to their own representative and get that squared away so the governing body can also explain to the lesser governing body what the score is in other words various communication lines take place all right well how about representation between the continental org and these little orgs and what about their advisory councils now these are independent and individual orgs this would be the pattern which will be adopted for saint hill and we simply abolish ad comms and we make every divisional secretary member of the advisory council all the divisional secretaries and the lrh communicator otherwise hco gets left out without proper vote see its only got three divisions whereas org has got four so therefore you get an eightman advisory council operating in much the same way so that the personnel of the organization is surely represented on the advisory council because their secretary is member of it so therefore that communication goes sideways and now we dont have reverse representations into these divisions but then were not up to size where its required but sooner or later there will have to be one therell have to be representative of the advisory council in that division all right in this particular way then you can see that continental organization which has three organizations and itselfwhich is quite commonit has three other organizations and it has itself well that makes four advisory councils composed of secretaries and executive secretaries that gives them nineman advisory councils see tenman with the lrh communicator now whatwhat is its relationship then with its junior orgs well of course in the case of johannesburg why durban would have to have representative in johannesburg so would cape town and as they develop up the line theyll have to have this they are going to get into arc breaks and theyre not going to amount to hill of beans until they can get into position where they can do this do you see so what are we dealing with here when were dealing with organization just to give you an insight into the matter were dealing with the basic formulas of technology were dealing with basic ethics technology now if youve got that many peopleif youve got that many people coming up the lineyouve got that many people with say and vote you have of course minimized the possibility of something going wrong on the suppression line do you see youve minimized that now the whole thing being crosspoliced by statistics gives everybody look right straight in on the plate of the officer operating because statistics are statistics you cant argue with statistic you never explain statistic and the reason statistics go bad of course are some of the lousiest reasons you ever heard of under the sun its incredible youd have to be running an organization for quite while before you finally fell wise to this very interesting point that statistic doesnt ever happen its always made good or bad it is always made and although somebody sitting right here right now wont believe this maybe see if youve had trouble with statistic stop going at it on the basis that it happened it isnt something that occurred it was something that was manufactureddown or upand youve got to find out what is manufacturing that statistic it has source it isnt sourceless its just one dayfor weeks people have been walking by the bookstore and theyve been buying books and then just one day they didnt walk by so you had down book statistic that is not the way it happens at all and the errors are always gross theyre always ridiculously gross i always wonder how you can miss them when you do the errors are so fantastic the reason why the bookstore statistic went down is they locked up the bookstore and nobody opened it and you can be fooled as an executive sitting maybe forty fifty feet away from the bookstorebut not actually going to the bookstore you understand sitting there and handling despatches and that sort of thing suddenly see your book statistic go down and then you start tearing it all to pieces and getting out terrific bookselling programs and you go brrrrrm and braaaam and you work and youre trying to get rrrn and so on and why arent they and we need new books and that sort of thing you never walked down there fifty feet and found out that the thing was locked you couldnt have book statistic there was nobody on post and by far the greatest source of down statistics is personnel on the post at all its not even subtle you know they just didntdidnt appoint d of t or if they appointed one for the day org he also had day job so he was doing his work in the evening its gorgeous it really is its incredible so that i often wonder how anybody can stand around and let one of these statistics go down see because the truth of the matter is it is minimal amount of alertness required now when an orgs gross income starts down and stays down and starts going out of the bottom you immediately say they need to be more ambitious theres too much entheta in the area the newspapers are bad tzaaa blaaah well nuts you know what i found it was in cape town once they hadnt opened their mail box in three months that wasnt very mysterious was it found out about it because itd gotten full and had slopped over on the window ledge and it was running all over the floor and one of the people going in said that they had gotten one of my bulletins because theyd found it there and so on it was very horrible because they were member of the public that wasnt supposed to get the bulletin so you can talk all you want to about clever management im very clever manager i have very very good statistic as manager as i think youll admit totally aside from research or anything of the sort just pure management statistic is good all right now where does it break down it just breaks down because i dont go down and find out if the bookstore is open see by the time ive looked into the bookstore to find out if the bookstore is open amongst twenty some orgs obviously now when you multiply this factor by another hundred factors that could also cause down statistics why you immediately see that it isnt feasible to have oneman government hed have to have eyes in the back of his thetan hed have to have one of these thousandeye eyeballs like fly people dont do these things willfully they just dont notice and you can get framework form of attitude going in an organization if you get too long stuck flow if your orders are going this way this way this way this way this way you get stuck flow of order and you tend to produce an apathy at the other end lack of initiative if nobody can ever talk up lets say the ad council keeps ordering the dist division the ad council keeps ordering the dist division the ad council keeps ordering the dist division and the dist division atdoesnt have any distribution secretary i mean itll happen many times just that way you see and eventually everybody in the distribution division is just kind of in total apathy and they dont come to work and when they come to work they just sit blankly and look at the paper in front of them and they dont quite know whats wrong everybody seems to be mad at them actually nobodys mad at them dont you see communication line is totally broken down they got stuck flow but if they were simply on the receiving end and there was representation ofon the ad council of the distribution secretary this could happen in any corporate body or in any area it doesnt have to be anything like backflow it has to be an existing channel for one do you understand and if one exists for one every once in while somebodyll come along and test it see is the line open and then they find it open so theyre perfectly happy lot of people want to talk to and i know why they want to talk to they want to talk to for only one reason they want to find out if i am there and they can talk to and they havent got anything to talk to about its very remarkable ive hadive had i dont know how many people one time i interviewed thirtyfive people after four day congress where id lectured day and night i was absolutely dead tired falling to pieces and i actually interviewed thirtyfive people there wasnt one single one of them had anything to say to at all they took up lot of time but they didnt have anything to say to so after that i didnt interview people after congress whatwhat is then the primary problem of government and what have you got to solve in all such things whats the primary problem which if it isnt solved will cause revolt revolution upset tearapart bad morale and that sort of thing theres only one problem in the problem of government because there is such thing as corporate body except as postulated thing theyre only individuals so the problem is to obtain an equable nottoooppressive notice how thats phrased relationship between the individual and the governing body and between the governing body and the individual and thats the problem youre trying to solve with government how are youhow can you achieve this relationship with the minimum amount of uproar and upset and its just thethe relationship between the individual and the corporate body and the corporate body and the individual its two ways corporate body which has insufficient authority and cannot act swiftly enough will make horrible mistakes and do lots of individuals in and setup where any individual can clobber the corporate body with total impunity will cause tremendous amount of upset and suppression because theyll also go around and clobber other individuals if theyre able to clobber the corporate body so the problem is trying to set up something that resolves these two things the corporate body the individual now the individual must be able to get some semblance of justice from the corporate body and hes entitled to certain amount of bright managementdoesnt have to be very brilliant but hes entitled to itand the corporate body is entitled to expect certain contribution and compliance on the part of the individual and between these two things if those are solved fairly well then youll find out you have working organization thats actually all it takes to make an organization is just resolutions to these problems if you want to find where any organization on this planet is falling to pieces i wouldnt go so far as to say that theyre all falling to pieces im sure in some bush tribe somewhere there is some organization on the planet that isnt incipiently violating this so wildly that it is falling to pieces i know of civilized government that has very very high statistical certainty of future i dont know of any empires on this planet have tendency to last very brief periods its fantastic that the british empire has lasted 350 or 50 years it has its gone on quite while one would ordinarily have expected it to fall to pieces long ago the roman empire is supposed to have lasted thousand years and so on and they bragged about it and talked about it and yapped about it and so forth and that doesnt count right in my history books i dont know how many years the roman empire lasted but it was thousand years man but its one of the longest lived of recent empires but all these other empires are dust and why are they dust its they didnt equitably solve the problems related to that relationship which i just described to you one can never solve it perfectly but he can try very well and when you get consent of the governed by representation in the government and when you get respect for the governed on the part of the corporate bodywhen you get those two relationships pretty well functioning why the thing will go on and on there is reason why theoretically they could not be balanced to go on for very very long time there is reason why an empire couldnt go on for very very very long time there are empires whichnot on this planetwhich have gone on for very long time and that wasthats one of the reasons they were not necessarily elective empires even they werent werent elective theybut there was big consent but the odd part of it is they were based on state of case if guy couldnt pick up his telephone with beam why he wasnt fit guy to govern if guy was in that good state of case why of course he was pretty good as governor you know i mean it wasit was caste system based on ability so you got ayou got selection you got an immediate selection of course anybody who saw that somebody like that was strong or clever or something like thathe was perfectly willing to say that guy represents and would tend to fall into line you see that was great as far as he was concerned you get the idea well i thought i would tell you about this change i dont say that that wont be changed again but these things are necessary to adjust from time to time the governing body which can govern ten thousand people is not the governing body which can govern hundred thousand various problems arise and these things need adjustment but when you put in an arbitrary such as government you must put in review of the arbitrary postulated form of government is an arbitrary so having postulated that governmental form why for heavens sakes put board of investigation in few months or few years later to find out how its running in order to make any adjustments necessary and people will do this in any event in the united states they passed their bill of rights ages after they passed their constitution they found out they had to have these bill of rights and they sort of looked it over and they changed the status of the president and they changed this and they changed that and theyve changed it along the line from time to time with amendments to the constitution but in actual fact nobody was reporting back to the body that organized it in the first placethe body or the person who organized it in the first placeso theyve never given it thorough overhaul and its getting pretty messy just at the present time its getting pretty messy for instance it used to be all congress and now its all executive talk about total shift of authority well of course you cant have it all executive but the reason its shifting all executive is congress did not represent the people but they couldthey could say well we voted for joe blow and hes president so therefore hes representative of us do you understand so in the absence of representation you get people trying to assert singleman representation theyre sure he represents them well these are the things which you try to solve but governed people who do not understand the ramifications of its government or the theories or postulates or other things which go back of government or the laws which underlie the systems of government and so on can be pretty dismayed they can be led around and confused and get upset at the wrong places and so on and become very uncomfortable because they individually are afraid that the relationship between the governing body and the individual and the individual and the governing bodytheyre afraid that those relationships have not been resolved and will not be safeguarded by the government or the action which they are protesting against and maybemaybe the thing is set up to represent them but nobodys let them in on it and so they tend to break down you will have lot to do with this in the future it isnt really dry subject anything is dry subject about which nothing is known i imagine government and so forth has been one of the driest subjects anybody ever heard of but its veryvery fact that it is dry subject has caused its history to be written in solid red and nobody has dug it so lot of people have killed lot of people trying to prove things they didnt know in the first place so i wish us far more success with regard to this thank you
