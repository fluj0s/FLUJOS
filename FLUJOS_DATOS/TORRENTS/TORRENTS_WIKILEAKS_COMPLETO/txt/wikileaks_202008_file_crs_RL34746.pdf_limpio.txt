environmental regulations and ﬁnancing costs can all be aﬀected by government energy environmental and economic policies government decisions to inﬂuence or not inﬂuence these factors can largely determine the kind of power plants that are built in the future for example government policies aimed at reducing the cost of constructing power plants could especially beneﬁt nuclear plants which are costly to build policies that reduce the cost of fossil fuels could beneﬁt natural gas plants which are inexpensive to build but rely on an expensive fuel the report provides projections of the possible cost of power from new fossil nuclear and renewable plants built in 2015 illustrating how diﬀerent assumptions such as for the availability of federal incentives change the cost rankings of

energy outlook 2008 report note that eia forecasts assume change to the laws and regulations in effect at the time the forecasts are madepower plants characteristics and costs introduction and organization the united states may have to build ma ny new power plants to meet growing demand for electric power for example the energy information administration eia estimates that the nation will have to construct 226000 megawatts of new electric power generating capacity by 20301 this is the equivalent of about 450 large power plants whatever the number of plants actually built different combinations of fossil nuclear or renewable plants could be built to meet the demand for new generating capacity congress can largely determine which kinds of plants are actually built through energy environmenta l and economic polic ies that influence power plant costs this report analyzes the factors that determine the cost of electricity from new power plants these factors includi ng construction costs fuel expense environmental regulations nd financing costs can all be affected by government energy and economic policies government decisions to in fluence or not influence these

of electricity demand influence power plant choice and ope ration the next part describes the generating technologies analyzed in the reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34746crs3 2 variable costs are costs that vary directly w ith changes in output for fossil fuel units the most important variable cost is fuel sola r and wind plants have minimal or variable costs and nuclear plants have low variable costselectricity demand and power plant choice and operation generation and load the demand for electricity load faced by an electric power system varies moment to moment with changes in business and residential activity and the weather load begins growing in the morning as people waken peaks in the early afternoon and bo ttomsout in the late evening and early morning figure 1 is an illustrative daily load curve the daily load shape dictates how electric power systems are operated as shown in figure 1 there is minimum dema nd for electricity that occurs throughout the day this base level of demand is met with baseload generating units which have low variable operating costs2 baseload units can also meet some of the demand above the base and can reduce output when demand is unusually low the units do this by ramping generation up and dow n to meet fluctuations in demand the greater part of the daily up and down swings in demand are met with intermediate units also referred to as loadfollowing or cycling units these units can quickly change their output to match th change in demand that is they have fast ramp rate loadfollowing plants can also serve as spinning reserve units that are running but not putting power on the grid and are immediately available to meet unanticipated increases in load or to back up other units that go offline due to breakdowns the highest daily loads are met with peaking units these units are typically the most expensive to operate but can quickly startup and shutdown to meet brief peaks in demand peaking units also serve as spi nning reserve and as quick start units able to go from shutdown to full load in minutes peaking unit typically operates for only few hundred hours year200040006000800010000120001400016000hourly load mw midnight to midnightthis report covers generating technologies used to meet intermediate and baseload demandpeak demand intermediatedemand baseloaddemandfigure 1 illustrative load curvehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34746crs4 3 combustion turbine is an adaption of jet gine technology to electric power generation combustion turbine can either be used standal one as peaking unit or as part of more complex combined cycle plant used to meet intermediate and baseload demand 4 this alignment of generating technologies is for new construction using current technology the existing mix of generating units in the united states contains many exceptions to this alignment of load to ty pes of generating plants due to changes in technology and economics for instance there are natural gas and oilfired units built decades ago as baseload stations that now operate as cycling or peaking plants because high fuel prices and poor efficiency has made them economically marginal some of these older plants were built close to load centers and are now used as reliability mustrun rmr generators that under certain circumstances must be operated regardless of cost to maintain the stability of the transmission grideconomic dispatch and heat rate the generating units available to meet system load are dispatched put onlin in order of lowest variable cost this is referred to as the economic disp atch of power systems plants for plant that uses combustible fuels s uch as coal or natural gas key driver of variable costs is the efficiency with wh ich the plant converts fuel to electricity as measured by the plants heat rate this is the fuel input in british thermal units btus needed to produce one kilowatthour of electricity output lower heat rate equates with greater efficiency and lower variable costs other things most importantly fuel and environmental comp liance costs being equal the lower plants heat rate the higher it will stand in the economic dispatch priority order heat rates are inapplicable to plants that do not use combustible fuels such as nuclear and nonbiomass renewable plants as an illustration of economic dispatch consider utility system with coal nuclear geothermal natural gas combined cycle and natural gas peaking units in its system nuclear coal and geothermal base load units which are expensive to build but have low fuel costs nd therefore low variable costs will be the first units to be put on line other than for planned and forced maintenance these baseload genera tors will run throughout the year combined cycle units which are very efficient but use expensive natural gas as fuel will meet intermediate load these cycling plants will ramp up and down during the day and will be turned on and off dozens of times year peaking plants using combustion turbines3 are relatively inefficient and burn expensive natural gas they run only as needed to meet the highest loads4 an exception to this straightforward economic dispatch are variable renewable power plants wind and sola r that do not fall neatly into the categories of baseload intermediate nd peaking plants variable renewable generation is used as available to meet demand because these resources have very low variable costs they are ideally used to displace generation from gasfiredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34746crs5 5 hydroelectric generation is special case hy dro generation is very low cost and is firm dispatchable capacity to the degree there is water in the dams reservoir however operators have to consider not only how much water is currently available but how much may be available in upcoming months and competing demands for the water such as drinking water supply irrigation and recr eation these factors make hydro dispatch decisions very complex in general hydro is used to meet load during high demand hours when it can displace expensive peaking and cycling units but if hydro is abundant it can also displace baseload coal plants 6 for example solar project developer decide d to leave storage and other extras out of proposed plant in order to make it commercia lly viable storage solar powers next frontier platts global power report november 1 2007 7 there are different measures of capacity nameplate capacity is the nominal maximum output of generator and gross capacity is the actual maximum output net capacity is gross output minus the electricity needed to opera the plant net capacity is therefore the amount of capacity that can actually put electr ic power on the grid net capacity can vary with air and water temperatures so further distinction is made between summer and winter net capacity capacity factor is most commonly computed using net summer capacitycombined cycle plants and peaking units with higher variable costs however if wind or solar generation is available when demand is low such as weekend or in the case of wind in the evening th renewable output could displace coal generation power systems must meet all firm loads at all times but variable renewable plants do not have firm levels of output because they are dependent on the weather they are not firm resources because there is guarantee that the plant can generate at specific load level at given point in time5 variable renewable generation can be made firm by linking wind and solar plan ts to electricity storage but with current technology storage options are limited and expensive6 capacity factor as discussed above baselo ad units run more often than cycling units and peaking units operate the least often the utilization of generating unit is measured by its capacity factor this is the ratio of the amount of power generated by unit for period of time typically year to the maximum amount of power the unit could have gene rated if it operated at full output nonstop for example the maximum amount of power 1000 megawatt mw unit can generate in year is 876 million gawatthours mwh calculated as 1000 mw x 8760 hours in year 876 million mwh if this unit actually produced only 40 million mwh its capacity factor would be 46 calculated as 40 million mw h divided by 876 million mwh note in this calculation the distinction between capacity and energy capacity is the potential instantaneous output of generating unit measured in watts7 energy is the actual amount of electricity genera ted by power plant during time period measured in watthours the units are usua lly expressed in thousands kilowatts and kilowatthours or millions meg awatts and megawatthourshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34746crs6 8 the estimate of 86 of 2006 generation from large baseload and intermediate generating units was computed from the eia860 gener ating capacity and eia906920 generation data files for 2006 available at http wwweiadoegovcn eafelectricitypagedatahtml the calculation assumed that plants with cap acity factor of 25 or greater fall into the intermediatebaseload category and that plan ts with capacity of 200 mw or greater are large these thresholds are assumptions be cause there are official categorizations of what constitutes intermediate baseload or rge power plants however large changes to the threshold values do not change the conclusi on for example if the capacity factor floor for what constitutes intermediatebaseloa d generation is increased to 33 the intermediatebaseload percentage of generation is 83 if the size threshold is increased to 300 mw the intermediatebaseload percentage of generation is also 83 and if both changes are made the intermediatebaseload percentage of generation is 81 9 generation from petroleum products dropped from 3651 billion kilowatthours kwh in 1978 to 657 billion kwh in 2007 almost quart er of the 2007 petroleum generation came not from liquid fuels such as distillate fuel oil but from solid refinery waste product petroleum coke eia annual energy review 2006 table 82a and electric power monthly march 2008 table es1b the difference between actual and theoretical maximum output is caused by planned maintenance mechanical breakdow ns forced outages and any instances in which the plant is backeddown from maximum output due to lack of load or because the plants power is more expensive than that from other plants it is rare for plant to have capacity factor of 100 baseload plants typically have capacity factors of about 70 or greater peaking pl ants about 25 or less and cycling plants fall in the middle utility scale gene rating technologies the types of generating technologies disc ussed in this repor t are often referred to as utility scale plants for baseload or intermediate service these technologies generate large amounts of electricity at single site for transmission to customers in 2006 large baseload and intermediate service power plan ts accounted for about 86 of total power generation in the united states8 utility scale plants typically have generating capacities ranging from dozens to over thousand megawatts the one smaller scale generating technol ogy covered in this report is solar photovoltaic power the capacity of the largest us central station solar photovoltaic plant at nellis air force base in nevada is only 14 mw because of their small size high capital costs and w utilization rates so lar photovoltaic plants built with current technology have very hi gh electricity production costs central station solar photovoltaic power is nonetheless included in the cost analysis because of public interest the report excludes peaking plants which play an important but small role in the power system the report also excludes oilfired generation which has all but disappeared from the nations generating mix because of the high cost of the fuel in 1978 oilfired plants produced 22 of the nations electricity by 2007 the oil fired share was less than 29 significant construction of new oilfired plants is not expected httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34746crs7 10 in 2007 total generation was 4160 million mwh generation from the industrial and commercial sectors totaled 154 million mwh some of which was from nonchp industrial and commercial generators eia annual energy review 2007 table 81 11 north american electric

from utility scale generati on chp generation is small part of the electric power i ndustry accounting for about 37 of total electricity output in 200710 hydropower is excluded because significant construction of new large hydroelectric pl ants is expected due to environmental concerns and the small num ber of available sites11 the cost analysis is for plants entering service on january 1 2015 which means construction would start soon between 2009 and 2013 pending on the technology the plants therefore inco rporate only small projected changes from 2008 cost and performance for mature technol ogies and reflect current estimates of cost and performance for new or evolving technologies such as advanced nuclear power and coal gasification the technologies covered in the report are described briefly below process diagrams and images of each technology are in appendix supercritical pulverized coal pulverized coal plants account for the great majority of existing and planned coalfired generating capacity in this system coal is ground to fine power and injected w ith air into boiler where it ignites combustion heat is absorbed by water carrying tubes embedded in the boiler walls and downstream of the boiler the heat turns the water to steam which is used to rotate turbine and produce electricity since about 2000 most plans for new pulverized coal plants have been for supercritical designs that gain efficiency by operating at very high steam temperatures and pressures in 2007 coal generation of all types12 accounted for 49 of total power generation in the united states see figure 2 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34746crs8 13 eia estimates heat rate advantage of 47 for current technology with projected improvements the difference widens substantially to almost 15 eia assumptions to the annual energy outlook 2008 table 38 another study is less optimistic finding that igcc electricity generating efficiencies demonstrated to date do not live up to earlier projections due to the many engineering design compromise s that have been made to achieve acceptable operability and cost the current igcc units have and nextgeneration igcc units are expected to

pulverized coal generation but proponent s believe they have compensating advantages including lower emissions of air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen oxides nox and mercur however modern pulverized coal plants also have low emissions of air pollutants so the advantage of igcc plants over conventional technology is limited greater efficiency ie lower heat rate although with

postcombustion removal of co2 from the exhaust gases flue gas emitted by conve ntional coal plant the promise of more efficient carbon capture is one of the prima ry rationales for igcc technology coalfired igcc experience in the united states is limited to handful of research and prototype plants none of which is designed for carbon capture commercial igcc plant is being constructed by duke energy at its edwardsport site in indiana and other projects have been proposed however some other power plant developers will not build igcc plants b ecause of concerns over cost and the reliability of the technology14 in general the cost nd operational advantages of igcc over conventional coal technology and the commercial readiness of igcc technology are disputed15 natural gas combined cycle combined cycle plants are built around one or more combustion turbines essentially the same technology used in jet engines the combustion turbine is fired by natu ral gas to rotate turbine and produce electricity the hot exhaust gases from the combustion turbine are captured and used to produce steam which drives another ge nerator to produce more electricity by converting the waste heat from the combusti on turbine into useful electricity the combined cycle achieves very high efficiencies with h eat rates below 7000 btus per kwh compared to around 9000 btus per kwh fo r new pulverized coal plants this high efficiency partly compensates for the high cost of the natural gas used in these plants modern combined cycle plants which evolved in the 1990s have relatively low construction cost and modest environmental impacts can be used to meet baseload intermediate nd peaking demand can be built quickly and are very efficient because of th advantages since 1995 natura l gas combined cycle

coal or nuclear plants typical wind plant capacity factor is about 34 compared to 70 to over 90 for coal and nuclear plants this means the capital costs of wind plant are spread over relatively few

chances of competing in the market for new power plants the base case is starting point for comparing how different assumptions such as for fuel and construction costs change estimated power costs none of the cases is most likely estimate of future costs future power costs are subject to so many variables with high degrees of uncertainty that projecting most likely case is impractical the object of the analysis is provide insight into how key factors influence the costs of power plants in cluding factors under congressional control such as incentive programs these estimates are approximations subject to high degree of uncertainty the rankings of the technologies by cost are therefore also an approximation and should not be viewed as definitive estimates of the relative costcompetitiveness of each option also note that pr ojectspecific factors would weigh into an actual developers decisions including how close fossil plant would be to fuel sources local climate for wind and solar the need for and cost of transmission upgrades the developers appetite for risk and the developers financial resources case 1 base case key observations the lowest cost generating tec hnologies in the base case are pulverized coal geothermal and na tural gas combined cycle plants all have costs around 60 per mwh 2008 dollars based on the assumptions in this report other technologies are at least third more expensive of the three lowest cost technolog ies geothermal plants are limited to available sites in the west that typically support only small plantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34746crs37 90 the annual outlook main report assumptions report and related information are available on the eia website at httpwwweiadoegovoiafaeoindexhtmland coal plants have become rder to build due to cost and environmental issues the gasfired combined cycle plant is currently technology that can be built at large scale for cycling or baseload service throughout the united states the above projections are based on private iou or ipp funding of power projects the cost per mwh drops precipitously if the developer is assumed to be pou with lowcost financing however most pous are small and do not have the financial or managerial resources to build large power projects discussion as noted earlier in the report power plants can be built by investorowned utilities ious publicly owned utilities pous or independent power producers ipps the base case assumes that coal and nuclear plants are constructed by ious because they are most likely to have the financial resources and regulatory support to undertake these very rge and expensive projects the natural gas combined cycle plant is assumed to be built by an ipp ipps often prefer to build and operate gasfired projects because of their relatively low capital costs the wind solar and geothermal plants are also assumed to be ipp projects the most common current practice is for ipps to devel op renewable projects and sell the power to regulated utilities the base case has the following characteristics the analysis is for new projects beginning operation in 2015 estimates of fuel prices allowance prices and most operational characteristics are from eias reference case assumptions for the 2008 annual energy outlook 90 the 2008 overnight capital costs for each technology are estimated by crs from public information on recent projects see appendix b the base case excludes discretionary incentives the federal loan guarantee program and clean coal tax credit programs state utility commission decisions to allow cwip in rates and the federal renewable energy production tax cred it which is scheduled to expire at the end of 2010 these incentives are excluded because they are granted by government entities based on casebycase analysis of individual projects andor are dependent on cong ressional action to fund or extend the incentives accordingly there is certainty that

gas combined cycle and geotherm generation all in the 60 per mwh 2008 dollars range column 10 these results ar attributable to the following factors pulverized coal is mature tec hnology that relies on relatively low cost fuel natural gas is an expensive fuel but combined cycle technology is highly efficient and has low construction cost geothermal energy has fuel co st and unlike variable renewable technologies such as wind and so lar can operate at very high utilization rates high utilization allows the plant to spread fixed operating costs and capital recovery charges over many megawatt hours of sales although all three technologies have similar power costs the coal and geothermal technologies ve limitations and risks that the natural gas combined cycle does not face geothe rmal plants are limited to re latively small facilities about 50 mw at western sites as discusse d above many coal projects have been canceled due to environmental opposition nd escalating construction costs in contrast the gasfired combined cycle plant has limited environmental impacts can be located wherever gas pipeline with sufficient capacity is available and plants can be built with generating capacities in the hundreds of megawatts probably the main risk factor for combined cycle plant is uncertainty over the long term price and supply of natural gas in the base case wind power igcc coal and nuclear energy have costs in the 80 per mwh range igcc and nuclear plan ts are very expensive to build with estimated overnight capital costs of respectively 3359 and 3682 per kw of capacity 2008 dollars see table 18 becau the plants are expensive and take years to construct an estimated four years for an igcc plant and six years for nuclear plant these technologies also incur large charges for interest during construction that must be recovered in power costs wind has relatively high cost per mwh because wind projects have high capital costs 2100 per kw of capacity and are assumed to operate with capacity factor of only 34 the low capacity factor means that the plant is the equivalent of idle twothirds of the year consequently the capital costs for the plant must be recovered over relatively sm all number of units of ectricity production driving up the cost per mwh high capital costs and low rates of utilization also drive up the costs of the solar thermal and solar pv plants to respectively 100 per mwh and 255 per mwh comparison to benchmark price of electricity another way of viewing the results is to compare each t echnologys costs to benchmark cost of

double prediction the wall street journal december 27 2004in the higher gas price case the cost of power from the natural gas combined cycle plant converges with wind nuclear and igcc coal the combined cycle plant longer has clear economic advantage over these technologies but neither is it at great disadvantage discussion the economics of natural ga sfired generation pivot on fuel prices for the base assumptions used in this study fuel constitutes half of the total cost of power from new combined cycle power plant compared to 18 for coal plant and 6 for nuclear plant in additi on to being critical to the cost of gasfired power natural gas prices are also one of the most uncertain elements in this analysis as discussed earlier in this report natural gas prices have been exceptionally difficult to forecast if the united states becomes more dependent in the future on imports of liquefied natural gas the domestic and international natural gas markets will be increasingly linked adding an additional element of uncertainty to the natural gas price outlook93 underestimates of natural gas prices were pervasive among government and private forecasters in the 1990s and cont ributed to overinvestment in gasfired generating capacity94 if future gas prices are higher than assumed in this reports base case the economics of gasfired generation could ch ange substantially the gas market has historically been volatile gas prices increased more than 200 from the early 1990s through 2007 and annua l increases sometimes exceeded 50 figure 7 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34746crs47 figure 8 illustrates the base case gas price projection and an alternative that ramps up to level 50 higher than in the base case in the base case the annualized cost of power from natural gas combined cycle plant is 6177 per mwh with 50 higher gas price the combined cycle power cost is 7705 per mwh at this power cost the combined cycle is substantially more costly than pulverized coal or geothermal power nd has clear economic advantage only over the solar technologies table 9 column 4 on the other hand even with this much higher fuel price projecti on the cost of power from the combined cycle is still comparable to that of wind nuclear and igcc coal generation and while pulverized coal and geothermal power have lower co sts as discussed above the former is increasingly hard to build for cost and environmental reasons and the latter is limited to small plants at western sites therefor even with 50 increase in fuel prices the gasfired combined

in capital costs key observations because of its low capital costs and assumed high utilization rate the power cost of the gasfired comb ined cycle plant is about half as sensitive to changes in

assuming 25 drop in capital costs compared to the base case the combined cycle is still competitive with all other technologies discussion as noted above the cost of building power plants has recently increased dramatically whether costs will continue to increase remain steady in real dollar terms or decline is unknown table 11 illustrates the effect on the cost of power of assuming uniform 25 increase or decrease in capital costs for all technologies compared to the base case power costs change by about 20 for each technology except for the gasfired co mbined cycle plant 12 see column 3

discussion carbon control legislation is under consideration by the congress but there has been agreement on the structure of control regime or timetable for implementation power plants have been built with full scale carbon capture equipment the costs of co2 allowances and control systems are therefore very uncertain actual costs will depend on the content of final legislation if any the

power plant cost and performan ce with carbon controls assume current petrochemical industr based technology capable of removing 90 of the co2 as discussed above the cost of carbon capture for power plants using petrochemical i ndustry derived technology will be very high table 13 provides estimates of how the capital costs and heat rates of coal and gas plants increase with the addition of

in this study emits about 1906 pounds of co2 per mwh this is computed as follows the plant has heat rate of 9118 btus per kwh this equates to coal consumption of 9118 mmbtus per mwh coal is assumed to emit 209 pounds of co2 per mmbtu of coal consumed so 9118 mmbtus per mwh x 209 pounds of co2 per mmbtu 19057 pounds of co2 per mwh in the case of combined cycle burning natural gas the gas emits only 11708 pound of co2 per mmbtu when burned 44 less than coal and the plants heat rate is 6647 btus pe r kwh 27 better than the coal plant the combined cycles co2 emissions are therefore 6647 mmbtus per mwh x 11708 pounds of co2 per mmbtu 7782 pounds of co2 per mwh 592 less than the pulverized coal plantthe results indicate the power costs for coal plants using control technologies are high compared to the base case the costs in the carbon case range from 10069 per mwh to almost 120 pe r mwh column 10 compared to 6319 per mwh for pulverized coal unit in the base case table 14 column 10 this illustrates the impact of the high capital costs and efficiency pe nalties of current carbon capture technologies with the imposition of carbon costs on fossil plants three of the least expensive options are zero carbon technologies geothermal 5923 per mwh nuclear 8322 and wind 8074 because geothermal plants are limited to specific sites in the western states nuclear power baseload technol ogy and wind power variable renewable resource are the zero carbon options with relatively low costs and wide latitude for plant sites fourth relatively lowcost tec hnology is the natural gas combined cycle plant without carbon capture 7721 per mwh including allowance costs the relatively w cost is due to the technologys low capital cost high capacity factor and relatively low emissions of co2 per megawatthour of power ge nerated as shown in table 14 the natural gas combined cycle plant without carbon capture incurs allowance costs of 1306 per mwh which is 61 less than the pulverized coal plant cost of 3380 per mwh column 6 in other words for every dollar of allowance costs incurred by coal plant without capture technology the combined cycle incurs only about 40 cents in costs96 solar thermal power 10032 per mwh has lower cost than fossil plants with carbon capture technology but is still estimated to be about 20 more expensive th an nuclear and wind power the relatively low cost of power from the natural gas combined cycle plant is in part function of the fuel price as noted above the carbon capture analysis uses the same fuel price projections as in the base case it is possible that in carbon constrained world demand for gas will increase driving up prices as shown below in table 15 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34746crs57 12 increase in the price of gas would equalize the cost of electricity from the combined cycle plant without carbon capture with wind power column 3 20 increase would equalize the power cost of the combined cycle plant and the nuclear plant the price of natural gas would have to more than double for the power cost of the gasfired combined cycle plant to equal the cost of coal power with carbon controls or increase by 75 to match the cost of solar thermal power this scale of natural gas price increases has precedent as shown in figure 7 between the early 1990s and 2007 the market price of natural gas increased by about 200 table 15 change

study calculates the capital component of power prices based on the overnight co st of power plant the overnight cost is the cost that would be incurred if power plant could be built instantly the overnight cost therefore excludes escala tion in equipment labor and commodity prices that could occur during the time pl ant is under construction it also excludes the financing charges often referred to as interest during construction idc incurred while the plant is being built with the exception of plants using carbon control technology see appendix c the overnight costs were estimated for th is study from public information on actual power projects the costs were estimated as follows crs developed databa of information on 161 power projects and cost estimates covering the fossil nuclear and renewable energy technologies included in this report subset of the projects in the database were used to estimate overnight costs projects were excluded for many reasons including because the projects were too old to reflect current construction costs did not use standard techno logy were extreme high or low outliers and information was available to explain the costs or had other unusual characteristics eg some plants reduced costs by purchasing used or surplus equipment the remaining projects were sort ed by technology eg nuclear wind etc the reported cost per kilowatt of capacity for the projects in each group were then averaged to estimate the overnight cost for each technology to the extent possible the information for the database was taken from information filed by utilities with state public service commissions the advantage of using this source is that utilities seeking permission to construct new plants are often required to disgorge cost details with these details the project cost estimate can be adjusted to exclude idc and other ex penses not directly associated with the cost of the plant such as major transmission system upgrades distant from the plant site when utility commission filings for project were not available as was almost always true for ipp and pou projects other public sources were used including press releases and trade journal articles in most cases it was possible to determine whether or not cost estimate included idc however it was rarely possible with or without utility commission filings to termine how much cost escalation was built into proj ect estimate b ecause it was not possible to extract the escalation costs from the project estimates as rough correction the financial model assumed cost escalation to avoid double c ount the model does compute the idc chargeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34746crs72 the 161 projects in the database in cludes information on 119 united states power plant projects some are still in the planning stage and few never progressed beyond paper studi and were canceled th database also includes information on 31 generic and 11 foreign cost estimates for nuclear power plants generic estimate is cost estimate not associated with any real project or specific site generic estimates are usually made by vendors or found in government and academic studies the generic and foreign estimates are useful for illustrating cost trends because nuclear plants have been built in the united states in many years but none were used in the final estimate of the overnight nuclear plant cost although the capital costs used in this study are based on these actual project estimates the capital costs are still subject to significant uncertainty due to such as factors as cost escalation and evolution in power plant and c onstruction technology the uncertainty is greatest for the tec hnologies which have the least commercial experience such as advanced nuclear plants and igcc coal plants immediately following is information on the projects used to estimate overnight costs for this report there is tabl for each technology g pulverized coal listing each project used to estimate th overnight cost for that technology accompanying each table is graph show ing the time trend for that technologys capital costs the data points on the graph are marked to indicate whether

124appendix c estimates of technology costs and efficiency with carbon capture pulverized coal with carbon capture the costs and heat rate for supercritical pulverized coal plant with carbon capture is primarily based on information from mits 2007 study the future of coal 97 mit estimated that new supercritical plant built with amine scrubbing for co2 removal would have the following characteristics co2 capture rate 90 change in efficiency compared to new plant without carbon capture 239 from 385 to 293 this equates to an increase in the heat rate of 313 increase in capital cost 6198 for new plant with amine scrubbing to have the same 600 mw net capacity as new plant without carbon controls the si ze of the plant has to be scaled up to account for the electricity and steam demands of the capture system the increase is proportional to the change in efficiency therefore developer would have to build the equivalent of 788 mw plant with carbon capture to get 600 mw of net capacity with the difference 188 mw cons umed by the amine scrubbing system either in the form of steam diverted from power generation or electricity used to compress the co299 mit does not break out the variable and fixed om costs for carbon capture as required by the financial model used in this study these costs were calculated from doe study of the costs of retrof itting carbon capture to the conesville unit 5 coalfired plant in ohio based on this study the incremental om costs for carbon capture are 824 per kw for fixed om and 779 per mwh for variable om 2006 dollars100 these costs for operating the carbon capture system are added to the base om costs for coalfired plant as estimated by eia to calculate the total om costs for the planthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34746crs94 101 the base om values are derived from eia assumptions to the annual energy outlook 2008 table 38 the eia values must be adjusted because as discussed above the unit is in effect 788 mw plant derated to 600 mw the adjustment is proportional to the difference in efficiency between the plant with and without carbon capture respectively 385 and 293 the ratio of these values 1314 is the adjustment factor the adjusted fixed om cost is the eia value of 2679 per kw x 1314 3520 the adjusted variable om is the eia estimate of 446 per mwh x 1314 586 per mwh 102 eia assumptions to the annual energy outlook 2008

characteristics of coal igcc plant built with carbon capture are taken from eia assumptions for its 2008 longterm forecast102 except for the capital cost as shown in appendix b the cost estimate for an igcc plant without carbon capture based on public in formation on current projects is 3400 per kw in 2008 this is much higher than eias estimate for an igcc plant without 1773 per kw or with 2537 carbon controls to estimate the capital cost of an igcc plant with carbon capture the percentage difference in the eia estimates of plants with and without capture 43 was applied to the crs timate of 3400 per kw without capture this produces an estimated cost for an igcc plant with carbon controls of 4862103 eias other assumptions such as for om costs and heat rates are used without adjustment in this studyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34746crs95 104 the eia data is from assumptions to the annual energy outlook 2008 table 38 doe study estimates cost premium of 112 doenational energy technology

combined cycle without carbon capture and 1409 w ith carbon capture premium of 100104 the capital cost for new combined cycle with carbon capture used in this study is therefore double the crs base
