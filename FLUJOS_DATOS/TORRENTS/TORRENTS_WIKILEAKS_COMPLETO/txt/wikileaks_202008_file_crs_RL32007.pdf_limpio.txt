involved in certain specified activities eximbank has three main programs it uses to finance us exports direct loans export credit guarantees and export credit insurance eximbanks direct lending program is used primarily to aid us expor ters in instances where they face foreign competitor that is receiving officially subs idized financing by foreign government these loans carry fixed interest rates and generally are made at terms that are the most attractive allowed under the provisions of international agreements they are made primarily to c ounter attempts by foreign governments to sway purchases in favor of their exporters solely on the basis of subsidized financing rather than on market conditions price quality etc and to enforce internationally agreed upon terms and conditions for export financing guarantees and insurance are the main programs the bank uses to assist ameri can exporters both programs reduce some of the risks involved in exporting by insuring against commercial or political uncertainty congressional restrictions when congress established the bank in 1947 it directed the bank to aid in financing and to facilitate exports and imports and the exchange of

1947 congress has amended the banks statutes at times to restrict its lending activities often these amendments have affected the banks ac tivities relative to particul ar type of economic activity or have acted to advance other us go als and objectives in some cases these restrictions likely have had limited impact on the banks activities but served as indicators of congressional intent and fu rthered us foreign political and economic goals eximbank however responds to ra ther than generates requests for its services from us firms that are exporting abroad ostensibly such firms likely are aware of congressional actions regarding eximbank and therefore would not likely apply for eximbanks services with project s that clearly violate congressionally mandated restriction in some cases t hough the legislative restrictions clearly distinguish eximbank from commercial bank or any private financial institution and impinge on its ability to respond on pur ely commercial basis nevertheless on an annual basis demand fo r eximbanks services usually outstrips its ability to respond due to congressional limitations on the overall level of financing at which the bank is allowed to obligate
