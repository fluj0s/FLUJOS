maguire government and finance division july 15 2008 abstract in 2006 41 million taxpayers were subject to the amt new jersey connecticut new york the district of columbia and maryland had the highest percentage of taxpayers subject to the amt south dakota tennessee alaska mississippi and north dakota had the lowest percentage of taxpayers subject to the amt in 2008 absent legislative change according to the joint committee on taxation some 257 million taxpayers will be aï¬€ected by the amt at that time whether married taxpayer has itemized deductions for statelocal taxes or miscellaneous deductions will become much less important factor than it is at present in determining amt coverage this occurs because whether they itemize their deductions or not married taxpayers across wide range of the income spectrum will be subject to the amt because personal exemptions are not allowed against the amthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs220831 see crs report rl30149 the alternative minimu m tax for individuals by steven maguire order code rs22083 updated july 15 2008 alternative minimum taxpayers by state 2005 2006 and projections for 2008 steven maguire specialist in public finance government and finance division summary personal exemptions itemized deductions for statelocal taxes and miscellaneous itemized deductions account for 96 of the pr eference items that are subject to tax under the alternative minimum tax amt but not subject to tax under the regular income tax as result over certain income ranges taxpayers who claim itemized deductions for statelocal taxes miscellaneous deductions or have large families are more likely to fall under the amt than taxp ayers who do not have these characteristics in 2006 41 million taxpayers were subject to the amt new jersey connecticut new york the district of columbia nd maryland had the highest percentage of taxpayers subject to the amt south da kota tennessee alaska mississippi and north dakota had the lowest percentage of taxpayers subject to the amt in 2008 absent legislative change according to the joint committee on taxation some 257 million taxpayers will be affected by the amt at that time whether married taxpayer has itemized deductions for statelocal taxes or miscellaneous deductions will become much less important f actor than it is at present in determining amt coverage this occurs because whether they itemize their deductions or not married taxpayers across wide range of the income spectrum will be subject to the amt because personal exemptions are not llowed against the amt this report will be updated as legislative action warrants or as new data become available the alternative minimum tax for individuals amt was originally enacted to ensure that highincome taxpayers paid fair share of the federal income tax however the lack of indexation of the amt coupled with the recent reductions in the regular income tax has greatly expanded the potential impact of the amt1httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22083crs2 2 us congress joint committee on taxation present law and background relating to the alternative minimum tax jcx3807 june 25 2007 3 jct june 25 2007 p 18 4 for more on the deductibility of state and local taxes see crs report rl32781 federal deductibility of state and local taxes by steven maguiretemporary increases in the amt exemp tions expired at the end of 2007 if legislative changes do not extend the expired changes then the number of taxpayers subject to the amt will rise from around 5 million in 2007 to 242 milli on in 2008 further by 2010 some 31 million taxpayers will be subject to the amt2 taxpayers with incomes in the 100000 to 500000 income range will be the hardest hit 88 of these taxpayers will be subject to the amt in 2010 itemized deductions for statelocal taxe s 627 pers onal exemptions 224 and miscellaneous itemized deductions 114 together account for 96 of the preference items that are subject to tax under the am t but not subject to tax under the regular income tax3 as result over certain income ranges taxpayers who claim itemized deductions for statelocal taxes miscellaneous deductions andor have large families are more likely to fall under the amt than taxp ayers who do not have these characteristics table 1 and table 2 show for 2005 and 2006 respectively the percentage of taxpayers in each state that were subject to the amt of all the states south dakota tennessee alaska mississippi and north dakota had the smallest percentage of taxpayers subject to the amt in these five states roughly 1 of taxpayers were on the amt in 2006 these are states in which ither many taxpayers have relatively low incomes or statelocal taxes that are deductible from the federal income tax are relatively low as result of the combination of these factors taxpayers in these states tend not to itemize their deductions and hence are less likely to be subject to the amt than taxpayers in other states4 on the other hand new jersey connecticut new york the district of columbia and maryland were the states with the largest percentage of taxpayers subject to the amt for instance in new jersey about 65 out of every 1000 taxpayers fell under the amt in 2006 in these states many taxpayers have relatively high incomes and the statelocal tax burden is also relatively high the combination of these factors produces larger number of itemizers and consequently larger percenta ge of taxpayers being captured by the amt note that absent legislative change patch whether married taxpayer has itemized deductions for statelocal taxes andor miscellaneous deductions will become less important factor in determining whether taxpayers are subject to the amt this will result because if the amt is not modifi ed then across broad range of the income spectrum all married taxpayers will be subject to the amt whether they itemize their deductions or not the potentially expanding impact of the amt has been mitigated through temporary increases in the basic exemption for the amt and temporary changes that allow taxpayers to use nonrefundable personal tax credits to re duce their amt liabilities the most

httpwaysandmeanshousegovmoreinfoaspsection46 visited july 15 2008 7 us congress joint committee on taxation stimated revenue effects of hr 6275 the alternative minimum tax relief act of 2008 scheduled for markup by the committee on ways and means on june 18 2008 jcx5108 june 17 2008increase in the basic amt ex emption occurred in december 2007 with the enactment of the tax increase prevention act of 2007 tipa pl 110166 under provisions of this act the amt exemption for 2007 was set at 66250 for joint returns and 44350 for unmarried taxpayers in addition this act allows taxpayers to temporarily use nonrefundable tax credits to offset amt lia bility in 2008 the basic amt exemption is scheduled to decrease to its prior law level of 45000 for joint returns 35750 for unmarried taxpayers and nonrefundable tax cr edits will not be allowed to offset amt liability because the temporary patches to the amt expired at the end of 2007 in 2008 roughly 21 million more taxpayers will likely be subject to the amt5 an increase of this magnitude will affect taxpayers in every state regardless of whether taxpayers in that state itemize and deduct their statelocal taxes andor miscellaneous deductions from their federal tax returns for example in 2006 27217 taxpayers in tennessee were subject to the amt thus tennessee taxpayers accounted for only 066 of the total amt returns filed in the united states that year however if that percentage remains constant and the temporary patches to the amt expire then in 2008 up to 159000 066 times 24156 million taxpayers in tennessee could be subject to the amt table 3 shows the potential number of amt returns by state in 2008 if the temporary patches to the amt are not extended the crs calculations are an extrapolation based on the assumption that the ratio of amt taxpayers in each state to total amt taxpayers in the entire country w ill remain the same in 2008 as it was in 2006 the methodology makes assumptions that c ould be challenged but still provides reasonable estimate of the potential impact of the amt in 2008 ab sent legislative changes the house ways and means committee has released projections of the number of amt taxpayers by congressional district these projections can be found on the committees website6 the joint committee on taxation estimates that the oneyear amt patch for 2008 would reduce federal revenues by almost 615 billion over 10 years7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22083 crs4 table 1 number of alternative minimum taxpayers by state tax year 2005 returns in thousands rank statenumber of
