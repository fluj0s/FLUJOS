was introduced in the house on november 14 2002 the house passed the bill by unanimous consent on november 15 2002 on november 22 2002 th senate adjourned for the session without considering hr 5728 it seems likel that similar bill may reemerge in the next session of congress since many of its provisions have been repeatedly introduced over the past few years the provisions seem especially popular in the house as exemplified by its unanimous passage of similar bill hr 4163 in the 106th congress the senate did not act on the bill the majority of the bills provisions are adva ntageous to taxpayers title i includes changes to the internal revenue services tax collection procedures th at would benefit the taxpayers involved in such actions title ii contains measures for improving the efficiency of tax administration and for strengthening the protection afforded to confidential taxpayer information title iii is aimed at reforming certain interest and penalty provisions in ways that favor taxpayers and at expanding the irss ability to penalize frivolous taxpayer actionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21371crs2 title i fairness in t ax collection procedures section 101 would allow the internal revenue service irs to enter into installment agreements for the partial payment of tax liabilities currently taxpayer who owes taxes may qualify under sect ion 6159 of the internal revenue code irc to enter into an agreement with the irs to pay the liability in installments present law is not clear as to whether the irs may enter into an installment agreement that only requires partial payment of the liability the bill would expre ssly allow installment agreements for partial payment the agreements would have to be reviewed by the treasury secretary every two years sections 102 and 103 relate to situations where levy has been wrongfully placed on taxpayers property when taxpayer fails to pay taxes owed the irs may collect the liability by placing levy on the taxpayers property including money eg wages under irc 6343b the treasury secret ary must return any property upon which levy is wrongfully placed when money has b een levied or when the levied property has been sold by the government the treasury s ecretary has 9 months from the date of the levy to return an amount of money equal to the amount levied or to the selling price section 102 of the bill would extend this period until 2 years after the date of the levy additionally the period within which an individual other than the taxpayer may file claim of wrongful levy against the irs w ould be lengthened currently such an individual who has an interest in the levied property must file claim within 9 months of the levy section 102 would change the deadlin to 2 years after the date of the levy section 103 would allow the treasury secr etary upon the determination that levy was wrongly or prematurely placed upon an individual retirement plan to deposit the amount of money levied plus interest into the plan if the plan allows rollovers the entire deposit would be exempt from tax section 104 would restrict the irss ability to toll certain statutes of limitation when taxpayer seeks taxpayer assistance order the irs must meet certain deadlines called statutes of limitation when it pursues collecti on actions against taxpayers under irc 7811d these deadlines are suspended when taxpayer requests assistance from the national taxpayer advocate the suspen sion continues until the advocate makes decision as to whether to grant the reque st section 104 would disallow the deadline suspension if the advocates decision was made within 7 days of the taxpayers request section 105 would require the treasury secretary to conduct study of the irss use of lien and levy actions the study would ddress two issues 1 the irss declining use of liens and levies and 2 the practicality of taking such an action when its cost is greater than the amount to be realized from the property section 106 relates to clinics that represent lowinco taxpayers for little or fee in disputes with the irs under irc 7526 the treasury secretary may grant total of 6 million in funding to qualifying lowinco taxpayer clinics section 106 would gradually increase the amount of available grant money to 15 million by 2004 furthermore the bill would make clear that clinics providing routine tax preparation do not qualify for the grantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21371crs3 title ii improved administrative efficiency and confidentiality subtitle efficiency of tax administration section 201 would expand the range of disc iplinary actions faced by irs employees for certain types of misconduc t currently an irs employee who violates section 1203 of the irs restructuring and reform act of 1998 is automatically terminated most of the section 1203 provisions are related to pr otecting taxpayers from abusive acts by irs employees the bill would allow the treasury secretary to impose disciplinary actions other than termination it woul d also require that most trigge ring violations be willfully performed by the irs employee section 202 would authorize the tax court to apply the doctrine of equitable recoupment this doctrine allows the governme nt to collect tax or taxpayer to collect refund when the deadline for such collection action has run so long as the collection is fair and just confusion exists as to whether the tax court may use this doctrine and the bill would expressly allow the court to apply it section 203 would give the tax court sole jurisdiction over collection due process cases which are taxpayer appeals from hearings approving the irss levying of taxpayer property under irc 6330d1 the us district courts have jurisdiction in these cases if the tax court does not have jurisdic tion over the underlying tax liability the bill would give the tax court sole jurisdic tion over all collection due process cases section 204 would eliminate the requirement that the irss office of chief counsel occ review offers in compromise under irc 7122 when the irs offers to compromise with taxpayer over the amount of tax interest or penalty owed the occ must review the offer if th amount of unpaid liability will be at least 50000 in all other cases the treasury secretary may ask fo r the occs opinion on the offer the bill would make all offers revi ewable by the occ solely upon the secretarys request section 205 would give taxpayers who elect ronically file indi vidual income tax returns an extra 15 days to file their retu rns and to pay any taxes owed thus such individuals could wait until april 30 to file and pay without penalty subtitle b confidentiality and disclosure section 211 would make it easier for an i ndividual to request information from the irs concerning taxes owed from return filed jointly with the individuals former or separated spouse currently an individua l may make written re quest under irc 6103e to the irs for information concerning any irs action to collect the deficiency from the other person the bill would allow the individual to make an oral request to the irs for the information section 212 would clarify that taxpayer representative may not be subject to examination solely because the represented taxpayer is being examined section 213 would require that federal agen cy or state take certain actions before disclosing taxpayer information to contractor s of that agency or state the bill would require that the agency or state 1 ensures that contractors have safeguards to protect thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21371crs4 confidentiality of taxpayer information 2 re views the adequacy of these safeguards and submits the findings to the treasury secretary and 3 certifies to the secretary that contractors are in compliance with the safeguards section 214 would elaborate on the current procedure for irs disclosure of taxpayer information to taxpayers designee under irc 6103c the irs may disclose taxpayer information to taxpayers design ee upon the request or consent of the taxpayer section 214 would specify that all requests designate recipient and be dated and certified additionally the designee would be required to keep the information confidential and to use it solely for the requests purpose the bill would also require that the treasury secretary create request form with warning to taxpayers that only completed forms should be signed and informa tion on what to do if coerced into signing an incomplete form finally the treasury inspector general for tax administration tigta would be required to submit report to congress on compliance with these new rules section 215 would require that the irs tify taxpayers whose return or other information was inspected or disclosed by an irs employee or by someone else currently irc 7431e only requires taxpay er notification when person is criminally charged with the inspection or disclosure of taxpayer information the bill would expand the notification requirement to situations where tigta determines that the information was unlawfully disclosed or inspected sec tion 215 would also requi re an annual report from tigta detailing the incidences of unauthorized disclosure and inspection section 216 would expand the group of law forcement agencies to which the irs may disclose limited information in certain emergency circumstances irc 6103i3b allows such disclosure to federa l or state law enforcem ent agencies and the bill would include local law enforcement agencies subtitle c other provisions section 221 would require that tigta report to congress on whether newer communication technologies eg email and fax are feasible methods of communication between the irs and taxpayers section 222 would allow the treasury secret ary to issue regulations on the conduct of enrolled agents who practice before the irs the bill would also allow these agents to identify themselves with the enrolled agent credentials section 223 would enable the financial ma nagement service division of the treasury department that provi des centralized payment and collection services for the federal government to charge the irs for the full cost of implementing the continuous levy program found in irc 6331 section 224 would allow for the information about certain security auctions that is discussed at treasury borrowing advisory co mmittee meetings to be publically disclosed once the treasury secretary releases the minutes of the meetings current law only allows for disclosure once the secretary make s public announcement about the auctionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21371crs5 title iii reform of penalty and interest provisions section 301 would change the way taxpayers are penalized for failing to make an estimated tax payment currently taxpayer who fails to make payment is assessed penalty under irc 6654 section 301 w ould reorganize section 6654 and renumber it as section 6641 two substantive changes would also be made first the penalty would be changed to an interest charge s econd the safe harbor would be increased from 1000 to 2000 so that taxpayers with underp ayments of less than 2000 would not be assessed the interest charge section 302 would exclude from taxable inco certain interest payments made on income tax overpayments under irc 6611 the irs must pay interest to qualifying taxpayers who have overpaid the amount of taxes owed the bill would make these payments nontaxable if the interest is from the overpayment of individual income tax and if the treasury secretary has not determined that the purpose of the overpayment was to collect the taxfree interest section 303 would ease the restri ctions on the abatement of interest owed to the irs under irc 6404e2 the irs may not begin to charge interest on an erroneous refund until the irs demands th refunds repayment however the irs may charge interest before the repayment demand if the taxpayer caused th erroneous refund or if the erroneous refund is more than 50000 s ection 303 would make erroneous refunds exceeding 50000 eligible for abatement fu rthermore under irc 6404f the irs may not charge penalty or addition to tax that is attributable to erroneous written advice from the irs the bill would extend this abatement rule to any interest attributable to such written statement section 304 would allow taxpayers to make deposits to the irs for the purpose of paying taxes not yet assessed once an ssessment is made the deposit date would be treated as the date the tax was paid thus av erting any interest charge for the underpayment of taxes the deposit would have to be returned at the written request of the taxpayer unless the treasury secretary determines that the return would jeopardize tax collection section 305 would give individual taxpayer s greater opportunity to take advantage of interest rate netting u nder irc 6621d when taxp ayer owes interest payments on an underpayment of tax and is concurrently owed intere st payments on an equivalent tax overpayment the net interest rate is zero thus the taxpayer neither owes nor is owed interest payments this symmetry is di sturbed by irc 6611e which disallows interest on overpayments that ar refunded within 45 days of th date that either the return is due or the refund is claime d this rule prevents taxpayer who owes interest during this period from netting the inte rest rate to zero secti on 305 would prevent the 45 day rule from applying for the interest rate netting purposes of individual taxpayers section 306 would waive certa in penalties for first time unintentional taxpayer errors under irc 6651 taxpayer who fails to file tax return or to pay tax is assessed penalty on such failu re unless the failure was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect the bill would grant the treasury secretary the discretion to not penalize firsttime unintentional errors the secretary would have to find that the taxpayer has history of tax compliance nd took prompt corrective action the error washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21371crs6 unintentional and minor imposition of the penalty would be unfai r and the waiver of the penalty would promote taxpayer complia nce and efficient tax administration section 307 would expand the penalties for frivolous tax filings under irc 6702 first the civil fine for filing frivolous tax return would be increased from 500 to 5000 second 5000 fine would be imposed on the making of specified frivolous submission including request for lien or vy hearing and an application for taxpayer assistance order installment agreement or compromise taxpayer could withdraw frivolous submission and the penalty would th be waived the secretary would also be able to reduce the 5000 penalty if the reduction would promote tax collection and efficient tax administration section 308 would clarify that the highes t percentage penalty under irc 6656 for the failure to make deposit of taxes only applies when the failure is for more than 15 days the percentages of underpayment charge d as the penalty are unchanged 2 if the failure is for less than 6 days 5 if the fa ilure lasts for 6 to 15 days and 10 if the failure is for more than 15 days
