in government finance government and finance division federal spending by agency and budget function fy2001fy2006 summary this report provides data on federal spending by agency and by budget function for fy2001 through fy20061 the agency and function data ranked by size reveal the concentrated nature of federal spending in 2006 the four largest agencies of 51 listed produced 82 of total outlays and the six largest of 19 budget functions produced 84 of total outlays most of the spending by the largest agencies and within the largest budget functions is either mandatory spending such as social security medicare and income support defense spending or net interest spending on federal debt among the largest spending agencies or functions minor reordering has occurred over the six years of data in this report net interest fell as share of total spending and in dollars slipped slightly because of lower interest rates and slow growth in federal debt early in the period net interest began growing again in 2005 the defense function spending grew as money was added for the war on terror and the wars in afghanistan and iraq for the largest agencies the department of health and human services moved from the second spot to the first replacing the social security administration as health care costs continued to accelerate the department of defense military moved from fourth to third while the treasury slipped into fourth as net interest payments fell many of the smaller agencies experienced substantial changes in their ranking such as homeland security which moved from 15th to 8th based on its lead role in the war on terror and its funding for hurricane recovery in 2005 and 2006 the concentration of federal spending in broadly popular or necessary activities makes congressional efforts to find and implement large spending reductions difficult without substantial reordering of the publics priorities as reflected in the governments allocation of resources or consensus among policy makers to reduce popular spending programs spending reduction efforts seem destined to remain small the result is likely limited effect on overall federal spending or deficit reduction this report will be updated as new budget data become available 1 unless otherwise noted all years mentioned in this report are fiscal years contents outlays by agency 2 outlays by budget

federal spending by agency and budget function fy2001fy2006 the federal budget is large and often confusing compilation of facts proposals estimates and expectations this report compiles portion of the extensive budget information available to focus on the high degree of concentration of federal spending within relatively few areas or agencies total federal spending has grown greatly over the last 21 years from 9464 billion in fy1985 to 26549 billion in fy20062 in current dollars in constant fy2000 dollars outlays grew from 13957 billion in 1985 to 23136 billion in 2006 est as percentage of gross domestic product gdp outlays have declined from 229 of gdp in 1985 year of recession to 203 of gdp in 2006 in between outlays fell to 184 of gdp in fy2000 year of rapid economic growth before climbing to the 2006 level the government spends this money on an immense number of activities through large number of federal agencies to provide some sense of what this money is spent on and in what amounts this report ranks federal spending by federal agency and by the office of management and budgets ombs 19 budget functions which omb uses to characterize spending by broad categories for the years 2001 through 2006 the data are arranged by size from largest to smallest for agencies and budget functions the data are shown in dollars and as percentages of total spending for budget functions the data are also shown as percentages of gross domestic product gdp the data are from the budget of the united states government for fiscal year 2007 from the omb and from the final monthly treasury statements for various years from the treasury the data clearly show two general patterns to federal spending the first is that most federal spending is and has been over this period concentrated in limited number of agencies and in about third of the budget functions the second pattern is that except for handful of agencies usually smaller ones the relative rank of the various spending categories has changed relatively modestly and slowly over the six years the combination of these two patterns indicates that the distribution of federal spending although always in some flux has been fairly stable over these years one other observation related to the concentration of federal spending is worth noting other than defense spending the spending of the largest agencies or budget functions is mostly composed of mandatory or required spending such as social security medicare medicaid federal civilian and military retirement programs and 2 unless otherwise noted all years mentioned in this report are fiscal years crs2 interest on the debt ombs short definition of mandatory spending states that mandatory and related programs include direct spending and offsetting receipts whose budget authority is provided by law other than appropriations acts3 this puts somewhere between 60 and 70 of total federal spending outside the annual appropriations debate even the 30 to 40 of the budget that is subject to annual appropriations is not completely discretionary much of the annual appropriated amounts are necessary to fulfill legal commitments that the government had entered into in previous time periods such as contracts or other obligations unless congress and the president are willing to eliminate programs and the payroll costs for federal employees that run them certain amount of the annual appropriations is needed for federal salaries in addition approximately half of the annual appropriated amount goes to defense spending an activity that is difficult to reduce during time of war in effect much less than the 30 to 40 of the budget considered discretionary can be reduced through appropriations alone tables 1 and 2 rank federal spending by agency including spending for the legislative and judicial branches by amount spent in fy2006 from largest to smallest the other independent agency category in the tables combines the outlays of multitude of relatively small agencies the international assistance program is collection of activities not included in specific agency table 1 contains outlays in millions of dollars and table 2 shows the agencies by their percentages of total outlays in 2006 for example the national science foundation ranked 25th had outlays of 55 billion and accounted for 02089 of total outlays tables 3 and 4 duplicate tables 1 and 2 respectively but are ranked by the 19 federal budget functions instead of departments and agencies as with the departments and agencies the functions are arranged in descending order by amount spent in 2006 the natural resources and environment budget function in 2006 for example had outlays of 331 billion which were 12 of total outlays and ranked 12th out of the 19 budget functions in addition table 5 shows the budget functions by their share of gdp the natural resources and environment budget function used 027 of gdp in 2006 in 2006 total outlays were 2033 of gdp outlays by agency tables 1 and 2 contain 2001 through 2006 outlays listed by the largest amount spent by an agency the department of health and human services hhs to the smallest amount spent by an agency the general services administration and on to those agencies with negative outlays in which the agencys outlays are offset by collections credited to the agency see footnote 5 this ordering of federal spending clearly shows the persistent concentration of federal spending in few agencies 3 omb budget of the united states government for fiscal year 2006 february 2005 historical tables p 15 crs3 when combined the four largest departments and agencies hhs the social security administration ssa defensedod and the treasury spent 2136 billion or 815 of the total outlays in 20064 the smallest of these four the treasury 4643 billion spent almost five times as much as the department of agriculture 954 billion which ranks right below the treasury in spending the department spending the most hhs 6143 billion spent 10 times what the tenth largest the department of transportation 601 billion spent in 2006 the two largest hhs and ssa each spent over 22 of total outlays in 2006 the dod almost reached 19 of total outlays in 2006 the treasury spent 175 of total outlays the next department in order agriculture spent 35 of total outlays showing the large gulf between the four largest agencies and all others in the amounts spent the next 14 departments or agencies in the table spent over 10 billion but less than 100 billion in 20065 their combined spending was 6634 billion 250 of total outlays the 11 departments and agencies spending more than 1 billion but less than 10 billion including the judicial and legislative branches produced total outlays of 639 billion and 24 of total outlays in 2006 these 11 combined spent slightly more than the office of personnel management alone ranked ninth in the list the final group of agencies with positive outlays group of 16 each spent less than 10 billion this groups combined outlays were only 65 billion and just 024 of total outlays in 2006 the amount spent by these 16 for fy2006 was little more than the amount spent by the department of commerce 64 billion and approximately what hhs spent on average in just under four days the sum of the percentages of total outlays spent by the agencies with positive outlays equals 1092 of total outlays for 2006 the remaining six agencies with negative outlays also called offsetting outlays or offsetting receipts plus the negative outlays from the undistributed offsetting receipts category produced 2431 billion in outlay offsets 92 of total outlays adding these offsetting outlays to total positive outlays produces total net outlays for 2006 of 26549 billion6 4 some of the money spent by ssa treasury hhs defense and the other departments and agencies includes internal payments within the government itself to avoid counting these internal payments in total outlays which represent government expenditures to the public they are offset either against the spending of the government recipient or are subtracted from outlays through the undistributed offsetting receipts category negative outlay amount found at the bottom of the list in each table the treasury is somewhat of special case without the inclusion of total interest payments on federal debt in its totals its outlays drop in 2006 from 464 billion to 58 billion and 22 of total outlays adding the net interest portion of total interest to this noninterest portion of treasury outlays produces modified 2006 treasury spending of 285 billion 107 of total outlays an amount substantially larger than the next largest agency the department of agriculture 5 negative outlays usually as offsetting receipts keep the totals from exceeding 100 of total outlays see footnote 5 6 negative outlays or offsetting receipts generally refer to collections by one agency from continued crs4 outlays by budget function as mentioned earlier tables 3 and 4 list the budget functions ranked in descending order of outlays for 2006 for the six fiscal years 2001 through 2006 the data in these tables make similar point to those in tables 1 and 2 the bulk of federal outlays are concentrated in relatively few large functions although not showing quite the same concentration as the agency listing the six largest budget functions out of 19 account for 844 of total outlays these six functions include the major mandatory spending programs of the federal government plus defense and net interest spending substantially increased spending within the community and regional development function resulting from federal hurricane recovery efforts reduced slightly the concentration of federal spending in the largest six functions in fy2006 in 2005 the six largest functions contained 852 of total spending which fell to 844 of total spending in 2006 the smallest of the six largest budget functions net interest produced over 85 of total outlays in 2006 and its share is expected to keep rising while the seventh largest function in the list education training employment and social services produced almost 45 of total outlays three other of the remaining budget functions individually produced more than 2 of total outlays the 12 smaller budget functions excluding offsetting receipts generated 18 of total outlays in 2006 and funded all other federal activities the six largest functions use such large share of total spending that even if they were reduced by the amount of the undistributed offsetting receipts which in the budget function listing is mostly federal agency payments of the employer share of federal employee retirement they would still account for almost 82 of total outlays7 total federal outlays were 203 of gdp in 2006 the largest budget function social security was 42 of gdp as with their share of total outlays the six largest functions accounted for most of federal spending as share of gdp by substantial amount the largest six combined were 172 of gdp in 2006 the remaining 12 functions with positive outlays made up 37 of gdp in that year undistributed offsetting receipts were 05 of gdp table 5 shows the budget functions as percentages of gdp for each of the six years 6 continued another agency and collections from the public that have businesslike or marketlike nature these are then credited to appropriation or fund accounts offsetting receipts are deposited in receipt accounts but are used to offset outlays rather than being added to total federal receipts 7 undistributed offsetting receipts uor are not defined or measured the same way in the two sets of tables in tables 1 and 2 the uor include almost all of the outlay offsets in the government accounts very few are offset against the spending in the departments and agencies in tables 3 4 and 5 many of the offsets are included within the various functions producing amounts in the functions that are essentially net outlays the uor in these three tables represents relatively small amount of offsets that are not distributed among the functions for various reasons crs5 changing rank and share over time some of the agencies and few of the budget functions shifted their rank over the 2001 to 2006 period while many gained or lost share of total outlays or gdp without change in rank these changes resulted from policy choices and external forces such as the war on terrorism and changing economic conditions respectively acting on the budget figure 1 selected agency outlays as the four agencies with the percent of total outlays fy2001fy2006 largest outlays in 2006 were also as percent of total the four largest in 2001 although 25 248 243 their order changed with hhs 235 237 235 and ssa swapping rank as did 231 234 231 dod and treasury health care 229 232 227 costs grew faster than social 208 221 security moving hhs to the top 20 191 188 while slower federal debt growth 184 180 192 and lower interest rates early in 164 the period and higher defense 175 165 170 166 spending raised dod military 15 156 above treasury 124 the combined share for the 117 117 115 four largest agencies fell from 121 115 840 in 2001 to 816 in 2006 10 111 85 the fall in the treasurys share of 85 71 total spending due to the fall in 74 net interest outlays explains 70 almost all of the decline for these 5 four agencies reduction in the hhs ssa ssas share contributed to the defensemilitary treasury fall while growth in the dods medicare net interest share more than covered the ssa 0 reduction the reversal in 2005 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 of the fouryear fall in net interest within the department of the treasury and the expectation that net interest and gross interest will continue growing has increased the chances of higher future concentrations of federal spending in these four agencies along with interest payments social security and federal health spending are also expected to rise as shares of total outlays the outlays of the three largest agencies combined were 632 of total outlays in 2001 rising to 640 in 2006 which was down from their peak of 659 of total outlays in 2004 these three agencies hhs ssa and dod produced almost two thirds of total federal spending over this period crs6 among the other agencies increases in department of education funding bumped it from the 10th spot in 2001 to the 6th spot in 2006 the department of homeland security dhs moved from 15th to 8th place in the list of agencies8 one of the larger changes in rank moved the executive office of the president from 35th place in 2001 to 26th place in 2006 the executive office of the presidents responsibility for the iraq relief reconstruction fund produced most of the rise in its rank the small business figure 2 selected budget functions as administration sba shifted percent of total outlays fy2001fy2006 from producing offsetting outlays 25 as percent of total negative outlays in 2001 to 232 positive outlays in 2002 through 2006 moving it to 30th place out 216 227 212 of 45 departments or agencies 220 207 with positive outlays in 2006 20 204 the postal service went the 187 199 199 other way dropping in the 173 164 rankings from 28th to 49th and 155 155 from having positive outlays in 15 145 2001 to having offsetting outlays 140 145 133 in 2006 it first had negative outlays in 2003 117 115 115 117 121 124 98 the six largest budget 10 111 95 functions social security 102 105 101 92 defense income security net 85 71 70 85 interest medicare and health 74 contain almost as much federal 5 spending and most of the same social security national defense activities as the top four incom security agencies the combined share medicare health for these six budget functions net interest was 861 in 2001 and 844 in 0 2006 excluding the net interest 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 function from the top six still produced threequarters or more of total outlays 750 of total outlays in 2001 and 758 of total outlays in 2006 the concentration of federal spending can be expected to increase in the near future as the federal programs for the elderly such as social security and medicare expand in response to the coming retirement of the babyboom generation the expected faster growth in federal debt resulting from persistent deficits along with higher interest rates may also raise net interest spending as share of total outlays in 2006 spending for hurricane recovery increased spending outside the largest four departments and six functions by enough to drive down their cumulative share of total outlays 8 omb adjusts historical budget data to conform to current accounting including organization changes such as occurred with the creation of the department of homeland security crs7 like the agency list the largest budget functions show little change in rank over the period the four largest budget functions held their rank throughout the five years the fifth and sixth ranked budget functions health and net interest exchanged positions health moving to number five and net interest falling to number six the share of total outlays going to the national defense function as one might expect increased over the five years growing from 164 in 2001 to 199 in 2006 the defense function reached 204 of total outlays in 2005 see table 4 for listing of the 19 budget functions showing their share of total outlays for the years 2001 through 2006 budget functions as percentages of gdp as percentages of gdp see table 5 total outlays have increased since 2001 rising from 185 to 203 in 2006 in other words federal spending has grown faster than the economy over these figure 3 selected budget functions as six years its growth in 2006 in percent of gdp fy2001fy2006 relation to gdp was smaller than as percent of gdp most of the other years in the 45 period of the overall increase 426 439 439 419 national defense increased its 430 429 40 409 403 share by 10 of gdp increases 375 395 in the shares of three other functions medicare health and 35 336 education training employment 303 310 and social services produced 30 282 much of the remaining increase in 301 270 total outlays as percentage of 288 268 gdp net interest lost 03 of its 25 243 222 231 233 252 share of gdp over the period 216 figure 3 shows the six largest 204 20 189 193 budget functions as percentages of 205 203 208 gdp for the years 2001 through 165 171 173 2006 their cumulative share of 15 139 150 gdp was 159 in 2001 and 142 171 in 2006 the changes for 10 the most part occurred over social security limited range none of the national defense incom security functions changed its share of 05 medicare gdp by more than 1 the health net interest national defense function 00 increased its share by exactly 1 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 most of the functions had changes of less than 04 of gdp many much less changing the scale in figure 3 to show total outlays over the period ie extending the vertical axis to 21 of gdp makes the visual changes in most of the six functions look relatively flat this is illustrated in figure 4 crs8 during the six years the individual functions showed varied patterns of change defense spending grew rapidly in the early years of the period from historically low levels as the funding for the war on terror grew but leveled off in 2005 and 2006 income security rose from 27 figure 4 selected budget functions and of gdp in 2001 to 31 of gdp total outlays as percent of gdp in 2003 before falling back to fy2001fy2006 27 of gdp in 2006 funding as percent of gdp in this function increased with 20 the economic sluggishness in the early years of the decade net interest fell from 20 of gdp in 2001 to 14 of gdp in 2003 and 2004 before rising to 17 of gdp in 2006 trend that is 15 likely to continue and may accelerate the slow growth in federal debt and low interest total social security rates in the early 2000s reduced national defense the share of gdp used for net 10 incom security interest medicare continued its medicare health fairly steady increase as share net interest of gdp although social security fell slightly as share of gdp over these years this trend 5 is unlikely to continue for long the coming retirement of the baby boom generation beginning early in the next decade will increase under current policy spending for social security at 0 rate fast enough to increase its 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 share of total spending crs9 table 1 federal outlays by agency in millions of dollars

slightly smaller total receipts outlays were larger by almost 500 million less than 002 of the original total outlays receipts were smaller by 6 million only 0002 below the original receipt total the
