ratemaking process7 the copyright act prior to crdra vest ed initial decisionmaking for statutory royalty rates in copyright arbitration royalty panel carp8 at the behest of the librarian of congress upon th recommendation of the copy right office carp was convened to take testimony from interested parties and recommend statutory royalty rate carp was made up of three profe ssional arbitrators at the conclusion of its proceedings it issued report to the libr arian the librarian upon the recommendation of the copyright office would dopt the fees pr oposed by the carp unless its determinations were f ound to be arbitrary or contrary to copyright law if the librarian rejected the proposed fees he could after an examination of the record and an additional 30 days issue an order setting them an aggrieved party who was bound by the librarians decision had the right to appeal to the us court of appeals for the dc circuit when the 1976 copyright act was origina lly enacted administrative responsibility for statutory royalty rates was reposed in copyright royalty tribunal composed of three fulltime commissioners9 finding that the tribunals workload did not justify the cost of three commissioners congress enacted th copyright royalty tribunal reform act of 1993 which established the carp system10 among the perceived advantages of the carp system was the fact that th panels were established on an ad hoc basis thereby saving the expense of fulltime employees and were paid for by parties to the proceeding but the carp process became the subject of congressional hearings during which substantial criticism of the process was aired11 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21512crs3 11 continued the judiciary 108th cong 1st sess 2003hr 1417 hearing 12 hr 1417 hearing supra statement of

subcomm on courts the internet and intellectual property the following i ssues were among those raised although the carp system was intende d to save money requiring the parties before it to foot the costs of the proceeding results in some interested parties being unable to participate because of the expense12 appointing the panels on an asneeded basis results in lack of stability and precedent in the ratemaking process and in light of the fact that the royalty laws and economics of ratemaking are extremely complex an absence of institutional expertise from panel to panel13 procedural rules for practice before the carp such as those governing discovery and the admission of evidence are either too restrictive or too vague deadlines for the carps i ssuance of ruling are inadequate14 and under the carp system proceeds fro m royalties derived from cable and satellite licenses are used to subsidize the costs of unrelated compulsory license proceedings there was mechanism for partial distribution of uncontested royalties15 pl 108419 the copyright royalty and distribution reform act of 2004 crdra hr 1417 108th cong 1st sess 2003 was in troduced on march 25 2003 by representative
