the fy2006 hsgp guidelines authoriz states and localities to purchase communications equipment17 interoperable communica tions equipment however is but one of many types of equipmen t on the dhs authorized equipment list ael even with this funding source nga states developing statewide interoperability for emergency responders is the chief priority and states are working diligently to bolster this capacity many are struggling with the dual challenges of funding and time states must either replace outdated equipment with new models or install software that allows incompatible equipment throughout the state to communicate with each other18 additionally nga stated that the survey re spondents indicated that additional grant funding would facilitate the acquis ition of new technology to enable interoperability19 one might assume that because dhs has not provided separa funding source or specific amount of grant funding for communications equipment the department does not recognize
