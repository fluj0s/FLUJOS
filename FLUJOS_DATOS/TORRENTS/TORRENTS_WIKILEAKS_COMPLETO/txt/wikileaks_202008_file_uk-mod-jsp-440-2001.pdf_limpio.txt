assets from compromise compromise can be breach of confidentiality the restriction of information and other valuable assets to authorized individuals eg protection from espionage eavesdropping leaks and computer hacking b integrity the maintenance of information systems of all kinds and physical assets in their complete and usable form eg protection from unauthorized alteration to computer programme c availability the permitting of continuous or timely access to information systems or physical assets by authorized users eg protection from sabotage malicious damage theft fire and flood 0102 in assessing integrity and availability consideration must be given to both t he direct and indirect consequences of compromise for example the theft of personal computer may be of limited direct consequence as such equipment can be relatively cheaply replaced the loss of the information contained on the computer may have significant indirect consequences particularly if arrangements have been made for backup storage of the information it contains the security system 0103 assets are defined as anything of value either tangible or intangible tha t is owned or used by an organization or business they can be documents and information material such as buildings equipment valuables or cash oper ating systems or personnel material assets can have different degrees of value these are defined within the following protective markings top secret the compromise of top secret information or material would be likely to threaten directly the internal stabili ty of the uk or friendly countries to lead directly to widespread loss of life to cause exceptionally grave damage to the effectiveness or security of uk or allied forces or to the continuing effectiveness of extremely

sector and its operations 0104 when an asset merits protective marking the appropriate levels of protection shown at annex are to be provided the protective marking given to document must be determined solely on the information it contains it is there fore very important that the protective marking selected is correct special markings 0105 only those with need to know or need to hold should have access to protectively marked information when it is necessary to provide additional protection by reinforcing the need to know principle special markings that restrict restricted principles of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 13 restricted access should be used normally in conjunction with protective marking special markings consist of national caveats national caveats exist for the additional protection of certain types of protectively marked uk material eg uk eyes only and canukus eyes only definitions of these and other caveats and advice on their use are given in chapter 16 b descriptors descriptors help to implement the need to know principle by indicating the nature of the assets sensitivity and the need to limit access accordingly list of mod descriptors is

similar protective markings to the uk prefixed nato or weu as appropriate further details are in chapter 4 the threat 0106 the following paragraphs detail the five threats to security espionage 0107 espionage is defined as attempts to acquire information covertly or illegal ly in order to assist foreign power foreign intelligence services are continuously collecting information for intelligence purposes they work mainly through agents who are either introduced into country or recruited locally such agents in their search for targets may be expected to seek out those with human weaknesses who can be exploited particularly through corruption or blackmail b mount technical operations such as eavesdropping including telephone interception interception of radio communications sigint and surveillance establishment is immune from attack one with access or potential ccess to protected assets is too unimportant to be cultivated either as useful cont act or restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 14 restricted possible agent definitions of levels of espionage threat including from sigint and extremists are at annex c sabotage 0108 sabotage is defined as an act falling short of military operation or an omission intended to cause physical damage in order to assist hostile foreign power or to further subversive political aim the following should be noted although sabotage on major scale is likely only in the period immediately before or after the outbreak of war it can be used as mea ns of advancing political causes b in peacetime agents of foreign intelligence services may select targets for future attack by trained experienced saboteurs c saboteurs may be capable of using highly sophisticated methods and their aim will be to disrupt essential communications damage vital milit ary installations impede industrial production and lower national morale d in acts of terrorism sabotage may be used for widely differing purposes ranging from attacking unimportant targets with the object of attracting publicity to the terrorists cause to damaging important installations as part of major terrorist campaign subversion 0109 subversion is defined as action designed to weaken the military economic or political strength of nation by undermining the morale loyalty or reliability of its citizens the threat from subversion stems not only from foreign intelligence services but also from members of organizations such as those based on anarchism religious fanaticism and extreme left and right wing ideologies orga nizations with these ideologies may try to acquire protectively marked information not necessarily to give to potential enemy but to use it in way that would bring the government in general into disrepute terrorism 0110 terrorism is defined as the unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence against individuals or property in an attempt to coerce or intimi date governments or societies to achieve political religious or ideological objectives it represents worldwide threat and is characterized by sudden and violent attacks terrorist methods include murder kidnapping hostagetaking hijacking of air sea road and rail transport and attacks on people buildings aircraft and vehicles by restricted principles of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 15 restricted small arms mortars bombs and mines definitions of terrorist threat levels are at annex d see also chapter 7 non traditional threats posed by other individuals or organizations 0111 government assets are under threat from variety of sources beyond those traditionally regarded as hostile or otherwise of significance in t erms of national security the responsibility for providing advice to counter nontraditional threats will not always lie with the security staff and may often be provided by the appropriate service mod or civil police agency the main threats of t his type are posed by investigative journalists pressure groups investigation agencies crimina l elements disaffected staff dishonest staff and computer hackers the types of threat from these sources can be categorized in six broad groups confidentiality compromise of politically sensitive information this threat is presented by 1 pressure groups and investigative journalists attempting to obtain sensitive information 2 unauthorized disclosure of official information leaks b exploitation of sensitive information debt collection agencies and investigation agencies are known to attempt to obtain personal information held in confidence by government investigative journalists have exploited personal tax information they also target commercial and financial information as do criminal elements seeking financial advantage c theft burglary and fraud there is growing threat of theft particularly of it equipment arms ammunition and explosives are always at particular risk theft may occur through burglary or the actions of dishonest staff establishments responsible for the collection or disbur sement of public funds are prone to fraud and there is an increasing threat of fraud through the manipulation of it systems d corruption destruction or unauthorized access to computer data the integrity of data held on computer systems is under threat mainly from disaffected staff existing levels of programming expertise the ready availability of malicious software eg viruses and the ease with which the can be deliberately or accidentally introduced combine to create substantial threat it is apparent that some staff misguidedly interfere with or compromise systems there is also level of threat of damage result ing from restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 16 restricted the actions of hackers either those with legitimate access t systems or those without such access pressure groups pressure groups for such causes as animal rights nuclear disarmament and the environment will sometimes carry out demonstrations against mod policy and activities although often confined to peaceful demonstrations extremist elements can cause violent attacks on individuals and property which can pose threat as significant as terrorism f criminal damage employees dependants visitors or intruders can carry out criminal damage g natural disaster natural disasters are risks to the integrity or availability of facilities buildings or equipment etc caused by such i ncidents as fire flooding subsidence or lightning strike components of security 0112 there are two different and interdependent parts of security security intelligence the collection of information and production of intelligence concerning the security threat plans to counter the activities of foreign intelligence services or subversive organizations and individuals must be based on accurate and timely intelligence concerning the identity capabilities and intentions of the hostile elements this intelligence is know n as security intelligence it is derived from studying attempts to break through security controls combined with knowledge gained from penetrating hostile organizations one means of obtaining security intelligence is the investigation of breaches of security although security intelligence is matter which is principally the concern of security staffs and security unit s all personnel in the mod whether service or civilian contribute to it by the prompt reporting of suspicious activity b protective security consists of 1 laws orders and instructions these measures range from the official secrets acts to establishment security standing orders 2 physical measures physical measures are the physical obstacles which protect specific security interests these range from perimeter defences such as fences and lighting to security containers restricted principles of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 17 restricted 3 personnel security measures the aim of personnel security measures is to ensure that only reliable and trustworthy persons have access to protected information 4 security education and training the aim of security education is to ensure that all who work for the mod irrespective of access understand both the threat and their general responsibilities for countering it the aim of security training is to ensure that individuals who have specific security responsibilities as part of their normal employment are properly trained in their security duties security education and training is the responsibility of commanders and hoe at all levels 5 security procedures security procedures include document handling control of access checks and audits risk 0113 risk can be defined as future uncertain event and is measured in terms of likelihood and impact amount of security measures can ever totally eliminate risk the vulnerability of assets to threats must be reduced so that the likelihood of compromise or loss is reduced to an acceptable level over protection leads to waste of resources and under protection leads to an unwarranted risk security measures selected must be balanced and cost effective in their application fu rther details are in chapter 3 the precepts of security 0114 the main precepts of security are command responsibility whilst every individual who works for the mod has personal responsibility to promote and maintain security at all times hoe are responsible for security within their establishments and commandersheads of department have overall responsibility for security within their formations or departments b need to know knowledge of protected matters must be limited strictly to those who are security cleared to the appropriate level nd who need such knowledge in order to carry out their official duties c need to hold protectively

required to be prote cted to specific level of protection the protective markings therefore provide means of establishing the value of and hence the level of protection to be afforded to particular assets these levels of protection are detailed below top secret information and other assets should be held processed transmitted or transported and destroyed under conditions which ensure that only those who can be trusted with them and have been authorized gain access to them that actual or attempted compromises will be detected and those responsible will be identified secret information and other assets should be held processed transmitted or transported and destroyed under conditions which make it highly unlikely that anyone without authorized access will by chance or design gain access to them t hat compromise will go undetected or that those responsible will remain unidentified confidential information and other assets should be held processed transmitted or transported and

of both the establishments asset and guarding risk impact level producing combined value eg b2p1 individual establishments and lodger units within large si should be assessed according to their individual assets and vulnerabilities for example the perimeter and service living accommodation on large site may be designated p1 for threat to life reasons and include sensitive unit that requires category a2 rating this does not mean that each and every establishment withi n the site need be accorded the same category a2 rating regardless of the activit ies conducted within its own discrete area where there is specific area within an establishment that requires higher category eg an operations or communicati ons centre it may be categorised separately from the remainder of the establishment which may then be placed in lower category for inspection purposes inspection periodicity 6 threats to defence establishments vary widely as do their vulnerabili ties although every

the security standards set out at annex to chapter 1 in order to achieve common and acceptable standard of protection throughout the government service at each level of the protective marking system certain baseline measures are mandatory the following baseline measures are to be applied when confidentiality is at stake universal baseline measures these are the general preventative measures that form normal part of good management practice eg implementing relevant health and safety legislation list of universal baseline measures is at annex c b control and carriage baseline measures t h mandatory standards for the control and carriage of protectively marked assets are given throughout chapter 4 and at annex c to chapter 4 as these baseline measures are set for low threat it may be necessary to add additional measures if the threat is higher than low c physical security baseline measures the mandatory standards for the physical protection of assets are arrived at by following the matrix of options and menu of measures at annexes and b to section 1 of chapter 5 d countereavesdropping baseline measures t h mandatory standards for protection against eavesdropping are covered in chapter 27 of volume 3 2 stage 2 having noted the relevant baseline measures and standards of security review existing security countermeasures and decide if they are excessive adequate or inadequate in relation to the threat if excessive consider whether funding or resources can be saved by reducing them sensibly while still maintaining the desired level of security if wholly adequate do more if inadequate then the assets are at an unacceptable degree of risk decision is required on what to do to reduce the risk to an acceptable level this may be achieved by either introducing suitable countermeasures to bring the level of security up to the baselines or by reducing the risk in some other way such as transferring the most valuable assets to site w ith higher degree of security restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 38 restricted f step 6 review existing security counter measures for integrity and availability and implement necessary changes to achieve mandatory standards 1 stage 1 for all assets where integrity or availability are concern it is necessary to consider how to achieve the standards of security set out at annex to chapter 1 as they can be related to the value of the asset in order to achieve common and acceptable level of protection the following standards are mandatory universal baseline measures the universal baseline measures at annex c are to be applied b arms ammunition and explosives the mandatory requirements for the protection of arms ammunition and explosives given in chapter 5 are to be applied c nuclear assets the mandatory requirements for the protection of nuclear assets given in the defence manual of security volume 4 are to be applied d dangerous drugs toxic substances and public funds those mandatory security requirements for the protection dangerous drugs toxic substances and public funds that form part of current mod or singleservice instructions are to be applied 2 stage 2 having noted the relevant baseline and mandatory levels and standards of security review existing security counter measures in the manner described at 0303e2 above and take action accordingly in some cases the measures designed to protect confidentiality may provide or contribute to protection for integrity and availability however usually integrity and availability can best be safeguarded by making suitable contingency plans eg by making regular backup copies of information vulnerable to loss of availability where an asset has clear monetary value cost benefit analysis techniques will help to decide how much it is worth spending to protect it g step 7 total security review conduct general review of countermeasures against threats and vulnerabilities to ensure that the overall result meets mandatory standards is cost effective and that the hoe is prepared to accept any remaining residual risk also ensure that the key facts restricted risk management jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 39

protection of compartmented information codewords and nicknames 1 definitions codeword is single word that is always expressed in capital letters and is used to provide security cover for reference to particular protected matter nickname is name made up of two words selected by the originator and used for convenience for reference to any matter where security protection is not required 2 it is important to understand the difference between codewords which provide security cover and nicknames which do not because confusion in the use of these terms could lead to breaches of security the adoption of local or unofficial terms or procedures eg code names is forbidden 3 use of codewords codewords are to be used solely for security purposes and only registered codewords may be used the primary purpose of codewords is to conceal intentions but they may also be used to limit the knowledge of particular matters they may be used as names for protected plans projects equipments etc b to describe or initiate phases of operations c to initiate action for emergency or contingency plans d to provide short reference to protected matter knowledge of which must be restricted to limited circle of people to identify protected documents with limited circulation ie subject to special handling procedures 4 control and allotment of codewords all codewords are to be taken from the united kingdom codeword index maintained by the defence crisis management centre dcmc the dcmc makes block allocations of codewords to lead commands service establishments are to apply for codewords or information about codewords to command hqs blocks of codewords not yet taken into use should be treated as confidential documents to avoid any risk of compromise in their subsequent use central staffs branches should apply for codewords or information about codewords direct to dcmc dpa and dlo staff should apply to restricted control and carriage of protected documents jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 4k1 restricted their principal security adviser in the event of codeword being required out of normal working hours application may be made to the chief of the defence staffs duty officer 5 notification of use when codeword is taken into use its meaning with the protective marking for both the codeword itself and its meaning must be not ified by the user to the issuing authority through normal channels any changes must be notifi ed as they occur codewords taken into use but subsequently cancelled may not be reused without authority from the issuing authority 6 procedure for bringing codewords into use the user of codeword is responsible for allotting meaning to it with protective markings for both the codeword itself and its meaning the user should ensure in conjunction with the issuing authority that within the limitations of the available registered words the codeword c hosen is suitable for the matter to which it is to refer namely it should be neither frivolous nor likely to invest the matter with an undesirable significance b unrelated to the meaning eg iceberg is unsuitable for cold weather operations c unrelated to other words of series eg series of bird names is unsuitable for say the various phases of an operation 7 the meaning the meaning given to codeword is to be specific and self explanatory but should not reveal more than is necessary 8 protective marking the purpose of codeword is to conceal the meaning attached to it and as long as this concealment is complete there is normally r eason for the codeword itself as opposed to its meaning to attract protective marking an unclassified codeword may be used in an unclassified letter or in telephone conversation in clear to convey protected meaning eg contingency plans may have high protective marking but the order to implement them might be given by signalling codeword in clear or by voice over radio net or by telephone occasionally there may be matter of such secrecy that knowledge of its existence must be limite d to few people in these circumstances wide knowledge of the codeword might excite unwanted curiosity when this is the case the codeword itself should be given protective marking although not necessarily as high as its meaning when codeword marking is applied the asset or event must attract protective marking of restricted as minimum 9 security of codewords in use users must ensure that protective markings of codewords and their meanings are progressively downgraded as the need for secrecy of plans projects or operations diminishes restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 4k2 restricted b codeword together with its meaning must never feature in any electronic transmission such as signal telegram telex fax or telephone conversation although they may appear in the same document provided the document is correctly protectively marked c codewords in frequent use on wide distribution are changed from time to time as protection against possible compromise 10 exercises if for real security reasons codewords as opposed to nicknames are required for exercises they should be issued by commands from the list of those allotted by the dcmc care should be taken in defining the meanings of codewords used on exercises particularly if there is likelihood that it may become necessary later to release codewords and their meanings to the press codeword used for an exercise must always be prefixed by the word exercise for example exercise matador nicknames only are required for restricted exercises 11 cancellation of codewords users are responsible for notifying the issuing authority through normal channels of the cancellation and surrender of codeword when its purpose has been completed or it has been replaced after compromise this notification should include the protective marking retained by the meaning surrendered codewords must in circumstances be taken into use again without specific reissue by the issuing authority 12 compromise of codewords if codeword is compromised the appropriate principal secuurity adviser must be informed immediately to minimize ny risk of compromising new codeword should not be referred to in the same document as the one it is replacing when change of codeword becomes necessary all concerned must be informed that the original has been cancelled and will be replaced by new codeword to be contained in later communication used codeword will not be reallocated for at least 3 years or if the branch concerned so requests for period up to maximum of 5 years after cancellation it will be reallocated only if there is suitable codeword available and if the controller is satisfied that its further use wil l not cause misunderstanding the second communication should be given the same protective marking as the meaning of the codeword and should merely refer to the first communication and state codeword is 13 use of codewords for equipment after declassification of the meaning codeword allotted to an equipment may be continued in use if appropriate as name for the equipment after it has been declassified 14 handling of codewords codewords are to be handled as confidential until they are taken into use and allotted new protective marking by the user 15 use of nicknames the use of nicknames is limited to restricted and unclassified matters examples of which are restricted control and carriage of protected documents jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 4k3 restricted operations enemy locations and target indication b training names for exercises c administration titles for logistic projects routes for movement geographical locations and place names 16 selection notification and cancellation of nicknames the user of nickname is responsible for its selection notification use and cancellation as follows it must consist of two words chosen at random which must be distinct and which cannot be run together into single word eg great coat or pig skin are not to be used this is to avoid confusion with codewords b notification is to be limited to those concerned with the matter to which the nickname refers c nicknames do not need to be reported

information and equipment against attempts to acquire them illicitly by surreptitious attack or theft defence in depth 05102 physical measures represent only one aspect of protective security and they need to be supported by sound personnel document handling communications and computer security sensible management of security risks involves finding the most effective and cost effective ways of countering the given threats by combination of measures from each of these areas good physical protection preferably built into any site or building from the beginning is of fundamental importance risk manage ment and mini mum baseline objectives 05103 risk management offers high degree of flexibility in providing the level s of protection required to safeguard protectively marked assets to ensure that there is some degree of consistency and mutual assurance about the way one establishments assets are handled by another certain minimum baseline objectives apply to all areas of protective security they are intended to provide acceptable security at all leve ls of protection where the threat is assessed as low further information on risk management can be found in chapter 3 the minimum baseline measures matrix mbmm meeting baseline objectives 05104 the matrix and menu of minimum baseline measures for physical security at annexes and b provide range of options which meet the baseline objectives they are designed to help the management of security risks by offering mean s for the identification and selection of the most suitable and costeffective physical security measures to safeguard protectively marked material against attem pts to acquire them illicitly by surreptitious attack or theft although many of the measures suggested will be helpful in counterterrorist context and suitable counterterrorist measures already in place may be taken into account in meeting the baseline measures the weighting given to the measures in the matrix is not primarily intended to meet terrorist threats the matrix and menu are intended as guide and particular circumstances may requi re different solutions the achievement of minimum score cannot be taken to be substitute for sound assessment of security measures based on the importance of the assets the conditions and layout of the site the level of the threat and protection required local circumstances may dictate that despite an adequate score enhanc ed restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 restricted 512measures or alternative combinations of measures should be considered see also 05009 threat

higher than low esyos are to keep themselves regularly uptodate on the nature and levels of threat to their asse ts by consulting their appropriate psya and local service and civil police authoritie s and are to decide for themselves on the proper response to increased levels of threat in the light of local circumstances about the matrix 05106 the minimum baseline measures are set as numerical values within matri x which correspond to the level of protectively marked material and to the level of the threat the matrix as shown at annex is supported by menu of physical security measures annex b from which measures can be selected so that the sum total of the value of the individual measures equals or exceeds the required numerical value of th appropriate minimum baseline measures it is fundamental principle that points are only valid when correct security procedures and practices accompany the selecte d measure numerical values 05107 the numerical value of the baseline measures required for each level of the protective marking system is made up from different sections of the menu of measures 2 from mandatory sections of the menu of measures and the remainder from any of the sections this system of mandatory and additional measures is to ensure t hat sensible balance of measures is achieved and allows hoes flexibility in the m easures they apply to reach the baseline position taking into account the security facilities equipme nt and manpower at their disposal how the matrix is used 05108 the matrix is used by selecting the appropriate level of protectively mar ked material and then reading off the scores to be achieved against the manda tory and additional sections of the menu of measures having identified the points score required the user should then turn to the menu of measures minimum baseline measures matrix points check sheet for use by esyos is at annex c guide to th use of the minimum baseline measures matrix is at annex d and sample of how to complete the full documentation is at appendix 1 to annex d menu of measures sections 05109 the menu of measures is divided into 6 sections each dealing with particular aspect of security or layer of

physical security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 restricted 513weighting of measures 05110 some measures are weighted in that their points score multiplies with t hat of another measure eg containers and locks whilst others are added eg fences perimeter intruder detection systems lighting and cctv the value of zero is used as multiplier where fence has control of entry at its entryexit points wher control of entry is provided the multiplier of one will validate the points awarded to the fence selection of measures 05111 in deciding what measures to select the user is to include existing sec urity measures and then fill in the score obtained the results can then be compared wi th the requirements of the matrix from the comparison it will be apparent whether the measures are excessive adequate or need supplementing additional measures 05112 if additional measures are required establishments are to decide which measures to select in the light of the actual threats faced by them if there is threat from forcible attack for instance the strength of container may be higher factor than the class of lock conversely if the threat is from surreptitious attack high class lock may be more important factor than the strength of the container used in this wa with imagination and common sense the menu will help esyos to find the meas ures most appropriate to their particular situation

number pin 3 is used in conjunction with an access barrier that prevents pass back and ensures one transaction one entry b class 3 system class 3 entry control system is an electronic aacs which 1 operates as card and pin 2 entry is controlled by suitable barrier that may require direct supervision by guard c class 2 system class 2 entry control system is one involving 1 security guards custodians or receptionist 2 involves the use of photograph or unique design pass entry system other identification documents such as defence identity cards are accepted for entry purposes d class 1

holders 05120 spare restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 restricted 518 the control of visitors 05121 the control of visitors within protected area where sensitive material is held or worked on or where special access control are exercised will depend on the level of security clearance of the visitor and on any special control requirements that the establishment may impose on nonstaff personnel the type of control exercised over visitors is described below escorted visitors visitors who are required to be escorted within protected area are accompanied at all times by an appointed escort or by personnel they are visiting if they need to visit number of different departments or other members of staff they are to be formally handed over from one escort to the next with if required the visitors pass being annotated accordingly b passbadge visitors are allowed unescorted entry to protected area or parts of it they are required to wear badgepass that identifies them as visitor and not as member of staff it should be noted that visitor badging system is only effective if all staff are also required to we ar pass note points for escorted visitors within the mbmm can only be scored where all visitors including mod employees to an establishment are escorted matrix section 5 guards and alarm systems guards 05122 the employment of guards to protect buildings or sites provides valuable deterrent to criminals and to those who might plan covert attack the guards duties and the need and frequency of patrols will be decided by considering the leve l of threat and security systems or equipment that might be in place more detailed instructions on the employment of guards and patrols are c ontained in section viii to this chapter the types of guarding are described below frequent internal patrols patrol that operates inside building at random intervals not exceeding 2 hours is frequent patrol it is to follow different route on each patrol so that the time and place of the guards visit cannot be predicted guards are to have specific tasks to perform on the patrol such as checking locked doors and security furniture and checking external doors and windows to see that they are properly secured b infrequent internal patrols internal random patrols at intervals not exceeding 6 hours allows for 2 or 3 patrols during the night and periodic security checks during weekend or holiday period the first patrol is to normally take place soon after cease work and is to be concerned with checking that the site or building is properly secure patrol routes are to be varied so that the timing and location of the guard cannot be predicted restricted physical security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 restricted 519 c external patrols patrols that are limited to the external areas of site or building and which are carried out by guards who do not normally have access to the buildings are external patrols only the frequency of external patrolling will be dependent upon the particular requirements of the establishment external patrols can be vehicle mounted or on foot and patrol the perimeter inside or outside and checking buildings that may be covered by an internal alarm system the mobile patrol will also act as an immediate response force d resident or onsite guards guards that are employed to man an incident control room or guard postguardroom but are not required to patrol are classed as resident or site guards they can be required to survey the protected area or parts of it either visually or by using cctv surveillanc equipment responding to other building alarm or monitoring systems can also be included in their duties visiting guards guards who visit site during the night and at weekends and carry out rudimentary perimeter checks are classed as vi siting guards such types of guard include those that may not normally be allowed to enter the site or building visited but respond by calling out the key holder in the event of suspected intrusion note there are further 2 types of guarding used in the security of equipment matrix these are described at 051818 intruder detection systems ids 05123 ids are used inside buildings in place of or to assist site guards to be effective an ids will have response force that will react in the event of an alarm condition alarm systems have been graded according to the level of security they offer class 4 system offering the highest level of security and class 1 the lowest more detailed information regarding ids is contained at section vii to thi s chapter the classes of ids system are described below class 4 systems class 4 ids is one which 1 is intended for use in applications where security takes precedence over all other factors 2 offers level of protection where the intruder has to plan the intrusion in detail and have full range of equipment capable of substitution of vital system components 3 is supplemented with comprehensive physical security measures and security procedures b class 3 systems class 3 alarm system is one which 1 is used in premises where high value assets are held restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 restricted 51102 includes appropriate physical security protection 3 offers protection from intruders who are conversant with intruder detection systems and have available comprehensive range of tools and portable electronic equipment c class 2 systems class 2 alarm system is one which 1 is used in premises where the security risks of sophisticated attack are not high 2 intruders are expected to have limited knowledge of alarm systems and have available only basic tools and portable instruments d class 1 systems class 1 alarm system is one which 1 is used in low risk premises where potential intruders have little knowledge of alarm systems and limited range of readily available tools 2 does not normally have an appointed response force and relies on public response to local alarm sounder or strobe lights matrix section 6 outer perimeter the peri meter 05124 perimeter fence forms useful barrier and identifies the boundary of protected or restricted area the level of protection offered by fence depends on its height construction the material used and any additional security features used to increase its performance or effectiveness such as topping pids lighting or cctv the type of fence used on the perimeter of site should reflect the type of threat ie terrorist criminal saboteur vandals fences are graded accordi ng to the level of protection they offer class 4 offering the highest security and class 1 the lowest instructions for external perimeter security measures are t section iii cctv at section vi and security lighting at section iii to this chapter t he types of fence attracting particular class are shown at annex the classes of fence are described below class 4 fence class 4 fence is high security barrier which 1 is designed to offer the maximum deterrent and delay to skilled and determined intruder who is well equipped and resourced 2 is designed and constructed to offer high degree of resistance to climbing or breaching attack 3 is normally supported by other perimeter security systems b class 3 fence class 3 fence is an intermediate security barrier which restricted physical security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 restricted 51111 is designed to deter and delay resourceful attacker who has access to limited range of hand tools 2 offers resistance to attempts at climbing and breaching c class 2 fence class 2 fence is an antiintruder fence which offers degree of resistance to climbing and breaching by an opportunist intruder not having particular skills and using material and breaching items that are readily to hand d class 1 fence class 1 fence is one which 1 is designed with particular security requirements 2 is only intended to mark boundary and to offer minimum of deterrence or resistance to anyone other than determined intruder 3 any type of construction material or hedging is used entry and exit searches 05125 establishments may undertake entry searches as condition of entry in particularly sensitive areas entry searching is to be designed to gua rd against the possibility of unauthorised electronic recording and transmitting equipment or copying equipment such as cameras or scanners being brought into the establishment such searches also guard against the possibility of an explosive device being carried into the establishment exit searches can only be undertaken in accordance with hoes statutory powers contracts of employment or the law relat ing to search police and criminal evidence act however such searche s can act as deterrent to the unauthorized removal of protectively marked or otherwise valuable assets from the establishment gates 05126 gates are to be constructed to the same security standard as the fenc and some form of entry control must be in place otherwise the security of the fence will be negated perimeter intruder detection syste ms pids 05127 pids may be used on perimeters to enhance the level of security offered by the fence pids may be installed as covert devices although this is usually for aesthetic reasons or overtly to act as deterrent pids are inherently prone to false alarm and should therefore normally only be used with an alarm verification system such as cctv closed c ircuit television cctv 05128 cctv is useful aid to security guards in covering large sites or perimeters the effectiveness of such system however will depend on the selection of s uitable equipment and its installation detailed professional advice via psyas is to be sought restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 restricted 5112security lighting 05129 security lighting can offer high degree of deterrence to potential intr uder in addition to providing the illumination necessary for effective surveillance either directly by the guards or indirectly through cctv system the standard of lighting is to meet the minimum requirement and its installation be appropriate to the site conditions 05130 more information on the

using the matrix read off the total points required to protect the particular assets at the current threat level and write the figure on the points checksheet eg 14 for secret at low low is the standard threat level unless otherwise directed from d def sy by psyas b read off the mandatory points required for the sections and write the figures on the points checksheet eg 8 for sections 1

containers detailed at 05114 and shown by type at annex determine the class of container that the protected assets are held in and write the loading figure in the subscore column ss1 eg 5x 2 security cabinet would give sub score of 3 likewise the lock fitted to the cabinet should be allocated loading insert at ss2 in accordance wit h the standards at 05115 and shown by type at annex eg mersey lock will give score of 3 the section 1 score is achieved by multiplying the scores of the container and lock restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 restricted 51d26 section 2 room determine the class of the room that the asset is held in using the standards at 05116 and shown by type at annex and insert the loading figure in the subscore column ss3 for example an unlocked room would attract 0 points similarly ascertain the loading for the type of lock fitted to the room using the standards at 05115 and shown by type at annex and insert at ss4 for example chubb mortice lock would attract 1 point the section score is achieved by multiplying the scores for the room and the lock notes 1 establishments are to follow the spirit of the baseline measures matrix at all times therefore heads of establishments are not to allow nonsensical situations to arise such as fitting class 4 lock to standard office door with glass panes in order to score more points on the matrix which in turn would allow other normal security precautions to be dispensed with 7 section 3 building using the standards at 05118 determine the class of the building its strength and insert the loading score in the section sc ore column s3 for example modern building of precast panels can attract 3 points 8 section 4 control of entry to building area or site determine the class of the control of entry to the building area or site using the standards at 05119 and insert in the subscore column ss6 decide the loading for the visitor control and insert in the subscore column ss7 the section 4 score is achieved by adding the two scores together example building where entry is allowed by the issue of keys to authorized personnel will attract 1 point if the visitor control system is one where they are required to wear pass identifying them from permanent staff further point would be gained the total for the section would be 2 points 9 section 5 guards and intruder detection systems ids the type of patrols and guarding procedures are described at 05122 determine the type of patrolsguarding practices in the building are and site and insert the loading scores in the subscore column ss8 the points scores for guards are divided into 3 areas internal patrols external patrols and other residentsite guarding points can be achieved for an establishment that has both internal and external patrols any additional residentsite guard will not attract any further points where sc ore has been achieved for internal or external patrols example particular building housing the protected asset may be the subject of infrequent internal patrols gaining loading score of 4 and be on an establishment that has external patrols around the site gaining score of 3 the establishment may also have site guard at the incident room or guardroom the latter would only attract points if there were internal or external patrols hence the total subscore ss8 in this example would be 7 points restricted physical security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 restricted 51d3 b determine the subscore for the type of ids on the establishment area andor site using the standards at 05123 and shown by type at annex and insert at ss9 the section 5 score is obtained by adding the scores for guards and ids and inserting at s5 10 perimeter decide what class the establishment perimeter is using the standards at paras 05124 and shown by type at annex and insert the loading into the subscore ss10 eg an approved 24m high chainlink fence with security topping would merit 2 points if the establishment has entry control insert 1 point at ss11 if it does not then points are allotted similarly insert the l oading figures for the yesno measures for searches ss12 perimeter intruder detection systems pids at ss13 cctv ss14 and lighting ss15 the total score s6 for perimeter measures is obtained by multiplying the loading scores of the fence and entry control and then adding this figure to the total of the rest of the subscores example an establishment has class 2 fence 2 points with entry control 1 point entryexit searches are carried out by guards 1 point but the establishment does not have any pids 0 points it does not have any cctv 0 points or security lighting to the appropriate standards 0 points the total points for section 6 would be as follows fence x entry control total of other subscores 2 x 1 2 1 3 note it is important to note that points for cctv and lighting can only be obtained if the equipment reaches the appropriate approved standards completing the points checksheet and further action 11 completion of the checksheet after completing the baseline measures menu complete the points checksheet by inserting the total points achieved in addition insert the points obtained in the mandatory sections 12 action to be taken if points required baseline is exceeded if all of these figures exceed the points required then the protected asset has adequate security nd further action is required however there may be scope for the esyo in consultation with the head of establishment to reduce some security meas ures if desired to the baseline position and this type of review is to be actively encouraged so long as expenditure is not wasted in the pursuit of lower standards when those in force are costeffective already any agreed action could be writ ten in the remarks column of the checksheet 13 action to be taken if the points required baseline is not reached if the points achieved figures have failed to reach the points required for either the total or mandatory section scores then the esyo in consultation with the hoe must restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 restricted 51d4reexamine the security measures implemented on the establishment and choose higher security measures accordingly to meet the baseline position 14 flexibility of the matrix the advantage of the baseline measures matrix is that it allows establishments the flexibility to choose their own securit measures at given threat level as long as the baseline measure is reached and certain manda tory measures are met it also takes into account any enhanced security measures that the establishmentt may have invested in such as aacs cctv or security lighting thereby perhaps allowing the costs to be reduced in other areas of security when to complete matrix 15 general the matrix is primarily intended to be used to assure the confidentiality of protectively marked assets where similar protected assets are held in particular type of building throughout the establishment only one menu may be required to be completed for each level of protective marking eg in an establishment hq building that houses quantity of all 4 types of protectively marked material it may only be appropriate to complete matrix for each type restricted confidential secret and top secret at the current threat level there may be requirement to complete matrix for each container in every building as the baseline may be able to be achieved for particula r building with menu for each type of protectively marked material 16 standard loading on the matrix much of the loading on the matrix menu of measures will be the same for an establishment for each menu completed for example the perimeter fence guardingpatrols posture entry control etc may be standard for all menus on the establishment at given threat level 17 change in threat level if the threat changes the esyo should consult the completed points checksheet and menu of measures to see if the measures in force are still adequate or in the case of decrease in threat whether certain mea sures can be changed or dispensed with by trying differing options within the menu for given protected asset the esyo should be able to obtain any new baseline position example the threat increases from low l to moderate m and the number of points required to house top secret protectively marked material increases from 18 to 20 assuming that particular establishment has the minimum 18 points and meets the mandatory points which would not change for such an increase in threat it could meet the new baseline position by introducing frequent internal patrols to the existing external patrols thereby gaining the 2 extra points required alternatively it could choose to house all of its top secret assets in higher class container which when multiplied with the value of the lock would meet the new baselinerestricted physical security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2

proximity of public rights of way and neighbouring buildings c the proposed uses of the facility d access arrangements for emergency services site layout security perimeter 05213 facilities used for work on protectively marked material are to have defined perimeter physical barrier such as security fence wall or hedge or psychological barrier designed to make any intruder feel vulnerable and exposed for details of perimeter security measures see section iii open space 05214 the measures that apply for open spaces within the site layout are as follows open space between any outer security perimeter and the buildings it surrounds is to be planned so as to help patrolling but hinder overlooking and deprive intruders of cover b for similar reasons there is to be open space between buildings c the foliage of tall trees should be kept well clear of the ground and of any fence account is also to be taken of shadows they may cast car parks and road system 05215 the road system and car parks inside the perimeter are to be designed to reduce the need for or eliminate the possibility of parking vehicles ne ar living or working accommodation to allow continuous use during periods of enhanced terrorist threat where possible car parks are to be sited at least 25m from such buildings in addition consideration if possible and appropriate should be given to constructing an earth

confined space must be taken into account and compensatory measures taken vehicle waiting area 05216 an area can be provided outside the main site entrance for vehicles waiting to enter traffic congestion can distract the guards however as with car parks due consideration is to be given to the potential terrorist threat in these ci rcumstances for service establishments waiting areas are normally to be loca ted outside the establishment close to the point of entry consideration should be given to landscaping these areas to minimise the effects of the blast ancillary facilities 05217 ancillary facilities are to be sited away from or at worst be on the peri phery of areas used for protected work public access routes eg for maintenance work for the delivery of supplies or removal of refuse are not as far as possible to pass through areas used for work on protected material buildings with public access 05218 buildings with public access should be outside the security perimeter if such buildings have to be inside they are to where feasible form part of the security perimeter access through them to the rest of the site is to be controlled number of entrances 05219 the number of entrances to building or perimeter is to be kept to minimum see also section iii to this chapter in the case of stablishments in urban areas any entrance directly off busy street is to be avoided there are to be sepa rate entrances for pedestrians and vehicles separate goods entrance should be arranged so that vehicles can be supervised while loading and unloading lighting at entrances 05220 adequate lighting is to be provided at entrances so that vehicles and people and their passes are clearly visible to the guards the types of lighting are detailed in section iii to this chapter guard accommodation 05221 accommodation for guards is to give an unobstructed view of surrounding areas the accommodation is to be equipped with domestic facilities and any outdoor guardpoint is to be weather proof see section v iii to this chapter restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 528 restricted working and living accommodation 05222 working and living accommodation is to be sited well back from the perimeter and where possible at least 25 metres from car park or road armouries and ammunition stores 05223 armouries and ammunition stores are to conform to the

accommodation to staff working on protectively marked material ground floor the use of the ground floor is wherever possible to be avoided for work on secret or top secret material as upper floors are less vulnerable to intrusion overhearing and overlooking b communications and computers communications centres large computer installations and equipment requiring tempest protection is wherever possible to be located near at or below ground level the requirements for the siting of communication and computer equipment should include the avoidance of water pipes and other sources of flooding c

overseas arrangements are to be made to segregate locally employed staff without security clearance from areas in which protectively marked material is used secure zones general 05227 when different degrees of security protection are required in various parts of the building the more sensitive areas are to be concentrated into secure zone or zones these are parts of building to which entry is separately controlled secure zones are not to be confused with secure rooms see section xi of this chapter reason for secure zones 05228 secure zone is established for one of the following reasons to concentrate work on protected material in one area of building that does not itself have access control b to give additional protection to an area where particularly sensitive work takes place in building which already has secure perimeter and to which entry is controlled building alterations are only required in order to provide access control to secure zone strengthened walls and doors may not be required but security furniture or secure room of an approved standard may be required for the custody of higher levels of protected material within the secure zone inner compartments 05229 where an entire building or group of buildings is made into secure zone series of inner compartments may be created with entry to each controlled separately in one of the following ways by guards b by

are to be escorted at all times g meetings in which protectively marked information is to be discussed should not normally be held in open plan offices but be held in secure conference facilities where practicable sensitive special projects 05236 groups dealing with special projects of sensitive nature are to be segregated from those groups which do not need to know however segregation should only take place where the amount and sensitivity of material justifies separate working areas these separate secure areas are to be subject to access control measures where practicable such areas are to be in the less accessi ble parts of floor or building ie located away from general access doors or transit corridors the type of access control is to depend on group size and any specific local requirements desk and seating arrangements 05237 desk and seating arrangements are to be such as to ensure that access to protectively marked material by others without need to know is difficult this

counter terrorist physical security measures for all mod owned or occupied buildings introduction 1 this annex details the minimum counterterrorist physical security measures which are to be applied to all mod owned or occupied buildings 2 the physical security measures adapted for the mod are based on cabinet office guidelines on robustness measures for buildings the purpose of these measures is to limit damage to the building fabric and injury to the occupants whatever the level of threat given the varying function and location of mod buildings physical security measures should be applied on the basis of vulnerability of the site 3 it is the responsibility of psyas to ensure that the measures applied are appropriate accordingly esyos andor psyas in consultation with scg tlb works advisers and the project sponsor or property manager are to assess the vulnerability of buildings as either high moderate or low taking into account the following location ie whether or not the building is within secure perimeter b perimeter security and access by the public c the building aspect in relation to the perimeter d the protection afforded by other buildings other features andor landscaping whether or not the building is normally occupied f building usage eg housing departments involved in the fight against terrorism 4 when determining building vulnerability due account should be taken of the following general rules together with the considerations at subparas 3b to f above buildings that are not located within secure perimeter or are located within 100 metres of secure perimeter will be high unless other factors afford protection from bombsmortars restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 52g2 restricted b buildings that are normally occupied by personnel are located beyond 100 metres within secure perimeter will be moderate unless other factors afford protection from bombsmortars c buildings that are not normally occupied by personnel will be low 5 the physical security measures fall into two distinct categories standard measures those measures that cannot be applied or removed quickly in line with changing threat there are two sections of standard measures those for new construction and those for existing construction and b enhanced measures those measures which can be applied or removed as the threat changes it is important to carry out security survey to establish the appropriate enhanced measures which are to be included in any contingency plan standard measures 6 these measures are to be applied to all new mod buildings being constructed leased for mod use or refurbished when applying these measures psyas should exercise common sense and give consideration to omitting certain standards in the case of buildings deep within the perimeter or with low occupancy domestic facilities such as housing and sporting facilities such as squash courts sm1 construction standard 1 the building should be of framed construction using either structural steel or in situ reinforced concrete 2 the structural frames should be designed to the degree of robustness required by the relevant british standards whatever the number of storeys ie all buildings less than 5 storeys high should be designed as 5 storey building for robustness only 3 if structural steelwork is used the beamcolumn connections are to be designed to carry load reversals and where possible the facade columns and beams should be concrete encased 4 the floors and roof slabs should be constructed with in situ reinforced concrete or with precast concrete slabs with structural topping suitably tied into the structural frame 5 cladding should be either precast concrete panels or solid masonry if precast systems are used the fixings of the panel back to the structure are to be robust easily accessible and repairable further the cladding system should be designed so that each panel may be removed without affecting the surrounding panels restricted physical security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 52g3 restricted b sm2 bomb shelter area bsa accommodation 1 high vulnerability bsa accommodation should be provided and must be sufficient for the maximum number of people likely to be occupying the building bsa provision may be achieved by careful planning of cores constructed in reinforced concrete or by robust basement construction 2 moderate vulnerability bsa accommodation may be provided for people likely to be vulnerable an alternative of emergency evacuation planning may be preferred 3 low vulnerability an emergency evacuation plan is to be in place c sm3 glazing protection glazing protection minimises the injuries to personnel and damage to assets by reducing the quantities of flying glass 1 high vulnerability this protection is achieved by the installation of laminated glass in frames which are securely fixe d to the surrounding structure the plastic interlayers within the laminated glass must be polyvinyl butyral pvb for the glazing to offer blast resistance if better level of protection is required then 75mm laminated glass in purpose designed frames should be specified if double glazing system is to be used then the outer leaf should be 6mm toughened glass of the appropriate thickness to suit the standard design requirements and the inner pane should be 68mm laminated glass for standard frames or 75mm thick laminated glass in enhanced frames 2 moderate vulnerability if single glazing is specified then the laminated glass should be minimum of 68mm thick in standard frames 3 low vulnerability as above or consideration should be given to the use of antishatter film d sm4 access control good access control system should be installed at all pedestrian and vehicular entrances this will minim ise the opportunity for the deployment of device within the building device placed inside building would cause greater damage and potentially more injuries that similar sized device deployed outside the building sm5 counter terrorist contingency plan current health and safety legislation requires an employer to have established appropriate procedures to be followed in the event of serious or imminent

consequences of an explosive device b sm2 bomb shelter area bsa accommodation if the building is of framed construction it may offer bsa accommodation structural engineering advice should be sought to ensure that the building construction is suitable and the shelter area construction meets current guidance if the building is not framed or does not provide suitable bsa accommodation external evacuation will be required as part of the contingency planning fr om the threat of explosive devices c sm3 glazing protection where the glazing is being renewed or refurbished consideration should be given to replacing the glazing in accordance with the recommendations in sm3 for new construction in all other cases anti shatter film asf should be fitted in the internal surface of all external

comprehensive set of measures for each of the alert states is to be incorporated in to the contingency plan 10 not all the measures will necessarily be appropriate for particular establishment it is however important to undertake security survey examining such aspects as location exposure activity site conditions etc so as to identify those measures that are appropriate and then incorporate them

their point of entry d assisting guard patrols and easing the employment of guard dogs effectiveness of fence 05305 the effectiveness of fence as barrier to or deterrent against intruders can be increased by the following surveillance of the fence by members of the guard force b the alarming of the fence with some form of pids c the addition to fences of suitable security lighting d ensuring that fences are inspected frequently to ensure that they are in good condition have not been tampered with and that they and the immediate area are clear of vegetation classes of fences 05306 the classes of fences are at 05124 and the types of specific barriers that fall into each class are shown at section i annex working and operational areas 05307 ideally fence should enclose the entire working or appropriate operational areas within an establishment when this is not practicable individual key areas are to be enclosed where possible careful planning will ensure that such ins

the advice of should be sought b access through the fence access is not to be possible under the fence or through drains and culverts beneath it points such as drains and culverts should be identified as weak points and due for special attention c l i n f f n c the following considerations are to be taken into account in regard to the line of fences 1 the fence is to wherever possible run in straight lines for ease of surveillance and erection 2 junctions where the fence changes direction are usually easier to climb and are therefore be kept to minimum 3 advantage is to be taken of existing or natural features so as to increase the protective value of the fence 4 using natural or existing features may help minimise the use of material in the fence 5 the manpower that will be needed for the surveillance of the fence d siting of fences securitybarrier fence should be sited around vulnerable areas to permit economic patrolling or surveillance however it should be built at least 25m away from any work mess or accommodation block where possible to provide protection against an explosive device being placed against the fence or satchel type ied being thrown over the fence to reach the buildings where possible ground on both sides of the fence is to be cleared to remove cover for potential intruders therefore the fence should if possible be at least 10m back from the marked boundary of mod land this will facilitate the creation of sterile zone both to allow the installation of certain types of pids and also to allow space for lighti ng and cameras to cover the fence face and the approaches to it if the use of restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 534 restricted pids is envisaged careful planning and the selection of the best line for the fence using natural features will increase the protective value of the fence and minimise the use of material and manpower required for construction and subsequent security coverage where security area abuts an external boundary additional security measures should also be considered and applied visibility wherever possible the whole of the fence area is to be visible to resident or patrolling guards the perimeter can be shortened in places to avoid pockets in the fenced area which would otherwise be out of sight closed circuit television cctv may also help to improve visibility at particular establishments jsp 436 chapters 3 and 10 provide more information on fence surveillance f anticlimbing devices anticlimbing devices such as barbed wire or barbed tape concertinas are to be used at the top of the fence barbed wire or barbed tape concertina laid inside the fence at its base can discourage burrowing jsp 436 chapter 3 provides diagrams of such devices as there may be legal implications where such devices are used in areas to which the public have access advice on the matter is to be sought from command security staff g gates the following measures apply to gates 1

restricted security lighting effective use of lighting 05322 lighting can make an important contribution to physical security but to be effective it should be used in association with guards if incorrectly applied it ca n assist intruders more than guard forces security lighting is to allow guards to see intruders before they reach their objectives b conceal the guards from intruders c deter intruders or hinder them in their purpose 05323 security lighting acts as particularly good low cost deterrent even low level of illumination can deter potential intruders lamps which require long wa rm up periods are unsuitable for certain security lighting applications switches movement sensors or photoelectric sensors can be useful for the control of security lighting but the latter are vulnerable to deliberate interference types of security lighting 05324 the following types of security lighting meet particular applications perimeter lighting perimeter lighting is to be designed to cast uniform light on the perimeter this is to be provided by overhead lamps or by low mounted lamps which will create glare effect to dazzle and deter intruders if the latter are used they are not to create nuisance or hazard outside the perimeter the lighting is to be so designed so that it does not reveal the position of patrolling guards brightly lit guard posts or reception rooms where the guards are clearly visible or silhouetted are to be avoided b area lighting area lighting is to illuminate areas inside the perimeter which intruders must cross in order to reach their objectives the following measures apply 1 area lighting increases the guards ability to detect intruders and acts as powerful deterrent 2 the illumination is to be even and without shadows 3 every part of each area to be illuminated is to be lit by at least two lights to guard against lamp failure c local lighting local lighting illuminates areas inadequately covered by area lighting and which could conceal an

record of searches be maintained i n circumstances of dispute refusal to consent to be searched or upon making find record must be made an example of an appropriate form for use in such circumstances that tlbs commands may wish to replicate is at appendix 1 4 everyone entering an mod site is to be informed or reminded that they are liable to be searched notices to this effect are to be prominently displayed at any of the following pass offices entry points or guardrooms through which access is give n to mod property an example of appropriate wording for notices is at appendix 2 in addition everyone potentially affected is to be informed that all personal effects left unattended and unsecured in offices or on mod property are liable to be searched line managers are regularly to brief all persons working on mod premises and land that this policy exists and practical methods of bringing this policy to the attention of all persons entering mod property are to be considered eg including

force may be service personnel mod guard service mgs or civilian contract guard force personnel searches with consent 6 it is condition of service for mod employees and standard condition for contracted and subcontracted personnel that their person and belongings or transport on mod property are liable to search the department therefore takes the view that they have given their implied consent to be searched at any time when on mod property including at the point of exit despite this personnel are still to be asked to give their consent before being searched 7 if person does not consent to being searched on entry to mod property access may be denied they themselves have the option not to enter mod property if they object to searches taking place restricted physical security

out the search is member of the cpf mdp or the service police using one of the specific powers vested in them 9 if it is suspected that person within or in the immediate vicinity of mo d property or premises constitutes an immediate and substantive threat to li fe they may be arrested and if they still present danger to themselves or others they may be searched by any member of the establishment security force with or without consent search criteria 10 the term search means the search of person the individual their personal belongings eg baggage or their vehicles this includes the search of unattended personal belongings on mod property for example briefcases or bags left in offices or unlocked desk drawers person searching 1 search of person may be conducted only by member of the same sex except where an immediate and substantive threat to life i s believed to exist and member of the same sex is immediately available in which case search may be carried out by member of the opposite sex 2 only cursory searches involving the examination of outer clothing are to be carried out b personal belongings person of either sex may search personal belongings however if the owner is present and requests that search be carried out by member of the same sex arrangements for this are to be made provided suitable searcher is readily available if suitable searcher is not readily available the search may proceed only with the individuals consent or if the search is carried out by police officer with appropriate constabulary powers c vehicles persons of either sex may search vehicles guidelines 11 the need for training of personnel assigned to searching duties will vary depending on the type of guard force and the categorisation of the establishment as restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 58c4 restricted minimum these personnel assigned to searching duties are to be made aware of the following guidelines consent irrespective of the circumstances all personnel are to be asked to give their consent prior to search commencing b reasons for search those carrying out searches must be able to explain the reasons why they intend to carry out search as the person to be searched may well ask the reason searchers should be able to explain that the search is for example for security purposes to deter or detect terrorists or espionage or to combat and deter theft c use of force the use of force will not normally be justifiable force may be used only by the cpf mdp or the service police where they have the necessary powers in circumstances where an immediate and substantive threat to life is believed to exist personnel other than police officers may carry out forcible search but only as last resort searching personnel are to be warned that the use of force when not justified or an excessive use of force when use of reasonable force is justified may expose the searcher to allegations of assault and possible criminal prosecution d searching techniques searches in public must be restricted to superficial examination of outer garments usually by running hands over the outside of persons clothing person may be asked to remove an outer jacket headgear or gloves voluntarily person may be asked to remove all items from their pockets searching personnel are not to place their hands in any pockets personal belongings search of personal belongings for example bag or briefcase may be carried out to ensure that it does not contain unauthorised material or dangerous or prohibited items such as an explosive device weapon or protectively marked material for instance an unattended briefcase left unsecured in an accessible cabinet or drawer is liable to be searched however searching does not extend to an examination of personal items such as diaries personal papers or notebooks beyond the point necessary to establish that the item is indeed personal whereupon the examination of it is to stop thus studying such material to look for passwords combinations or other compromising material is unacceptable this applies to all personal belongings whether they be accompanied by the owner or left unattended and unsecured elsewhere f

believes may constitute an immediate threat to life for example weapon the guard may detain that person by using citizens powers of arrest cpf mdp or service police should be summoned immediately iv should an unattended item be found in room its presence there indicating breach of security then that item may be locked away and the person responsible for it notified of where to find it v in all cases guards should consider the need to preserve evidence and should handle an item only if it is necessary to do so to prevent further danger or prevent the continuation of breach of security g instigation of and selection for search entry and exit searches will ordinarily be instigated by the commanding officer of the unit or by the hoe where searching is conducted for deterrent value and not in response to threat or specific information personnel and or vehicles are to be selected for searching in an entirely random manner searching policy overseas 12 the principles of this policy apply equally to overseas establishments in that the underpinning tenets are the reasoning behind searching the jurisdiction within which to search and consent to search the question of jurisdiction is key issue and must be verified locally taking account of regional cultures and laws the powers of establishment security forces may well be different overseas depending on their composition and

defence estate the principle of aacs 051002 the principle of aacs is that entry to building or area within building is controlled by the use of cardtoken and personal identification number pin carried and known only by authorized personnel which when used together activate an access barrier use of aacs 051003 establishments are to be encouraged to consider the security benefits that may be achieved by the installation of aacs to buildings or zones within buildings the benefits may be most applicable to establishments located in single building in an urban area where an aacs system could provide increased efficiency in controlling access and reduction in the guard force such reduction may provide significant long term cost savings 051004 further information advice and guidance further information advice and guidance can be obtained from the following sources where establishments are considering installation of an aacs system consult tlb psya security staff to provide specialist advice and appropriate policy input eg aacs readers should be compatible with watermark technology used in the current version of the defence identity card didc section ii provides information and

version of the tally or exchange pass classes of aacs 051011 the classes of aacs are described at 05119 types of aacs 051012 there are 3 types of aacs namely hands on this requires the bearer of token to use it physically as an item of equipment b proximity proximity hands free is one where the bearer carries passiveactive radioinfrared token which uses coded signal to release the barrier c biometrics this is where identity is checked by some physiological feature offered at the point of entry against the record of the same feature held in computer memory in general intrusiveactive physiological feature reading such as retina scanning should be avoided 051013 in higher security installations it is mandatory for pin to be use d if hands free system is in place it is policy for hands on systems only to be used restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 5104 restricted within the mod estate for personnel hands free systems may be used for vehicles biometric systems are not to be installed without the prior approval of the appropriate tlb psya and d def sy installation criteria 051014 when considering the installation of an aacs study of the minimum baseline measures is necessary whenever it appears that substantial s aving in manpower or marked improvement in protective security will occur then aacs should be considered for installation the advantages and disadvantages which should be considered in relation to the proposed installation are as follows advantages the advantages of aacs are 1 continuous controlling of entry even in the absence of guards 2 cannot be distracted suborned persuaded or threatened 3 installation expenditure is oneoff outlay 4 upkeep and maintenance costs are low 5 can be programmed to detect unauthorised users 6 provides barrier against forced entry 7 gives protection to guards operating the system 8 will maintain record of token holders movements b disadvantages aacs has the following disadvantages 1 human supervision is still needed for visitors trades people breakdowns etc 2 collusion by unauthorised and authorised persons cannot be prevented 3 controls entryexit only does not safeguard protectively marked material security criteria 051015 where an aacs is installed to control direct access to an area housing protectively marked material it is to comply with the following have standby source of power b have fail shut device which ensures that the area to which the system gives access is secure in the event of failure or emergency restricted physical security jsp 440 volume

after 3 unsuccessful attempts at entry i prevent tailgating and passback system security 051016 when aacs has been installed its reliability and security must be maintained by good management supervision and regular servicing this includes ensuring that access to the computer and its software is restricted to authorized personnel b all cards lost stolen or longer required should be programmed out of the system as quickly as possible c consideration is to be given to making special arrangements such as withdrawing cards or programming them out of the system for staff who for prolonged period are on leave sick leave detached duty or abroad system security policies and security operating procedures 051017 where aacs are computercontrolled appropriate system security policies ssps and security operating procedures syops must be issued for the sys tem system criteria incorporation of watermark technology 051018 an increasing number of establishments are installing or planning to install aacs it is mod policy that new systems should be compatible with watermark technology in addition to being tried tested approved and secure technology watermark systems can utilise the triservice defence id card d idc and permanent passes manufactured using site access management syste ms this limits the number of cards carried by an individual on an establishment accordingly sector security authorities need to ensure that establishments inst all only watermark compatible systems the use of special services group for system surveys should ensure that this requirement is complied with restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 5106 restricted watermark specification 051019 copies of the watermark specification can be obtained from ssg the names of approved systems houses can also be obtained from ssg effective use components 051020 there are 3 components which together determine the effectiveness of an aacs namely the barrier which permits access b the token which is used to seek admittance c the control unit which accepts or rejects the token and orders the barrier accordingly barriers 051021 barriers for the admittance of personnel can be doors turnstiles or booths they are classed as higher or lower security installations higher security barrier 051022 where monitoring of an acp is from distance higher security barrier is to be installed this involves structure allowing space between barrier and ceilingroof or adjoining wallsfences entry is to be restricted t one person at time and extra precautions such as weight sensors or metal detectors are to be incorporated if the assessed threat determines the need lower security barrier 051023 where on site monitoring of an acp occurs lower security barrier such

system updates occur restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 5108 restricted maintenance contracts 051030 establishments are to ensure that an effective maintenance contract is in place through the life of the system which allows for repair to the system to be actioned within 24 hours of the system failing doors 051031 an aacs may be considered for use in conjunction with conventional door for example to restrict access to room or area inside building however the level of security provided is dependent on the security standard of the door door is more vulnerable to being circumvented than properly designed barrier particularly by tailgating therefore strong adjustable door closer is to be fitted secondary systems biometric systems 051032 biometric systems verify users identity by checking some physiol ogical feature offered at the point of entry against the record of the same feature held in the computer database biometrics systems are currently under trial by d def sy an approved list of systems will be issued in due course advantages and disadvantages of biometric systems 051033 the main advantage of biometric system is its verification of the identity of the person rather than the token disadvantages are the relatively high instal lation costs and sometimes the high level of sensitivity needed to guarantee prevention of unauthorized entry this can result in large proportion of authorised users being denied access it is for these reasons that all systems need to be approved by th centre restricted physical security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 5111

waste is to be destroyed by method approved for each particular waste type see annex there is requirement to use seap approved equipment the rules for restricted waste are as follows 1 small quantities of paper waste may be disposed of as unclassified waste eg in waste paper bins provided it is torn into small pieces and mixed with other unprotected paper waste prior to disposal 2 waste may be sent to or collected by an approved commercial company that has been contracted for this purpose approval for the use of commercial contractor is to be obtained by establishments from command security staffs b confidential secret and top secret waste marked confidential and above is to be destroyed by method approved for each particular waste type see annex using seap approved equipment or methods the principal methods of destruction are 1 incineration 2 disintegration 3 hammermilling 4 shredding 5 pulping 6 acid and chemical techniques c certification the destruction of top secret and secret material is to be witnessed and certified by two suitable vetted persons one of whom must be an officer not below the rank of warrant officer or senior nco nominated by the commanding officer administrative officer or equivalent the destruction of material marked confidential where recorded in mod f 102 may be undertaken by one authorised member of the armed forces or civil service the methods are described in more detail below in addition to destroying waste on site approved destruction facilities can be used to destroy all waste types restricted physical security jsp 440 volume 1

its destruction the waste is to be held in an appropriate container according to its protective marking b general rubbish such as cans bottles food and broken glass is not to be included with protectively marked waste c the waste sacks when filled are to be secured before being taken to the central destruction or collection point by appropriately cleared personnel d personnel not authorised to have access to protectively marked material may be employed as messengers provided they are supervised by suitably cleared person bags of protectively marked waste awaiting bulk destruction should be sealed in such way that tampering will be immediately apparent waste sacks 051607 waste sacks for the collection of protectively marked waste are to be sufficiently strong eg doublelined to withstand rigorous handling where required special kraft paper sacks identified by hmso code numbers are available as follows code 971003 multiwall printed in red for burning b code

threat 051806 the security of equipment minimum baseline measures matrices are designed to provide an appropriate level of protection for equipment against the espionage rather than the terrorist or sabotage threats however by their very nature many large items of equipment are very valuable in financial and operational terms and the matrix provides for these factors the system is aimed to be flexible enough to cover operational deployments and not only protection at the home base the assumed threat level for the use of the matrix is low l unless otherwise directed by psyas having been so advised by ddef sy eg the threat level for special armour is set at significant risk manage ment and mini mum baseline objectives 051807 risk management offers high degree of flexibility in providing the level s of protection required to safeguard protectively marked equipment to ensure that there is some degree of consistency and mutual assurance about the way one establishments assets are

the security of equipment matrices and menu of minimum baseline measures provide range of options which meet the baseline objectives they are designed to help the management of security risks by offering means for the identi fication and selection of the most suitable and costeffective physical security measures t safeguard protectively marked equipment against attempts to acquire them illic itly by surreptitious attack or theft although many of the measures suggested will be helpful in counterterrorist context and suitable counterterrorist measures already in place may of course be taken into account in meeting the baseline measures the weighting given to the measures in the matrices is not primarily intended to meet terrorist threats threat levels 051810 the security of equipment minimum baseline measures are those in the fi rst column of each of the matrices headed l the remaining columns offer means of deciding on the increased measures appropriate to levels of threat higher than low establishment security officers esyos are to keep themselves regularly uptoda on the nature and levels of threat to their assets by consulting their appropriate psyas and local servicecivil police authorities and are to decide for themselves on the proper response to increased levels of threat in the light of local circumstances about the matrix 051811 the security of equipment minimum baseline measures are set as numerical values within each matrix which correspond to the level of protectively marked equipment and to the level of the threat the matrices as shown at annexes and b are supported by menu of physical security measures annex c from which measures can be selected so that the sum total of the value of the individual measures equals or exceeds the required numerical value of the appropriate minimum baseline meas ures it is fundamental principle that points are only valid when correct security procedures and practices accompany the selected measure numerical values 051812 the numerical value of the baseline measures required for each level of the protective marking system is made up from different sections of the menu of measures some from mandatory sections of the menu of measures and the remainder from any of the sections this system of mandatory and additional measures is to ensure that sensible balance of measures is achieved and allows esyos

measure eg containers and locks whilst others are added eg fences perimeter intruder detection systems lighting and cctv the value of zero is used as multiplier where fence has control of entry at its entryexit points wher control of entry is provided the multiplier x 1 will validate the points awarded to the fence selection of measures 051816 in deciding what measures to select the user is to include existing sec urity measures and then fill in the score the results can then be compared with the requirements of the matrix from the comparison it will be apparent whether the measures are excessive adequate or need topping up additional measures 051817 if additional measures are required establishments are to decide which measures to select in the light of the actual threats faced by them if there is threat from forcible attack for instance the strength of containercasing may be higher factor than the class of lock conversely if the threat is from surreptitious attack high class

security of equipment matrix section 5 in addition to the types of patrols detailed in 05122 the security of equipment has 2 further types as follows 1 point guard person specifically detailed to guard particular building or individual piece of equipment continuously the guard must be in the immediate vicinity and carry out continuous surveillance of the building or equipment to be guarded the guard must be in possession of or have immediate access to communication equipment linked to the response force 2 dog patrol patrol comprising trained handler and trained militarypolice guard dog who have successfully completed instruction at recognised dog training school ie the defence animal centre or mdp wethersfield the patrol must work within predetermined patrol area that is known to the guard force and is larger than can be reasonably expected to be covered by single dog team the patrol should remain continuously on their designated area until relieved or designated time patrols are to be in accordance with the accepted norms for patrol durations the handler must be in possession of communication equipment linked to the response force note the mbmm points attracted by dog patrols

particular assets at the current threat level and write the figure on the points checksheet eg 14 for secret at low b read off the mandatory points required for the sections and write the figures on the points checksheet eg 8 for sections 1 andor 2 plus 3 4 turn to the menu of baseline measures to carry out the assessment sample assessments can be found as follows appendix 1 to this annex for large items of equipment kept inside specialtotype buildings b appendix 2 to this annex for large items of equipment kept in the open restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 restricted 518f2 notes 1 small items of equipment small items of equipment are assessed in exactly the same way as if they were documents therefore assessme nt for them is to be carried out using the minimum baseline measures matrix at section i to this chapter 2 summary of the classes of equipment and security measures annex to section i of this chapter details the classes of security equi pment by type carrying out the assessment 5 section 1 containercasing the aim of this section is to equate the degree of protection afforded by the casing ie skinfabric and locking mechanisms of the pi ece of equipment to that of security container by comparing the piece of equipment with the standards of containers detailed at 05114 determine the class of casing that the piece of equipment equates to and write the loading figure in the subscore column ss1 likewise the locklocking mechanisms fitted to the equipment should be allocated loading insert at ss2 in accordance with the standards at 05115 the section 1 score is achieved by multiplying the scores of the container and lock it is likely that most scores will be low unless there are special security provisions and tha t most scores for casing and lock will only achieve one point 6 section 2 room if applicable determine the class of the room that the equipment is held in using the standards at 05116 and insert the loading figure in the subscore column ss3 for example an unlocked room would attract 0 points similarly ascertain the loading for the type of lock fitted to the r oom using the standards at 05115 and insert at ss4 for example chubb mortice lock would attract 1 point the section score is achieved by multiplying the scores for the room and the lock note 1 establishments are to follow the spirit of the baseline measures matrix at all times therefore heads of establishment are not to low nonsensical situations to arise such as fitting class 4 lock to standard office door with glass panes in order to score more points on the matrix which in turn would allow other normal security precautions to be dispensed with 7 section 3 building using the standards at 05118 determine the class of the building its strength and insert the loading score in the section sc ore column s3 for example modern building of precast panels can attract 3 points 8 section 4 control of entry to building area or site determine the class of the control of entry to the building area or site using the standards at 05119 and restricted physical security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 restricted 518f3insert in the sub score column ss6 decide the loading for the visitor c ontrol and insert in the subscore column ss7 the section 4 score is achieved by adding the 2 scores together example building where entry is allowed by the issue of keys to authorized personnel will attract 1 point if the visitor control system is one where they are required to be escorted at all times then 3 further points would be gained the tota l for the section would be 4 points 9 section 5 guards and intruder detection systems ids the type of patrols and guarding procedures are described at 05122 and 051818 determine the type of patrolsguarding practices in the building are and site and insert the loading scores in the subscore column ss8 points can be achieved for an establishment that has both internal and external patrols any additional residentsite guards will not attract any fur ther points where score has been achieved for internal or external patrols example particular building housing the equipment may be the subject of frequent internal patrols gaining loading score of 5 and be on an establishment that has external patrols around the unit gaining score of 3 the establishment may also have site guard at the incident room or guardroom the latter would only attract points if there were internal or external patrols hence the total subscore ss8 in this example would be 8 points b determine the subscore for the type of ids on the establishment area andor site using the standards at 05123 and insert at ss9 the section 5 score is obtained by adding the scores for guards and ids and inserting at s5 10 section 6 immediate dispersalparkingstorage area decide what class the fence is using the standards at paras 05124 and shown by type at section i annex and insert the loading into the subscore ss10 eg an approved 24 metre high chainlink fence with security topping would merit 2 points if the establishment has entry control insert 1 point at ss11 if it does not then points are allotted similarly insert the loading figures for the yesno measures fo r searches ss12 perimeter intruder detection systems pids ss13 cctv ss14 and lighting ss15 the total score s6 for perimeter measures is obtained by multiplying the loading scores of the fence and entry control and then adding this figure to the total of the rest of the subscores example armoured vehicles are located in storage area without any measures other than security lighting the total points for section 6 would be 2 11 section 7 outer perimeter decide what grade the establishment outer perimeter fence is using the standards at 05124 and shown by type at section i annex and insert the loading into the subscore ss16 eg an approved 24 metre restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 restricted 518f4high chainlink fence with security topping would merit 2 points if the establishment has entry control insert 1 point ss17 if it does not then points are allotted similarly insert the loading figures for the yesno measures fo r searches ss18 perimeter pids ss13 cctv ss14 and lighting ss15 the total score s7 for outer perimeter measures is obtained by multiplying the loading scores of the fence and entry control and then adding this figure to the total of the rest of the subscores example an establishment has class 2 fence 2 points with entry control 1 point entryexit searches are carried out by guards 1 point but the establishment does not have any pids 0 points it also does not have any cctv 0 points or security lighting to the appropriate standards 0 points the total points for section 7 would be as follows fence x entry control total of other subscores 3 2 x 1 1 3 note it is important to note that points for cctv and lighting can only be obtained if the equipment reaches the appropriate approved standards completing the points checksheet and further action 12 completion of the checksheet after completing the baseline measures menu complete the points checksheet by inserting the total points achieved in addition insert the points obtained in the mandatory sections 13 action to be taken if points required baseline is exceeded if all of these figures exceed the points required then the equipment has adequate security and further action is required however there may be scope for the esyo in consultation with the head of establishment to reduce some security measures if desired to the baseline position this type of review is to be actively encouraged so long as expenditure is not wasted in the pursuit of lower standards when those in force are costeffective already any agreed action could be written in the re marks column of the checksheet 14 action to be taken if points required baseline is not reache d if the points achieved figures have failed to reach the points required for either the total or mandatory section scores then the esyo in consultation with the hoe must reexamine the security measures implemented on the establishment and choose hig her security measures accordingly to meet the baseline position 15 flexibility of the matrices the advantage of the baseline measures matrices is that they allow establishments the flexibility to choose their own security mea sures at given threat level as long as the baseline position is reached and certain mandatory measures are met they also take into account any enhanced security measures that the unit may have invested in such as aacs cctv or security lighting thereby perhaps allowing the establishment to reduce its costs in other areas of security restricted physical security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 restricted 518f5when to complete matrix 16 general matrix must be used for all protectively marked equipment on the establishment where similar items of equipment are held under similar circumstances throughout the establishment only one matrix may be required to be completed for each level of protective marking additionally if items of different protective markings are housed in the same specialtotype building then as long as the requirements are adequate for the highest level of protective marki ng matrices for the lower levels would not be required 17 standard loading on the matrix many of the loadings on the matrixmenu of measures will be identical throughout an establishment for each menu completed eg loadings which might be standard are those for the perimet er fence entryexit checks entry control guardingpatrol patterns 18 change in threat level if the threat changes the esyo should consult the completed points checksheet and menu of measures to see if the measures in force are still adequate or in the case of decrease in threat whether certain mea sures can be changed or dispensed with by trying differing options within the menu for given protected asset the esyo should be able to obtain any new baseline position example the threat increases from low l to moderate m and the number of points required to house top secret protectively marked material increases from 18 to 20 assuming that particular establishment has the minimum 18 points and meets the mandatory points which would not change for such an increase in threat it could meet the new baseline position by introducing infrequent internal patrols to the existing external patrols thereby gaining the extra points requir ed alternatively it could choose to house all of its top secret equipment in highe r class of building which would meet the new baseline position restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 restricted 518f6 this page intentionally left

physical security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 5191 restricted section xix to chapter 5 site access management systems general introduction of site access management systems to the defence estate 051901 number of events have focused the attention of the mod on the need to explore all the options to improve the security of access particularly in relation to visitors and contractors within the defence estate allied to the need to incorporate greater use of technical security systems due to limit ed guarding resources terrorist attacks and other nonterrorist incursions the departments security staffs have closely examined the extension of site access manage ment systems sams within the defence estate 051902 in addition there is need to upgrade the mods control of access systems control of access security other than on number of establishments that have installed sams is at present predominantly based on the issue of paper passes to visitors and contractors the passes do not have photographic image of the bearer and the details of the visitor contractor are not entered on database which can be used locally or via network the widespread introduction of sams may go some way to meeting our current and future security challenges and wi ll put into place technology enhanced computerbased image capture systems that will serve the mod into the digital age definition 051903 site access management system sams is defined as computer based control of access system which incorporates digital image capture of personnel vehicle registration number plates and database with pass production system sams applications 051904 sams computerbased digital capture products cover many security applications that are appropriate to defence establishments and can considerably enhance the security at many of those establishments the range of products available encompasses simple standalone selfoperated units for the production of range of imaged passes with database to highly sophisticated widearea network systems restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 5192 restricted benefits of adopting sams 051905 the introduction of sams as standalone system or as part of local or wide area network lan or wan provides the following benefits increased efficiency 1 reduced contractor costs by streamlining access to site 2 establishment of database of visitors reduces processing time for initial if notified visits and revisits 3 increased efficiency by not having to check as many people by telephone or other means cost savings attributable to administration of visits and contracts reduction in the number of vetting enquiries bcctc and reduction in escort requirements 4 provides potential manpower savings through possible combination of existing arrangements for producing permanent passes and for processing visitors b deterrence through image capture sams provides significant deterrence value as visitors will have their image digitally captur ed with the advent of biometric systems such as face verification there may be the perception that the captured image will be crossreferred with police and other government databases this will also reduce the incidence of contractor substitution and impersonation c improved intelligence and information details of where person has visited or worked will be recorded as well as their clearance detai ls if any d local and wide area networks the potential exists if required to share data amongst user establishments via central database reports and post incident investigative action sams has the ability to provide wide range of reports in differing formats that are particularly useful in postincident investigative procedures f technological integration with other systems it has the ability to be technologically integrated with security applications such as pedestrian turnstiles access control vehicle barriers and automatic number plate recognition this allows data and images entered into the sams to pass seamlessly in real time to other systems this eliminates the unnecessary re keying of information that has already been entered into another system and restricted physical security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 5193 restricted helps to overcome inconsistencies that can sometimes occur through human typographical errors g corporate image the widespread extension of sams will considerably improve the corporate image both in the security and non security context of individual establishments and the department as whole the current predominantly paperbased system is seen as giving an outdated and inefficient image sams presents modern hightech corporate image compatible with the digital age networking sams introduction 051906 large number of visitors to defence establishments have clearance and in the event of any requirement for investigation there is little or information gathered with traditional paper systems even those with som form of clearance are often put through the control of access process several times for different establishments and crossreferencing of information is impossible this is inefficient resulting in duplication of effort unnecessary escorting and resulting in lack of structured administrative and security information benefits 051907 existing sams users benefit from the information held on local database as it provides history as well as clearance details personal data and im age for verification on each visit to site the information is however limited to each user or organisation and there is still large amount of duplication of effort and replication of data when one considers the number of separate databases by having central database which is updated by all sams users each time new visitor or contractor visits site for the first time staff will be able to ch eck if there is record elsewhere as well as on their own database if the benefits detailed at 051905 above are true for single establishments database then economies of scale and enhanced benefits may be achievable through aggregating all the data collected throughout the mod creation of mod central database 051908 to address this situation mod central database has been established at dera farnborough this will give hoes an option to drawupon and contribute to centrally held database access to the database will be dependent on the user having access to suitably configured pc running windows nt and with connection to restricted lan interconnect rli there will be joining fee for each terminal requiring access to the central database together with m onthly service cost this option can be obtained through the dgics catalogue 051910 refers 051909 hoes are encouraged to consider the introduction of networked sams as both costeffective security enhancement for the establishment and as contribution to modwide coordinated approach to control of access restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 5194 restricted system procurement requirement for command security staff approval 051910 whilst the initial decision on the requirement for sams is taken at establishment level it is essential that the

additional countermeasures over and above those within the bikini system can also be developed by overseas commands depending on local circumstances and promulgated on local basis bearing in mind the

different there is standard time for personnel to remain under cover much will depend on the number of mortars believed to have been used as the likelihood of unexploded or nonfired bombs increases with the greater number of mortars used in the attack and therefore the longer personnel should remain protected those in charge will have to make their own judgement at the time 10 once the

has the capability to seriously injure or kill it is therefore essential that those using baton are authorized to carry it are correctly trai ned in its use and understand the circumstances that will allow its use for the purpose of this paper the term baton includes any truncheon generally regarded as obsolete expandable baton or rigid baton specifically designed for an operational security or policing purpose it should not be confused with baton rounds used in public order situations for which separate instructions apply the use of pickhelves staves or any other implement as substitute for purposedesigned baton is not authorized aim 2 the aim of this paper is to outline the situations in which the use of batons by service personnel may be authorized and the procedures and constraints that apply to their issue and use the requirement for batons 3 number of situations are envisaged when batons may be required these may be operational security or police related the provision of baton will allow graduated response from an unarmed reaction through to the use of firearm if issued depending on the situation and the roe in force 4 batons may be suitable weapon for use in both peacetime operations and during armed conflict the requirement for batons will therefore vary depending on the nature of the conflict at the time 5 the list of circumstances that follows illustrates the range of situations fo r which the issue of batons may be appropriate operations 6 members of the armed forces may require to use batons in order to achieve mission on any type of military operation within the spectrum of conflict withi n such an operation batons may provide an effective option to or be used with other weapons 7 examples of such military operations include restricted defence manual of

evacuation operations security 8 in order to provide security for the department personnel may be posted as sentries to guard property or personnel the mod has responsibility to equip its personnel for the task on which they are employed and therefore sentry should be equipped on basis commensurate with the assessed threat sentry could therefore be equipped with firearm and perhaps also baton with baton or unarmed policing duties 9 the mdp and service police require batons to execute police duties where their use has been approved by minister af ccmdp and service police provost marshals will issue separate police instructions which accord with the associ ation of chief police officers acpo guidelines consequently this policy paper does not apply to the mdp andor the service police 10 batons could be required by service personnel who may not be service police but who could be employed in support of service police eg patrols sentries or in response to specific incident summary 11 batons offer an effective weapon to provide deterrence through display of capability b individual protection of the servicemen or of others from aggressors in variety of scenarios and for the protection of property c an offensive capability short of the use of firearm authority for the issue of batons 12 given that baton has the capability to kill or seriously injure with consequences for the individual using baton and the department and in line with arming policy for firearms approval for their issue must be given at the appropriat level the issuing of batons for operational use would

is likely to have been handled by several peopl during transmission and will be constructed to withstand such manhandling 2 being an antipersonnel device designed to detonate on opening the person discovering postal bomb is likely to be quite safe provided that attempt is made to ope n or tamper with the object once declared as suspect the general procedures fo r dealing with an ied should be observed immediate response drills 3 having decided that an item of mail is suspect the following actions should be taken place the object on the nearest level surface such as table or the floor b without further handling the object make detailed note of any markings and characteristics including size post mark etc c evacuate the area leaving all doors and windows open d carry out the ied immediate response drills 4 do not attempt to open the package b attempt to carry the object out of the building c attempt to place the object in bucket of water d attempt to cover the object with sand or sandbag around the object or surround the object by steel cabinets or other furniture as this is likely to enhance any explosive shrapnel effect 5 if suspicions are aroused once the package has been partially opened or the contents partially removed carry out the same immediate reaction drills restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 74d2 restricted 6 advice on postal bomb recognition is at appendix 1 restricted counter terrorist measures jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 74d11 restricted appendix 1 to annex d to section iv to chapter 7 postal bomb recognition types of postal bomb 1 postal bomb is essentially an antipersonnel weapon that is usually designe d to explode at the moment of opening the device will invariably contain an explosive charg detonator or igniter to initiate the charge and some form of triggering mechanism the triggering mechanism will probably employ an electrical igniter system percussion device involving the release of springloaded striker or simple frictional thod of ignition superficial appearance and other indications 2 the sender of postal bomb will take great care to make its appearance as innocuous as possible the envelope may be professionally embossed suggesting that it comes from bonafide source and the recipients address may also be printed or typed as the first identification of postal bomb is likely to depend totally on the reci pient becoming suspicious when the mail is first examined personnel should be alert to the following aspects that could indicate receipt of letter bomb if the point of origin gives cause for doubt b if the manuscript of the sender is unusual c if the balance of the package is uneven d if the package seems very heavy for its size if there is any springiness in the top bottom or sides of the package or letter but do not bend excessively f if wires protrude from it g if there is hole like pinhole in the package wrapping or envelope h if there are grease marks on the envelope or parcel wrapping from the sweating of the explosive i if it smells of almonds or marzipan restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 74d12 restricted j if the package is thought to contain book that is not expected k if the flap of an envelope is stuck down completely usually there is an ungummed gap at each end of the gummed flap 3 additionally look for the following when examining letters the feel will indicate whether there is only folded paper inside the envelope that will show that it is all right bomb will probably have stiffening eg by cards or the feel of metal b letters usually weigh up to 28 grams postal bombs will usually weigh more than 56 grams and therefore need more than the usual postage stamps they will tend to be unusually thick eg 32mm or more and are likely also to feel lop sided c if an envelope contains an inner envelope addressed to an individual this should be examined again for the signs listed an inner envelope that is tightly taped or tied with string is also typical of bomb 4 it may not be possible to feel any solid objects in the package since these are not essential ingredients and if present may be shielded by padding it is also import ant to realize that the envelope and its contents may be quite flexible operation of the device 5 postal bomb is usually designed so that the action of opening it causes an immediate explosion the actions relied upon to operate the device may be summarized s follows tearing apart the envelope this action can either operate simple electrical switch or release the springloaded retainer of striking mechanism b pulling out tucked in envelope flap the interior part of the flap may be connected by thread to an electrical switch to friction device or to the retainer of percussion striker it should be noted that in some devices the necessary pull on an operating thread is very small indeed c using paper knife the use of paper knife could pull thread as in subparagraph 4b above d removing the contents of an already opened envelope this action could achieve the same results as those referred to in subparagraphs 4a and 4b above in this context any unusual resistance to the removal of the contents could be significant restricted counter terrorist measures jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 74d13 restricted potential of postal bomb to kill 6 postal bombs may be designed either to kill or to wound and frighten lethal letter bombs invariably contain powerful explosive those not designed to kill may contain either small charge of high explosive or even detonator alone or quantity of incendiary or flash material the characteristics of both types of bomb are as follows lethal postal bomb the designer of postal bomb normally strives to avoid suspicion by keeping the package as thin as possible and using standard envelope sizes but technical considerations and the need to include an adequate explosive charge mean that lethal bomb less than about 32 mm thick is unlikely to be used lethal bombs are likely to weigh 4384 grams they can of course be heavier and would cause the recipient injury severe shock and possible death one that was 84 grams or more would almost certainly kill while these weights which are based on past experience of these devices are still most likely to be encountered modern developments in explosives and electrical circuits does mean that smaller devices could also be lethal b postal bombs designed to wound shock or frighten bombs not designed to kill are made in the same way as lethal ones but may be of the same flexibility and thickness about 16mm as an ordinary letter those that contain high explosive could be expected to cause injury to hands and possibly to the eyes others containing incendiary or flash material could produce brilliant flash followed by fire but not dangerous blast injury being limited to burns on the hands and possible harm to the eyes restricted defence manual of security jsp

2 cm or more in thickness if from an unusual point of origin or sender treat as suspect but do not return to the sender for validation b handwriting of sender if this indicates foreign style of

7 survival in hostage situations 1 good personal counter terrorist security and anonymity as described elsewhere in the defence manual of security jsp 440 are the most effective counter measures to avoid targeting and therefore becoming victim in hostage or kidnapping situation 2 very few military personnel have been kidnapped or held hostage in the past however there has been general increase in kidnapping worldwide and there is therefore an increased possibility of military personnel being held as human shiel ds during humanitarian or peace keeping operations 3 the security advice contained in this annex is based on the foreign and commonwealth office fco brief guidance notes on personal protection measures overseas general 4 nobody can predict when where or against whom terrorists will strike although senior officers may be singled out as an attractive target because of their hi gh publicity value all ranks must be aware of the danger for this reason it is im portant to retain anonymity within the local community and to keep low profile especially whe n off duty service personnel must make every effort to keep up to date through their designated overseas security authority this must be decided prior to deployment with any changes to the threat this is reflected in the overseas terrorist threa t assessment list ottal which is disseminated by mod d def sy however despite thorough awareness and appreciation of the terrorist threat together with the application of preventative measures kidnapping can still take place therefore all ranks should be aware of survival techniques if taken hostage 5 once captured the hostage is on his or her own usually in total isolation their immediate reaction and subsequent behaviour during captivity can be vital in leadi ng to their eventual release unharmed the following notes have been prepared from debriefings of hostage victims moment of capture 6 this is generally one of the most critical and dangerous parts of the abduction phase any sudden or unexpected movement noise or cry for help is likely to provoke violent response from the terrorist which could prove fatal to the captive in host age situation tension will remain high until the terrorists are sure that they are in control they will attempt to gain psychological advantage by putting the captive on the defensive restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 75e2 restricted resist or submit 7 whether to resist or surrender to kidnappers must remain personal decision you should weigh carefully the danger of resistance in the face of what may be overwhelming odds if you decide not to resist assure the abductors of your intention to cooperate particularly during the abduction phase remember that resistance is extremely risky because the terrorists are already mentally prepared to meet this contingency and are acting under great deal of tension during the first few moment s of the operation blindfolds gags and drugs 8 it is important to realize that terrorists want hostages alive while they may use blindfolds gags or drugs at the time of the abduction you should not be overalarmed pressured or provoked into resisting resistance is likely to result in the terrorists using more extreme measures stay alert 9 try to occupy your mind by noting sounds direction of travel passage of time conversations of the terrorists and any other information which later could lead to thei r capture and conviction living conditions 10 the living conditions of hostages vary greatly from incident to incident in general hostages are detained in cramped conditions and in isolation there will usually be complete lack of privacy and conventional toilet facilities may not exi st maintaining dignity and selfrespect under such conditions will be difficult but such standards are important for survival fear 11 fear is the most important tool of terrorists they use it to control intimidate and wear down the hostage negotiators and anyone sympathetic to the victims plig ht fear may be further induced by the captors loading and unloading weapons in the presence of the hostage displaying excesses of temper resorting to physical abuse nd staging mock executions fear of dying is very real and it can become overwhelming particularly during the early stages of captivity although death is possibility remember that statistically the odds favour hostage being released time 12 experience has shown that the more time that has elapsed the better are the chances of the hostage being released or rescued for this reason although the passing of time in captivity is depressing it is to the hostages advantage restricted counter terrorist measures jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 75e3 restricted boredom 13 to ward off the effects of boredom and keep up morale the hostage must discipline himself to take daily physical exercise and engage in creative menta l activity such as reading writing or any other pursuit that exercises the mind because of the likely cramped space physical exercise may be reduced to running on the spot push ups and sit ups isometric exercises may have to be used to overcome cramped space or physical restraints illness 14 side effect of captivity for some hostages is illness caused by ina dequate meals or poor diet gastrointestinal upsets or constipation may also be suffered though such symptoms may be unpleasant they do not generally threaten life and the hostage should not hesitate to complain to the terrorists who normally want to keep their hostage ali ve and at least reasonably well rapport 15 it is important for the hostage to establish an early rapport with the captors studies have shown that the more human their victims appear the more difficulty the captors will have in carrying out threats of violence against them the displa of family photographs or discussions about children and family matters have occasionally been instrumental in saving the lives of hostages of course you must avoid giving the terrorists any information which they could use later to their advantage this is matter of fine judgement particularly for female hostages and care should be taken not to give the terrorists the wrong impression by becoming too familiar rescue or release 16 most hostages who die are killed during rescue attempts so it is crucial fo r hostages to be particularly alert cautious and obedient if they suspect that suc h an attempt is close at hand the terrorists may be extremely nervous during any negotiations especially if the process is long and drawn out as the central figure in any rescue attempt the hostage must avoid all sudden moves which would invite reacti on from the rescue force as well as from the terrorists the natural impulse to sta nd up and run must be resisted as it could easily be thought to be the action of one of the terrorist s by the rescue force the hostages safest course is to drop immediately to the floor and lie as flat as possible carry out any request by the rescue force and remember that the rescuers may not know you initially and they are trained to treat everyone as suspec t until

air traffic regulations it is impractical to regulate the activity of taking ae rial photographs and that any control which in practice is likely to be little more than influe nce can only be applied to their sale or distribution in addition this approach can only be directed towards the professional aerial photography companies there is little or effective control over others who have the ability

marked confidential or above on the contractors premises b what is the highest protective marking of information to be included in the tender or initial contract documents if disclosure of protected

requisitioning branches should bear in mind that contract documents have wide circulation in companies and the aim should therefore be to exclude information marked confidential or above from contract documents if it is not possible to avoid protectively marking the contract document itself the requisitioning branch should consider whether the particulars which will need to appear on the advice

the special obligations laid upon the contractor become legally effective only when the ministry of defence has issued notice in writing defining which aspects of the itt or contract are to be marked as confidential secret or top secret this is achieved by means of security aspects letter sal written by the requisitioning bra nch or by the inclusion of security aspects clause in the itt or contract the contractor is require d to confirm in writing that he understands and will implement the provisions of the sal or clause the sal must therefore be issued to the contractor along with the itt or contract document info sy industry23 must be informed in advance if this is not possible it is sometimes unnecessary to define the secret matter to the c ontractor in the form of an sal this is usually the case when all access to protected informati on will be on government property only eg the employment of consultants etc in these circumstances the requisitioning branch should include of the following clause in the contract under security measures the requirement under defcon 659 for the provision of security aspects letter is waived as all work on the contract will be carried out on

to info sy industry23 importance of defining secret matter to the contractor 12041 the importance of defining secret matter to the contractor are explained as follows the aim of the sal or security aspects clause at the tender stage i s to ensure that the contractor safeguards protected information documents or material adequately during and after the tender stage and to enable the contractor to make financial provision in the tender for the measures which will need to be taken to safeguard the secret matter in the event of them being subsequently awarded the contract b the aim of the sal or clause in the contract is to provide guidance on the security markings of the main features of project and those subassemblies restricted defence manual of security 1220 jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 restricted or components from which any of the protected features might be deduced 12042 contracts staff will be guided by sals when protectively marking t heir correspondence and it is therefore important that all sensitive features of the work which are likely to be the subject of correspondence between contracts staff and contractors should be correctly identified points to be considered by requisitioning branches in the preparation of sal 12043 points to be considered by the requisitioning branch in preparation of sal are sal which gives only provisional guidance must be amplified by the requisitioning branch directly with the contractor as soon as possible when contract is placed following consideration of tenders further sal as set out in 12049 below must be issued by the requisitioning branch even if there is change in the definition and passed to the contracts branch b separate notification of secret matter must be made for each new contract it is not sufficient to state that these are the same as for previous contracts even though it maybe the continuation of an on going task c when the work to be undertaken by the contractor does not stem from service requirement eg research initiated by the ministry of def ence the appropriate protective markings may have to be decided by the rd establishment or project branch concerned in consultation with def sy st in the first instance d when production is current with or follows research and development the project branch which acts as requisitioning branch must consult the appropriate hq rd branch to ensure that the definition of secret matter is consistent with that given at the research and development stage projects at very early stages of development may not yet have been considered by technical grading committee it is then necessary to seek the advice of the or branch sponsoring the project and def sy st the requisitioning branch together with the sponsor and def sy st should then analyze the project and allocate appropriate protective markings to the ma in features assemblies and subassemblies which need to be protected in technical grading guide if necessary f project and

1221 jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 restricted g sals should be protected strictly according to content and care should be taken not to overgrade them for instance if certain aspects of an equipment such as the weight or internal dimensions are secret then the letter should simply state that fact without giving any actual figures the sal may then be protectively marked higher than restricted h in running contracts which cover both protected and unclassified work eg contracts for drawing reproduction or film processing it will be sufficient for the secret matter to be defined in general terms such s any drawing etc marked confidential secret or top secret i the association of one piece of equipment with another or of one component part with one or more other parts the several parts having perhaps been manufactured by different contractors may require protection in some cases the fact that an unclassified proprietary component is being used in an item of equipment may require protection in such cases the association of the component with the equipment must be protected j the use of blanket technical protective markings must be avoided k the contractor must be notified of the protected aspects of any equipment issued to him on embodiment loan l in certain sensitive fields of work it may be necessary to protect knowledge of the destination of equipment and to give detailed

projects 1 private venture pv projects are likely to fall within one of three categories variants variants of standard defence equipment under development or in production eg aircraft military vehicles or ships etc with nonstandard equipment or fitments offered to meet special customer requirements or to avoid security or commercial difficulties associat ed with the sale of the service item b derivatives equipment for military or civil use which is not based on standard service designs but depends on expertise or technology acquired in the course of defence contracts c freelance equipment of defence importance which is in way based on information gained from defence contracts 2 ipt leaders will be primarily concerned with variants or derivatives although cognizance may need to be taken of items in category c if they have an ac tual or potential military application the patent office has arrangements whereby pate nts can be given security protection but see paragraph 12102d 3 the variant is one of the more common forms of private venture many such variants may be more than paper studies prepared for consideration by the defence department of other prospective overseas customers each variant should be subjected to proper security assessment since it may embody protectively marked aspects of service projects and therefore require formal departmental approval of release before details of it may be made available to prospective overseas customers supporting documentation etc may also require inhouse protection by the contractor and by potential and actual customers 4 the derivatives may not necessarily come formally to the notice of ip t leaders the existence of paper studies or work on such derivatives should in every case be reported to the security grading authority foreign power will rightly assume that service technology is fully abreast of such derivative work that the performance of service equipment is unlikely to fall short of the performance of the deri vative and that there will be much in common in the design work hence degree of security protection may be required to protect service interests derivative projects may subsequently be adopted for limited or full uk service use restricted defence manual of security 12u2 jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 restricted 5 it is desirable that project managers be aware of the extent of contractors obligations in respect of private venture work since such obligations may not always be clearcut and may be disputed both classified and unclassified defence contracts have clauses prohibiting the publication of material related to contract without the approval of the department in addition the manual of protective security contains advice on reporting private venture work for grading see paragraph 7 below contractors may have considerable commercial or other incentives for denying that their private ventures are in any way associated with defence contracts though it is often possible to persua them that the security protection of their own designs is not only in the public i nterest but factor of importance to prospective customers 6 overseas sales of private venture equipment need not concern ipt leaders except where they conflict with contractors undertakings to the department eg if they make unacceptable demands on existing design production or testing resources or where they require the release of information protectively marked or unclassified 7 for further information on private venture funded projects see the security in industry insert b1 of

annex d 2 lessons lessons may be drawn from recent security intelligence cases security breaches and terrorist incidents such material is available from curity staffs and should be disseminated rapidly lessons may also be drawn from security surveys and inspections 3 videos these provide particularly effective way of informing large numbers of staff about the various threats to security and of making them aware of their security responsibilities they can be used as visual aids during course or be the main focus of separate security session video should never be used in isolation but must be set firmly in its security context by the presenter otherwise the audience will be inclined to judge it solely on its entertainment value and s obtain little or security benefit from it 4 showing video should therefore always be preceded by short introduction describing its purpose and points to look out for discussion about the value of the video and the security lessons it highlights should follow if guidance notes for the use of presenters are not provided with the video the presenter should compile his own the joint services military training film and video catalogue issued by the british defence film library bdfl includes security educational and instructional material produced triservice single service or by the security ser vice virtually all recent production has been in the form of videos commands are responsible for notifying the release of new videos that are not yet listed in the catalogue videos should be chosen that are appropriate to the audience eg civilian audiences may not relate to one featuring uniformed characters and it should be suited to the expertise and seniority of the audience 5 posters posters are not intended to teach lessons but to remind staff of the threats to security and of the principal security measures necessary to comb at them to retain their impact posters must not only be prominently displayed but also frequently changed 6 wall calendars these featuring different security theme for each month particularly when well designed can be very effective in pressing home the sec urity message 7 stickers stickers are aimed at reminding staff of their personal responsibility for maintaining security when using specific items of security equipment eg the restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 13b2

subject is to be covered talk may be the most appropriate medium it is useful to confirm the audiences understanding of the talk with subsequent discussion it is also important to consider the size and composition of the audience for example it may be difficult to pitch talk to capture and retain the interest of groups comprising widely different seniorities or specialisations large audiences may pose problems audibility reduced impac t of the message on the individual and the tendency for individuals to feel anonymous in crowd and therefore to listen and contribute less 3 seminars or informal talks seminars or informal talks may be useful when greater degree of audience participation and discussion is possible and desirable for example when persuading senior management of the importance of promoting good security practice or b when introducing staff to the security requirements of specific task 4 if wider variety of topics of general needs to be covered presentation with different speakers may best hold the attention of the group and help them to distinguish between the different subjects 5 when greater amount of information is to be conveyed and the students need to understand and apply it longer course may be desirable with opportunities for practical exercises to ensure that the audience understands and retains the information 6 with both presentations and

of any organisation these include trainingeducation b information management c product catalogues d advertising presentations multimedia advantages 4 the quality of multimedia products available is evidence of growing reliance on the use of these types of media they provide cheap though highly effective methods of delivering information education and training take training as an example on the one hand over the past few years many organisations have restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 13d2 restricted slashed their training budgets and reduced their training resources on the other the need for training has risen relative to the rapid changes in technologies and working practices in the workplace consequently organisations have been forced to reassess how they provide appropriate training for their employees computer based learning cbl 5 many organisations have found that cbl provide viable alternative to increasingly expensive traditional classroombasedtrainerled teaching methods the cbl approach is being adopted by many organisations as the main impetus to their training strategy reduced training budgets and corresponding decrease in

been written with the aim of setting out the principles of security and providing the guidelines and instructions required to maintain security throughout the ministry of defence 1402 surprise and security are two of the principles of war surprise cannot be achieved without good security on operations the tempo nature and extent of activity may preclude carrying out in full the detailed security procedures outlined els ewhere in jsp 440 this is not to suggest that security on operations is of less importance t han at peacetime base locations or on exercises indeed the success of operations depends in great measure on the element of surprise and on the steps taken to prevent knowledge of friendly force intentions reaching the adversary security enhances freedom of acti on by limiting vulnerability to adversary activities and threats thus security on operations is based primarily on the security of information the main object is to prevent the adversary obtaining information about our intentions order of battle vulnerabilities deployment and movements in certain types of operations especially where terrorism is involved measures required to prevent the seizure of arms ammunition and equipment and attacks against our own forces with for example improvised explosive devices also assume significant importance 1403 although the detailed procedures given elsewhere in jsp 440 may not all be fully appropriate to the operational scenario the principles upon which these procedures are based remain equally valid in both peace and war 1404 the aim of this chapter is to provide general guidance to assist comma nders to produce their own security orders while deployed on operations ranging from minor conflict to general war to ensure that all personnel are familiar with their responsibilities these procedures are to be practised on exercises as appropriate 1405 clear distinction must be drawn between security on operations and operations security opsec opsec is the process which gives military ope ration or exercise appropriate security using passive or active means to deny the adversary knowledge of the dispositions capabilities and intentions of friendly forces aap 6u the opsec plan provides for the overall security of an exercise or operation employing wide range of military disciplines both offensively to disrupt or stroy the adversarys intelligence surveillance target acquisition and reconnaissanc istar capability and defensively to deny information to the adversary the opsec plan will of course include measures and procedures taken as part of secu rity restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 144 restricted on operations further information and details of opsec can be found in ajp01 and jdp

and the host nation administration may well have collapsed exposing the force to wide range of threats security and protection as key components of capability assume an even higher importance in joint operations jdp 199 considers uk doctrine for force protection in joint and multinational context and provides framework for comprehensive protection of the deployed force to conserve its fighting strength in order to achieve its mission with minimum casualties to both personnel and equipment the uk doctrine examines within the context of joint operations future conflict and the need for force protection its aim definitions and principles its constituent elements concept of operations and its command and control the protection of the force including the force generation phase on the uk mainland in and permanent garrisons abroad is addressed by existing mod and theatre policy covering standing security measures although such policy may be modified in response to other operations 1407 force protection can be defined as process which aims to conserve the fighting potential of the deployed force by countering the wider threat t all its elements from adversary natural and human hazards and fratricide force protection is not an issue that can be addressed separately or in isolation it is n integral part of operations and must be incorporated into the commanders plan from the outset in joint operations involving uk forces overseas the cjos strategic estimate will consider force protection as factor and this should be reflected in the deployed force levels the force hq will examine force protection in mor detail in the operational estimate which will confirm force protection policy and secu rity requirements based on the threat assessment security elements of force protection measures 1408 following the threat assessment appropriate protective measures can be decided force protection measures fall under several broad categories which includes security covering physical and procedural measures directed from force hq level and integrated into the overall plan but mainly applied at local level security measures aim to minimize direct and indirect attacks on personnel equipment installations and lines of communication by other than the adversarys main forces in ootw and pso where the adversary may not possess an air theatre missile and nbc capability security is probably the main constit uent of force protection some security measures will affect the civil population and suc h measures must be subject to appropriate legal advice which may need to

responsibility of the commander to modify the existing security procedures applicable to the force in accordance with the est ablished principles described in jsp 440 such modifications are to be

particularly the uks closest allies assets that attract national caveat should always be marked with an appropriate protective marking where necessary descriptor may also be applied any additional national caveats that may be required by originators specifically for use within the mod should ensure that the same principles laid down in this chapter are applied the core nat ional caveats are detailed at annex and summary of release levels at annex c 1603 before applying national caveat to any information the originator should give serious consideration to the content recipients and the likely uses to which that information will be put within mod this is particularly relevant in the followi ng organisations and training establishments where foreign exchange personnel are employed and

consent as incorrect usage will cause considerable difficulties in areas where dual and foreign nationals are employed eg such as exchange personnel and generally in uk industry b uk eyes discretion the originator should use this caveat when the information while having sensitivity to uk national interests may be capable of wider discretionary dissemination in marking material with this caveat the originator is implicitly delegating subsequent release au thority to hoecos who may authorise subsequent release in accordance with annex c this discretion provides flexibility for hoecos to make effective risk management decisions without reference to the originator if in any doubt staff should always seek advice from their principal security adviser composite caveats 1607 composite caveat denotes that the information may be shared by nationals of more than one country eg ukus etc the aim of composite caveats is to restrict the dissemination of sensitive assets by limiting disclosure only to foreign nationals with proven needtoknow who are authorised and appropriately cleared for access these caveats are most widely used in areas of activity whe re the exchange of sensitive

strap security is set of nationally agreed principles and procedures to enhance the needtoknow protection of sensitive intelligence and related operational information produced by the principal uk intelligence agencies including mod sources strap is codeword not an acronym it is used to mark most types of material handled under the strap system where this is practicable because of technical constrai nts the originating agencies will give guidance on the strap equivalent of codewords the codeword strap in isolation does not require protective marking the threat to sensitive intelligence 1702 the principal threat to sensitive intelligence arises when target becomes aware of an intelligence attack so warned the target can initiate countermeasures and intelligence of the kind protected by the strap system is particularly vulner able to this type of reaction 1703 the uks intelligence capability is similarly at risk when knowledge of an intelligence success against target falls into the hands of any other country organisation or individual they may assume their own activities against t he uk national interest to be similarly targeted at worst future success against valua ble target could be denied and an agents life lost but in any event the cost of recovering lost intelligence capability is likely to be very high 1704 the traditional threat to the uks intelligence operations from for eign intelligence services fis remains potent one particular ly in the field of scientific technical and industrial espionage and the classic methods of attack are likely to be employed however many of todays high priority intelligence targets ar not connected to foreign government or therefore to professional intelligenc service whilst this may be seen to reduce the level of risk it does not make these inte lligence operations any less vulnerable 1705 for example activities against the uk national interest such as ter rorism drug trafficking and other illegal dealing by individuals and organisations are inc reasing in significance and hence in priority as intelligence targets the threa t to operations against these targets is less likely to arise from positive acts of counteres pionage than from leakage of information through disaffected members of staff or as result of the attentions of an investigative journalist or simply by accident or carelessness 1706 in this wider definition of threat the enemy is unwelcome publicity of any kind and through any medium the most effective safeguard is to reinforce those restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 1 issue 2 174 restricted aspects of security that minimise the risk of leakage of sensitive intel ligence operations or product into the public domain whether by accidental exposure or deliberate intent the strap system aims to achieve this how the strap system operates 1707 the strap system seeks to add value to the standard security measures employed for intelligence matters top secret secret etc by using addit ional effective procedures it aims to minimise the risk of unauthorised disclosure of particularly vulnerable intelligence assets by restricting access to sensitive intelligence material on strict needto know basis b agreeing the appropriate facilities for its protection in transit ie strap channels use storage and disposal and c providing explicit briefings and guidance for individuals who handle this type of material 1708 information that requires protection under the strap system will be clearly defined and labelled it will be carried by authorized couriers during tra nsit and signed receipts will be obtained at all stages of handover three levels of protection 1709 within the overall definition of particularly sensitive some items of

output required of the contractor for example to deny access to the site by unauthorised persons rather than to state an input requirement x number of access control personnel to be employed in this way responsibility for denying access rests with the contractor should breach occur factors to be considered in preparing the sor are set out below the tlb psya must be consulted on the contents of

requirements specified in the contract factors to be considered in drawing up statement of requirements 3 the sor will vary according to the nature of the site to be guarded and the availability of physical protective security measures when draft ing the sor site security must always be borne in mind because copies of the sor are likely to be circulated to number of firms only one of which will eventually be awarded the contract existing security measures should only be described on needtoknow basis and sor will normally be protectively marked restricted the management of companies circulated should be advised to protect all such information accordingly establishment contingency plans should not be included in the sor any security sensitive aspects of the proposed contract may be covered verbally during the onsite briefing conducted by the hoe and attended by the psya cs and contractors who have been invited to tender 4 however it is most important that the requirement is described as clearly comprehensively and unambiguously as security considerations will allow as the sor provides the template against which the invitation to tender itt will be framed and tenders evaluated in turn the itt will form the basis of the contract and thus define the criteria that the contractor will be required to meet in perfo rmance the hoe must bear in mind that he will have grounds for future complaint should requirement not be specified in the contract the cs are available to give advice and should be consulted during the drafting stage of the sor once approved by the

chapter provides brief summary of the principles of security in the context of personnel security more detailed information is contained in chapter 1 of the defence manual of security dms volume 1 protective security the definition of security 0102 security is the protection of assets andor people against an unwanted event the damage arising from an unwanted event is described as compromise the threats to security 0103 the threats which are not in priority order can be summarised as follows espionage b subversion c sabotage d terrorism non traditional espionage 0104 prime area of interest so far as personnel security is concerned is the exclusion from access to protectively marked information or material of those people who might become involved in espionage owing to some form of inducement or pressure applied to them or because of ideological beliefs or disaffection 0105 foreign intelligence services fis try to collect information for intelligence purposes and to break through our security defences they work mainly through agents who are either introduced from overseas or are recruited locally these age nts are known to seek out those with character weaknesses or special circumstances eg relatives in countries presenting special security risk who can be exploited through bribery blackmail or other pressures one with access or who may later have access to sensitive information or material may be considered too unimportant to be cultivated either as useful contact or possible agent restricted defence manual of security 14 jsp 440 volume 2 issue 2 al1 restricted subversion 0106 personnel may be subject to the threat of subversion by fis and members of organisations whose interests are inimical to those of hm government it may not be easy to detect this form of attack at first sight so personnel should be alert to disguised approaches sabotage 0107 sabotage is threat normally associated with state of war with c onditions of international tension or during local internal security situations terrorism 0108 acts of terrorism may continue to be perpetuated in the uk the nature of the threat whether in the uk or overseas will vary depending on the local situation non traditional 0109 this covers the compromise of information or assets through for example theft accidental loss leaks and non traditional actions of disaffected staff fraud and deliberate compromise corruption or destruction of computer or other data such compromise represents threat to security in its wider sense protective security 0110 protective security is maintained by combination of laws orders and instructions these measures range from the official secrets acts to unit security standing orders b physical security measures these are covered in chapter 5 of the dms volume 1 protective security c personnel security measures these are covered in this volume d security education and training the aim of security education is to ensure that all who work within the mod both military and civilian irrespective of access understand both the security threat and their responsibilities for countering it the aim of security training is to ensure that those individuals who have specific security responsibilities as part of their normal employment are properly trained in their security duties security education and training are the responsibility of commanders and line managers at all levels for details see dms volume 1 chapter 13 restricted principles of security 15 jsp 440 volume 2 issue 2 al1 restricted security survey and inspections need to know and need to hold 0111 knowledge of protectively marked matters must be limited strictl to those who are security cleared to the appropriate level and who need such knowledge in order to carry out their duties in addition protectively marked documents must not be retained by individuals unless they are required to hold them for the performance of their duties protective marking 0112 assets are protectively marked according to the damage that unauthorised disclosure could cause an understanding of the governments protective marking system is required in order to reach the appropriate conclusions about the levels of protection needed in particular circumstances guidance on this system is given in volume 1 chapter 1 0103 restricted defence manual of security 16 jsp 440 volume 2 issue 2 al1 restricted

security in the mod is based on number of interlocking procedures which may not be effective or may even be dangerous if they are applied singly without the support of other measures thus personnel security measures must not be regarded as an end in themselves but only as means to an end in particular security vetting must be seen as only part of our protective security system 0212 personnel security measures devolve from government instructions to all departments they are designed primarily not to catch spies but to exclude or restric t access to protectively marked information or material by persons whose loyalty reliability or trustworthiness may be in doubt also to ensure that those who are appointed to posts which afford access to protectively marked information or material conduct themselves in such way as to demonstrate their suitability t retain access 0213 to achieve these ends it is most important that any doubts about an individuals loyalty reliability or trustworthiness are brought to the attention of the security authorities without delay so that where necessary action can be taken t limit the risk to security 0214 in the context of personnel security although every consideration must be given to safeguarding the rights individuals in the final analysis the security of the state must outweigh all other considerations personnel security

volume 2 issue 2 al1 restricted chapter 3 the vetting regime introduction 0301 the review of protective security rps completed in 1994 was fundamental and wideranging review of the governments security policies and practices it resulted from recognition of the changes in the wider environment in which government departments and agencies and government contractors operate particularly changes in the level and nature of the threats to national securit 0302 in the area of personnel security the rps concluded that the vetting process served useful purpose not only in disclosing circumstances which might lead to breaches of security but also as deterrent to those who might otherwise seek to undermine that security the review recommended however new approach to vetting with the greater engagement of line managers and increased opennes s with staff in post about the outcome of the security vetting process it also recommended an updated range of checks and security clearances details of which are given in this chapter 0303 all candidates for security vetting are to be asked to complete secur ity questionnaire which will explain the purpose of the procedure and invite them to provide the personal details required for the necessary checks to be undertaken vetting will then be carried out on the basis of hm governments stateme nt of vetting policy at annex 0304 in essence the purpose of vetting is to exclude those who might be secur ity risk from having access to protectively marked information or material or to mod establishments the process consists of collecting information on individuals and making judgement based on that information however vetting cannot guarantee that person is totally reliable still less can it give assurance that he w ill remain so for all time there is therefore need both for close and continuous supervision by more senior staff of all those who have access to protectively marked assets or to mod establishments and

they are guidance on how to check identity as pa rt of the bc process is given below documents to be checked 2 before recruitment prospective recruitsemployees should be asked to provide original documents to establish their identity duplicates and photocopies should not under any circumstances be accepted the documents necessary to establish identity will vary according to the nationality of the individual concerned british nationals 3 either full 10 year current british passport or if the subject is over 21 full passport that has lapsed within the last five years or combinati on of at least two of the following preferably 1 british driving licence 2 p45 3 an original long version birth certificate 4 an original short version birth certificate which bears an issue date within six

this appears genuinely to be problem the subject should be asked for passportsized photograph of himself endorsed on the back with the signature of person of some standing in the community eg jp medical practitioner officer in hm forces clerg yman teacher lecturer lawyer bank manager or civil servant and accompanied by signed statement completed by the same person stating the period of time that the subject has been known to him minimum of three years the statement should always be checked to ensure that the signature matches that on the back of the photograph and that it contains legible name address and telephone number in all cases of doubt and for random sample of the others the signatory should be contacted preferably by telephone to check that he did complete the statement and has known the subject for minimum of three years other eu nationals na to recruits for hm forces 5 either full eu passport or an identity card issued by an eu country restricted the

individuals may not be who they say they are there may be number of reasons for such deception including concealment of criminal record b illegal immigration c concealment of identity for the purpose of terrorism or espionage d department of social security fraud 9 any of the above could cause someone to act improperly whilst in government employment eg commit theft or fraud breach the official secrets acts provide false documents for others threaten the safety and wellbeing of staff and members of the public it is thus of considerable importance that care is taken t check documents thoroughly 10 there are number of simple steps which can be taken to verify the documents produced to insist that original documents are produced and not transcripts or photocopies b to examine the documents to ensure that they are originals especially as modern photocopiers produce excellent results comparing them where possible with other examples you may have available restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 2 issue 2 al1 restricted 5a4c to check as far as possible that the paper and typeface are similar to any others you may have to hand or may have examined recently and that the watermark where appropriate is present passports and driving licences invariably contain watermark d to examine the documents for alterations or signs that the photograph andor signature have been removed and replaced an ultraviolet lamp may be useful for this purpose to check that any signature on the documents tallies with other examples in your possession and if practicable ask the prospective employee to sign something in your presence f to check that details given on the documents correspond with what you already know about the individual 11 you should also note the date of issue of the documents presented to you particular care should be taken where documents are recently issued especially if all the documents available to you are new and there is little referee coverage s ee below other means of confirming identity 12 other means of checking documentation may be available to you and they should not be neglected for example adequate referee coverage can provide high level of assurance especially where the reference is given by reputable organisation or by someone known to the recruiting agency however reasonable steps should be taken to ensure that the reference is genuine written references produced by the prospective employee should be treated with care and where possible followed up directly with the organisation concerned particularly where the reference is less than convincing eg on poor quality paper or containing spelling or grammatical errors where someone particularly young person has difficulty providing both evidence of identity and adequate referee coverage it may be appropriate to obtain both from the same person see 4 above action in cases of doubt 13 if after having examined the information available to you doubts remain

chain of command and line management the head of establishment hoe 1802 keeping personnel security under review is continuous process hoes and their subordinates play very important role in ensuring the security of their organisation particularly in respect of personnel security except for personal friends and close colleagues an individuals superior officer is likely to have more detailed and accurate knowledge of himher than anyone else in the organisation 1803 it is particularly noteworthy in that in many recent espionage cases both in the uk and overseas superior officers had been aware to some extent that security problem had arisen but had failed to appreciate its significance or had not realised their responsibility for reporting the matter responsibilities of heads of

protectively marked assets over categorisation of posts is both waste of staff resources and money the responsibility of hoes towards dv posts is detailed at 0906 briefing 1807 the hoe is also responsible for briefing staff on arrival or on change of job about any aspects of the work that might raise issues of security or potential conflicts of interest similarly they may be involved in the briefing of individuals before they are granted access to particularly sensitive assets monitoring staff 1808 the vast majority of staff are security cleared without difficulty and throughout their service never give cause for concern however the mod is reliant on hoes and their subordinates to spot potential difficulties and draw attention to them 1809 hoes and their subordinates are expected to monitor the behaviour of their staff for security they should look out for the types of behaviour described in annex which could suggest that member of staff is unreliable or suscept ible to

their personal lives creating positive security climate 1811 it is unusual for serious security problems to arise with personnel who feel able to express themselves freely and are able to approach superior about problems hoes should create an atmosphere in which those who work for them can feel confident that there will always be sympathetic ear to any matter that they consider might have bearing on security it should be emphasised that such matters will be treated in confidence and discussed if necessary only with the esyo or his staff dealing with problems 1812 when person has expressed any level of concern about security matter the hoe will need to decide whether it is of security significance where the information is not of serious concern reassurance and advice should be offered however where it appears to be serious or its significance is unclear the esyo should be consulted before any further action is taken 1813 should hoe receive security allegations about an individual or about someone elsewhere in government service regardless of their position it should be reported to the esyo unless it is clear that the story is illfounded or malicious the esyo will not assume that any allegation is true without taking steps to verify what has been reported or seeking advice the generic responsibilities of the esyo are shown at jsp 440 volume 1 chapter 2 0227

guidelines for named supervisors of personnel aged under 21 occupying dv posts introduction 1 the role of the supervisor of personnel working in sensitive areas is particularly important one and this is especially so where young people are concerned it is not always possible to avoid employing personnel under 21 years of age in sensitive areas where it proves to be unavoidable special care is ne eded to ensure the close supervision of such personnel who are at an impressionable age and whose character interests and opinions are likely still to be developing 2 the responsibility for the supervision of under 21s filling dv annotated appointments is placed on named supervisors who are directly responsible for the close supervision of the staff assigned to their control the aim of these guid elines is to provide supervisor with clear understanding of what the role entails and what needs to be done to carry out the duties effectively close supervision 3 supervisor will be expected to get to know the individual well and to keep in sufficiently close contact with him to be able to discern any potential problems and any changes in his behaviour or attitudes and to bring them to the attention of hi s hoe without delay this process will require supervisors to be sensitive to the personal problems and concerns of young staff and be prepared to listen sympathetically to them and to encourage them to seek help in resolving any problems they may have which if unchecked could lead to difficulties in the future what to look for 4 guidance is given in annex 18a the vetting authority will advise on what steps if any should be taken to keep problem under both control and review formal duties and specific controls 5 there are certain formal procedures which supervisor must ensure are carried out these include the following limitations on access to sensitive material apart from the standing need to know principle the access of young staff to and restricted defence manual of security 18b2 jsp 440 volume 2 issue 2 al1 restricted involvement with protectively marked and sensitive assets must be limited until the supervisor has formed judgement as to their reliability nd discretion even then access to the most sensitive information and material should continue to be limited as far as is practicable b limitations on areas of responsibility personnel under 21 should not be given sole responsibility for putting away papers and securing protectively marked or sensitive assets at the end of the day and for opening secure areas at start work at least until such time as judgement ca n be formed as to their reliability and discretion c problems for shift workers it is recognized that in shiftworking environment there may be particular difficulties in implementing the measures outlined in these guidelines not least because changes in shifts could well result in supervisors having little contact with individuals in s uch cases an assistant supervisor must be appointed however even when supervisors role is shared the principles governing supervisory responsibilities will remain the same and there will be need to exercise less care in carrying out these duties because they are being shared d regular reports dv clearance for individuals under 21 years of age is subject to annual and other reviews during such reviews the supervisor will be required to provide report on the individuals general reliability and character saf may be used for this purpose at the fina l review both the subject and his immediate superior officer will be interviewed

restricted security advice on travel 195 jsp 440 volume 2 issue 2 al1 restricted 1911 there is an increasing trend towards terrorism without frontiers usama bin laden and groups who have allied themselves with him are the protagonists in this increasingly global threat posing threat across most of the developing world as well as in parts of western europe and the us irish related terrorism has also been responsible for number of attacks on british military personnel abroad in the past and this could occur again 1912 terrorists may use number of alternatives to attack target rather than use direct violence for example terrorist groups are becoming increasingly computer literate and are not only using computers for communications propaganda and the gathering of targeting information but there is the possibility of them being used to carry out harassment or attacks against the government infrastructure there is also steady increase in the number of westerners who are being kidnapped however it is difficult to distinguish whether this is for terrorist or criminal motive s 1913 travellers are most likely to encounter problems of civil disorder in developing countries where civil war andor insurgency are rife or where only fragile system of law enforcement exists 1914 the threat from terrorism is volatile and it would not be practicable to list here the countries

security clearances for transfers detached duty and exchanges introduction 2001 this chapter deals with the notification of security clearances for mod personnel involved in both internal and external transfers many of the internal notification procedures are heavily dependent on singleservice administrative methods which are exclusive to each area the scope of this chapter therefore provides only the broad departmental requirements which will have to be amplifie d in other orders and instructions the overall provision which must apply to this area is that without the requisite level of assurance of probable reliability bas ic check or security clearance access to sensitive information or assets is to be allowed transfers loans or moves to another department agency or company 2002 anyone with current security clearance can carry his clearance with him if he moves or is transferred or loaned to another department agency or company responsibility for ensuring that the security clearance meets the appropriate criteria rests with the importing sector thus the importing sector will ensure that the current clearance is suitable for use in its area of responsibility if the appropriate level of clearance has not been held has lapsed or is close to expiry the exporter is responsible for doing the mandatory investigative work and the importer will then make the final assessment of the findings to judge suitability for trans fer for the conditions governing the transfer of security clearance see 2018 2003 in all cases the receiving organisation has the right to examine the security papers relating to an individual before accepting him on transfer or loan if the individual requires developed vetting dv clearance the relevant papers must be examined before the transfer or loan takes place if the transferee does not have appropriate clearance it is the responsibility of the receiving department to ensure that the correct level of clearance is obtained this should be achieved before the transfer takes place however where this is not possible the subject can be ac cepted at the discretion of the head of establishment 2004 if security check sc or counter terrorist check ctc is required it is normally sufficient for the receiving department to be given written assurance that clearance has been granted for the level required and that information of

at annex 2 all mod service and civilian personnel regardless of the degree of security clearance which they may hold should be aware that they may become objects of interest to the intelligence service of any country listed in annex from the time that they file their visa application with the consulate of the country concerned 3 having identified person of interest an intelligence service may see k to gain hold over that person while they are in the country concerned as described in paragraphs 4 to 11 below surveillance eavesdropping and clandestine entry 4 mod service and civilian personnel the visitor should be aware that local people such as guides particularly if they are english speaking drivers hotel st aff touts and loiterers in tourist resorts commonly act as informers or workers for the local intelligence service visitor may therefore effectively be under surveilla nce for much of the time hotel rooms or the apartments of acquaintances made locally may be subject to eavesdropping by concealed microphones andor surveillance by cameras it may also be assumed that telephones particularly in hotels will be subject to bugging visitors should give indication that they are aware of such operations they must not search for any devices or make any acknowledgement of the fact should device be found accidentally hotel rooms may be clandestinely entered and searched all papers relating to visitors work should be left at secure location entrapment ploys 5 because of the control which the local intelligence service may achieve as result of the methods described above visitors must take special care not to break local laws they must conduct themselves in such way as not to lay themsel ves open to blackmail or pressure visitors must realise that in these

issue 2 al1 restricted alcohol and drugs 6 in many countries drinking alcohol is an accepted form of social behaviour however excessive consumption of alcohol can render an individual susceptible to garrulousness injudicious and antisocial behaviour and possible arrest by police personnel must avoid drunkeness the use of or association with illegal drugs or drug pushing in cssra can easily lead to far greater complications and is now well known as form of entrapment sexual involvement 7 intelligence services use the threat of exposure following sexual involvement with local in order to blackmail visitors into working for them the intell igence services may arrange the liaison itself or may exploit spontaneous liaison visitors should be wary of entering into any friendship which might attract the attention of the local intelligence service homosexual acts whic h are legal in the uk may be contrary to local laws currency transactions 8 it is dangerous for visitor to get involved in illegal currency deals apparently highly advantageous offers to change the local currency for western currency are probably illegal and may be arranged by the local intelligence service intending visitors are advised to obtain the latest information on currency regulations from reputable travel agent bank or state tourist office of the country concerned before leaving the uk these regulations are likely to change and fresh enquiries should be made before each visit blackmarket goods 9 local laws may forbid the sale or purchase of certain goods and deals of this kind may be exploited by the local intelligence service visitors should not be tempted into deals involving the sale of any consumer goods which they have brought with them antiques and religious objects may be subject to stringent local laws on export and visitors must ensure that they have the correct permit before attempting to take these out of the country correspondence and literature 10 local laws may prohibit the import or export of certain types of correspondence or literature visitors must be careful about the type of literature they bring into the country and be very wary about requests to take out correspondence or other literature with them when they leave the possession of these items could lead to prosecution and subsequent pressure to cooperate with the local intelligence service

to places which are normal tourist attractions local sensitivities may be offended by taking photographs and films of poor or less developed areas the taking of such photographs or of photographs near military installations or prohibited areas could lead to accusations of involvement in espionage and exploitation by the local intelligence service when in doubt about taking photograph visitors should ask first defensive measures 13 visitors may be exposed to security dangers if they are detained by the local authorities as result of failing to avoid any of the pitfalls outlined above or as result of infringing any local law or traffic regulation person thus involved may be approached by the local militia or the local intelligence service which might seek to extract promise of cooperation with the authorities in exchange f or an undertaking that charges will be preferred such undertakings should not be given if they can be avoided legal documents admitting to wrongdoing or

many foreign companies are eager to j oin the increasing number of those who are investing their time money and effort in establishing links with china 2 the purpose of this brief is not to discourage the development of trade nor to warn against the financial and legal pitfalls of working in china which incide ntally are many this brief gives advice about chinese intelligence activity and how you can guard against the risks it might pose to you when visiting china chinese intelligence aims 3 chinese intelligence activity is widespread and has voracious appetite fo r all kinds of information political military commercial scientif ic and technical it is on this area that the chinese place their highest priority and where we ssess that the greatest risk lies 4 the chinese have realised that it is not productive to simply steal technology and then try to reverse engineer it through intelligence activity they now attempt to acquire an indepth understanding of production techniques and methodologies there is an obvious economic risk to the uk our hard earned processes at very little cost and then reproduce them with cheap labour 5 it is also potentially more serious than the above in certain key military areas china is at least generation behind the west the chinese may be able to acquire illegally the technology that will enable them to catch up the real danger is that they will then produce advanced weapons systems which they will sell to unstable regimes they have track record of doing so the consequences for the worlds trouble spots and any uk involvement there could be disastrous characteristics of chinese intelligence activity 6 chinese intelligence activity is very different to the portrayal of mosco w rules in the novels of john carre the chinese make distinction between information and intelligence their appetite for information particularly in the restricted defence manual of security 21f2 jsp 440 volume 2 issue 2 al1 restricted scientific and technical field is vast and indiscriminate they do not run agen ts they make friends although there are chinese intelligence officers both civilian and military these fade into insignificance behind the mass of ordinary student s businessmen and locally employed staff who are working at least partt ime on the orders of various parts of the state intelligence gathering apparatus cultivation 7 the process of being cultivated as friend of china ie an agent is subtle and longterm the chinese are adept at exploiting visitors interest i n and appreciation of chinese history and culture they are expert flatterers and are well aware of the softening effect of food and alcohol under cover of consultation or lecturing visitor may be given favours advantageous economic conditions or commercial opportunities in return they will be expected to give information or access to material or at the very least to speak out on chinas behalf becoming an agent of influence locally engaged staff 8 most companies operating in china are obliged to employ number of locally engaged staff supplied by organisations such as the provincial friendship labour services corporation it is probable that the chinese civilian intelligence service will have briefed such staff to copy all papers to which they are able to gain access many chinese students and some businessmen also work to brief from the chinese intelligence services technical attacks 9 the chinese intelligence services are known to employ telephone and electronic bugs in hotels and restaurants they have also been known to search hotel rooms and to use surveillance techniques against visitors of particular inter est compromise 10 the chinese intelligence services have been known to use blackmail to persuade visitors to work for them sexual involvement should be avoided as should any activity which can possible be construed as illegal this would include dealing in blackmarket currency or chinese antiques and artefacts straying into forbidden areas or injudicious use of camera or video recorder what you should do 11 this brief has warned you about the aims of chinese intelligence activity and indicated some of the means they use to obtain intelligence the steps you take to protect yourself your department or agency your company and the uk are up to you restricted security directions for countries to which special security regulations apply cssra 21f3 jsp 440 volume 2 issue 2 al1 restricted 12 common sense will tell you to be careful in your dealings so that you do not give away more than you mean to or find yourself in position where you will feel obliged to do more for the chinese than you know you ought careful use of the telephone and postal system will prevent you from giving away free information by avoiding indiscreet and injudicious behaviour you will prevent yourself from being compromised if the worst case happens and you are arrested and charged or if you have been caught in an embarrassing situation you should always insist on being immediately allowed to contact the british embassy immediately restricted defence manual of security 21f4 jsp 440 volume 2 issue 2 al1

brief for visits to russia and the former soviet republics about this brief 1 the purpose of this brief is to provide security advice for travellers to russia and the rest of the former soviet union fsu it describes both the risks involved in travelling to russia and the other former soviet republics and the action to be taken should trouble arise the information in the brief is based on the actual experiences of recent travellers to the fsu why should i read this brief 2 as visitor to russia and the fsu you may attract the attention of the local security and intelligence services although most travellers experience little or trouble it would be unwise for you to assume you are immune to this attention as you will see from the examples given in this brief all visitors to rus sia and the fsu are potentially of interest to foreign intelligence services irres pective of the purpose of the visit what are the rfis after 3 in view of the poor state of the russian economy the russian federation intelligence services rfis place high priority on information to bolster their economy scientific and technical information and on information to help advance their political influence this extends to the theft of patents and to seeking detailed information on western scientific developments they also have an interest in political reporting alongside their more traditional targets such as we stern defence and security eg nato the svr foreign intelligence service and t he gru military intelligence try to recruit british subjects to work for them in the united kingdom and elsewhere often initially in minor support roles they are always on the watch for any british subject who may be induced either wittingly or unwittingly to cooperate they do not necessarily concentrate on those who already have access to information of value to them restricted defence manual of security 21g2 jsp 440 volume 2 issue 2 al1 restricted the approach to overseas visitors 4 from the moment visitor enters the country he or she may be reported on by wide variety of people including officials business contacts tourist guides hotel employees and apparent casual contacts people who speak the visitors own language may be introduced in such way as to make him think that it was the visitor who took the initiative or that their meeting was entirely fortuitous we know it sounds like spy movie but as well as having wide networks of agents and informers the fsb russian security service makes extensive use of sophisticated technical devices in the main hotels all telephones can be tapped and in some rooms visual or photographic surveillance can be carried out if necessary using infrared cameras to take photographs in the dark if is perfectly possible for the fsb to ensure that the visitor is placed in such room there is also wide range of technical devices which can be used outside and even in places such as restaurants and cars these technical devices pick up indiscreet talk which could be of use to the fsb methods of compromise 5 careful behaviour should be sufficient to avoid difficulties with the fsb but visitors should bear in mind that they can get into trouble in many ways unofficial financial transactions such as obtaining local currency at favourable rates or selli ng personal possessions to acquaintances are all in contravention of local laws russian friend or acquaintance may ask visitor to deliver letter or present to some relative living in the west but this is again in breach of loca l regulations taking works of art out of russia is serious offence while drinkdriving regulations are rigorous there are strict rules about taking photographs in russia and it is advisable to find out in advance where cameras may be used 6 irregularity in personal behaviour may also lead to trouble the fsb may attempt to capitalise on sexual liaisons between visitors and local national s in addition the fsb may attempt to compromise and subsequently blackmail through knowledge of marital infidelity or sexual activity the target may wish to hide risk of arrest 7 visitor who commits any offence against local laws runs the risk of be ing arrested and threatened with the withdrawal of business facilities im prisonment or exposure unless he or she agrees to work for the fsb attempts may be made t induce the victim to sign confession or to agree to cooperate alternatively the evidence may be stored away for use at later date perhaps when their circumstances have changed for example after the visitor has married or entered different field of employment restricted security directions for countries to which special security regulations apply cssra 21g3 jsp 440 volume 2 issue 2 al1 restricted 8 visitors may face any of these hazards whenever they visit russia but the fsb is especially active during trade fairs at these times particular care should be taken svr and gru approaches worldwide 9 as general point it should be borne in mind that both the svr and gru are known to have approached british nationals in particular businessmen in many parts of the world the threat is especially high in some third world countries where the rfis believe they have little to fear from the local security services people who have been regular visitors to russia are more likely to come to notice since the fsb will hold some record of their personal details which can be passed onto the svr and the gru an indiscretion or irregularity committed in russia even if apparently unnoticed at the time may be exploited by rfis officers elsewhere in addition rfis officers may make approaches using the cover of another nationality for example eastern european or scandinavian to disguise their true allegiance advice about visits to other former soviet republics 10 visitors to the other former soviet republics should heed the advice given to visitors to russia although these republics now have their own independent security services many of them continue to cooperate closely with the rfis the rfis are so comfortable operating in some former soviet republics that they rega rd them as virtually home territory the advice about compromising offences and risk of arrest also applies it should be noted that many of these republics are not used to western visitors and may pay particular attention to them final point 11 visitors to any foreign country should remember that it is in their own interests to tell the british authorities abroad the embassy high comm ission or consulate or the police at home if they have been in trouble or if they suspect that foreign intelligence service is interested in them anything they say will be treated as strictly confidential and advice on how to avoid any further difficulties wil l be offered general security advice 12 knowledge of the risks can do much to help the visitor to russia avoid difficulties every visitor should restricted defence manual of security

they are primarily concerned with accumulating scientific fence and technical information as well as biographical information about individuals for possible exploitation at later date intelligence

accreditation 01069 accreditation can fall into 4 basic categories full accreditation the target for all permanently installed it systems b interim accreditation constrained authorisation of limited duration and scope which has been planned c conditional accreditation constrained authorisation of limited duration and scope which has not been planned d legacy approval legacy systems are retained systems if they are noncompliant with current accreditation practices or security standards their continued operation has to be accepted on case by case basis it is government wide requirement that all systems in service on 31 december 2000 are accredited and hence any systems approved on legacy basis must be brought up to standard where at least conditional accreditation can be issued before that time unclassified an introduction to cis security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 113 unclassified 01070 more detailed information on the categories of accreditation are contained in chapter 2 01071 complex systems may require the use of formal evaluation and certification as detailed at chapter 6 and this is largely dependant which of one of four distinct modes of operation known as the mode of secure operation that the cis can be categorised as operating within dedicated security mode mode of operation in which all the users of system are cleared for needtoknow about and have access to all the data handled by it evaluation and certification will normally be required for such systems b system high security mode mode of operation in which the users of system are all cleared for and have formal access approval for all the information handled by it but not all of whom actually needtoknow about all of the data c compartmented security mode mode of operation in which the users are all cleared for but do not have formal access approval for all the data handled by the system d multilevel secure mls mode mode of operation in which computer system or network of computer systems handles data at various protective markings etc but for which there are users not cleared for all that data and whose access is restricted appropriately 01072 special case of dedicated mode is session processing mode which permits the use of dedicated machine at different protective marking levels of data by using separate media sets if this method is to be used the additional paragraphs in chapter 3 annex s will require to be added to system security instructions integrity and availability 01073 this policy recognises that for official information systems the protection of integrity and availability merits equal consideration with the protection of confidentiality it introduces the following new definitions of the two terms integrity the assurance that information has been created amended or deleted only by the proper actions of authorised users availability timely access to assets by authorised users 01074 the purpose of integrity protection is to give adequate and appropriate assurance against the risk of it assets being created amended or deleted other than by appropriately authorised users unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 114 unclassified 01075 the purpose of availability protection is to give adequate and appropriate assurance against the risk of loss of timely access to it assets by authorised users 01076 this policy further recognises that integrity and availability are primarily system or service properties integrity and availability protection requirements will normally be assessed at the system level though specific countermeasures may be applied at low er levels 01077 in assessing the protective requirements for official information s ystems the security objectives of integrity and availability shall be considered alongside that of confidentiality the different natures of the three security objectives are recognised but it is acknowledged that failure to safeguard any one of them can result in the compromise of information or other assets 01078 integrity and availability protection requirements shall be establishe d for all systems and networks storing processing or transmitting official

as appropriate 01080 for each of integrity and availability the risk assessment process shall assign systems to one of two protection requirement ranges standard or enhanced and shall consider which supporting security services are relevant see chapter 6 annex b 01081 countermeasures can be drawn from several different security fields often operating in combination the two protective ranges are each associated wit h levels and types of countermeasures that are therefore indicative only see countermeasures below protection shall respond primarily to any specific risks highlighted by the risk assessment 01082 it is recognised that in the case of certain applications eg in nuclea r or air safety contexts the possible consequences of loss or compromise of integrity or availability may be so catastrophic that enhanced measures special to these fields will always be required even if the threat is assessed as only slight business continuity 01083 disruption can arise due to the failure of

discussion of the united kingdoms defence and counterterrorist policy and overall strategy does not impose threat to national security and is welcomed by government it is important however that such discussion should not disclose details which could damage uk national security the defence advisory notice system is means of providing advice and guidance to the uk media about defence and counter terrorist information the publication of which would be damaging to the uks national security the system is voluntary it has legal authority and the final responsibility for deciding whether or not to publish rests solely with the editor or publisher concerned 2 da notices formerly dnotices are issued by the defence press and broadcasting advisory committee dpbac an advisory body composed of senior civil servants and editors from national and regional newspapers periodicals news agencies television and radio membership of the committee is given on pages 8 and 9 it operates on the shared belief that there is continuing need for system of guidance and advice such as the da notice system and that voluntary advi sory basis is best for such system 3 the current edition of the da notices was issued in 1993 and recognises the changed circumstances following the break up of the soviet union and warsaw pact and the uks involvement in smallerscale conflicts the undiminished threat from terrorist attacks and the risk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction it also takes account of the continued targeting of the uk by foreign intelligence services 4 compliance with the da

principles 1 the protection of information is covered in some detail in other volumes of the defence manual of security the purpose of this annex is to consider some of the implications particularly when information is held on it systems 2 in general terms all information has some value whether that repr esents the value of resources spent on its collection and recording or the value that can be gained from its exploitation when assessing its value judgement has to be made on the degree of damage likely to be caused to government assets caused by compromise the cause of compromise can be broken down into four general groups 1 disclosure 2 theft 3 destruction 4 tampering b based on an assessment of the outcome of such compromise all assets whether information or physical items are allocated protective marking table setting out these criteria is at appendix 1 to this annex c also in general terms information can be owned and the owner can and should be responsible for determining its level of protection see paragraph 5 below this includes information released to the uk government by international agreement or on commercial basis 3 information concerned with the business of government or service activit ies which crown servant or government contractor has by his or her position as such is deemed to be official and the communication of any official information to any person other than one authorised to receive it is expressly forbidden by the official unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 1c2 unclassified secrets act the originator of official information is not therefore the owner of tha t information the rules for the protection of official information are based on the allocation of protective marking the criteria for which are set out in other security publications the authority to allocate protective marking is limited to ce rtain ranks and appointments although in an emergency the originator of document of any rank may authorize any protective marking provided the definitions laid down are used and can be justified national caveats 4 instructions for the use of national caveats are promulgated in other security publications but some important extracts are set out here with regard to the t wo core national caveats uk eyes only information bearing the national caveat uk eyes only is not to be released to any other country and within uk government service is strictly to be confined to those staff as deta iled in jsp 440 volume 1 it should be used sparingly originators are reminded that indiscriminate use can lead to transmission and custody difficulties and it should only be used where there is real risk that information whose uncontrolled disclosure would cause real damage to the uk may inadvertently or unwitt ingly be disclosed to those who are outside the listed categories it should not be used where the originator wishes to indicate that information is not to be releas ed to particular country in such cases this should be indicated in the text eg this information is not to be passed to the ruritanians b uk eyes discretion information bearing the national caveat uk eyes discretion is not to be released to any other country nor to any other than person in the above category or on discretionary basis to slightly wider category listed in jsp 440 volume 1 information may be released by originators or owners of the information only to those detailed in chapter 16 of volume 1 in marking material with this caveat the originator is delegating his release authority including that of the protective marking to the named recipients ie named individual or specific post it may therefore at the named recipients discretion be released to other uk and dual nationals provided one nationality is british and exchangeintegrated officers and officers on attachment to uk armed forces only where the conditions detailed in chapter 16 of volume 1 are met it thus provides flexibility for named recipients to make valued judgement on further dissemination immediately and without reference to the originator of the information but having regard to the release of

on particular subject will attract m andatory protective marking mandatory degrees of protection are also associated with proje cts covered by codewords of various kinds and statistical records in these cases the originator of an item of information may not protectively mark it lower tha n the mandatory prescribed level in information technology it terms the degree of protection is owned by the authority setting the mandatory level and the originator is the holder of that protective marking this is an extension to the existing ru in other security documentation whereby holders of documents protectively marked confidential and all documents protectively marked secret or higher have to consult the originator if they consider regrading is necessary aggregation of information 6 the sensitivity of information is greatly influenced by the context in whi ch it is or can be viewed the aggregation of information and its exploitation by electronic processing is the basis of the it revolution the security of set of information may attract higher degree of protection than an individual record and the originator of piece of information may be unaware of its ultimate sensitivities for instance the reliability of fleet of vehicles is of higher sensitivity than for s ingle vehicle if that fleet could be more closely defined as essential to an operational theatre then it would be higher still the it system manager acting on behalf of his command au thority may need to take advice on the degree of protection necessary for such aggregated information and to assign higher mandatory level to computer document after processing there may also be need to anticipate an overall degree of protection for the it system which allows for aggregation of user data this may be parti cularly important when considering the level of compromise which might result from the destruction or tampering of database in some cases it may be possible to employ the opposite effect of decreasing

chapter 1 annex d as with accreditation it is important that the compartment infosec representatives cir are approached as early as possible to ensure any additional requirements are identified should the cirs not be known to project offices then the dsso should be consulted 02060 accreditation panel where an cis system does not fall solely within the boundaries of single accreditators remit connects to departments or organisations outside mod or holds information belonging to departments or organisations outside mod an accreditation panel ap will probably need to be established wit h representatives for all accreditors and from the project office in most such cases the dsso will normally choose to staff the chairing of such panels 02061 the ap will normally be an infrequent group which would form only when specific accreditation issues arise they will be chaired by t he lead accreditor with secretariat functions provided by the affected projects or systems routine security issues should continue to be progressed through security working groups swg membership would normally be restricted to the accreditors and necessary cis security agencies 02062 there are number of standing accreditation bodies in existence for instance the multinational security accreditation board msab which deals with cce b and nato accreditations and projects should consult the dsso when planning accreditation timescales as there are benefits to defence in utilising such s tanding bodies rather than convening multitude of separate aps with broadly similar representation security accreditation principles 02063 an accreditation is defined in hmg infosec standards as formal statement by the accreditors confirming that the use of system to store process or forward official information under the conditions specified in the security policy documentation spd meets the security requirement and does not present an unacceptable risk it is reviewed against the provision of adeq uate risk management procedures against all 8 facets of security as laid down at chapter 1 02064 accreditation of system or network is achieved by security staffs independently reviewing and agreeing the best fit of techniques and technologies to the business needs it therefore confirms for both the data owners and for the system operating authority soa that confidentiality provisions of the implementation do not present an unacceptable risk to the information being processed and that appropriate asset protection for integrity and availabili ty is in place unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 216 unclassified 02065 the goal of the accreditation process will be to gather evidence to be presented to the accreditors that residual risks have be minimised to an acceptable level for most nontechnical facets of security the evidence will be demonstration of compliance with mod baseline security standards for the 3 technical infos ec facets compusec comsec and radsec as well as compliance with baseline securit standards the organisations responsible for the systems implementation should demonstrate that significant exploitable vulnerabilities or risks of fai lure of security functionality exist 02066 additionally accreditation is required for the installation of additional equipment within an existing infrastructure or for connection to exist ing systems or networks to the connection will not adversely affect the security of the exist ing infrastructure 02067 accreditation is given on the basis of both the security policy documentation and physical instantiations for sensitive or complex syste ms the accreditation will involve detailed examination of system specific security requirements agreed between system management and security staff and may require an assessment of the degree to which the system meets these requirement s for such systems configuration control is of great importance further advice on configuration management is given at paragraph 02098 to this chapter 02068 although risk management approach is taken it must be realised that there are certain national minimum standards including baseline measures with which mod is obliged to comply 02069 where an accreditor exercises discretion to vary the requirement from that laid down in national or departmental regulations this will be done on the basis of specific risk assessment for the systemsaffected requirements for dispensations below national minimum standards are laid down later in this chapter in cases where an accreditor has to raise the requirements the specific risks addressed must be documented in the spd 02070 to aid understanding of the way in which accreditation is achieved and maintained generic schematic of how is given at annex i risk acceptance 02071 the accreditation process works in conjunction with the need for operational authorization which is subsequent management approval process whereby the system operating authoritys soa and data owners accept any residual risks identified by the accreditation process the senior responsible officer is the individual who accepts the risk 02072 an accreditation status

440 volume 3 issue 2 217 unclassified 02073 full accreditation the target for all permanently installed cis should be to achieve full accreditation which will be full compliance with all the spd as endorsed by the accreditors in such circumstances the accreditation ce rtificate will be countersigned by the accreditor and representative of the system operating authoritys soa and data owners and thereby grants operational authorization as well an example of an accreditation certificate is given at annex i appendix 1 02074 interim accreditation where permanently installed cis is does not fully meet the target of accreditation but the shortfalls are as result of phased syst em development constrained interim authorization of limited duration and scope as defined in the certificate can be issued instead typically to permit in stallation testing commissioning and initial operating capability ioc 02075 in such circumstances the accreditation certificate will be countersigned by the accreditor and representative of the system operating authority s soa and data owners and thereby grants operational authorization as we ll it will be issued for short period normally of either 3 or 6 months after which review is required for renewal and continual renewals are not acceptable as substitute for full accreditation an example of an accreditation certificate is give n at annex i appendix 1 02076 conditional accreditation for permanently installed cis which do not fully meet the target of accreditation whose shortfalls are of an unplanned nature eg minor vulnerabilities found by evaluation or from unscheduled minor changes constrained conditional authorization of limited duration and scope as defined in the certificate can be issued conditional accreditation can also be used in planned manner for short duration installations such as prototypedemonstrator systems and quick notice deployments where the full accreditation cycle would be nugatory effort the need for conditional accreditation of short notice operations was formerly referred to as operational exigency approvals 02077 in view of the increased risk being taken in such circumstances the accreditation certificate as signed by the accreditor will spec ifically itemised the shortfalls against the target of accreditation for unplanned instances or against national and departmental standards for short duration installations the countersignature in these cases must be made by senior representative of not less than 2 level of the system operating authoritys soa and data owners who in so doing accepts the risk and thereby grants operational authorization 02078 it is stressed that conditional accreditation must only be issued in respect of cis or network wholly within the signatorys jurisdiction

and applies in all instances even if the equipment does not store or process protectively marked information it should be noted that all it equipment requires security approval and the relevant security authority should be consulted in the first instance before procurement begins principles 2 in order to ensure the confidentiality integrity and availability of all it equipment within the mod and to comply with both national and mod regulations it is essentia l that the relevant security authority and ida andor cida are notified in advance of all new requirements andor when changes to the types locations classifications or numbers of equipments installed are proposed the cida will vet all designs and proposals of new systems and incorporate them into existing drawings and plans see appendix 1 3 the primary concern is that systems processing protectively marked information are installed and operated in such way that they do not compromise their own security or that of other systems in the vicinity it is also important that unclassified systems are reviewed by the appropriate security authority both to ensure that the equipment and its installation does not affect or assist in the escape of emanations from classi fied systems tempest and to minimise the risks to the confidentiality integrity and vailability of systems and data eg from hacker and virus attacks

generic threat introduction 1 the origins and nature of the threats to information processed electronically are similar to those for information held in other forms this statement concentr ates on aspects in which the threats to information which are particular to informat ion technology it it does not consider the risks from hazards such as fire or flood in particular it does not give advice on specific countermeasures which should be implemented as result of vulnerability and risk assessment for given sy stem 2 this statement covers the general threat to it systems in special situations eg northern ireland specific threat assessment should be obtained through the security chain of command origins of the threat 3 foreign intelligence services the collection of defence scientific and technical information is high priority for foreign intelligence services fis the increased use of it to process store and distribute large quantities of protectively marke d information including critical operational data will make it systems an attra ctive target for fis and it is likely that they will seek ways of exploiting any secu rity weaknesses which they discover nevertheless fis are likely to be inhibited from carrying out operations against it systems by the difficulty of obtaining adequate access in host ile environment and in peacetime by the risk of discovery and consequent embarrassment the threat from fis may rise significantly during the early stages of transition to war ttw but will fall after the withdrawal of diplomatic and trade missi ons prior to the outbreak of war 4 subversive organizations and individuals subversive organizations are often opposed to the use of it by the state and may exploit opportunities to penetrate and disrupt them there is however evidence that any subversive group or individual has sought to acquire protectively marked information from it systems or has the resources to mount technical attack sabotage is the most likely form of attack if any easy opportunity is presented especially in mainland europe restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 3b2 restricted 5 members and sympathizers of terrorist groups the international elements which pose threat to british interests include state sponsors of terrorism and indivi dual terrorist groups they might have an interest in acquiring specific information perceive d by them to be of direct relevance to their interests the difficulty that they would have in obtaining access to it systems holding protectively marked information would however be likely to deter them from deploying resources to this end such information might though be of interest to them should it become easily accessible 6 authorized users it systems are particularly vulnerable to persons who as authorized users of terminals may for whatever reason endeavour to disrupt the system or to obtain information which they may have need to know such persons may range from the merely curious through those who have grudge to agents of fis experience has shown that at least half the attempts to hack into systems arise from this group and that external hackers use social engineering techniques to trick authorised users into revealing information which may aid an external penetration 7 the media investigative journalists are increasingly interested in state it sys tems particularly those operated by the police and the security and intelligence agencies there has been evidence of premeditated attempts to acquire protectively marke d information from it systems 8 members of the public the fact that information held electronically may be open to novel forms of surreptitious attack provides special attraction to certain individuals commonly known as hackers whilst the efforts of hackers are unlikely to be directed specifically against protectively marked information there is added kudos in breaking into defence systems so much information might be discovered fortuitously this threat is enhanced by the spread of computer literacy and the publicity given to the use of internet and similar data services in particular there is high threat to any unprotected it system connected to the public telephone network 9 theft and loss and capture there is ample evidence that it hardware and components are attractive targets for theft by the criminal community the smal l size of modern portable computers and in particular storage media associated with it systems have frequently led to loss for operational systems the risk of capture has to be assessed methods of attack 10 agent penetration as with information held in other forms the most likely method of attack on electronicallyprocessed protectively marked information is through an agent within an organization who has legitimate access either as user or as an it specialist such as an engineer or programmer apart from seeing copying or otherwise procuring protectively marked information an agent may be able to subvert system restricted security policy documentation jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 3b3 restricted security by modifying or circumventing the software or hardware controls to allow unauthorized disclosure corruption or destruction of the information the growing use of computer networks presents particular opportunities for this form of attack it is even possible for specialist agent to set up means for an attack for example through software modification which will lie dormant until activated by person or event at later date possibly long after the agent has left his job the uncontrolled use of remote diagnostic facilities may also create opportunities for attack especially when conduc ted from outside the united kingdom 11 malicious software range of malicious techniques have been developed to exploit the vulnerability of computer software to unauthorized or unknown modification the boundaries between different types of malicious software are not always clearcut but generally they fall into one or more of the following viruses trojan horses logic bombs worms and mobile code malicious software is now widespread and the speed of infection is increased by the use of interconnected and distributed systems 12 interception and tempest like all communications links data links are vulnerable to interception particularly when transmitted by radio relay most long distance communications involve radio relay links in addition many types of electronic equipment emit unintended informationbearing radiation tempest which may also be detected the tempest threat in the united kingdom is generally very low except for some sites in the greater london area in northwest europe and in other commands where sites can be in close proximity to foreign diplomatic premise s or ships the threat is higher 13 terrorism and sabotage the controlled operating environment required by mainframe computers make them vulnerable through the disruption of essential services such as airconditioning and most it hardware is itself fragile terrorist or sabotage attack could therefore result in denial of service and the incidental loss or damage of information there is however evidence that any group has ever considered mounting such an attack specifically against protectively marked information in ttw and war sabotage teams may be expected to operate 14 network penetration the technical expertise available to fis and the criminal hacker community is high and probably exceeds other groups it does not preclude such expertise being purchased such hackers will target defence systems and in particular those with little or security protection in the hope of collating aggreg ated information they will make use of social engineering lying normally over the telephone to obtain background information before mounting an attack even if their activities do not lead to compromise by unauthorised disclosure of information they may well corrupt or delete critical parts of system data or software restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 3b4 restricted conclusion 15 the main threat to the compromise of protectively marked information on i t systems comes from authorized users who may for whatever motive disrupt the sys tem or gain access to protectively marked information which they have need to know there is also threat from fis which are likely to try to exploit any s ecurity weakness of which they become aware the threat from subversive and terrorist organizations criminal activity

system output 0427 introduction and scope this section describes alternative methods for handling output from computer systems to those generally adopted when implementing security regulations the implication of running multilevel and compartmented modes of secure operation is that the system is trusted to maintain security and needtoknow it may do so by labelling information and this can form the basis for applying security markings to output in accordance with departmental security instructions hence multilevel and compartmented systems are not discuss ed further in this section the implication for system high and dedicated modes of secure operation however is that little or such trust in upholding separation is placed on the system hence all information on the system has to be treated as potentially of the highest level of protective marking ndor category on the system b too rigid an implementation of this policy has led to output from dedicated or system high systems being routinely protectively marked as if i t were of the highest protective marking or category it may then have to be recorded in mod form 102 if bearing protective marking label higher than its actual content it should be downgraded and this event too has to be recorded in the mod form 102 in situations where very little of the information on system is at the highest protective marking the effort involved in following such policy may be immense this section describes alternative methods for protectively marking printed or magnetic output other forms of output such as direct links to other it systems electronic mail etc are to be treated as for the highest level of information the system stores processes or retains 0428 printed and other humanreadable output plain printed text or other output the nature and meaning of which can be readily assessed by the originator is to be protectively marked according to its content this is in line with the genera l requirements of other security documentation format legibility and volume of output are to be within reasonable bounds technical schematic or large volumes of data are not suitable for such uncontrolled output and should therefore be protectively marked as for the highest protective marking the system processes the output should be inspected to ensure that the security protective marking is correct 0429 output to magnetic media national technical security advice is that magnetic media is ways to attract the highest protective marking that has ever been held on it so it systems work most efficiently by transferring blocks of data between the central processor and any magnetic media drives regardless of how much of the blocks contain unrelated data possibly at higher protective marking small it unclassified media management jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 411 unclassified systems in particular occasionally use media for temporary storage often without the knowledge of the user b accordingly all magnetic media mounted on it systems must be treated as for the highest protective marking on that system and colourcoded diskettes have been introduced to help implement this rule where however there is need to produce magnetic output from system at some lower protective marking than that of the system for example for transferring data between systems the following rules are to be followed 1 the procedures for handling all output are to be incorporated into the system security operating procedures syops and submitted for approval by the appropriate security authority prior to using the system the agreed syops are to be brought to the attention of all users on regular basis 2 it is preferable that previously unused media be used but old media may be used provided it has never attracted protective marking higher than that of the intended output disks or diskettes are first to be formatted using system at the target protective marking or less following transfer of the output data the media is then to be write protected before following the next step 3 the content of the media is then to be verified on the output system or one running at an equivalent protective marking using suitable utilities software which will display the entire contents in block format the originator is to inspect the contents and assess the protective marking of all the information found the media is then immediately to be removed and given the appropriate security marking if any and thereafter treated in accordance with existing security regulations c summary with the prior approval of the accreditor it may be permissible for information on dedicated or system high it systems to be output at lower protective marking than that of the system itself this upholds the general principle that information is to be protectively marked acco rding to its content the methods to be used are to be documented in the systems syops approved by the accreditor and then promulgated to all users control procedures for protectively marked it systems hard copy output 0430 the following is to be implemented with regard to hard copy output that requires protective marking protectively marked hard copy output is to

time it leaves the printer until it is received by the originator is dispatched by approved means or destroyed 0431 hard copy output from program testing programs are to be tested as far as possible using unclassified dummy data when it is necessary to use live protectively marked data the hard copy output is to be treated as protectively marked hard copy output from test runs is not to be allowed to accumulate but is to be destroyed when longer required 0432 graphs charts drawings etc output from other peripherals such as plotters which produce eyereadable material should be dealt with in the same way as textual print 0433 computer output to microform com user identification and job identification should be shown on both microfilm and microfiche in eyereadable form the frames of top secret and secret output are to be serially numbered and the last frame indicated tight physical control is to be exercised over the com devices microfilmmicrofiche including checks on film waste and film counters where counters are available then record is to be kept of the serial numbers and the jobs they relate to when duplication of the film is necessary close check is to be made on the authority to reproduce on material used and on film counters the use of nonre settable or locked counters should be considered 0434 paper tape the output from paper tape punches presents additional problems in that it is more difficult to identify the protective marking of the content the following measures will be necessary where possible the program or controlling system software should punch at the beginning of the paper tape information on the identity of the job its owner and the security protective marking of the output this should be carried out in plain language however if this is not possible means must be readily available for the interpretation of the information as an essent ial part of the output identification procedure unclassified media management jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 413 unclassified 0435 treatment of protectively marked documents or information longer required good security requires the amount of protectively marked information to be kept to minimum

retained unnecessarily storage and custody of protectively marked documents 0436 all protectively marked it documents as described above and ancillary materials are to be stored when not in use to approved standards as described in jsp 440 volume 1 0437 where it is necessary to restrict access to particular type of i nformation to cleared personnel with strict needtoknow it may be necessary to

process which overwrites the data making it unrecoverable through systems interface eg keyboard essentially it gives only need to know protection b purging the eradication of data such that it can be expected to withstand recovery even under an attack employing sophisticated specialised hardware two types of erasure are permissible this permits the rele ase of the media from government custody and

repr esents the value of resources spent on its collection and recording or the value that can be gained from its exploitation when assessing its value judgement has to be made on the degree of damage likely to be caused to government assets caused by compromise the cause of compromise can be broken down into four general groups i disclosure ii theft iii destruction iv tampering b based on an assessment of the outcome of such compromise all assets whether information or physical items are allocated protective marking table setting out these criteria is at appendix 1 to this annex c also in general terms information can be owned and the owner can and should be responsible for determining its level of protection see paragraph 5 below this includes information released to the uk government by international agreement or on commercial basis 3 information concerned with the business of government or service activit ies which crown servant or government contractor has by his or her position as such is deemed to be official and the communication of any official information to any unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume issue 2 4a2 unclassified person other than one authorised to receive it is expressly forbidden by the official secrets act the originator of official information is not therefore the owner of tha t information the rules for the protection of official information are based on the allocation of protective marking the criteria for which are set out in other security publications the authority to allocate protective marking is limited to ce rtain ranks and appointments although in an emergency the originator of document of any rank may authorize any protective marking provided the definitions laid down are used and can be justified national caveats 4 instructions for the use of national caveats are promulgated in other security publications but some important extracts are set out here with regard to the t wo core national caveats uk eyes only information bearing the national caveat uk eyes only is not to be released to any other country and within uk government service is strictly to be confined to those staff as deta iled in jsp 440 volume 1 it should be used sparingly originators are reminded that indiscriminate use can lead to transmission and custody difficulties and it should only be used where there is real risk that information whose uncontrolled disclosure would cause real damage to the uk may inadvertently or unwitt ingly be disclosed to those who are outside the listed categories it should not be used where the originator wishes to indicate that information is not to be releas ed to particular country in such cases this should be indicated in the text eg this information is not to be passed to

secret red top secret 2 this media is to be used for computer wordprocessing and other information technology it equipment which processes stores or forwards information protectively marked confidential or above non colourcoded diskettes are only to be used on unclassified or restricted it equipment 3 hence subject to paras 4 and 5 below diskettes are only to be used if they are of the colour appropriate to the highest protective marking of information for w hich the equipment has been cleared see table above this also applies to diskettes which contain programs or system software 4 when it is necessary to import data using diskette of lower protective ma rking the writeprotect mechanism is to be used to prevent inadvertently writing more highly protectively marked data on to the diskette and the rules which describe such use are to be included in the equipments security operating procedures syops equipment with fixed disks 5 where equipment has already been approved for use at different protective markings at different times dedicated sessions then the appropriately coloured or non colourcoded diskette may be used provided the equipment has first been purged of more

displayed on the wrapping and may be regarded as unclassified until the packaging is broken baseunit security officer s are to record by serial number the issue of packs to users since each diskette is to be individually accounted for this will help security staff to trace the origin of misplaced media 7 once taken into use as soon as the wrapping is broken the individual items are to be treated as protectively marked documents they are to be labelled and recorded as appropriate when recording the diskette in classified or other appropriate document register the unique serial numbers printed on the diskettes are to be used 8 there may be great number of protectively marked non colourcoded diskettes which need replacing staff are reminded that copying of data is to be performed on appropriately cleared equipment and that the copying of protectively marked documents including diskettes is to be recorded in an appropriate manner 9 unless the protectively marked non colourcoded diskettes which have been replaced or superseded meet the criteria laid down in chapter 4 they may not be declassified nor downgraded but must be physically destroyed by an approved method nb before

unclassified media management jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 4c1 unclassified annex c to chapter 4 erasure for reuse or disposal introduction 1 when it equipment becomes surplus to requirements care must be taken to ensure that its disposal does not expose any protectively marked material which it has processed or stored to an unacceptable risk of compromise this guidance applies to all types of computer storage media magnetic disks and tapes optical disks magn etic computer memory and semiconductor memory where it is impractical to separate the computer storage media from the equipment of which it is part the guidance should be taken to apply to the whole equipment 2 this annex provides guidance to the owners of communications and information systems on the security aspects of reuse or disposal of protectively marked computer storage media as an alternative to destruction the deletion of computer files and data generally only suppresses that information from immediate view and makes the area of storage available for overwriting the deleted inf ormation can usually be recovered with minimal expertise using cots utility software cure erasure of protectively markedmarked data requires more deliberate erasure procedure to specified overwriting or degaussing standard which will positivel verify that secure erasure has occurred 3 the physical properties of storage media are such that even after thorough overwriting minute electrical or magnetic effects may rema in however it is technically complex operation requiring specialist equipment and considerable resources to recover usable data threats 4 the threat of protectively marked data being compromised is lowest w hen storage media is released for reuse within the same or equivalent security environme nt the threat is significantly increased when storage media is released outs ide the secure environment disposal of storage media on the open market by resale or recycling increases the potential for data falling accidentally into the wrong hands or being positively targeted the threat may relate to the attractiveness of the dat to an attacker unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2

d all data with uk eyes caveats secure erasure 6 secure erasure defines more thorough process than deletion and may comprise of any of the following depending on the security risk assessment clearing process which overwrites the data making it unrecoverable through systems interface eg keyboard b purging the eradication of data such that it can be expected to withstand recovery even under an attack employing sophisticated specialised hardware it is not possible to give categorical assurance that purging will be sufficient in all circumstances however successful attack is likely to be both technically difficult and expensive and the risk can often be dismissed unless the data is likely to be particularly attractive to the attacker c destruction physical destruction of the media which may be preferred when the residual risk after purging is considered unacceptable 7 the success of the erasure should be positively verified if there is large quantity of storage media for reuse it may be decided that verification of sample rather than whole batch is sufficient to manage the risk secure erasure standards 8 the security equipment assessment panel seap is an organisation of the cabinet office responsible for physical security equipment the seap catalogue of security equipment cse offers approved degaussing equipment for the secure erasure of media 9 the degaussing process detailed in the equipment user manual is to be strictly followed after degaussing representative sample of all degaussed media that previously contained protectively marked information is to be checked by attempting to read data from the degaussed medium to give confidence that erasure has taken place after degaussing media is considered to be unclassified and is to be marked accordingly unclassified media management jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 4c3 unclassified 10 equipment meeting the seap degaussing standard class 1 is acceptable for secure erasure of media that has held restricted and degaussing standard class 2 is acceptable for secure erasure of media that has held confidential and above 11 staff should be aware that degaussing might not be fully effective on some of the modern highdensity backup storage media the approved equipments are not suitable for degaussing magnetic tapes and cartridges with coercivity g reater than 1700 oersteds when purchasing magnetic media the

st atement that significant exploitable vulnerabilities were known at the time of sanction vulnerabilities 0608 the vulnerabilities of software stem from the following factors changes to software resulting from the addition of new facilities or t he correction of detected errors are unavoidable and may inadvertently weaken the security controls or cause some to be bypassed b the need for software changes may allow programmers to deliberately or inadvertently induce malfunctions or organize the bypassing of security controls c utility programs are often autonomous and as such may be capable of circumventing security measures residing in the controlling or application software d security loopholes may be caused through incomplete system design resulting from lack of security awareness by system programmers some software manufacturers deliberately introduce trap doors into controlling system software this permits access to the system in the event of total lockout these trap door mechanisms can be discovered by skilled staff and used to bypass the system security controls f only authorized changes to software are permitted these must be properly tested and cleared

evaluation methodologies only apply to the computer security compusec aspects of sefs and where communications security comsec techniques ie cryptography are also contained with the toe this requires separate approval the corollary of this is that comsec approval does not necessarily an that all compusec aspects of toe have been analysed and procurement authori ties must satisfy their accreditors that both aspect have been comprehensively addressed where both are required 0637 for defence use as detailed at chapter 23 all cryptography must be formally approved by the national technical

the way in which the system is used and to ensure that s ecurity controls are effective in practice specific events and details relating to the operation of the system and its security controls must be recorded for subsequent inspection and analysis 0637 the degree and depth of monitoring and detail recorded for auditing will depend on the highest level of protection required by the data being processed or stored and the mode of secure operation for dedicated systems none may be required additionally the type of system the location and physical security measures in place will also influence

the creation deletion or alteration of passwords 5 the introduction of all software authorized or unauthorized b the following events may be recorded or may be configurable 1 the production of

of all or selected activity there should also be facility for the records to be printed in an easily readable form 0644 all security records are to be inaccessible to users without need to know 0645 operating systems are capable of recording vast amounts of detailed information about wide range of system events however most operating systems have facilit ies to allow the system manager to define and select which events are to be recorded in the audit log as security audit messages generally for the purposes of system security it is the recording of exceptional events that is required and will be of grea test interest in determining compliance with the ssp 0646 unattended terminals users are to be automatically logged off the system if their terminals have been inactive for some predetermined period of time t prevent an attacked making use of an unattended terminal an audit report is to be created of the systemgenerated logoff so that repeated incidents may be dealt with by the ss for installations employing very high security measures it may be thought necess ary to enforce reauthentication procedure at frequent intervals say 50 of the forced logoff time during the session 0647 in order to assist with technical inspections and recovery from system failures etc record is to be maintained of all software fixes and patches that are made to system 0648 collecting security audit messages in the security audit log file is useless w ithout periodically reviewing it for suspicious activity most operating systems ve facilities for generating reports from the audit log utilities are also general ly provided to analyze the log for patterns of unusual behaviour the analysis over period of time may reveal pattern of activity that clearly indicates security violations particular attention should be taken with accounts which have enhanced privileges baseline patterns 0649 it is important to establish what are the normal and acceptable patterns of use of system before potential security problems can be recognised once this is done procedures should be established to regularly review the audit log normal events can be identified by answers to the following what are the typical hours most users work b who are the specific users who normally operate with higher privileges unclassified software security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 617 unclassified c which programs generate system security events as part of other applications d what are the regular batch or network jobs that run at specific times of the day 0650 the size number of users and amount of system use will help determine how often this should be done the most common type of report is brief daily listing of selected events that is created from running batch job every evening before midnight it is important that such reports are reviewed as soon as possible in order to gain early warning of any system security breaches analysis of audit logs is specialis ed job and requires considerable experience and expertise to recognise events of suspicious ac tivity requiring further investigation and follow up logs must be protected from unauthorised modification suspicious activity 0651 whenever this analysis reveals potential security incident detailed investigation of the relevant security events should be carried out common forms of system attack that should be recognised as suspicious include hunting for access lines b hunting for passwords c attempting breakin d changing or creating user authorizations granting or stealing extra privileges f using node as gateway to other nodes g using network configuration interrogation tools retention of security record 0652 in accordance with national guidelines all recordings which refer to data protectively marked secret or higher must be retained for minimum of 2 year s recordings of data protectively marked confidential and below should be retained for period of not less than 6 months to be decided by the system accreditor intruder detection systems 0653 mod policy on the use of intruder detection systems ids and related real time monitoring rtm technologies has not yet been finalised but the following unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 618 unclassified initial guidance and policy framework can be given before attempting to deploy any ids or rtm capability within mod infosytech jsycc and eccciiiocm proj should be consulted through the accreditors for current guidance 0654 the term intrusion is defined in chapter 11 as one of the likely outcomes of rtm or ids detecting an occurrence with be the need to handle an incident at the simplest the review of accounting records by security staffs can be considered to be special manual case of ids 0655 ids is means of detecting unauthorised use of or attack upon computer or network the use of ids is not panacea it is only one of number of measures which may be required to protect system or network it should be noted that in order for an ids to work number of supporting factors will need to be considered where the ids is used to analyse data from more than one host or probe it is essential that synchronisation of timebases is provided if the resultant analysis is to be of any value for evidential purposes it is recomme nded that the master timebase be synchronised to source at least as accurate as stratum 2 internet time service to conform with other operational pr actice it is recommended that zulu time be used for all ids recording and reporting b any system components holding information to be used by the ids will need to have their mass storage capacity aligned to the volumes generated between analysis periods particularly if contentbased rather than eventbased logging is deployed c an ids may cause inadvertent denial of service dos by flooding any shared communications bearer and this should be considered in system sizing 0656 risk assessment approach will be required to determine the nature of the ids to be provided both in terms of functionality and assurance in accordance with the requirements laid down at chapter 6 annex b and at chapter 14 0657 the protection service required may vary depending on the ids employed where confidentiality is the main concern the risk assessment will be driven by protective marking but where integrity and availability services are the main driver asset valuation in terms of criticality level cl should primarily be used to drive the risk assessment 0658 ids is either host based hids or network based nids mixture of each type offers the most effective defence the type and location of ids will depend on the level of threat and the functionality required 0659 currently ids offers maximum protection when incorporated within the sec ure managed interface smi at the entryexit points of system or network either s an unclassified software security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 619 unclassified element of boundary protection device bpd or as standalone bpd in its own right 0660 critical hosts within network such as servers should also be protected with additional host based ids which may be implemented as software age nts on hosts or as additional freestanding sensors in such cases the ids may be configured not only to detect intrusions but also to provide some internal anomalous behaviour detection 0661 an ids can use either event or content based logging with the latter approach having significant performance and sizing implications 0662 the selfprotection requirements for the ids platform andor any cryptography used within any ids should be assessed on the same basis as the identificati on and authentication ida barriers for the hosts being protected as laid down at annex b it may be necessary to provide dedicated infrastructure for ids reporting separate from that being monitored by the ids itself 0663 it is the intention of mod to use mix of ids products which are compatible and interoperable although standards for recording of information such as us department of defense dod common intruder detection framework cidf and the internet engineering task forces ietf intruder detection exchange f ormat idmef and incident object description and exchange format iodef have been proposed most current commercial products are however proprietary and do not conform to these standards investment in ids may therefore require change to standards conformant product at some future time if the ids is to be integrated into modwide ids structure but as an interim measure an ability to produce syslog format if required is highly desirable 0664 it is strongly recommended that all ids installations are implemente d so as to make their output accessible to recognised mod monitoring and reporting centre mrc as defined at chapter 11 in addition to any local monitoring in the case of ids provided for criticality level cl 1 and 2 mod cis the provision of feed to mod mrc is mandatory and this mrc

are cleared for access to all systems 2 login to connected system some form of trusted identification forwarding is to be used between hosts when users are connected to other system through network when trusted identification forwarding is not used remote hosts are to require that the unclassified software security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6a3 unclassified user authenticate himself by supplying his uid and password the password for use on remote host is to be different form that used on the local host 3 transmission over communications link when passwords require to be transmitted over communication link from one part of computer system to another they are to be protected by means appropriate to their protective marking passive wiretapping communication lines between terminals and computers are to be adequately protected see chapter 22 24 b active wiretappingspoofing spoofing occurs when system is fooled into believing one user is at the terminal when another user is actually there computer systems can be easily spoofed c these threats can be prevented by encrypting all communication between the terminal and the computer passwords are not to be used as encryption keys or as part of encryption keys 4 system breakdowns in the event of system breakdown special operating procedures may be needed to ensure quick and secure restart there are serious dangers in allowing password files to be restored by standard mechanisms such as retrieval of previously valid version for archives onetime passwords are particularly vulnerable to this approach since they may receive second lease of life 5 notification to the user upon successful login the user is to be notified of 1 the date and time of users last login or logoff 2 the location of the terminal used for the last login 3 each unsuccessful login attempt to use this id since the last successful login 4 action to be taken if this information is not accurate b this provides means for the user to determine if someone else is using or attempting to guess his uid and password such notification is to be given immediately after successful login the system is to require an acknowledgeme nt from the user key depression that the information has been read before the screen is overwritten with the next set of broadcast information c if the login is unsuccessful simple error message is to be gene rated which is to be detailed enough to be of help to genuine user but not so explicit unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6a4 unclassified as to assist an attacker any error messages are to appear at the end of th attempted login regardless of where in the procedure the error occurred technical measures 6 the following technical requirement should be included in the security

modes of processing or operation in unprotected environments advice should be sought from dsypol user generated passwords 8 where it is not technically possible or required to implement cesg approved password generation mechanisms the following guidance should be followed to ensure that password of reasonable strength is selected passwords should not be dictionary word or any proper name b passwords should not bear any direct or indirect relationship to the user eg own family pets or location names or nicknames car registration numbers etc or post eg job tally project name c passwords should be at minimum 6 characters long 9 characters is preferred d password should normally include numeric and special characters if so permitted by the system as well as alphabetic characters 9 one method of producing difficult to attack passwords that can be relatively easily remembered or recreated is to use the pass phrase technique select 3 or 4 word phrase eg main building london or defence ministry head office which unlike the examples should not bear and obvious relationship to the user or post unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6a6 unclassified b take first 3 characters of each of 3 word phrase mai bui lon or the first 2 of 4 word phrase he of c substitute lookalike characters where possible eg 0 for 1 for i 5 for s resulting in the passwords of ma1bu1l0n or dem1he0f 10 if the system concerned treats upper and lower case characters as being different for password purposes this can be further strengthened by alternating upper and lower case in the password eg ma1bu1l0n or dem1he0f unclassified software security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b1 unclassified annex b to chapter 6 mod assurance requirments for communications and information systems from hmg infosec standard 1 assurance requirements for it systems background 1 rapid and unremitting change in the it world means that fixed and absolute security solutions are hard to define and harder to achieve so the process of risk management calls for healthy measure of pragmatism the method documented here has evolved over nearly decade as combination of widelyaccepted basic principles and actual experience within hmg and this document helps security staff decide what level of technical security is appropriate to achieve their overall risk management aim 2 balanced set of security measures will invariably include element s of physical personnel and procedural security as documented elsewhere in the manual these may be extant planned or purely hypothetical but values for the various parameters used for the calculations described later in this document have to be defined as it is these that dictate the extent to which technical secu rity will be relied upon the decision is arrived at in way that highlights the tradeoffs between one form of protection and another to strike the optimum balance 3 technical information security infosec measures may include elements of computer security compusec communications security comsec and radiation security radsec although all of these issues need to be considered this document deals primarily with compusec measures that is specific security funct ions such as verifying passwords implemented in hardware or software 4 it is necessary to determine both the functionality of such security measure that is what it does and how much reliance can be placed on its robustness expressed as an assurance level this compusec target of accreditation toa may entail formal evaluation of the system by commercial evaluation facility cle f or it may be sufficient that the system incorporates products that have been formally evaluated by clef and certified by the uk scheme to the required assurance level as derived from this document unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b2 unclassified 5 the compusec principle which can be stated as every specific threat should be countered or the risk posed by that threat deemed acceptable will indicate to great extent what functionality is needed status 6 it is baseline requirement that those responsible for securing protectively marked information within hmg will use this agreed standard method which has been specifically tailored to the current security environment base line in this context means that it is expected that the document will be applied in all cases unl ess there are strong documented reasons for not doing so 7 this document has been derived from the generic hmg infosec standard but has been adapted in line with departmental security officers dso discretion to make it more applicable to mods various operating environments it is therefore the mod minimum standard and any comments regarding it should be directed to the infosytech office in ddefsy applicability 8 where specially sensitive classes of information are stored proces sed or forwarded the mod is bound to comply with the regulations governing their protection either in the terms of bilateral multilateral agreement typica lly for multinational instances or as condition of release for externally owned material 9 the main instances of this will be for strap material as regulated by volume 5 for strap and other especially sensitive material in addition to carryi ng out an assessment against this document an assessment against the compartme nts requirements must also be carried out and the higher of the requirements will form the baseline in cases where this cannot be met infosytech and the compartment infosec representatives cir should be informed in writing before proceeding scope and limitations 10 this document is primarily intended to address the risk of compromise to official it systems carrying protectively marked data while it recogni ses that compromise may arise from accidental as well as malicious causes it does not cover safetycritical requirements such requirements are addressed by appropriate industry standards and regulatory authorities for the purposes of this document softw are should be considered safetycritical if its failure would result directly in hazardous situation if however software failure or compromise would open up way for potential attacker to create hazardous situation then it may be considered as curity related as well as safetycritical and this document can apply unclassified software security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b3 unclassified 11 the method applies primarily to individual security barriers and analysis of complete system can require large number of very similar calculat ions use of the software tool will ease this task 12 the method can also apply to group of security barriers or even monolithic approach for the whole system as was common with previous issues of this method generating only one assurance level although this may result in an assurance level higher than necessary for some or all of the security measures this may be appropriate when solution based on single commercialofftheshelf cots or governmentofftheshelfgots product is envisaged b users and data are particularly homogeneous 13 however it may be advantageous to implement some parts of the system t higher degree of assurance than others and segregate the more sensitive ope rations in those parts at the cost of multiple assurance calculations for the differe nt aspects it may be possible to justify lower assurance levels in some parts of the system principles for use 14 this methodology should be used at the design stage to investigate various design and configuration options including changes to the physical personnel or procedural security measures to arrive at an optimally costeffective solution 15 having carried out preliminary assessment based upon an outline solution the calculated assurance levels will fall within one of 5 defined compusec toa groupings which indicate the assurance approach required in all cases where evaluation verification or analysis is advocated the goal is to prove that significant exploitable vulnerability exists 16 if the assurance approach indicated by the indicated toa group is not felt to be feasible the accreditor should in the first instance consider whether either of the following approaches should be applied enhance or alter other security measures to reduce the calculated assurance levels to those to those which are more easily achievable or in some cases evaluation is necessary b decide the risk is unacceptable and do not proceed 17 should this approach still not produce an acceptable solution risk management decision will be required and the accreditor will therefore need to produce risk assessment for the appropriate senior responsible officer sro as laid down at unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b4 unclassified chapter 2 the accreditor should therefore consult infosytech for an individua l assessment as to which of the following courses of action approximately in decreasing order of preference is likely to produce the lowest residual risk incorporate certified products as included in the assured products list uksp 06 certified to the level indicated by the calculation into the system and perform system evaluation to lower level than the calculation indicates and accept the additional risk b arrange for the system to be evaluated and certified under the itsec common criteria or other cesg recognised schemes to level lower than that calculated by this method and accept the additional risk c incorporate certified products as included in the assured products list uksp 06 certified to the level indicated by the calculation into the system in appropriate places and have an approved inspection ei and vulnerability analysis va by competent bodies carried out on the s oundness of the configuration and accept the additional risk d arrange for an inspection ei and vulnerability analysis va by competent bodies to be carried out the system and accept the additional risk do nothing and accept the additional risk 18 experience has shown that when several certified products are combined in system there are increased problems caused by misconfiguration or misuse and by interactions between products in such situations system evaluation is highly desirable if only one product provides all the security functionality misconfiguration or misuse is less likely and system evaluation is not usually necessary 19 before proceeding with inspection ei and vulnerability analysis va the accreditors will require evidence of sensible baseline agains t which to proceed analogous to the target of evaluation toe used in formal evaluations whic h will probably take the form of system configuration model scm that can be validated and checked by the verification staff it should be remembered the systems identified criticality level cl also has an inherent compliance requirement for other verification activity throughout the system lifecyle accreditor discretion 20 this is risk management tool and if the method is followed and the security measures evaluated and certified to the level indicated then the residual risk should be acceptably low 21 however even the best technical security barriers cannot alone protect fully against worst case situations for instance determined knowledgeable potentia l unclassified software security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b5 unclassified attacker with unlimited access to the system if accreditors consider that ven the very low residual risk is unacceptable they may in consultation with in fosytech wish to exceed the recommended levels of assurance or add other forms of protection 22 the calculation works to precision of one decimal place with the calcul ated assurance level being rounded to the nearest whole number to give the required assurance level in borderline cases accreditors may wish to round either way if in their opinion and for justifiable reasons they feel that there are local fact ors which the calculation does not adequately take into account examples of such justification would be very strong security management regime which would allow reduction in the requirement whereas poor history of the prime contractor in delivering compliant security solutions will of course necessitate rounding up in all such ca ses the reasoning must be included with the records of the calculations very high or very low assurance levels 23 should the recommended assurance level not be achievable in practice then this means that wholly acceptable technical security for the configuration under consideration is not normally possible with current technology this is the case where mod special protection sp toa is indicated 24 should the calculation produce an assurance level of zero or lower this means that formal certification is needed however this should not be interpreted as meaning that security functionality is necessary and it becomes mod be st current practice bcp target of accreditation it remains up to the accreditor to take considered view and decide whether exceptionally the security functiona lity could be omitted reaccreditation 25 where system security parameters change for instance through new network connections large change in user population or type of data fresh assessment using this document is recommended the accreditor will be key player in this revi ew process and this may require that the system is formally reaccredited concepts 26 potential attackers potential attacker is anyone who is not an authorised user of the data or system in some cases people may be potential attackers ven though they have legitimate access for instance if they are allowed to see informati on but not modify it then they are potential attackers as far as an integr ity attack is concerned the following are examples in particular order of groups of people who may be potential attackers system users without the necessary clearance level for the data unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b6 unclassified system users without the necessary special access approval system users with need to know the data maintenance staff cleaners journalists investigators third party contractors foreign intelligence services or their agents terrorists extremists competitors 27 potential attackers will vary considerably in how likely they ar to try to mount an attack the type of attack what resources they can bring to bear how much effort they are prepared to expend and the opportunity they have to mount an attack 28 attacks may or may not be easily detected subverted employee would try to remain undetected whereas disgruntled employee might try blatant attack on data integrity in order to cause embarrassment 29 potential attackers may be extremely knowledgeable about the system they re attacking or they may know little the availability of readymade hacking tools can greatly enhance the effectiveness of an attacker 30 as result of this diversity the treatment of potential attacke rs in this document is necessarily simplification there is an assumption that checks and clearances bc sc and dv reduce the chance that person so cleared will mount an attack and this applies to attacks on confidentiality integrity and availabili ty 31 potential attackers capabilities may be limited by the system itself either in the facilities the potential attacker can bring to bear or because the re is limited time for the potential attacker to access the system the total facilities potenti attacker has available are not relevant only those that he can bring to bear on the target of attack unclassified software security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b7 unclassified 32 in networked system all those with physical or logical access to the network should be considered as potential attackers except when they are legitimate users of the data to be protected by the security barrier under consideration 33 ways of grouping data potential attackers and security functionality are developed below that clarify this idea 34 an essential feature of the method hinges on the distinction between security measure and security barrier the former provides protection against some particular aspect of the threat that potential attackers pose to the data the l atter is combination of one or more such security measures which may be independent or cooperating taken as whole it provides the total protection required to counter the threat to the data from the group of potential attackers 35 in monolithic system the security barrier comprises all the sec urity functionality of the system it is important to bear in mind the distinction betwe security measures and security barriers whilst reading this section the discuss ion is mainly in terms of confidentiality although similar considerations apply when considering security measures for other purposes 36 the approach in this document is firstly to group potential attackers conceptually according to their most important characteristics that is normal ly clearance and technical factor ignoring their geographical location and the paths by which they might mount an attack group of potential attackers consists then of all those potential attackers who share the same clearance and technical fa ctor the possible attack paths for various members of the group may be different and the security measures which block those paths may be different 37 the analyst may if desired group potential attackers according to other characteristics provided this does not significantly increase the number of groups and is not simply device to reduce the numbers in the groups if potential attacker has multiple technical factors he should be counted in each group 38 to introduce further flexibility the analyst may subdivide small number of the resulting potential attacker groups not more than 10 such subgroups should be introduced they should correspond to real differences in the potential attacker characteristics and subgroups of potential attacker group should give rise to significantly different assurance requirements 39 although of less significance grouping is also applied to data it is appropriate to group data in different ways according to whether the threat considered is to confidentiality integrity or availability in the confidentiality case all the data on the system at each protective marking level should be grouped together it is not generally suitable to group the data according to the particular subsystem on which it is held thus if data of the same sensitivity is distributed across several subsy stems the unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b8 unclassified different security measures on those subsystems will all form part of t he security barrier that protects the data 40 in the integrity and availability cases the data should in general be grouped according to the impact that compromise would have that is the value of t he impact parameter but data may be grouped on other criteria at the analysts discretion 41 each group of potential attackers will then present threat to each data group and each such threat is addressed by group of technical measures this group of measures is by definition security barrier the method works out an assurance level for security barriers and the degree of assurance required in security barrier is determined mainly by the characteristics of the group of potential attacke rs and the characteristics of the data group 42 as security barrier may consist of several component security measures each part will need to be assured to at least the level for the security barrier it is possible that the same security measure may be used by several security barriers in which case it should be assured to the highest calculated level it is also possi ble that the security measures in single security barrier include all the security functionality of the whole system in such case the system is essentially monolithic 43 to use these grouping options effectively it is desirable to have an idea of the likely design of the system and the particular security measures that wil l be used it is envisaged that these assurance level calculations will be made iterativel by the system designers as they evolve to design that can incorporate the required level of security in the most economical way 44 in the integrity case separate security barriers define the func tionality that prevents the modification of particular group of data by particular group of potential attackers it is necessary to stretch the definition of pote ntial attacker group little to accommodate the possibility that data corruption may sometimes not be attributable to particular potential attacker that is data may requir protection against unattributable accidents 45 in the availability case further extension of the security barrie r concept is necessary denial of service attacks threaten services rather than data it is therefore necessary for the analyst to define particular groups of services or subservices that require enhanced protection characterised by the impact if they are compromised then separate security barrier is deemed to protect each service from each group of potential attackers again such barrier may require protection against unattribut able accidents 46 networked systems it is often hard to define what is meant by system systems may be definable physically in terms of the hardware and its location but when two systems are connected together they may be considered either as two systems connected together or one bigger system the latter is more consistent unclassified software security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b9 unclassified approach but runs into problems where part of system is relatively isolated and it is desired to treat this part in some way differently from the rest of the s ystem further guidance on networked systems is given at chapter 15 47 focusing on one security barrier at time means that subsystem boundaries need not be rigidly specified the analysis encompasses the full system and assurance can be concentrated in relatively isolated subsystems it is however st ill important to define the total scope of the analysis and what external security measures can be assumed to be in place 48 accesses involving several interconnected subsystems are likely to be regulated by separate security measures provided by the individual subsystems the overall assurance level attained by security barrier is determine d by the assurance of its constituent security measures and the way they combine into mutually supportive whole 49 defence in depth security measure can be guaranteed to be 100 effective and at first sight it might appear attractive to present s everal security measures which would have to be breached for an attack to succeed on the basis that if the first is 99 successful at blocking attacks and the second 90 effective then in combination they are 999 effective 50 in practice achieving this effect in compusec is problematic in many case s the several security measures which block an attack path are not truly independent and breaching one security measure leads to ways in which other security measures can be circumvented easily an example is an ida followed by internal access controls if potential attacker can defeat the ida for instance by guessing users id and password then he has access to all the data to which that user should have access however it is recognised that in carefully controlled environment w ith wellunderstood functionality genuine defenceindepth did can be achieved 51 an accreditor may accept defenceindepth argument using series of security measures if he is satisfied that the different security measures are inde ed independent in such cases the effective assurance level of two security mea sures in combination is determined as follows where each security measure is ass ured to the same level the effective assurance is one higher than that level ot herwise the effective assurance level is the higher of the two 52 it is stressed that the defence in depth argument is regarded as providing functional equivalent of higher assurance level and that care must be taken that thi s should not be misquoted as being equal to higher eal number 53 in all cases where defence in depth argument is used within mod the exercise of accreditor discretion must be sanctioned by the sector security authoritys involved who will require proof that the mechanisms employed to implement the barrier functions bf are indeed functionally independent in both implementation and unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b10 unclassified operation eg based upon differing paradigms such as stateless and stateful operation if the calculated assurance requirement being addressed exceeds eal34 or if compartmented information is involved the departmental security officer dso as represented by infosytech must also be consulted 54 dilution where data at given level of marking is diluted by large quantity of data at lower level of marking there may be justification for slight reduction in assurance level but the presence of data at the high level cannot be totally ignored dilution can only be allowed when it is substantial of the order of 01 the difference in marking level is not great and there is easy way to pick out the more highly marked data 55 in all cases where dilution argument is used within mod the exercise of accreditor discretion must be sanctioned by either the psya of the tlb involved the dsso or if compartmented information is involved the departmental security officer dso as represented by infosypol must also be appraised 56 in all cases the grant of sanction will require the submission of proof that the dilution is indeed stochastic random in both time and space where applicable and that additional channels eg descriptive filenames or scanable labels exist to subvert the perceived degree of randomness in this context randomness can be considered to be any pseudorandom sequence with its autocorrelation function approaching zero ie 0025 for n 1000 to 0005 for n 1000000 methods of analysis 57 the essence of security analysis is to identify all the risks in terms of the threats and vulnerabilities then to place appropriate security barriers to reduce each risk to an acceptable level this document does not mandate any particular risk identification method however cramm is an hmgpreferred analysis tool which aids in detailed analysis and is recommended when advice on specific detailed security measures is required whatever method of analysis is chosen it should be methodical and well documented 58 confidentiality identification and authentication and access control security measures together usually form the backbone of protection for the confidentiality of data generically there are three reasons for preventing access to data these are related to the mode of operation 59 mode of operation in monolithic system the mode of operation reflects the reason for wanting to prevent access to data the definition of mode of operation has been amended in this document to adapt it from systemwide conce pt to one that can relate to parts of system down to the level of individual security barriers the mode of operation of security barrier is then merely shorthand way of referring to the reason for providing the security barrier unclassified software security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b11 unclassified 60 the three reasons for preventing access to data are lack of clearance level the potential attacker does not hold the clearance level necessary to see protectively marked material this applies where material is marked using the standard protective markings restricted confidential secret and top secret and the potential attackers lack checks and clearances of basic check security check and developed vetting systems with internal access controls for this reason have multilevel mode of operation security barriers which are provided for this reason likewise have multilevel mode of operation b lack of special access approval the potential attacker may lack special access approval which applies to special data often intellige nce material even though the potential attacker is cleared to sufficient level under lack of clearance level above to see the data this applies where there are formal rules in place for marking such data and formally giving people special access approval to see that data the system of special acc ess approvals exists locally within government departments or occasionally between closely cooperating government departments this includes the use of national caveats for example ukus eyes only where potential attacker is not one of the appropriate nationalities systems which need internal access controls solely for this reason have compartmented mode of operation security barriers which are provided for this reason likewise have compartmented mode of operation c needtoknow the potential attacker may have needto know the data it is likely to be locally determined and is sometimes referre d to as privacy requirement it includes the use of the uk eyes discretion marking systems with internal access controls solely f or this reason have system high mode of operation security barriers which are provided for this reason likewise have system high mode of operation 61 for completeness systems where all potential attackers are excluded by non technical means and all users need access to all the data have dedic ated mode of operation 62 when assessing the conceptual mode of operation of security barrier which prevents logical access to system by those having physical access th value used depends on whether the potential attackers have an appropriate clearance level where compartmented mode reflects their lack of access approval or whether the potential attackers do not have an appropriate clearance level in which c ase the multilevel mode is appropriate 63 integrity the integrity of data in system is always important but is often taken for granted the manual of protective security establishes two protection unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b12 unclassified levels baseline for the majority of normal situations and enhanced for spe cial environments or where special risks have been identified 64 baseline in this context means those security measures which represent industry good practice which can be regarded for now as being the equ ivalent of requirement for those technical measures that would be required under iso9001 and bs7799 65 when enhanced protection is indicated this document can be used to calculate an assurance level the cramm tool can be used for more detailed analysis of integrity functionality 66 the security measures supporting confidentiality may also support integrity for instance access controls may be able to set independent read modify and write permissions important security measures include the use of antivirus software to prevent the import of malicious code b an inherently nonalterable medium such as cdrom to store the data c master copy for comparison d mathematical checksum to ensure data has not been modified with many standard data transfer protocols such checksum is an inherent part of the protocol 67 digital signatures may be used where additional integrity is requi red the subject of digital signatures is complex and should their use be contemplated specialist advice from infosytech should be sought 68 measures specifically to protect for integrity are usually deter mined locally this document gives guidance later on finding an appropriate assurance level should such measure be indicated 69 availability availability requirements are usually expressed at the system level or at the service level it is rarely that the concept of availabili ty is applied to data directly although availability of the data may be essential for the avai lability of service or system deliberate attacks on availability are often referred to as denial of service attacks 70 the hmg standards establishes two protection levels baseline and enhanced and requires system owners to assign their systems to one category or the other the acceptable level of availability is an operational matter and how that availabi lity is achieved is design decision the cramm tool can be used for more detailed analysis of availability requirements although protecting against hardware failure is unclassified software security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b13 unclassified outside the formal scope of this document suitable security measures include in ascending order replacement of faulty units from central stores under normal working hours response within n days support contract b replacement of faulty units from locally held supplies by maintenance staff on 24 hour call out c cold spare with manual detection of failure and manual switchover d hot spare with automatic detection of failure and manual switchover hot spare with automatic detection of failure and automatic switch over f multiplyredundant system with majority vote decision 71 the common criteria provides some functional components fault tolerance security measures that ensure the system wil l maintain level of correct operation in the event of failures b priority of service security measures that control the use of resources to ensure that high priority activities will be accomplished without undue interference or delay by low priority activities c resource allocation security measures to prevent the unauthorised monopolising of resources by users 72 security measures specifically to protect availability are usuall determined locally although in all cases should at least conform to industry good practice which can be regarded for now as being the equivalent of requirement for those technical measures that would be required under iso9001 and bs7799 73 this document gives guidance later on finding an appropriate assurance level should such security measure be indicated 74 security accounting and audit basic summary of security accounting and audit appears in guide to the security of it systems security accounti ng and audit functions serve four purposes detecting unusual activity which may indicate breach of security when done in real time this may be equivalent to intrusion detection b providing forensic evidence unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b14 unclassified c deterrence d assisting in remedial action when problem occurs such as corrupted data 75 security accounting and audit is useful security measure to counter the threat posed by privileged users such as system managers who are able to override normal access controls on some systems the fact that all such users actions are accountable may be the only deterrent to such an attack 76 experience has shown that in practice security accounting and audit systems are often difficult to operate security accounting logs are difficult to understand and unusual activity which may indicate breach is usually obscure auditing is very time consuming and tedious except in welldisciplined environment audit is rarely performed effectively 77 to be of any use security accounting records need to be audited the frequency of audit is matter of judgement for the accreditor and will depend on the nature of the business and other local factors audits may be manual or toolbased it is important to determine what constitutes normal behaviour and abnormal behaviour 78 it is worth noting that there are attack tools for common operating systems which can hide successful attack by altering the security accounting records 79 this document allows compensation for less than fully effective sec urity accounting and audit by raising slightly the assurance level of other securi ty barriers the functionality that can be regarded as fully effect ive is detailed in the parameters for effective security accounting and audit 80 physical measures physical security measures control physical access to hardware such as terminals servers cabling and include building access controls fences walls locks etc almost all it systems will have some physica l security measures already in place interaction between physical security measures nd technical security barriers comes about because the physical measures both reduc the number of potential attackers and limit potential attackers to those of known clearance status some isolated systems may be able to rely almost entir ely on physical security 81 personnel security measures the recognised formal checks and clearances for personnel are basic check security check and developed vetting personnel security measures have the effect of restricting normal access to the sy stem to people with known clearances permitting reasonable assumptions about their reliability unclassified software security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b15 unclassified 82 personnel security measures can interact with technical security barriers there is often an opportunity to reduce the required assurance level of the technical security barriers significantly or even remove them by increasing the cleara nce of potential attackers this reduces required assurance levels in its own right and may well change the mode of operation resulting in further reduction in required assurance levels 83 reduction in assurance level is allowed if personnel are cleared to higher level than they strictly need to see the data which is incorporated in the works heets 84 procedural security measures procedural security measures aim to reduce risks by applying rules and are usually locally devised and approved there are occasions when procedural rule may be invoked which reduces or removes the need for some particular technical security measure for instance 2man rule may be considered adequate to prevent an attacker mounting any attack on an access control security measure 85 accreditors will need to use their discretion when considering the effectiveness of procedural security measures and any consequential reduction in other security measures and may need to seek advice from infosytech 86 encryption an important security measure to reduce the risk of interception is the use of encrypted lines using hmgapproved cryptographic equipments cryptos an approved crypto used in accordance with cesg infosec memorandum 3 british cryptographic instructions can be assumed to be totally effective in maintaining the confidentiality of the data from an intercepti on attack 87 if communications paths are accessible to the public as is often the case using an appropriate grade of crypto immediately reduces effectively to zer both the threat to the data in transit and the threat to confidentiality of the end sys tems via the communications path more information on the use of cryptos is available in infosec memorandum 3 88 encryption of data stored in system is an appropriate security measure to counter the threat that whole system will be lost or captured intact and hence applies particularly to portable computers in other cases experience has shown that wholesale encryption is difficult to implement and manage and the gains ar less than might be expected further advice on the use of encryption for internal access control may be obtained from infosytech baseline compusec functionality requirements 89 in the majority of cases there should be an identification and authentication measure unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b16 unclassified b internal access control measures these may be mandatory access control andor discretionary access control depending on the reason for the security measure c where feasible security accounting and audit measure where none is present there may be consequential increase in the assurance level of related security barriers and in some cases additional security measures specifically to ensure the i integrity of data over and above commercial standards ii availability of data or service over and above commercial standards 90 the following paragraphs elaborate on this point 91 identification and authentication ida all systems should have the following functionality uptodate lists of authorised users b positive identification of all users at the start of each processing session c authentication of computer connections via communications circuits before transmission this may be provided by cryptographic protection of the circuit 92 passwords are part of most ida security measures specific requirements relating to passwords and their generation and management are given chapter 6 supplemented by cesg compusec memorandum 8 password guidelines if required 93 internal access control dac and mac all systems except the few working in dedicated mode need internal access controls to prevent pote ntial attackers from reading modifying or otherwise interacting with the dat 94 this document cannot describe the detailed functions that must be provided for this purpose as general rule any communication path between potentia l attacker and the data can be used to carry an attack or leak data it is for the syst em designers and implementers to identify all possible means of attack and nsure that they are blocked it is precisely because this is difficult and error prone task th at evaluation and certification can add value to the procurement process 95 in discretionary access control dac system user can be given the right to access data by any other user who already has access in mandatory acce ss unclassified software security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b17 unclassified control mac system an ordinary user cannot give another user access rights this provides protection against careless or malicious users and also against malicious code that attempts to mimic the actions of users 96 traditionally mac has been implemented by operating systems that ass ign protective marking labels to data and permit access only when user clearances are consistent with protective marking there is requirement for this spe cific implementation if the required protection can be provided in other ways the most common alternative is trusted downgrade or trusted release whereby dac is provided within security domains and data is transferred between domains or released only by the actions of specifically authorised staff 97 technical security measures trusted paths ensure that the actions are performed by people rather than by malicious code and carelessness and malice are deterred by higher level of accounting and audit 98 where the potential attacker has the required clearance level or specia l access approval for the data but may lack needtoknow the use of dac is permissible where the potential attacker does not have the required clearance level or special access approval for the data multilevel or compartmented mode of operation mac is required this is summarised in the following table associated mode of operation type of internal access control measure multilevel mac compartmented mac system high dac dedicated none 99 where the presence of nationally caveated material for example ukus eyes only calls for compartmented mode of operation and hence calls for mac there are subtle points of interpretation the definition of uk eyes only permits the originator and only the originator to extend access to the material it i s difficult to design systems which provide originators with this freedom this conflict may be resolved by procedural security measures 100 integrity special technical integrity measures are usually needed because the access controls described above can be configured to control write and modify permissions as well as the read permissions needed for confi dentiality if this does not apply then specific integrity protection measures may be needed 101 should technical security measure such as checksum algorithm or an access control measure be indicated to protect data integrity then the appropriate assurance level for that security measure can be calculated by using the method in the worksheets unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b18 unclassified 102 availability special technical availability measures are usually needed as this is local operational matter should technical security measure s uch as an automatic backup or automatic switchover to hot spare be indicated to protect availability then the appropriate assurance level of that security measure can be calculated by using the method in the worksheets 103 integrity availability in addition to any technical security measures for integrity and availability the following supporting measures should be considered based upon the criticality level of the system criticality level objective countermeasures cl1 as cl2 plus protection against radiated energy attack fully meshed communications links with at least 50 utiising dedicated bearers diverse processing capacity cl2 as cl3 plus flexible power backup multiple diverse routed communications links redundant processing capacity cl3 provide sufficient countermeasures

accidentsmishaps and known recurrent problems eg viruses and power supply variations defined contingency plan data backup with local storage cots anti virus software cots authentication 104 security accounting and audit the term accounting and audit in this document refers only to general purpose security accounting and audit that is the unclassified software security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b19 unclassified recording of actions and events that may indicate attempts to circumvent id or access controls there may well be requirements for other types of accounting and audit such as financial audit or audit needed for local business management reasons which exceed those stated below but are outside the scope of this document 105 normally an security accounting and audit system will be required where security accounting and audit system is lacking and this increases the reliance placed on associated security barriers then the calculated assurance level of those security barriers is increased depending on rounding this may or may not increase the required assurance level 106 in this document the treatment of security accounting and audit is separa ted into two aspects firstly the minimum recommended security accounting and audi t functionality and secondly the effect the presence or absence of accounting and audit functionality may have on the required assurance level of other securit measures the first of these uses the term security accounting and audit rating the second uses the term accountability 107 the specific events to be included in the security accounting depend on the security accounting and audit rating as derived from the table below clearance status of potential attackers dv sc bc uncleared top secret comprehensive comprehensive comprehensive comprehensive secret comprehensive comprehensive comprehensive comprehensive confidential none none partial comprehensive restricted none none none partial 108 the security accounting and auditing system itself may need certification and the assurance level can be calculated by using the method in the worksheets 109 when an event is to be recorded at least the following elements should be logged type of event user id date and time device id if relevant 110 the security officerss should be able to print an easily readable report of all or selected events unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b20 unclassified 111 events to be included in the security accounting record none there is mandated requirement but as mentioned above there may be local or departmental requirement for audit partial the following should be recorded if applicable to the system under consideration all logon attempts whether successful or not log off creation deletion or alteration of access rights and privileges creation deletion or alteration of passwords creation deletion or alteration of the security accounting log comprehensive the following should be recorded if applicable to the system under consideration in addition to the partial requirements production of protectively marked hard or soft copy output creation or deletion of files and the assigning of their level of protective marking any regrading of the level of protective marking either of data objects or logon privileges introduction or removal of storage media backup operations attempts to access datafiles and whether or not successful attempts to disseminate datafiles whether or not successful 112 the frequency and type of audit is matter of judgement for the accreditor or dso and will depend on the nature of the business and other local factors the basic recommendation is that effective audit should take place at adequate intervals 113 data exchange in most systems data will be moved around and may be exchanged with other systems maintaining the confidentiality integrit and availability of transferred data may need special security meas ures many protocols exist which ensure data integrity during transfer hmgapproved cryptos can be used to ensure confidentiality during transfer various forms of redundancy can be used to ensure system or data 114 should noncryptographic technical security measure be considered necessary to protect either the data being exchanged or the whole system then it will protect either the confidentiality integrity or availability or co mbinations of these and the appropriate assurance level for that security barrier can be calculated by using the methods in the worksheets 115 additionally to facilitate interconnection between systems some common assumptions as to available security functionality is required as detailed t chapter 13 unclassified software security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b21 unclassified parameters and their values 116 the level of risk presented to system data by group of potential attackers depends upon various characteristics of the system its data and the attackers themselves there are many possible ways of describing these characteristi cs in this section standardised set of parameters is defined and discussed in some detail 117 there are two special cases where it may not be obvious what the parameter values should be where there is public physical or logical access to system b danger of breach of security from the accidental failure of the security measure that is failure not caused by potential attacker 118 the parameter values for these two special cases are stated xplicitly where appropriate the term public physical access applies where terminal or part of the system is placed in public space where there is uncontrolled access such as public library public logical access is where there is the possibility of accessing the system via another system such as the public switched telephone network pstn to which the public has access 119 although potential attackers will have been grouped on the basis of their most important common characteristics they can be expected to differ in minor paramete rs this raises the question of what values of these parameters to assign to the group as whole the general guidance is to assign the typical or average value rather t han the worst case if it is particularly difficult to decide on typical value t hen the limited dispensation to subdivide the group should be in monolithic calculation use worstcase values for protective marking and clearance 120 the parameters are environmental factor number of potential attackers check and clearance status of the potential attackers protective marking level of the data for confidentiality impact for integrity or availability mode of operation technical factor which consists of unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b22 unclassified facilities available cumulative opportunity level of publicity of the existence of the data accountability quantity of data 121 environmental factor this parameter is needed for all groups of potential attackers it is an empirical reflection of certain factors known to have bearing on the likely threat to be associated with that group such factors will typically have been identified in national threat assessments and may be complemented by local evidence of particular problems known to departments possible values are normal default value increased appropriate if any of the following is true department has evidence of persistent problem relevant to the group for instance recurrent fraud internal hacking infringements of departmental rules or some other form of bad track record the group is outside the uk there is some reason to believe the group may be target of foreign intelligence high appropriate if any of the following is true the group has connection to public network the major instance being the internet the group is outside the uk in place where it is target of an aggressive intelligence service 122 it is important that where any direct or indirect connection to public networks is identified as result of this analysis an explicit statement as to its presence must be made in association in presentation of the results of the risk analysis to accredi tors if virtual private networking vpn technology is used it may not be apparent whether or not such direct or indirect connection to public networks exists 123 clientserver vpn csvpn which use encrypted tunnelling either between hosts or between clients and hosts with encryption under the control of the system management authority are analogous to link encryption and can be considered to be provided link level protection commensurate with the grade of cryptography available and thus provides separation from public networks 124 on the other hand service provider furnished vpn spfvpn can be implemented by either cryptographic or closed user group cug mechanisms unclassified software security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b23 unclassified outside the control of the system management authority and as such can only be considered to provide isolation from public networks if both the specific architecture can support this concept and an appropriate level of trust can be demonstrated in the service provider 125 in addition to the generic environmental factors laid down certain classes of mod systems have specific environmental factors based upon their criticality level cl criticality level cl environmental factor 1 high 2 increased 126 advice can be obtained from the jsycc office within ddefsy as to threats to specific mod locations or formations 127 for cases where the security barrier protects against an accidental breach of security the value is normal 128 the numerical value to be used in calculations derived from this param eter is found on the working chart 129 this parameter can alter the assurance level by up to 10 130 number of potential attackers this parameter is needed for all cases 131 values are 110 1150 51200 2011000 10015000 greater than 5000 132 where there is public physical or electronic access the value is greate r than 5000 133 where precise connections of potential attackers are not known for example when the system is frequently reconfigured or connected to other systems that are imperfectly understood conservative high value should be used if the value of 5000 is selected this will have the effect to saturating the factor in the analysis and will thus provide futureproofing against any subsequent use of cascade connections either within or without the system managements control 134 for cases where the security barrier protects against an accidental breach of security in the confidentiality case the value is that appropriate to the num ber of people who would be in position to exploit the breach for example if the accident were to release the information to the public the value would be 5000 but if only to one individual then the value would be 110 in the integrity availability and accounting and audit cases where there is obvious group of people who might exploit failure the value 5000 should be used unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b24 unclassified 135 as explained above potential attackers are grouped and the number in each group is input to the calculation 136 the numerical value to be used in calculations derived from this param eter is found on the appropriate working chart refer to appendices 14 137 this parameter can alter the assurance level by 2 138 check and clearance status of potential attackers this parameter is needed in all cases 139 this is the normal clearance level of the potential attackers and can have the values uncleared basic check bc security check sc developed vetting dv in this document the term basic check includes complying with any chec ks made which are locally approved and are broadly comparable to formal basic check 140 where the public have physical or electronic access to the system but are to be excluded by the security barrier under consideration from access to some parts of the system the value is uncleared 141 where the security barrier is protecting against an accidental breach of security for the confidentiality case the value is that appropriat to the people who would gain by the occurrence of the breach for example if some users are dv and some bc and failure of the security barrier would allow top secret mater ial to fall into the hands of the bc users then the value is bc for the integrity availabi lity and accounting and audit cases there is obvious group of people who would gain by the occurrence of breach the appropriate value is uncleared 142 this parameter can alter the assurance level by 6 143 protective marking of data this parameter is needed only for the confidentiality and security accounting audit cases 144 this is the normal protective marking and can have values restricted confidential secret top secret 145 this parameter can alter the assurance level by 7 unclassified software security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b25 unclassified 146 impact this parameter is needed only for integrity or availability cases and possible values are minor significant major extreme the various values relate to the impact resulting from loss of integrity or loss of availa bility this parameter is similar to the protective marking level for the confidential ity case 147 mod systems should be assessed for criticality level cl the details of which are included in chapter 1 criticality level protection category impact parameter cl1 enhanced extreme cl2 enhanced major cl3 enhanced significant cl4 enhanced minor 148 note that this parameter reflects only the effect of loss of inte grity or availability not the protective marking of the data which normally reflec ts the effect of loss of confidentiality thus it would be possible to have data marked top secret but with an impact of minor should its integrity be lost and viceversa 149 only the more immediate effects should be considered remote consequences which would require long chain of unlikely events should be ignored 150 mode of operation the mode of operation of the security barrier under consideration applies in the confidentiality case only and is determined from t he reason for providing the security barrier refer to paragraph 64 and summarised in table below reason for security barrier associated mode of operation lack of clearance level multilevel lack of special access approval protecting nationally caveated material eguk eyes only ukus eyes only from nationals of other countries compartmented lack of needtoknow protecting uk eyes discretion from non uk nationals system high 151 technical factor this parameter is needed for all cases 152 the technical factor is an important parameter that reflects the constrai nts imposed by the system or its environment on the ability of potential atta cker to mount an attack if potential attacker has limited facilities available to m ount and little opportunity for an attack then the technical factor is low if potential unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b26 unclassified attacker has many facilities available and unlimited opportunity for attack then the technical factor is high 153 the technical factor is determined by combination of the partial meters facilities available and opportunity for attack 154 it may be that potential attacker has several interfaces dir ectly available providing him with widely differing facilities and opportunities these interfaces should in principle be regarded as relating to differing security barriers and the potential attacker should be counted as attacking each security barrier that is he should be counted many times however it is quite likely that the same security measures will be present in each security barrier the highest assurance requirement then applies 155 more complicated scenarios are also quite common one interface may give potential attacker access to more restricted interface if there is potential for subverting the more restricted interface then its technical factor should be used for example potential attacker may have unrestricted access high technical factor to pc but only receive broadcast teletext messages on it clearly he can do nothing to influence the second computer that generates the messages however if his pc has trusted

this parameter is needed for all cases it takes account of the presence or absence of security accounting and audit measure 176 for normal situations possible values are none where there is effective

qualify for value of comprehensive all the functionality must be provided irrespective of the fact that the security accounting and audit rating may have value of partial or none 178 it is noted that in some case the accountability may not be technically achievable in particular the widely used windows nt operating system even with security extensions does not completely meet the specification for compr ehensive for vanilla nt based systems the partial accountability parameter of 03 should be used within the worksheets and if ntse has been implemented specific accountability parameter of 05

the domain based approach 1 the methodology for carrying out an analysis of system or network proposed by cesg involves the use of threataccess spider diagram to replace the network diagrams used in the previous issue of the standard as cesg compusec memo 10 version 22 2 since that time the mod via dera cis3 and iaicss applied research package arp 21c has independently evolved the domain methodology for defining systems and networks and advice on its use can be obtained from iaicsimpl 3 although the methodology does not at present cater for threataccess diagram it does support the identification of threats within the existing domain m odel notation guidance on identification and analysis of these threats is given below 4 domain model identifies the physical environments from which people operate computer systems these contain the potential attackers that may constitut threat to the data in the system it also defines domains within the system that re present the logical places where people invoke software to work on their behalf membership of domain provides facilities to reach data and enables members to pose different threat to the data in the system for this reason they may be regarded as distinct groups of potential attackers data is held in repositories that may be reached from one or more domains 5 as part of the domain model set of tables defines the numbers and minimum clearances of members of environments and domains and the maximum protective markings of data handled in domains the model therefore provides the basic information required to identify threats and analyse them at high level in depth analysis of the threats however requires detailed knowledge of the technical design configuration and modes of operation of the it that implements the security requirements expressed in the domain model discussion of how this is achieved is beyond the scope of this note unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b52 unclassified 6 the diagram below illustrates simple domain model the data in repository r is reachable from domain d representing computer system that may be operated from physical environment by entering portal p fig 1 portal enables some people to enter domain 7 in this case there are at least two groups of potential attackers for the data in r the members of who are not members of domain d and the members of d the barriers to be considered should therefore prevent entry to the domain by those who are not members b control access to data in r by members of d including those who lack the clearances special access approval or need to reach it 8 the first of these barriers consists of single logon measure to counter the threat of nonmembers attempting to enter the domain calculation of the required eal for this barrier uses the normal calculation for confidentiali ty it is based on the characteristics of the environment members as potential attackers and t he minimal facilities available to them in attempting to logon 9 the second barrier may be compromised by several means members without the access rights to data may attempt to obtain access to it mbers with access rights to the data may release it either accidentally or through failure to follow procedure s or because they are traitors different measures are required to counter these different causes of compromise they comprise access control measures which may include labelling and usersanctioned release and accounting measures which although they do not prevent compromise can limit the damage caused 10 for the access control measures the normal memo 10 calculation for confidentiality applies while for the accounting measure separate table is used to calculate the required eal the potential attackers in this case are all th domain members and the facilities available are all those provided to users in the domain 11 access control and accounting measures both depend on identification of the domain member concerned which is provided by the logon measure the required eal for the logon measure is therefore the greater of the levels calculated for each of the barriers that depend on it d p r unclassified software security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6b53 unclassified 12 in practice domain models will be more complex than in this example the members of connected domains must also be included as potential attackers and data handled by these domains must be considered as data under threat in most cases the potential attackers will be divided into separate groups according to clearances etc and the data will be divided into groups according to protective markings 13 in addition different types of connection between domains will permit different causes of compromise and will determine the facilities available to potential attackers hence further division of groups will be made on the basis of technical factors while such factors are crucially dependent on the design of the system the domain model of security requirements can give good indication of what these might be 14 in the case of messaging channels between domains which do not carry attachments capable of carrying executables the facilitie s available are rated as low but if the attachment may carry executable code such as macros the rating is normal connecting repository which is readonly within domain will reduce the fac ilities available to other domains which may therefore be rated as low whereas for readwrite repositories the rating would be normal 15 in assessing the different causes of compromise and consequent threat posed by groups of potential attackers to some data it is necessary to make some assumptions about the facilities provided to users within and between domains how these facilities will be implemented and the security measures tha t may be employed these assumptions may relate to it andor procedures and must be recorded with the results of the calculations to which

monitoring should form part of suite of countermeasures including eg virus checkers and firewalls designed to counter the threats faced by systems which are connected to public networks such as the internet the objective s of the monitoring would be threefold firstly it should provide mechanism whereby user compliance with departmental security policy could be monitored b secondly it should reduce the risk from attack internal or external to the system being monitored and to other departments to which it is connected restricted software security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6e3 restricted c finally it should provide records to support appropriate incident reporting investigation and response 14 monitoring can be carried out at system or intranet level where an intranet is system or systems such as the gsi system monitoring should be primarily concerne d with ensuring safe user behaviour and identifying anomalous user and network activity ie it should endeavour to identify activities likely to compromise sys tem information intranet monitoring should be concerned with identifying events that occur across number of systems and which may not be visible at the system level 15 whilst it is strongly recommended that departments monitor all it systems that that have connections to public networks departments should also consider applying similar techniques to systems that have external connectivity to help maintain the integrity confidentiality and availability of system serv ices 16 monitoring may at the departments discretion also be used for other lawful purposes it could for example detect abusive or offensive material or improper use of official assets however departments should be aware of the requirements of the data protection regulations detailed in section b compliance with hra and other legislation 17 protective monitoring policy must be compliant with the following legislation the human rights act 1998 the data protection act 1998 the regulation of investigatory powers act 2000 the lawful business practice regulations 2000 18 the data protection commissioner will be publishing an employment code of practice in 2001 which also deals with monitoring the consultation draft stressed that monitoring should not intrude unnecessarily on employees privacy and autonomy the commissions code is an authoritative statement on the subject and should be closely followed user notification 19 the lawful business practice regulations permit the monitoring of it systems by managers for specified purposes including in the interests of national security to prevent or detect crime and to secure the effective operation of the system but the stipulate that reasonable efforts must be made to notify all users of the system of the monitoring

other than those for which it was introduced and about which users were notified unless it reveals criminal activity or gross misconduct threats introduction 21 this section documents the currently known threats that are relevant to any department with system connected to public networks specific threats t1 accidental export of sensitive data to an inappropriate system examples user wrongly addresses an email or uses distribution list which contains recipients outside the government system user accidentally modifies some aspect of the system which results in the export of data an administrator incorrectly configures system component such as domain name server which results in information being routed outside the government system software or hardware failure results in the misrouti ng of data outside the system t2 deliberate export of sensitive data to an inappropriate system examples disgruntled employee consciously releases sensitive infor mation to entities not permitted access or modifies an element of the system with the net result that information is released service such as webba sed disk storage utilised by user as convenient means of storing department information to allow access from home t3 exploitation of an allowed service to export sensitive data to an inappropriate system an allowed service is one that is permitted by the local security policy and supported at the system boundary examples an external entity may use an allowed service to introduce malicious code into system this code may affect the integrity or availability of the system or may use the same or similar allowed service to export nsitive information from the system the code could be introduced through other means eg floppy disk or cd with the same outcome t4 exploitation of disallowed service to export sensitive data to an inappropriate system disallowed service is one that is not permitted by the local security policy and should not be supported at the system boundary examples an external agent may discover configuration error implementation flaw or hardware failure in boundary component such as firewall which can be used to introduce malicious code or directly extrac t sensitive information from the system restricted software security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 6e5 restricted t5 denial of responsibility for an action example user may deny carrying out an action that led directly or indirectly to the export of sensitive information to an inappropriate domain t6 modification of evidence example an entity may modify system record to hide evidence of illeg activity assumptions introduction 22 it has already been stated that defensive monitoring is only one of number of countermeasures that should be employed it is assumed that these countermeasures will be applied to system being subjected to defensive monitoring security assumptions a1 the configuration of key components will be tested in accordance with documented test plan the

this page intentionally left blank unclassified malicious software jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 73 unclassified chapter 7 malicious software introduction 0701 malicious software is general term covering several types of software code introduced into system to perform tasks that are not part of the systems designe d functionality malicious software is intended to compromise communications and information systems by breaking its confidentiality corrupting its int egrity or affecting its availability it is not to be confused with unexpected functions due to errors i n software miskeying or the misuse of operating system commands 0702 some forms of malicious software especially viruses present real risk to mod cis viruses in terms of numbers of security incidents represent the biggest threat to mod cis relatively simple countermeasures can minimise the risks key countermeasure is high user awareness of the problem antivirus software avs must be installed on all mod cis it is also essential to ensure t hat latest version of the avs is installed 0703 variants of malicious types appear almost on daily basis in most cases the visible impact on your system will be different though the general advice contained in this chapter will always be relevant cesg infosec memorandum 12 gives additional information on dealing with the different types of malicious software types of malicious software 0704 the boundaries between different types of malicious software are not always clearcut but they generally fall into one or more of the following viruses these are so called because they attach to healthy programs and replicate themselves thus infecting other programs and systems the primary target for viruses is the pc operating system but all major operating sy stems have been targeted though to lesser extent viruses are by far the most common type of malicious software and whole industry has been built up to combat them b trojan horses trojan horse is program that pretends to do one thing while performing another unwanted action any executable file sent as an attachment could contain trojan the most well known trojan is where the login screen is mimicked enabling usernames and passwords to be stolen c logic bombs logic bomb is malicious program routine triggered by specific event or situation the triggering event could be date eg friday unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 74 unclassified 13th or change made to database record eg change to joe bloggs employment status or any other event that can be recognised by software d worms worms like viruses replicate themselves but they do not attach to specific programs variant is where the original program makes copies of itself but retains control over its offspring the primary target for worms is networked systems mobile codes mobile codes can be used maliciously mobile codes are metacodes which are designed to be executable on multiple platforms or architecture by use of an intermediary interpreter or virtual machine examples of mobile code are java javascript activex cobra and software agents effects 0705 the actual damage done to the security of the system under attack depends on the action triggered this action is called the payload and can vary from benign or action to catastrophic action in general malicious software attacks system ava ilability and data integrity by corrupting files on the system attacks against t he confidentiality of data on the system are less common the most obvious attack on confidentiality is the clandestine capturing of usernames and passwords for use in subsequent hacking attacks threat 0706 malicious software can originate from many sources such as disaffected staff foreign intelligence services investigative journalists or terror ists however in practice the vast majority of malicious software attacks originate from delinquent enthusiasts who are unlikely to gain from the inconvenience caused apart from certain amount of notoriety there are exceptions to this vulnerabilities 0707 in order to be effective malicious software attack has to gain access to the system in some way viruses can be propagated in number of ways any medium that can store or transmit data can carry virus including diskettes cdr oms network communication lines telephonemodem lines disk fax machines and email attachments the most common sources of risk are described below software pirated software engineering diagnostic software free software given away with magazines shareware and even shrinkwrapped commercial software from reputable sources have all been responsible for spreading viruses the only way to provide your system with adequate protection is to trust one almost all viruses are spread unintentionally check everything for viruses before placing your system at risk unclassified malicious software jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 75 unclassified b internet the internet is popular source of viruses and all files downloaded from email bulletin boards webpages or any other internet source should be treated with suspicion until they have been checked c home computers carrying out official work on home computers is becoming more common unfortunately the majority of home users do not practise safe computing and can bring viruses into the office the advent of macroviruses has dramatically increased the risk of infection from this source disks must be checked every time they have been used outside the office d email email messages themselves may carry viruses but more commonly attachments are used macroviruses are the most common forms spread in this way an attachment should not be opened until it has been scanned deliberate infection by user or hacker the vast majority of virus incidents are accidental but the deliberate introduction of virus into specific system is possible and may be attractive to some 0708 number of ways of gaining access to system for the purpose of delivering malicious software are described below access during software development by authorized programmers provides opportunities for building in trojan horses and logic bombs this is unlikely in proprietary products not aimed specifically at the defence market but time bombs designed to ensure licence payments are not unknown risks to bespoke software can be reduced by the use of quality assurance and appropriate personnel security clearances b access via communication links systems accessible to public communications networks are extremely vulnerable to hacking and such connection may be made without authority from the appropriate accreditor direct connection to public network is easily avoided by the system administrator but considerable care should be taken to ensure that onward connection is not made via another system this includes remote diagnostic facilities c access via user terminal this could be either keyboard or other software loading point such as disk drive user can be an end user systems user or programmer each presents different risks in general standalone and small networked systems use dos windows 3x 95 98 2000 or nt which allow easy access to all parts

development 0713 there are two main ways in which software development and amendment takes place when an upgrade of the operating system or application programs is offered by computer manufacturer or where software programs are written by suitably qualified inhouse personnel to enhance or develop applications and utilities the following unclassified malicious software jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 77 unclassified security measures are to apply to software amendment upgrade and development assurance software enforcing security functionality may require evaluating and certification in accordance with current national standards this process effectively defines the quality assurance level required in the pre paration of such software b commercial software all system software changes must be authorized through formal change control procedure in certain circumstances where software amendment is received from software manufacturer or mod software bureau the twoperson rule may need to be applied when the amendment is loaded onto the system this is to ensure unauthorized modification andor tampering can take place from the time it is received from the supplier until the time it is loaded into the system c in house development software where software programs andor amendments are carried out inhouse by suitable qualified staff the following measures are to be enforced 1 system of quality inspection is to be established to ensure that unauthorized modification andor amendments have been made to the software 2 the amendment and change is to be fully documented and hard copy of the software code is to be retained on file 3 the software is to be thoroughly tested on an independent pc or system before loading onto the operationallive system 4 the twoperson rule is to be strictly adhered to when loading the software onto the operationallive system to prevent unauthorized modification and tampering before the loading takes place 5 the software amendment or change must be authorized through formal change control procedure viruses 0714 most viruses are designed to attack systems running the most popular operating systems to date these are dos microsoft windows 3x 95 98 2000 and nt viruses have been written for other operating systems such as linux and the apple macintosh environment but these make up fraction of the overall virus population 0715 viruses come in variety of forms using different techniques to both hide and unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 78 unclassified propagate initially viruses could only spread via the boot sector of disk or w ith an executable program file the macro language facility in microsoft offi ce products especially microsoft word provides the environment for new generation of virus writers the development of powerful macro languages has blurred the boundary between data and programs making it possible to propagate viruses via wordprocessing documents and spreadsheets 0716 macroviruses now pose the greatest threat to systems as they are much m ore likely to be passed from user to user either via diskette or email this tec hnique also allows macro viruses to cross to different operating systems because an infe cted word document created on windows machine might run quite happily on an apple macintosh running word 0717 the popularity of microsoft word has led to the majority of macro viruses to date being written for this and other microsoft office products any word document file unless it is in rtf format could potentially contain virus staff should not assume the macro virus problem only exists for microsoft any product that gains popularity and has facility to execute user statements is liable to be misuse d by the virus writers 0718 any form of executable file or object is vulnerable to virus infection once activated the virus payload may attack any file stored within the system or ny system within network systems are particularly vulnerable in working areas where ac cess and the circulation of floppy disks are uncontrolled email attachments are now the primary method for transporting infected objects 0719 actual infection of host computer occurs when the virus code is executed viruses are designed so that the act of executing them is triggered without t he knowledge or consent of the user when normal process is carried out 0720 there are number of ways of detecting viruses none of them are perfect viruses can be identified directly by their form or signature by their actions or by changes made to previously uninfected files it is these techniques along with strong procedures that allow the threat from viruses to be combated annex b gives details of techniques of virus detection annex c gives details of defensive techniques against viruses antivirus software 0721 the use of antivirus scanners is fundamental to effective antivirus strategy and forms key component of mod policy wide range of antivirus softwa re avs is available to scan systems

training of all users in measures against malicious software is cri tical otherwise protective procedures will not be followed helpdesk staff should also be trained in recognising virus infections and should be familiar with reporting procedures it is also essential that effective contingency plans are in place to recover system s from virus attacks and this implies trained personnel as well as suitable software management controls 0731 most network operating systems employ security features which if applied correctly will provide adequate file protection any file or directory on the network that the user can modify is at risk from virus the system administrator should adhere to the following rules when setting permissions for filesdirec tories on the network all executable files and shared templates on the network should be put into readonly directory b each user should have their own private home directory on the network other users may be allowed to read from but not write to these home directories if users workstation becomes infected the same users home directory on the network may also become infected but the rest of the network will be safe c there is often requirement for shared directories on the network unclassified malicious software jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 711 unclassified these allow for example for documents to be created and modified by more than one user if one users workstation becomes infected the shared directory may become infected if second uninfected user workstation then accesses files on the shared directory this too may become infected each time file is accessed from the shared directory it should be treated with caution and checked with antivirus software prior to opening 0732 for large systems and networks the system security officer or an appropriately security trained member of staff should be identified as the focal point for the reporting of virus infections this role should be defined together with an agreed scope of authority in the security policy documentation this member of staff should be familiar with the escalation procedures in event of largescale virus infection these escalati on procedures should cover actions to be taken with regard to connected systems and reporting procedures to higher mod authorities incident handling is covered in chapter 11 0733 large systems and networks should have documented procedures on managing incidents in the form of an incident response plan irp as defined at chapter 3 this should include details as to how levels of degradation are to be managed if it is required for operational reasons for networks and interconnected systems it may be necessary t have form of service level agreement to cover circumstances which could include whether to keep the system running and manage in conjunction with the avs vendor b sever interconnections with other systems c take the system down user action in the event of virus infection 0734 users should be familiar with the actions required by the syops in the event of virus infection the actions and disinfection procedures will vary between systems and according to the stage of the infection if in doubt and virus attack is suspected the following actions must be taken stop using the workstation at once b do not switch off or reboot the system until given permission to do so by local security

workstations and disks is only to be carried out by personnel specifically authorized to do so by psya reporting and investigation 0737 all malicious software incidents are to be reported initially using the form at laid down in annex to chapter 11 then when resolved to the unified incident reporting and alert scheme as described in chapter 11 it is essential that an investigation is carried out so that the source of the malicious software can be established and action taken to limit the spread of infection and minimize the chance of recurre nce the investigation should be initiated by psya in accordance with their own procedures unclassified malicious software jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 7a1 unclassified annex to chapter 7 workstation media authorization guard wmag previously known as flexible disc authorization guard fdag 1 systems which prevent unauthorized floppy disks being used on the pc significantly reduce the opportunity for viruses to be introduced however unless authorization is always preceded by thorough virus scan preferably by more than one scanning product they provide specific defence against the virus itself 2 wmag are proactive in that they aim to prevent any situation where virus can infect computer system through floppy drive they work on the principle that once the guard system is loaded on pc only authorized floppy disks can be used whether or not the individual pc is granted the right to authorize software is decided when the system is loaded wmag provide mixture of software and hardware control 3 usually one pc would be nominated as gateway sheepdip pc for group of pcs for safety the gateway should be standalone pc at least while it is being used in the gateway mode it is then used to scan all floppy disks to ensure they are free of infection most wmag type products come bundled with virus scanner it is generally agreed that it would be sensible to use second virus scanner to give some additional protection once the disk is declared clean the wmag then adds an electronic signature to the disk this signature contains checksum which i s related to the contents of the disk it is this signature that is required by every other pc to prove that it has been authorized some wmag systems use this mechanism to pre vent the disk from being used on other pcs which have not been loaded with the wmag some wmag systems permit the disk to be used outside the group but if the disk is written to by any device which does not have the wmag loaded the checksum wil l become invalidated subsequently when the disk is loaded onto wmag pc the signature is verified before any access is permitted any disk which has been used outside of the wmag group would be required to be scanned and reauthorized by the gateway pc 4 some wmag have additional utilities to monitor all processor activity nd then to prevent and report any actions which have been designated by the user as illegal such as an unauthorised write access to elsewhere on the disk this helps identify any virus which has not been caught by the gateway scan or has been introduced into the pc through the communications port from modem unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 7a2 unclassified 5 the main advantages of the wmag system are that only authorized floppy disks can be used with the pc this not only reduces the risk of malicious software but also the use of pirated software and generally any unofficial software b only those pcs designated as gateways need have virus scanning software bought for them this reduces the overall cost and also the upgrading effort required every time an update for the scanner is produced this can be every month of course in some circumstances each stand alone pc can be designated as its own gateway and thus authorize its own floppy disks however this detracts from the additional control which this system offer s and should be discouraged unless required for local operationaljustified reasons 6 the only disadvantage of using wmag is the additional cost however wmag type systems are typically significantly cheaper than virus scanners t he cost of any additional virus scanner would be limited to the number of gateway machines unclassified malicious software jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 7b1 unclassified annex b to chapter 7 techniques of virus detection categories of virus protection products 1 virus protection products can be divided into three broad categories on demand on access and activity monitoring on demand products require the user to initiate virus detection by starting the antivirus software manually this is the most common way of using scanners and is ideal for providing controlled antivirus boundary for an organization it is only necessary to install such software on small number of quarantine sheep dip pcs to provide measure of protection for all the organizations pcs on access products check files automatically whenever they are to be acce ssed to be effective this software must be installed on all the systems to be prot ected activity monitoring software does not detect viruses as such but detects and blocks suspicious activity to be effective this software must be installed and act ive on all systems to be protected antivirus software must be upgraded on regular basis and kept current detection by virus signature 2 each virus has form that can be recognised by appropriate software provided it is known virus this is the basis of the best known type of antivirus software virus scanners advantages 1 the input medium can be scanned for known viruses before any files are loaded or copied onto the systems hard disks 2 companion software can normally locate and remove the virus 3 single pc can act as guard for all other systems by scanning all incoming disks b disadvantages 1 only viruses known to the scanner will be detected as new viruses are constantly being created often by modifying old viruses unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 7b2 unclassified there is always the risk of an unknown virus slipping through undetected 2 false detections can occur when part of valid file is mista ken for virus 3 compressed andor encrypted files may thwart the scanner 4 virus scanners must be continually upgraded to take account of new viruses 5 polymorphic multishaped viruses are particularly difficu lt to detect as they can change their signature at each replication detection by virus activity 3 viruses can be detected by monitoring the system for suspicious actions virus protection software is available that will detect and intercept suspicious ctions before any harm can be done advantages unknown viruses can be detected and harmful actions can be prevented b disadvantages 1 detects viruses only after they become active however if the virus is not allowed to perform any damaging action this may not be considered disadvantage 2 the antivirus software must be installed and running on all pcs at all times to monitor program activity apart from the cost the presence of such program will affect system performance 3 legitimate programs may initiate suspicious actions during normal running giving false detections most antivirus programs of this type allow the user to identify privileged programs that are allow ed to use specific illegal methods this can be complex to set up especially on large number of pcs and provides potential loophole for virus to exploit detection of file changes checksumming 4 viruses that attach themselves to programs will make changes that are detectable in its most primitive form the program file will become slightly longer but it is possible for unclassified malicious software jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 7b3 unclassified virus to overcome this more sophisticated detection methods introduce some sort of digital signature calculated from the original file contents if the file is infected its signature will be different making the infection apparent advantages 1 can detect unknown viruses 2 has little effect on performance as the file checking proces s is only active while program is being loaded for running b disadvantages 1 must be installed on all systems 2 will not detect viruses that were already present when the initial file signature was calculated 3 depends on the files it is monitoring being relatively static this makes the technique unsuitable for guarding against macroviruses heuristic scanning 5 although the name implies learning process in practice most software that uses this technique checks files for the potential of virus type activity this is normall done by disassembling the program code to detect suspicious functions in essence it is an activity monitor which works prior to the virus becoming active advantages 1 prevents damaging activity before the virus can execute 2 can detect unknown viruses 3 significant performance implications 4 single pc can act as guard for all other systems by scanning all incoming disks b disadvantages 1 can generate many false alarms 2 has been unreliable in the past but this technique is improving and may become the best defence against macroviruses unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 7b4 unclassified this page intentionally left blank unclassified malicious software jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 7c1 unclassified annex c to chapter 7 defensive techniques against viruses introduction 1 an effective defence against viruses can only be provided by using combination of defensive techniques and antivirus software products security can also be considerably enhanced by effective configuration management in general this is easie r to achieve with networked system of pcs controlled by network manager than with standalone pcs configuration management 2 configuration management cm is normally associated with large syste ms however there is considerable advantage to applying it to standalone pcs and small systems to ensure that only authorized software is installed if cm is introduced and enforced only authorized software can be installed significantly re ducing the probability of it being infected in the first place and ensuring that it is properly virus checked before installation it should be noted that the use of unlicensed software is an offence under the 1988 computer copyright acts and the use of licensed software used for purpose other than that authorized by users organization is also an offence under the computer misuse act see chapter 1 backups 3 if system is subjected to virus attack the only effective means of recovering may be to recover the files from backedup material the key to any recovery programme is good backup procedures accordingly procedures for regularly backing up data must be identified in system syops prevention of boot sector viruses 4 pcs vulnerability to boot sector viruses can be reduced significantly by resetting its system default settings in the basic inputoutput system bios to boot di rectly from the c drive instead of looking at the drive first unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 7c2 unclassified boundary protection disks 5 an organization can protect itself very effectively from disk borne vir uses by setting up boundary protection facility boundary protection is implemented by ensuring that all input media are subjected to virus checking and cleaning on specifically designated sheep dip pcs before any files can be copied to the organizations working pcs it is recommended that the sheep dip pcs utilize both virus signature scanner and an heuristic scanner often included in the same package if effective boundary controls are introduced disks can be exchanged within the organization with minimum risk of viruses being propagated boundary control can be enforced by using disk authorization software which makes it impossible for non authorized disks to be read by pcs within the boundary boundary protection electronic mail 6 electronic communication such as email that is strictly confined to intra organization communication will not need boundary protection if disk boundary protection is enforced external communications other than those conducted via an airgapped system should only occur via one of the organizations servers it is the network managers responsibility to ensure that effective antivirus software is installed w hich will check all incoming and outgoing mail for viruses before forwarding t its destination email scanner 7 this resides on firewall server and scans all email before it is passed through to the destination email server it is good network design to use this on server in combination with onaccess scanners on workstations boundary protection internet 8 internet connections are only allowable with authorization from the appropriate accreditor it is recommended that an airgap be maintained between the internet terminal and user systems files originating from the internet should be transferred using disk via the disk boundary facility protection at users workstation 9 boundary protection is very effective but it is still possible for viruses to reach the users workstation via number of loopholes unknown viruses will not be detected by unclassified malicious software jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 7c3 unclassified signature scanner and may fool an heuristic scanner but the biggest loophole is introduced by the increasingly common use of compression and encryption it is not possible for any antivirus product to

an open environment whose whole purpose is to facilitate the exchange of information however its very openness also makes it vulnerable to security threats the inte rnet is public network that has central management or control the user has control over the route message will take when it crosses the internet and it is possible for messages to be read or modified connection of system to the internet makes it vulnerable to other internet users with malicious intent even though very tiny minority of users will attempt to steal alter or delete information or disrupt services and systems the risk will always be there 1002 the more common uses of the internet include email which allows the exchange of mail messages with other us ers anywhere in the world email is more than messaging service as it provides the facility to append variety of attachments b world wide web is multimedia environment for publishing and sharing information on the internet it provides access to millions of documents called web pages the documents can be in variety of formats including plain text files pictures and video c information exchange file transfer provides the facili ty to send and receive virtually any type of data file software programme text graphics video and sound across the internet these will often be appended as attachments to mail messages d ecommerce and electronic data

1101 the mod has generic procedures for handling of many security incidents in particular those of terrorist or criminal nature which are well blished and simply codified 1102 mods ability to respond and contain security incidents occurring within the electronic security environment of the mods cis is fundamentally less easy to reduce to simple rules as the nature of issues constituting an incident is less clearly delineated in these cases the topic of incident handling is part of the wider iss ue of what is referred to in allied groupings as alert warning and response awr with details of the warning policy within mod being contained in chapter 2 annex g 1103 of particular note is the fact that even if such an event occurs on an unclassified or cl4 cis it may either directly or indirectly put officia l information at risk or have additional implications good illustration of such wider implications would be the unauthorised modification eg defacement by hacker of an official website this is compromise of the integrity of official informat ion albeit unclassified and is likely to attract much greater amount of unfavourable reaction from both the press and potentially parliament than the perceived impact of the incident in confidentially terms would suggest 1104 it is worth noting some terminology event an activity detected on cis that may or may not be suspicious but affects cis with security relevance eg an auditable activity like failed logon or icmp echo request ping on firewall b incident any unauthorised event affecting cis with security relevance eg computer misuse c intrusion any set of actions that penetrate system and attempt to compromise the integrity confidentiality or availability of securit barrier d attack any incident or intrusion with

compliancerelated activities carried out on behalf of the principa l security advisor psya or defence security standards organisation dsso and the dso respectively 1208 security reviews comprise three main elements procedural review examination of manual logs such as document registers and room access registers system accounting records should be scrutinised for violations or incidents b hardware review validation of hardware inventories and examination of cable infrastructure c technical review verification that the technical measures appl ied within the electronic security environment are appropriate and operating correctly 1209 the purpose of an installation vulnerability review ivr is to r eview the system configuration model scm as described in chapter 3 against known

larger and more complex nature the operation of such systems will almos t certainly involve specialist staff to manage their technical operation and it is i mportant to realise that security considerations start very early in the procurement cycl 1302 it covers both vote 1 nonoperational and vote 3 dpa led procurement procedures and by alternative measures such as those installed and operated for mod by pfi and ppp partners systems not procured using these methods are still subject to security input and all procurement is to follow the guidance given in jsp 343 mod it project guide security considerations at the planning stage 1303 the introduction of security features into an existing systemenvironment can be timeconsuming and costly much expense time and inconvenience will however be avoided if the system and installation are designed with security considerations taken into full account from the outset 1304 this requires the total involvement of the security staff from the initial planning stages and throughout development and installation so that maximum benefit can be derived from the recognised authorities in the various fields of computer curity defence security standards organisation dsso or tlb principal security advise r psya staff or their nominated representatives are to be informed when proposals are submitted for new or enhanced installation 1305 at the outset of project the nature of the security policy documentation that i s required should be agreed with the mod accreditor this is particularly important if contractor is being employed to produce the security policy documentation 1306 an it security working group swg must be established for all large complex or operational cis systems and projects the swg is to be formed from the outset for all cis systems and projects and is to be chaired by senior member of the projectsystem staff who will also provide resources accommodation and administrative support for the swg the swg is responsible for all aspects of security within the project or system and for supporting the accreditor and project sponsor it reports to the project sponsor accreditor and project board and is to meet at frequent intervals as determined by the project sponsor and accreditor throughout the whole lifespan of the project or system the role of the swg is covered in chapter 2 unclassified defence manual

the boundary for the systems that forms the target of accreditation should be carefully established before identifying assets all sensitive and va luable assets within the boundary which are essential to the business process should be identified 1416 assets are divided into groups typically as follows unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 146 unclassified information and

these can be expressed in terms of confidentiality avai lability and integrity and an asset could therefore have its value expressed at three different levels asset register 1418 an asset register is

groups of assets should be identified and an assessment made of the levels of those vulnerabilities the level is an indicator of how serious each vulnerability is and the likelihood that if threat was to manifest itself that the vulnerability would be successfully exploited the vulnerability level should also reflect the probability that vulnerabilities will be discovered in the s ystem during its lifetime risk management 1422 risk management is the process by which perceived risks are eliminated reduced accepted or transferred this involves the identification selection and adoption of countermeasures to the identified security risks to reduce them to level that is assessed as acceptable it may also involve activities to manage the uncertainty of risk assessment through monitoring or risk reduction studies planning for repeat assessments and preparing contingency plans should the risk prove unacceptable in the future balance has to be agreed between proactive and reactive risk management measures 1423 risk management responsibilities and ownership of risk must be clearly identified agreed and assigned accountability can be achieved by the use of risk management statement this is the formal acceptance of which risks are going to be avoided accepted transferred or limited together with acceptance of the costs implied by those choices the risk management statement will

be mod government or public telephony operator pto provided is fully secure and calls are vulnerable to interception and overhearing although the following nonsecurity factors do provide some element of protection dilution effect it is technically difficult and expensive to identify and extract particular telephone calls when they are mixedin with the myriad of telephone calls that make up the rest of telephone networks at any one instant b dispersion effect the dynamic routing of calls over telephone networks further complicates the targeting of particular traffic since cal l between two points if repeated is unlikely to be routed via the same channel on both occasions c c ompression and multiplexing most communications media incorporate features enabling the maximum amount of data to be sent down given channel compression and multiplexing techniques are often applied to communication channels to eliminate the otherwise redundant capacity taken up by the natural pauses in conversation thereby achieving higher capacity network though utilised for mainly commercial reasons such features deter casual access to the information being passed and thus afford further degree of inherent security 1802 telephones are vulnerable in the following ways casual overhearing this is overhearing by persons nearby the telephone instrument being used or those who may have access to the communications path such as switchboardhelpline operators technicians linesmen or other subscribers by cross connection feature interaction or induction if the matter overheard is interesting enough this may thereafter encourage deliberate eavesdropping b deliberate interception this is intentional planned interception by foreign intelligence services subversive organizations or militant members of protest nationalist organisations and members of the press the techniques involved include the use of covert eavesdropping devices and hacking into telephone switch software restricted defence

not normally be aware that their calls are being routed over microwave links such links can be intercepted from numerous places including foreign diplomatic premises both within the uk and overseas protection of telephone calls 1804 the following defines the requirements for the protection of telephone conversations top secret top secret telephone calls must always be made over cryptographically protected secure systems b secret and confidential secret and confidential telephone calls should be made over secure cryptographically protected systems unless the telephone exchange is mod operated and has been accredited for passage of secret between directly connected extensions in all such cases the accreditation process must involve the dsso and be carried out in accordance with annex c restricted telephone networks in mainland uk are approved for telephone calls up to and including restricted without additional countermeasures calls to from and outside mainland uk are limited to unclassified only restricted or above calls must be made over encrypted links procedural security aspects 1805 the requirements for technical countermeasures are supplemented by procedural protection in the form of rules for users of telephone systems these rules which place responsibility for safe use of the telephone on the user are protectively marked information is to be disclosed to an unknown caller if in doubt or where there are suspicious circumstances the caller should be asked to give telephone number at which he can be rung back this number should be checked from telephone directory or with the organisation whom the caller claims to represent before any official information is disclosed if necessary users will first obtain formal authentication b when establishing call in which protectively marked information is to be discussed it is the responsibility of the calling party to satisfy himself t hat the recipient is bona fide the communications system in itself will not always be an adequate safeguard for this purpose and it is stressed that even for some modern systems which provide visible authentication of the connected terminal restricted telephone security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 185 restricted equipments themselves this cannot be taken to provide any significant measure of authentication of the actual user of the equipment during given call c the use of guarded language veiled speech to protect protectively marked information is at best unsatisfactory and should only be employed in emergencies d if during the period of call if either caller recognises the other part is raise the level of the conversation above the highest protective marking permitted for the system then the call should be terminated immediately when using system cleared to handle protectively marked information callers should ensure they are familiar with any specific secure mode indication such as handset indicator light or audio tone injection used by that particular system special care must be taken with those legacy syste ms that use the now deprecated approach of audio tone injection as differing mod systems use these for diametrically opposite purposes 1806 where databases mapping telephone numbers to users or posts are present the inference of the data protection act is that the information will have to be prote cted as if it were

answerphone connected to telephone extension or on voicemail service attached to the telephone network and there are differing security considerations for each case as given below 1809 although the sensitivity of information in any incoming message left on an answerphone is the responsibility of the originator the owner of each answerphone or voicemail box user is to be responsible for regularly checking and clearing incoming messages as there is some risk that individually unclassified messag could be collated to reveal sensitive information 1810 answerphones where answerphones are provided

discovered that facsimile message has gone to an incorrect terminal due to faulty dialling or misrouting the actions set out in paras 18241826 below are to be followed restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 198 restricted 1926 the most common reason for the misdirection is the incorrect use of publ ic switched telephone network pstn dialling codes often and sometimes inaccurately referred to as outside line or bt british telecom codes users are r eminded that before they dial any pstn code they must normally precede it with either 0 or 9 dependent upon telephone exchange to connect the line pstn should not be used as the first choice for connection but as last resort users of insecure f acsimiles who are using stored pstn numbers are to check that they have preceded the code with the correct access digit described 1927 the order of precedence to be used when making facsimile transmissions is as follows use the defence fixed telecommunications service dfts the use of which does not incur charges from public telephony operators pto b use the government telephone network gtn which not only provides access to mod establishments but also to other government departments there is charge for this service but it is less than the equivalent call made through ptos c use the government out of area lines service goals which is feature of the gts which allows trunk long distance calls to be made at local call charge rates d use the pstn 1928 most facsimile machines allow users to insert both the telephone number and terminal identifier normally the branch name of the facsimile machi ne both of these items are displayed on every page transmitted and also they are shown on the di splay panel of facsimile machine trying to transmit to it it is recommende d that both these options are used as they provide simple method of checking that the correct connection has been prior to transmission transmission security violations 1929 transmission security violations occur when any protectively marked information is passed over communication circuits including facsimile not approved for that particular protective marking this includes the partial transmi ssion of protectively marked document 1930 it is essential to report any violation of transmission security at the earliest opportunity to reduce the effects of the compromise of the

misdirected document repair maintenance and disposal 1932 stored numbers should be erased from memory before the equipment is sent for repair or disposal 1933 some equipments also have volatile memory acting as buffer store for data transmitted or received this buffer store is normally cleared when the machine is switched off but for added security an unclassified a4 size paper with computer picture such as computer test pattern or similar document followed by blank sheet of paper should be fed through the machine before the equipment is sent away for repair or disposal 1934 maintenance

telephones that have camera and screen to permit the transmission of photographic images when the telephone is not being used for voice the system also incorporates the use of standalone pc technology to store and manage photograph files the camera can be used to transmit images of either handheld documents equipments persons or items on background 2002 spi systems are subject to the same comsec tempest and procedural security considerations as other telephone equipment and should only be used within the limit of the protective marking for which the equipment and the transmis sion are authorised the limit of protective marking for the transmission is dete rmined by the location of the transmitting and receiving equipment the transmission medium and the accreditation of the local

restricted case by case basis measures taken must also be designed to reveal any signs of tampering or intrusion use of fibreoptic cables 2222 whilst not totally immune from interception fibreoptic cables provide greater degree of security than other media such as copper wire where it is int ended to seek approved circuit status project officers should consider the use of fibre optic cables in preference to metallic conductors 2223 where fibreoptic cables are to be installed the cida will request performance test of each fibre on initial installation and the results of such tests should be archived to allow future comparison if required 2224 splices or connections in fibreoptic cables increase their vulnerabilit to interception although this is reduced by permanent splicing such as fusion where it is necessary to splice fibreoptic cables the fibre optic connector or splice includi ng fusion splicing is to be protected in accordance with 2219 above use of wireless networking

installation of either multisecurity level msl or oneway devices that bridge between protective marking levels in addition to any accreditation requirement accruing from chapter 6 in respect of the software or hardware mechanisms implemented to maintain separation it is also important that for tempest reasons as detailed at chapter 21 electromagnetic separation is provided across the interface

being the art or science concerning the principles means and methods for rendering plain text unintelligible and for converting encrypted messages into an intelligible form 2302 this definition basically refers to the use of encryption decryption for confidentiality but it is worth noting that cryptographic techniques are so used for authentication eg digital signatures and integrity eg cryptog raphic checksums and message digests 2303 cryptography is implemented in one of two distinct manners symmetric cryptography where it is essential that all the cryptog raphic key variables are private between parties involved in the particular community this is sometimes referred to as private key cryptography b asymmetric cryptography where there are 2 types of cryptographic key variables private key for particular user or community and public key which can be freely published this is usually referred to as public key cryptography pkc 2304 most hmg approved encryption systems currently deployed are based upon symmetric cryptography but there are growing number of asymmetric syste ms being developed 2305 it should be remembered that even when the content of message is encrypted and cannot be read determined longterm attacker can often gain valuable information by analysing the flow of information between parties on communications network this can reveal chains of command or links between organisations and their locations increased activity can indicate reactions to an event or interest in particular incident traffic flow security tfs techniques can be applied to link encryption devices to make it appear that the link is constantly active by making the genuine traffic indistinguishable specialist comsec publications 2306 this chapter is only intended to give an overview of the security requirements relating to cryptographic systems and to provide readily accessible sourc of restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 234 restricted guidance on the use of certain cryptographic systems that due to their w idespread deployment are not solely constrained to use by authorised cryptographic personnel fuller details regarding cryptographic material definitions marking handling and authorization are given in the relevant specialist comsec publications details of which can be obtained by authorised personnel from either the defence comsec authority infosytech within ddefsy or the defence comsec operating authority ia branch within dcsa definition 2307 although full details are given in the relevant specialist comsec publications the following definitions are offered to allow initial discussions to take place 2308 cryptographic system is defined as manual or automated method for rendering plain text unintelligible and for converting encrypted messages into an intelligible form 2309 cryptographic equipment is defined as any equipment whose purpose is to provide protection within communications systems by rendering any information being passed over the system unintelligible and unrecognizable until it reaches the int ended recipient cryptographic equipment used for the security of hmg protectively marked information must be approved by cesg 2310 cryptomaterial is defined as any material pertaining to cryptosy stem or containing information relating to the operation and protection of cryptosystems 2311 cryptographic keymaterial often referred to as key variables or kv or historically as cryptovariables cv is defined as the specific ke setting for given period 2312 cryptographic authorisation is defined as the mandatory approval and education procedures required before personnel prior are granted direct access to cryptomaterial 2313 cryptomaterial may attract an additional restrictive markings eg crypto in addition to its protective marking to indicate the need to limit access and apply extra controls grades of cryptography 2314 cryptographic systems and equipment are graded according to the level of protection they provide the grade of cryptography available will be major fac tor in the selection and approval for particular purpose the grades of cryptography authorised for use in mod are restricted cryptographic systems jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 235 restricted high grade high grade hg cryptography is solely provided as cryptographic equipments which have been designed inhouse by cesg to provide long term security for highly sensitive information b enhanced grade enhanced grade eg cryptography provides security for sensitive information both within and outside great britain nd may be implemented in either cryptographic equipments or in software usi ng either cesg designed algorithms or public domain algorithms that have been approved by cesg c baseline grade baseline grade bg cryptography offers limited protection for official information and will normally be found as software implementation of public domain pd algorithms that have been approved though the cesg assisted product scheme caps or in some legacy cases by the implementation of cesg furnished algorithm wherever possible b g solutions based on pd implementations are preferred for defence use as these will require less constraints in their handling and distribution especially overseas selection of appropriate cryptographic systems 2315 in selecting the grade of cryptography required for mod systems the followi ng matrix is to be used protective marking overall grade of encryption required top secret secret high grade hg confidential enhanced grade eg restricted baseline grade bg note there may be instances encountered where there is discrepancy between the strength of the cryptographic algorithm used and the architectural protection afforded by the system implementation in such case the overall grade of encryption is determined by the lower of these two ratings 2316 mod policy differs from the guidance given in the government manual of protective security mps and cesg handbook on cryptographic security bid011 in that mod does not routinely permit the protection of short term secret information which is defined in mps as information which is likely to have decreased to the equivalent of confidential or less within one year by enhanced grade eg cryptography however the mod does recognise the concept of genuine ephemeral data as laid down at chapter 1 restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 236 restricted and the requirements above may be varied on case by case basis provided that the defence comsec operating authority can be satisfied that the information in question is genuinely ephemeral within the sense of this manual b mod requires restricted material elsewhere in the uk than the mainland eg northern ireland to be protected by encryption whilst in transit 2317 system sponsors are to provide defence comsec operating authority with details of their intended secure communications linknetwork during initial planning stages this should include information on the community of interestsize of network location of terminals protective marking of information to be passed and whether any special categories of information are to be handled 2318 for situations requiring either hg and eg cryptography traffic flow securit tfs techniques will normally be required and any decision not to implement such an approach must be agreed with the defence comsec operating authorit where requirements are identified to use cryptographic equipments in manner for which they are not explicitly approved eg encrypting low across high specific sanc tion must be sought from the both the defence comsec operating authority and infos tytech 2319 all approved cryptosystem are to be operated in accordance with the relevant handling instructions which will be either in the form of british inte rdepartmental document bid normally for hg systems or defence information assurance notice dian normally for eg and bg systems it should be noted that completion of the caps approval process for eg and bg systems does not mean that either kv generation procedures or handling instructions will have been completed and it is the responsibility of the defence infosec product coordination group dipcog chaired by infosytech with representation from both the defence comsec operating authority and cesg to ensure that these steps have been completed before iss uing dian which will allow the use of such products in defence public key cryptography 2320 public key cryptography pkc and in particular the public key infrastructures pki needed to support any large scale implementation of pkc within defence is the subject of evolving policy 2321 pkc equipments not requiring the use of any supporting pki eg bid2010 brent may be used in defence in accordance with the operating instructions detai led in the appropriate national andor departmental publications 2322 any requirement for the use of pki with defence should be referred to both the mod pki management authority for advice and must be endorsed by both the defence comsec operating authority and the accreditators before procureme nt action is initiated restricted cryptographic systems jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 237 restricted operational exigencies 2323 in extreme circumstances an operational commander of not less than 2 rank may determine that there are operational imperatives for enhanced grade eg encryption to be used for the protection of short term secret information accepting the consequential security risks these circumstances should only be for limited time period for example the duration of specific operat ional missi on must be notified in writing to the defence comsec operating authority and mus t only be in respect of communications or it systems or networks wholly within the commanders jurisdiction these circumstances will therefore not be permitted in networked environment where commanders decision could lead to propagation of unacceptable risks to the rest of the community or where third party controlled or released information is stored or processed on the systems 2324 when considering the use of enhanced grade eg encryption for the protection of short term secret information if any of the following considerations apply then the use of high grade hg encryption will continue to be required communication links which are especially attractive to foreign intelligenc services b large communication networks or high volume links readily interceptible by foreign intelligence service c situations where the local threat is greater than level 4 moderate and tempest or tamper protection is an issue approval procedures 2325 when it has been determined that encryption is necessary the defence comsec operating authority will identify the most appropriate equipment for the pur pose and give approval for the requirement any approval will be restricted to par ticular area of operations will limit the type of information to be passed and will only be on case by case basis approval for use of cryptographic equipment will not be delegated to any other organisation procurement of crypto equipment 2326 when the correct grade of equipment has been determined and approved demand or procurement action sometimes referred to as crypto callout is to be taken through appropriate cryptographic equipment sponsors it should be noted that significant lead times may be required for some types of cryptographic quipment restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 238 restricted provision of cryptographic keymaterial 2327 the defence comsec operating authority is responsible for the provision and management of cryptographic keymaterial for secure systems having been made aware of potential requirements 2317 the defence comsec operating authority will liase with the system sponsor to enable the appropriate type of cryptographic keymaterial to be produced at least 3 months advance notice must be given of any requirements 2328 test keymaterial will be provided to locations where cryptographic equipment is to be installed to facilitate engineering of the equipment and testing the insta llation operational keymaterial will not be authorised for issue until the instal lation has been certified as satisfactory by the idacida 2329 cryptographic keymaterial will

to be provided to defence contractors who must have list x status for any purpose other than repair under an existing mod contract must have prior approval from the defence security standards organisation dsso comsec office acting on behalf of dcsa project sponsors or other authorities seeking this approval should provide the contract number which dictates the issue handling requirements 2331 cryptomaterial bearing the crypto marking referred to as crypto items require special handling and wholelife accounting procedures and detailed guidance on the measures for crypto items is contained in bid011 2332 other items of cryptomaterial which do not warrant crypto marked handling and wholelife accounting procedures may attract specific requirements either generically as in the case of us sources crypto controlled items cci or on c aseby case basis as laid down in the relevant bid or dian movement of cryptographic equipment 2333 where cryptographic equipment protectively marked confidential or above is not subject to special handling within crypto channels ie supplied through stores channels it should be moved in accordance with the regulations for the movement of protectively marked equipment as detailed in jsp 440 volume 1 any restricted cryptographic systems jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 239 restricted item bearing the crypto marking must of course be moved through crypto channels export control aspects 2334 cryptographic systems are regarded by many countries as requiring specific export controls unless they have symmetric key of less than 128 bits which are exempted under the terms of the wassenaar arrangement 2335 all hg and eg cryptography authorised for use within hmg can be considered to constitute strong encryption in export control terms and will thus gene rally require an export licence in addition to cesg release procedures bg cryptography based on cesg algorithms will attract similar constraints but bg cryptography based on pd algorithms may well have more flexible export posture which is major re ason for the defence preference for unencumbered pd solutions at the bg level the defence comsec operating authority should therefore be consulted before making any plans to move cryptographic systems from the uk or permanent overseas locations having first reviewed the relevant bid or dian installation of cryptographic equipment 2336 installation of cryptographic equipment is only to be carried out by appropriately trained and cleared personnel 2337 high grade cryptographic equipment is normally confidential but assumes the same level of protective marking as the cryptographic keym aterial when operational physical security to be provided is therefore dependent on the protective marking level of the operational machine this may be achieved by insta lling the equipment in an appropriate security container as identified in the catalogue of security furniture where it is impractical to install within cont ainer eg because of the volume of equipment rooms in which the cryptographic equipment is installed are to be of secure room type or b standard 2338 enhanced grade cryptographic equipment where approved to process confidential should be installed to the to the standards as laid down at annex b in all other case it is essential that good engineering practices as id down in jsp480 are observed 2339 baseline grade cryptographic equipment is unclassified when it does not contain cryptographic key when filled with cryptographic key either electronically or physically it must be protected in accordance with the protect ive marking of the key when operating attended at cease work such devices must be switched off when unfilled baseline grade devices must be protected s as to prevent theft tampering or unauthorised modification restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 2310 restricted secure containers 2340 where cryptographic equipment is installed in secure container the c ontainer is to be firmly fixed to the fabric of the structure 2341 secure containers are not to be drilled or cut for access except through the panels provided for this purpose the drilling of holes in any other part of container renders it insecure and longer approved for secure storage jsp 440 volume 1 refers installation standards 2342 cryptographic equipment and

encryption between end user computer systems the accreditor may require that encryption keys be lodged at any mod controlled secure managed interface smi as defined at chapter 15 that is transitted to facilitate checks for malicious software chapter 7 and transmission violations chapter 11 incident handling 2349 the main threat to any cryptographic system is the possibility of the physical compromise of its keying material the strictest possible control must be xercised over cryptographic material from the time of its production to its destruction 2350 the loss of cryptographic equipment cipher code or any protectively marked associated document or the loss of any document which may prejudice the use of cryptographic system constitutes compromise of the system 2351 any instance of physical violation compromise or loss affecting cryptosystems must be handled as matter of urgency by the crypto custodians for hg or eg installations and by either the relevant unit security officer or crypto cust odian where one exists for bg systems report must be raised to both the def ence comsec operating authority and the joint security coordination centre jsy cc in accordance with chapter 11 authentication by cryptography 2352 where cryptographic authentication is required formally approved digital signature mechanisms should be used details of which can be obtained from infosytech it should be noted that where cryptography is being used for encryption decryption purposes to maintain confidentiality this cannot be assumed to automatically provide cryptographic authentication integrity by cryptography 2353 where cryptographic integrity checks are required formally cryptographic integrity mechanisms eg cryptographic checksums and message digests should be used details of which can be obtained from infosytech it should be noted that where cryptography is being used for encryption decryption purposes to maint ain confidentiality this cannot be assumed to automatically provide cryptographic integrity restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 2312 restricted interoperable cryptography 2354 most cryptographic systems in official defence use at present are those designed and built for uk government purposes and their interoperability options where applicable are based on this model limited number of online cryptographic equipments of either uk or allied origin can be configured to allow their interoperation with external entities typically defence allies and it i s important that any such interoperability requirement is identified to the defence comsec perating authority as early as possible in the procurement cycle 2355 there is growing requirement for use of bg pd cryptography to allow protected information exchange with wider range of external partners who would not have been eligible for the release of cryptographic systems based upon cesg algorithms 2356 most early implementations of such technologies eg pgp for hmg rely on asynchronous communications techniques and their interoperation can therefore be configured retrospectively if so required without consequential risk of data loss 2357 there is growing requirement to extend such techniques to online cryptography for example to permit the implementation of clientserve r virtual private network csvpn as defined in chapter 22 and such implementations should wherever possible be based upon public domain standards to obviate the risks of mod becoming locked into any proprietary solution the two major standards in this area are the internet engineering task force ietf internet protocol security ipsec and transport level security tls and the standards underpinning their use for defence are contained at annexes c and d respectively the handling instructions for any product implementation of these standards will be found in the related dian restricted cryptographic systems jsp 440 volume

operations or exercises or for use by personnel on uk military bases outside the uk this annex is intended for those personnel who may be attending overseas meetings courses and similar events in an official ca pacity and whose duties may require them to carry such encrypted systems the importance of protecting portable systems containing protectively marked information cannot be overstated it is emphasised that the key consideration in the overseas movement of such systems must be the maintenance of their security in accordance with jsp 440 2 this annex does not affect the restrictions and regulations for the movement of any other form of cryptomaterial or equipment removal of export controls for personal systems 3 during the last year export regulations covering the import and export of cryptographic equipment and algorithms have been relaxed this has come about as result of an international agreement signed at wassenaar in december 1998 and now formally incorporated into many nations regulations and legislation for instance portable computer systems employing encryption products and carried for personal use should longer be subject to export control in signatory nations examples of such products are kilgetty secrets for hmg and safedial modems there is longer any requirement to carry an open general export licence for the movement of such systems overseas open

transport layer security tls introduction 1 the aim of this annex is to document the mod requirements for implementation of transport layer security tls standard as outlined in rfc2246 in cases where baseline grade bg would otherwise be required 2 this requirement is based upon cesg infosec manual t as interpreted for the military environment this document refer only to publicly available implementati ons of tls and the products that use them this pragmatic approach to this particular class of products does not imply similar concessions for any other cryptographic products the uk governments continued position is to evaluate as thoroughly as possible cryptographic mechanisms used to secure protectively marked data in particular inclusion in this document of cryptographic algorithm method or protocol does not imply cesg recommendation unless explicitly stated 3 tls can only be one component in securing distributed system the protocol does not protect the integrity or the confidentiality of any data stored on serve rs or being processed within client domain it provides protection against vulnerabil ities present in the end systems or in the management of those systems other measures designed to assure overall system security may in some circumstances reduc or eliminate the requirement for tls it should also be noted that the advertised presence of tls might mislead users into believing that better system security is present than in fact exists background 4 the transport layer security protocol has been devised by the internet engineering task force ietf as nonproprietary development of the popular secure sockets layer ssl protocol developed by netscape communications corporation for many purposes tls can be thought of as equivalent to ssl v31 tls v10 was released in 1998 5 tls provides transport layer communications security for client server based internet applications its primary use so far has been to provide secure channel between worldwide web browsers and the web servers with which they wish to communicate however tcp port numbers are also defined for tls for use with unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 23d2 unclassified smtp simple mail transfer protocol nntp network news transfer protocol ldap lightweight directory access protocol and pop3 post office protocol 6 complete list of the ports defined for tlsssl can be found at httpwwwianaorg 7 the official goals of tls are cryptographic security interoperabi lity extensibility and relative efficiency these are very similar to the goals of ssl the main changes in tls v10 from ssl v30 are minor security improvements clearer and more precise specification and broader base for future protocols 8 tls enables client and server to secure tcp connection by encrypting all traffic between client and server the protocol does not provide confidentiality or integrity for data stored on the server or when it is processed within the cli ent domain 9 the main benefits of tls can be summarised as follows it is extensible and adaptive it provides means for two partie s to negotiate which cryptographic protocols they will use to communicate b by separating functions tls allows different algorithms and different keys to be used for encryption authentication and data integrity this is advantageous where national or local legislation places limitations on the lengths of certain types of cryptographic keys c in addition tls allows sessions which are not encrypted but which are authenticated and protected against tampering this is useful in countries where encryption is forbidden by law but data integrity is still desired d it is reasonably efficient because of the timeconsuming nature of public key encryption decryption tls allows session security data to be preserved between connections this allows secure communications to begin immediately without the need for extraneous public key operations 10 tls ssl is the only encryption protocol that is present by default in the majority of desktop environments 11 in summary tls is communications security protocol and provides protection against vulnerabilities already present in either communicat ing system it protects the traffic against observation whilst in transit through the network bet ween the tcp connection end points and authenticates those end points to one another limitations 12 tls only provides protection only between tcp end points and other unclassified cryptographic systems jsp 440 vol 3 issue 2 23d3 unclassified appropriate infosec measures must be in place to provide protection outside of those end points configuration 13 tls is not single product but protocol that is implemented to varying standards and degrees of correctness in several commercial products given that most problems in given system are due to the implementation and that it will not be feasible to evaluate commercial implementations cesg have taken pragma tic view as to the configuration offering the best security for protectively marked data 14 the rfc for the tls protocol is constantly under review and the number of available ciphersuites is expanding in particular it is likely that the tls st andard will be updated in the near future to include one or more ciphersuites specifying the recently selected aes algorithm it is therefore likely that situati ons will arise in the near future that are not covered by this document users who believe that such situation applies to their project should contact infosytech for the latest recommendations 15 provided the requirement for encryption is more than hmg baseline grade bg the way in which tls can be used to provide confidentiality and authentication services is in the following configuration only ciphersuites containing cesgapproved cryptographic elements may be used to secure protectively marked data in the current tls rfc t his equates to ciphersuites using i tripledes as the data encryption algorithm ii sha1 as the data integrity algorithm iii dsadss or rsa as the signature algorithm iv either rsa or ephemeral diffiehellman as the key exchange algorithm b for key exchange algorithms the composite modulus size must be 1024 bits c for signature algorithms the modulus must be 1024 bits with 160 bit parameter d servers and clients must be configured to allow selection only of ciphersuites comprising recommended algorithms unclassified defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 23d4 unclassified only tls products configured to authenticate always both the client and the server are to be used to secure protectively marked data f operating procedures should mandate user to check manually the certificate as connection is initiated and before any protectively marke d data passes over the connection g servers are to be configured to perform check of the certificate as connection is initiated and before any protectively marked data passes over the connection h identity certificates are not to be used as the sole method of authentication and identification complementary infosec measures must so be employed the accreditor should contact infosytech as early as possible in the system design cycle to validate these compleme ntary measures i security policy documentation should mandate maximum duration for the validity of retained session security data this is likely t be project dependent and system security managers should contact infosytech through their accreditor before setting value in case should session security data remain valid for more than 24 hours after which new key exchange process must be initiated j to ensure that session security data is not compromised browser s cache must be explicitly flushed at the end of tls session k it is reiterated that tls provides protection only between tcp end points and other appropriate infosec measures must be in place to provide protection outside of those end points dissemination 16 this

concerned over the risk of static password irrespective of its strength being carried clair across public network as compromise of the password can subvert the confidentiality integrity and

nonsecurity factors do provide some element of protection dilution effect it is technically difficult and expensive to identify and extract particular telephone calls when they are mixedin with the

features enabling the maximum amount of data to be sent down given channel compression and multiplexing techniques are often applied to communication channels to eliminate the otherwise redundant

spectrum is very attractive as carrier for co mmunications due to its range speed and high traffic capacity rf is therefore used as carrier for number of modes of transmission including telephone telegraph facsimile speech data and television 2602 the major disadvantages of radio is that it is more susceptible to inte rception than all other means of transmission with it being neither possible to conclusively prevent such interceptions nor possible to detect the unauthorized interception and recording of transmissions in an operational environment it will often be the case that brief and irregular interceptions can be sufficient for both direction finding df and some traffic flow analysis tfa 2603 it can be assumed that an attacker can intercept rf transmissions w ith commercial off the shelf cots equipments at the following ranges as guide frequencies below 30mhz the propagation modes at these frequencies make it difficult to make any sensible guess as to the maxi mum possible intercept range and therefore all such transmissions should be assumed to be liable to regular if not continuous interception b surface transmissions above 30mhz although number of extremely variable factors such as mode of propagation type and height of antenna weather conditions and sunspot activity make it impossible to give precise maximum possible intercept ranges indeed it is not even possible due to varying topographical factors to give generic statement as to what constitutes lineofsight for transmission although if high ground is used for transmitter this may be up to 50km the following broad classification may therefore be used in assessing the risk of interception of broadcast transmissions distance from attacker threat source risk level less than 50km very high between

and trading funds coshoes requiring specific threat guidance should initially contact their psya who will seek spe cialist advice from infosytech 2706 the main elements of the audio security threat are the threat from deliberate attempts to overhear conversations posed by fis especially at locations overseas sophisticated terrorist and subversive organisations and in particular from criminals investigative journalist s private investigators and some members of the public this depends very largely upon the attackers ability to gain access to the site of the target conversation as with most forms of security there is always significant risk of an insider attack where someone with legitimate access is suborned b the threat from conversations accidentally being overheard by those not party to the information this can be result of simple proximity for example unguarded conversations in communal areas or an indirect effect exacerbated by technical means for example nearby microphone in telephone or public address system 2707 the threat posed to an individual or area can increase under certain circumstances this might be because of media interest major financial event s evidence or suspicion of information loss through eavesdropping or for other reasons 2708 the threats associated with the protection of sensitive conversations within mod facilities and platforms against deliberate attack are deta iled in chapter 28 for active eavesdropping chapter 29 structural acoustic protection and chapter 30 acoustic emission security for nonaudio emissions eg sonar principles 2709 good practice and common sense can provide most of the security required for the less sensitive conversations that routinely occur within the mod where the bulk of the information discussed will be at the unclassified or restricted levels the protection of occasional discussions at higher protective marking levels randomly distributed in time and space and diluted by the mass of other information is aided by culture of ongoing good practice 2710 all conversations are inherently vulnerable unless the potential attacker can be denied access to the vicinity of them the vulnerability relates to the area in whic h the conversation is being held an understanding of the basic principles will help determine the need for appropriate countermeasures 2711 the single most important countermeasure is an awareness amongst staff of the security risk associated with overhearing this will involve promoting security awareness amongst new and existing staff through security lectures including unclassified introduction to acoustic security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 275 unclassified induction lectures and other courses and distribution of awareness material it will be intended to warn staff not to discuss sensitive matters in public places or where they can be overheard by uncleared visitors contractors etc 2712 additionally staff must be aware of the need to actively reduce the risk of casual overhearing by closing doors and windows if necessary when holding sensitive discussions 2713 good building access controls will be the main deterrent to any potential eavesdropper good building design is important and the incorporation of sensitive zones sited away from vulnerable points ie adjacent to public areas or toilets or on ground floor perimeters is recommended staff should be well briefed on the need to prevent unauthorised access the regime should be supported by suitable pass and access control systems there should be control and supervision of visitors and staff with limited clearances eg cleaners maintenance staff etc control of loudspeaker telephones 2714 handsfree telephones which have built in loudspeakers can act as microphones passing information from the environment via the telephone system such telephones should be removed from conference or meeting rooms and disconnected when sensitive conversations are being held in their vicinity operations security 2715 the topic of operational security opsec is addressed in more detail at jsp 440 volume 1 but in the context of audio security it is particularly important to consider opsec where the subject matter is notionally unclassified as in ferences can be drawn from operator chatter and mannerisms use of jargon and call signs 2716 administrative discussions experience has shown that notionally unclassified administrative discussions concerning such matters as supply problems technical matters and even social events such as cocktail parties and sports fixtures can be used to provide intelligence on future operational acti vities and can also be of interest to terrorist organisations in particular where discussions relate to the movements of senior officers and vips

devices bugs in order to overhear and transmit or record conversations this includes longterm devices perhaps concealed in the fabric of building quickplant devices hidden in room and certain longrange attack techniques 2802 eavesdropping also extends to the practice of attaching covert recording or transmitting devices taps to telephone or other communications including data lines within the working area this subject is addressed in counter eavesdropping because such linetapping attacks often use the same techniques of surreptitious entry as are used in bugging attacks and are frequently carried out by the same perpetrators against the same targets consequently the countermeasures are very simila r overhearing of cellphone and personal radio conversations by radio interception is covered in chapters 18 and 26 respectively the collection of unintended electro magnetic radiation from equipment such as computers is considered in the chapter 21 2803 the methods problems and techniques involved in the planting of photographic bugs concealed still or video cameras are essentially the same as those used for udio bugs although the object of the attack will be slightly different they are less com mon than audio bugs but the protective measures are essentially the same threat 2804 the general threat of eavesdropping and other attacks is covered in the threat assessment which is issued annually to principal security advisors psya in tlbs and trading funds tf coshoes requiring specific threat guidance should initiall contact their psya who will seek advice from the joint security coordi nation centre jsycc the elements of the threat which are peculiar to eavesdropping are outlined below threats of eavesdropping posed by foreign intelligence services especially at sites overseas sophisticated terrorist and subversive organisations and in particular from criminals investigative journalist s private investigators and some members of the public b the level of threat as in other areas of protective security depends upon the attackers motivation and capability technical and financial re sources and expertise in the case of eavesdropping it also depends very largely upon the attackers ability to gain access to the site of the target conversations restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 286 restricted c the potential attackers motivation may be very heavily influenced by his willingness to risk being found out this risk of discovery and embarrassment is considered high in the uk because of the good protective security regime here this factor is significant in determining t he level of threat of eavesdropping attacks in the uk by hostile or foreign government other groups who do not fear such embarrassment such as terrorists criminals etc may be less inhibited about such attacks d overseas an attacker especially one with the support of the host government is likely to be able to achieve much greater degree of access and there will be less risk of discovery and embarrassment consequently the threat level is likely to be substantially higher depending on the source of the threat and location of the target with most forms of security there is always significant risk of an insider attack where someone with legitimate access is suborned this is particularly true in eavesdropping where access to room or building can be exploited vulnerabilities 2805 all conversations are vulnerable unless the potential attacker can be denied access to the vicinity of them the vulnerability relates to the area in whic h the conversation is being held the various types of attack can include deliberately planted devices quickly concealed or deeply embedded in the building telephone or dataline taps fortuitous devices eg accidentally transmitting cellphones or mains conducti ng devices an understanding of the basic principles will help determine the need for appropriate countermeasures 2806 all devices need power source and means of recovering the conversations being collected the power can be battery or mains electricity and the device may be remotely switched on and off to conserve power and avoid detection recovery of the conversation is often by radio transmission to nearby listeningpost transmitting down mains circuit or telephone wire or some other feature of the building infrastructure 2807 other highly sophisticated techniques include longdistance microphones laser eavesdropping and microwave flooding such technically advanced and uncommon techniques are not the subject of this

it is necessary to approach the psya for the provision of appropriate countermeasures countermeasures general control of access 2809 good building access controls will be the main deterrent to any potential eavesdropper good building design is important and the incorporation of sensitive zones sited away from vulnerable points ie adjacent to public areas or toilets or on ground floor perimeters is recommended staff should be well briefed on the need to prevent unauthorised access the regime should be supported by suitable pass and access control systems there should be control and

hazardous electronic devices such as mobile radios cellphones or various types of recorder into sensitive areas resident staff use of such devices is lso to be controlled protection of telephone circuits 2811 access to communications facilities telephone exchanges and frame rooms should be restricted to authorised staff these areas should be secured with appropriate locks when not occupied digital telephones are generally more difficult to tap than analogue telephones and should therefore be used in preference to analogue where both systems are in situ however staff are reminded that as laid down at chapter 18 these telephones are not secure for the purposes of protectively marked conversations such conversations should only be conducted over approved secure speech telephone systems data communications 2812 although computer or data communications lines are also digital they carry greater volumes of information and thus could be more attractive than telephone restricted defence manual of security jsp 440 volume 3 issue 2 288 restricted lines therefore protective measures for data lines should include encryption use of fibreoptic cabling or antitamper devices on cabling where the risk of eavesdropping is high inspections inspections 2813 counter eavesdropping inspections of sensitive premises may be used to reduce risk where access control measures may have been breached or to supplement access control measures in areas where the threat is deemed to be high inspections are substitute for good access control measures however inspections vary from casual scrutiny of an office by occupants to simple physical searches and detailed technical inspections sweeps by experts detailed technical sweeping of government and overseas sites is usually only carried out by the technical authority as authorised by the security service currently commercial companies are not licensed or authorised to sweep such governmentoverseas sites some military and other speci alised units are trained by the technical authority to carry out limited electronic sweeping at military and other sites both within the uk and overseas all requests for inspections should be submitted in

restricted general protection measures buildings 2817 it is reasonable to assume that in general most sensitive conversations will take place within sites buildings or rooms which are normally used for processing or stori ng material up to the same level of protective marking it therefore follows tha t sufficient physical personnel and procedural security measures should already be in place in most cases within uk those measures will also provide sufficient counter eavesdropping protection but where additional measures are required chapter 29 should be consulted 2818 the principle to bear in mind when considering physical security measures for counter eavesdropping protection is the prevention of access by attackers to the sensitive area even when the area is unoccupied and the protectively marked material is safely stored in approved containers particular attention must therefore be paid to outof hours protection guard patrols ids secured rooms etc 2819 in addition it is advantageous to apply certain physical security measures for counter eavesdropping purposes to selected areas or rooms within building or site eg some locked offices ids for sensitive zones cctv

other courses and awareness material it will be intended to warn staff not to discuss sensitive matters in public places or where they can be overheard by uncleared visitors contractors etc b confidential privacy closed doors this measure requires staff to actively reduce the risk of casual overhearing by closing doors and windows if necessary when holding sensitive discussions c secret

these emissions in the environment can present potential security issues in terms of confidentia lity integrity and availability 3002 the security of data deliberately modulated upon acoustic emissions is covered within the communications security comsec discipline typically by the use of cryptographic systems as laid down at chapter 23 3003 acoustic emission security is defined as those measures taken to prevent interception and exploitation of those intentional acoustic emissions not produced specifically for communications purposes it is analogous to the discipline of electronic emission security elsec for radio frequency issues as detailed at chapter 21 section 2 3004 the nature of the threat environment means the current requirements for acoustic emission security measures deal only with the countering of intelli gence gathering activities by hostile group or country overview 3005 the interception of acoustic emissions can be an attractive and profitable source of intelligence as it can in principle be undertaken from the safety of home territory international air space or the high seas such interception could reveal i nformation relating to certain aspects of the electronic techniques employed within the equipment or the extent and preparedness of the countrys defences which is otherwise protected by physical personal and cis security measures 3006 the aim of acoustic emission security practices is to minimise as far as possible the risk of emission information being compromised that would in itself be protectively marked by limiting the opportunities for its interception by any hos tile group or country total denial is impracticable in most cases without seriously impeding the progress of project through its developmental stages and more so when

associated with information obtainable from interception of acoustic emissions is generally considered to be higher in the early stages of research and development although it may not be practicable to maintain the same degree of security from the beginning of the development of an item of equipment to the inservice date and beyond continuation of security is essential 3008 the technical analysis of such emissions can provide data which can be used against mod platforms andor may allow development of similar equipment or systems these may involve sophisticated deception and decoy techniques or jamming indeed successful interception and analysis could allow the development and deployment of countermeasures to coincide with the operational use of the target signals 3009 the intercept of only seconds of complex signal can provide vital information as to its purpose modes and technical characteristics generally speaking high signal level is necessary for analysis but even at low level this will alert n interceptor to signal of interest and for subsequent attempt at intercept heshe can t hen maximise resources weaknesses or exploitable features which may not be evident to the developer may give hostile analysts an early lead in designing countermeasures 3010 the main system types for which acoustic emissions will need to be considered are as follows sonars b beacons and navigational aids c torpedo guidance and control d targets and decoys fuzing systems 3011 in providing protection for the emissions listed consideration must also be given to the security of any communications

those implementing policy and those providing sec urity support advice and assistance 2 tlb holders remain responsible for implementation of security measures in those vote funded defence agencies for which they or their senior staff are owners trading fund agencies will for security assurance purposes be treated in the same way as tlb holders and be held accountable to the departmental security officer dso 3 separate guidance is being issued on revised responsibilities for dealing with the security of nuclear weapons and nuclear materiel background 4 the strategic defence review sdr of 1998 led to significant changes in the way the business of the department is conducted as result in september 1999 2nd pus commissioned review to examine the organisation of security in the department this review the security structures review ssr was to consider all aspects of security except policing guarding and vetting the results of the review were endors ed by the defence management board on 25 january 2001 as dmb 00 12 dci 14801 reported the outcome 2 impact of ssr 5 guiding principle of the ssr was that security is core business is sue and should be firmly embedded in management systems and processes of the department with ownership of risk unambiguous and aligned with budgetary authority and accountability it is the responsibility of everyone working in the department the management of security risk is to complement and mirror the application of c orporate governance principles 6 the main elements of the revised security structure are as follows responsibilities in the ministry

government departments mod is obliged to adopt corporate governance process in accordance with hm treasury guidance in dear accounting officer gen 1300 the concept of corporate governance has emerged through the cadbury code the stock exchanges combined code and the turnbull report1 in essence turnbull guidelines require companies to maintain sound system of internal control to safeguard shareholders investment and the companys assets this requires organisations to consider the nature and extent of risk acceptable extent and categories of risk risk appetite likelihood and ability to reduce and or mitigate risk costbenefit of risk controls and produce an annual statement of internal control showing how risk is identified evaluated and managed daogen 1300 extended the requirement for such statements to be included in the accounts produced by the public sector with effect from 1 january 2001 2 in parallel dcs 17 the sdr and the security structures review ssr have recommended changes to the way in which security is managed and controlled in the mod the ssr embeds security decisiontaking in core management processes at top level budget trading fund tlbtf level this note explains how to manage sec urity risk in way consistent with jsp 503 business continuity and with jsp 462 corporate governance which directorate of performance analysis d pa are producing for the defence management board dmb it also examines the link between securi ty risks and the hierarchy of balanced scorecard objectives and explains how risk appetite is 1 the turnbull report internal control guidance for directors on the combined code ddef sy615 september 2001 2determined finally it outlines the audit process that the defence securit standards organisation dsso will undertake with tlb holders and chief executives of defence trading funds tfces on behalf of the departmental security officer dso director general security safety dgss risk 2 the mod defines risk generically as future uncertain event that could influence the achievement of departmental objectives and statutory obli gations the key element is the uncertainty of the outcome taking risk may result in benef it or harm this general definition covers the risk that occurs at all levels and in l areas of departmental activity such risk arises from the random nature of events imperfect or incomplete knowledge human behaviour resource and time constraints and lack or failure of control systems it is assessed in terms of likelihood and impact using qualitative and quantitative methods and judgement born of corporate and individual experience 3 within that generic definition risk has more specific meaning in the security context mod security policy is laid down in jsp 440 and derives from the cabinet office manual of protective security mps revised in april 2000 to incorporate bs 7799 information security management security risk is perceived as threat of compromise to the confidentiality integrity andor availability of asse ts and is defined as combination of threat and vulnerability the subelements of threat and vulnerability are described as the likelihood of potentially compromising event taking place and the feature or characteristic of an asset that could be exploited in an attack thus despite the more negative perception of security risk the consequence is assesse d in the same way as generic risk in terms of likelihood and impact it is therefore ent irely reasonable to make security risk management decisions using the processes and terminology common to the corporate governance mechanisms specified by the dmb for all other departmental risk management jsp 440 will require some change to reflect this ddef sy615 september 2001 3corporate risk management 4 both d pa and mps describe risk management as continuous cycle of identifying assessing controlling monitoring reporting and reviewing risks against objectives identified in management plan bs 7799 also emphasises the need to relate security risks to business harm the key elements are the dynamic ide ntification and ranking of risks to management plan objectives and the creation of effective control systems to maintain exposure to the likelihood andor impact at acceptable level s the generic risk management model being developed by d pa will allow the dmb to consider the overall at risk position of mod in the light of current control chanisms and to assess whether this could confound the achievement of dcp objectives 5 departmental corporate governance policy will be reviewed annually by the dmb to ensure its continued application and relevance the principles are risks should be identified and evaluated in the context of their potential impact on the achievement of objectives b risks should be managed at the level at which staff have authority responsibility and resources to take action c the identification and evaluation of risk will become an integral part of performance management d all key decisions should be supported by risk assessment and risk management plan the risk management policies developed by policy setting bodies should be compatible with corporate governance and risk management policy and guidance f internal audit and other assurance activities will be based on asse ssments of risk to objectives ddef sy615 september 2001 4g the directorate of internal audit will continue to provide the departments principal source of independent internal audit advice but will draw on other bodies both internally and externally as sources of corporate assurance as appropriate 6 in practical terms risk appetite the range of risk and tolerance the level of risk can be determined by answering such questions as what risks will we take in pursuit of management plan objectives and what risks are unacceptable b can we tolerate the level of each accepted risk and the aggregate level of risk in the light of current control mechanisms c are legal statutory and baseline control requirements met and at what impact on output time and cost d what opportunities are lost because of risk aversion what impact does our risk have on internal and external stakeholders f where should risk be reduced or increased g where should regulationpolicy be challengedchanged there is an evident corollary between this generic approach and more specific application in regard to security security risk management 7 although functional areas such as security afford scope for more bespoke approach to identifying risks security risk should be managed through corporate governance mechanisms equally while the dso will indicate any spe cific legal ddef sy615 september 2001 5statutory or regulatory security baseline objectives the dmb will deter mine departmental risk appetite and tolerance through the dcp but specialist staff input will be require d to identify threats accurately advise on costeffective risk mitigation reduced likelihood and reduction reduced impact strategies and indicate whether the residual risk is consistent with any mandated baseline control or legal obligation the tlbtf s ecurity risk manager will adjudicate in conflicts between business and security i nterests by considering issues of residual or reasonably foreseeable risk in the light of existing or proposed controls practicality and cost he or she may draw on the dsso for impartial expert advice higher levels of appeal would involve the tlb holdertfce and dso personally the process 8 risk management should be implemented as continuous and auditable process there is one mechanism for this but mod has accepted fourstage process identification analysis planning and control as best practice this is illustra ted at annex further guidance is available on the dpa website on modweb 9 the techniques appropriate to the stages of the risk management process will be familiar to principal security officers psyas an approach to t he process for example is described in supplement 2 of mps this guidance note does not describe the techniques in detail but simply notes some key considerations risk identification all security risks to businessoperational objectives are to be listed these will be drawn mainly from threat assessments but may include opportunity risks risks should be examined from the perspective of all internal and external stakeholders consequential risks that arise from the mitigation of primary risks or the granting of waiversexceptions should be identified risks should be grouped against businessoperational objectives and by balanced scorecard bsc categories see annex b b risk analysis risks are to be prioritised in terms of likelihood and impact and related to the key balanced scorecard risks between 1015 identified by the management board this will make security risk analysis consistent with t he ddef sy615 september 2001 6required output risk appetite tolerance and mandatory controls both qualitative and quantitative methods should be used the present system of grading threat levels between very high grade 1 and negligible grade 6 is consistent with d pa level 2 methodology and the cabinet office ssg definitions regarding frequency may also be useful see annex c c risk planning the key to effective planning is to complete the risk register for managing each significant risk typically this will include identifying who is responsible for control implementation the resources to be used the budget allocation timescale and mechanism for monitoring and reviewing compliance with the risk

completely tran sfer or terminate risk d risk control this term covers the processes whereby the effect of planned activity is monitored reported and reviewed there is wide range of control mechanisms

management has passed to tlb holders and chief executives of mod trading funds tfces the ssr included the recommendation that the security inspection regime be reviewed aim 2 the aim of this guidance note is to establish the policy for security inspect ions post ssr scope 3 the scope of this note is limited to outlining the dsos standing requirement for information on security compliance and to the policy guidance needed by tlb holderstfces to carry out their security inspection responsibilities reference will be made to the complementary process of independent audit to be established as result of the ssr but only to explain the linkage with inspections and the distinction between the two activities details of the future audit policy and the w ay in which defence security standards organisation dsso audit team will ope rate will be promulgated separately 4 this note is concerned with the policy on inspections of security procedures at establishment level these inspections are to embrace all aspects of protec tive security and include checks on the implementation of physical security procedures protecting the communication and information systems cis installations and the electronic dddefsy170911 restricted september 2001 2 restricted information held by the establishment concerned however this inspection rég ime does not include the separate measures to be taken to check the security of the electronic environment in which the cis operate the latter are to be promulgated in issue 2 of jsp 440 volume 3 chap 12 definitions 5 loose use of the terms survey inspection and audit can cause confusion the following definitions apply survey detailed preplanned security examination carried out by specialist team to examine report and make recommendations on the protect ive security requirements of an establishment b inspection periodic onsite review of compliance with security orders regulations and instructions conducted by security team tasked by the tlb holder tfce that owns the risk at the establishment concerned c audit an independent review by the dsso of the systems and structures in place to support the tlb holderstfces security risk management processes assurance requirements 6 the manual of protective security mps requires the departmental security officer dso to provide an appropriate method for assuring that the required levels of protection is being achieved as part of this process the dso should provide the head of the department or agency with an annual certificate of assurance this certificate is designed to provide formal assurance that the organisation is achieving the required levels of protective security and to highlight areas of specific security concern dddefsy170911 restricted september 2001 3 restricted in the mod the dso delivers this assurance by submitting an annual report to the defence audit committee this report is dependent on the contributions provided by tlb holderstfces covering the state of all aspects of protective security for their respective areas of responsibility reported against criteria and other guidance provided by the dso in future the feedback from the independent audit function carried out by the dsso will be an important contribution to the dsos report 7 while management of the security risk in accordance with the policy gu idance in dso guidance note 2 will be delegated to tlb holderstfces it will be necessary to have consistent sets of baseline criteria to inform not only tlb decisions on resource allocation and the inspection regime but also the dsso audit process the majority of these criteria will be in the form of advisory guidance although few will be mandatory these baseline criteria will be promulgated in dso guidanc notes pending publication of the new jsp 440 this approach will involve the use of two tools in particular common approach to the categorisation of establishments b common guidance on the inspection régime categorisation of establishments 8 categorisation of mod establishments will maintain consistent basel ine across the defence spectrum and assist tlb holderstfces with the ris k management process that will inform their resource allocation decisions it is ther efore important that tlbs are able to give their establishments security profile assessed ag ainst common definitions the adoption of one combined matrix will take account of the full threat spectrum and risk impact level it will facilitate com prehensive approach to security inspections to include where relevant the personnel physical and procedural security measures which apply to cis installations within sites this combined matrix is shown in outline below dddefsy170911 restricted september 2001 4 restricted table 1 combined matrix guarding category asset category risk impact level p1 p2 p3 a1 high a2 medium high b1 medium b2 medium low c1 low c2 very low notes 1 categories a1c2 relate to all aspects of the threat to the security of information and materiel assets and are based on new definitions these definitions are given at annex 2 categories p1p3 relate to the threat to life posed by terrorism and retain pressr jsp 440 definitions used to determine guarding criteria these definitions are also reproduced at annex 9 the process of categorising establishments is to involve an assessment of both the establishments asset risk impact level and the guarding requirement producing combined value eg b2p1 10 individual establishments and lodger units within large site should be assessed according to their individual assets and vulnerabilities the fact for instanc that the perimeter and service living accommodation on large site is des ignated p1 for threat to life reasons and includes sensitive unit that requires category a2 rating should not be taken to mean that each and every establishment on the site should be accorded the same category a2 rating regardless of the activities conduct ed within its own discrete area where there is specific area within an establishment that requires higher category eg an operations or communications centre it may be categorised separately from the remainder of the establishment and the remainder may then be placed in lower category for inspection purposes dddefsy170911 restricted september 2001 5 restricted categorisation of communications and information systems 11 there are four criticality levels cl1 cl2 cl3 and cl4 which are used to gauge the impact of any disruption to cis or exploitation of any information they contain the criteria for establishing the right criticality level for cis are in issue 2 of jsp 440 volume 3 chapter 1 security survey and inspection regimes 12 tlb holderstfces will be required to carry out security survey when an establishment is first formed is reorganised and changes its role or on completion of major works services the comprehensive survey report will be the basel ine against which future protective security of the establishment will be measured additional security surveys may be conducted in response to special requirements of the tlb holderstfces this is change to the pressr regime 13 the pressr inspection régime was mandatory in character and new régime is required to reflect tlb holderstfces delegated responsibilities for security risk management and more flexible approach to managing all aspects of the changing threat threats to defence establishments vary widely as do their vulnera bilities although every establishment should be subject to periodic formal security inspection the programme should reflect these differences in determining the frequency of inspections for establishments within their area tlb holderstfce s will need to consider various factors these will include the criticality of the establ ishments output in meeting management plan objectives the risk profile the outcome of previous inspections and audits turnover of key personnel and any mandated requirements tlbtf inspection reports will provide major input into the dsos annual certificate of assurance tlb holderstfces may elect to supplement formal inspections by advisory visits and by the completion of security questionnaires the guideline for the periodicity of inspections is shown in the categorization m atrix below dddefsy170911 restricted september 2001 6 restricted table 2 inspection

importance of the establishments outputs to the tlbtf its risk profile and security history g uidance on best practice on the form and conduct of security inspections will be promulgated separately 15 tlb holderstfces may opt to inspect at more frequent intervals than given in the above matrix in accordance with their risk management and resource decisions if they elect to inspect establishments in given category at intervals greater than the periodicity indicated in the matrix tlb holderstfces will be requir ed to provide an audit trail and rationale for the decision as part of the process of their reporting of security assurance and subsequent audit 16 for many establishments the guidance periodicity for asset and guarding categories will differ it will be for tlb holderstfces to schedul their inspections programme so that both asset and guarding elements are inspected satisfactoril as guide when asset and guarding category periodicities differ the asse t category periodicity should be taken as the driver for the conduct of comprehensive inspections and the guarding category periodicity for supplementary inspections of relevant counter terrorist ct measures tlb holderstfces might for example choose to schedule these additional ct inspections around the mid point between comprehensive inspections the following examples illustrate the options open to tlb holders tfces dddefsy170911 restricted september 2001 7 restricted an establishment is categorised b1p2 giving periodicity for inspections of 3 and 4 years tlb holder might choose to merge the two categories and carry out comprehensive inspection including ct inspection between the 3 and 4 year points alternatively the tlb holder might choose to conduct all aspects of security inspection at the 3 year point and carry out supplementary ctorientated inspection at the 4 year point b an establishment is categorised c2p2 giving periodicity for inspections of 6 and 4 years the tlb holder might choose to adhere to the guideline periodicity or to advance the ct inspection to the 3 year midpoint between comprehensive inspections conclusion 17 following the ssr the implementation of protective security in the mod is the responsibility of tlb holders tfces as owners of the risk they will have support from specialist security staffs tlb holderstfces will need to prioritis the allocation of inspection resources in accordance with their interpretation of defence wide system of categorising establishments dependent on the threat faced the implementation of protective security by tlb holderstfces may
