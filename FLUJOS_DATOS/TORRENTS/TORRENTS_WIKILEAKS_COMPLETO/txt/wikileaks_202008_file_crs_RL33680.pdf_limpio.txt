and budget omb to establish publicly available online database containing information about entities that are awarded federal grants loans contracts and other forms of assistance federal agencies award over 880 billion dollars annually in three of the primary categories of financial assistance to be included in the database470 billion in grants 381 billion in contracts and 29 billion in direct

has been praised as step toward worthy objectiveenhancing the transparency of government expendituresgovernment officials and members of the public have expressed concern that issues surrounding its implementation have not been adequately addressed in particular many observers question the reliability of information taken from the federal assistance award data system faads and the federal procurement data system next generation fpdsng which are important sources of information for usaspendinggov they note that information in faads and fpds is often incomplete and inaccurate and therefore might limit transparency some observers also believe that the cost of establishing and maintaining the new database might grow as agencies seek to improve data quality and collect new

september 26 2006 president bush signed into law s 2590 the federal funding accountability and transparency act pl 1092821 according to supporters of the new law pl 109282 was an attempt to reduce wasteful and unnecessary spending by the federal government including spending on funds earmarked for special projects2 to that end the legislation required the office of management and budget omb to establish publicly available online database containing information about entities that are awarded federal grants loans contracts and other forms of assistance using the database supporters asserted citizen or watchdog group would be able to easily determine how much money was given to which organizations and for what purposes 3 the premise of the new law was that by making the details of federal spending available to the public government officials would be less likely to fund projects that might be perceived as wasteful suppo rters of the legislation also suggested that the new database would give citizens the opportunity to better understand how the government distributes funds and enable the public to become more involved in the discussion of federal spending priorities4 three of the primary categories of federal expenditures and obligations to be included in the databasefederal grants loans and contractsrepresent significant element of federal spending according to the most recently publish ed consolidated federal funds report cffr federal agencies award over 880 billion in those three categories of financial assistance alone 470 billion in grants 381 billion in contracts and 29 billion in direct loans 5 omb launched the database usaspendinggov on december 13 2007 while the new database has been praised as step toward worthy objectiveenhancing the

representative roy blunt introduced on march 30 2006 as an amendment to the federal financial assistance management improvement act of 1999 on june 21 2006 the house passed hr 5060 as amended by voice vote 16 according to representative blunt the bill was intended to increase accountability and transparency in the federal awards process by establishing public database with information on award recipients17 while both s 2590 and hr 5060 had similar objectives the bills differed in important ways table 1 highlights three of the most important differences between the engrossed bills t able 1

horized most notably contracts were exempt from the public database under the house bill but were covered in s 2590 since contracts are one of the largest categories of federal domestic assistance their exclusion would have significantly reduced the comprehensiveness of the database when hr 5060 was first brought to the house floor in june critics argued that database without information on federal contracts was missing key component that is essential to public oversight 18 even some members who ultimately voted to pass the bill expressed concern that it did not include contracts19 supporters of hr 5060 maintained that database primarily covering grants would still be valuable tool and the bills sponsors reportedly pledged to develop separate legislation enhancing public access to federal contract information 20 after s 2590 passed the senate some house members expressed clear preference for the senate 16 congressional record vol 151 june 21 2006 pp h4335h4338 17 rep roy

it included contracts21 both s 2590 and hr 5060 required the public database to include information on subrecipients but only the senate bill provided funding to cover the costs associated with collecting and reporting that information currently data on subgrantees and subcontractors are not gathered uniformly across the government some experts believe that recipients of federal financial assistanceparticularly states and local governmentswill incur substantial costs as they begin to collect and report information on their subrecipients 22 under s 2590 recipients and subrecipients of federal assistance might recover the costs associated with new reporting requirements by incorporating those costs into their indirect cost rates hr 5060 had similar feature leaving it open to the charge of being an unfunded mandate imposed on award recipients by the federal government 23 because uniform method of collecting detailed information on subcontractors and subgrantees existed s 2590 directed omb to conduct pilot program to determine the most costeffective and least administratively burdensome approach to implementing governmentwide subaward reporting process the pilot program was not included in the senate bill when it was first introduced by senator coburn it was added after concerns were raised about the potential administrative and financial burden new reporting requirements would place on grant award recipients 24 hr 5060 did not contain provisions for pilot program and was criticized in congressional hearings as being an attack on federally funded grantees25 g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g3g140g157g561 the database required in the act was to be implemented in two phases by january 1 2008 the new database was

objective of providing to the public comprehensive information on federal financial assistance virtually all categories of awards will ultimately be covered by the database including grants contracts subgrants subcontracts loans cooperative agreements delivery orders task orders and purchase orders two special provisions addressed particular types of transactions individual transactions of less than 25000 are exempt and credit card transactions will not be included until october 1 2008 to achieve greater transparency the act requ ired the database to provide the following information about each federal award name of entity receiving award amount of award type of award eg grant loan contract agency funding award north american industry classification system naics code for contracts or catalog of federal domestic assistance cfda number for grants and loans 27 program source award title that describes the purpose of the funding location of recipient city state congressional district and country in which award performance primarily takes place unique identifier for entity receiving award and of the parent entity of recipient if one exists any other information specified by omb s

federal assistance award data system faads and grantsgov29 according to the provisions in s 2590 as initially passed by the house and senate user must be able to access information from all three databases in single search the bill was explicit on this point it was not acceptable merely to provide links to these or other databases because that would force users to search for information at different websites the single search provision of s 2590 was modified by s res 114 allowing grants and contracts to be searched separately on the new public website sconres 114 also added another reporting requirement the government accountability office is to provide congress with compliance report on pl 109282 later than 2010 as previously noted the act did not require information on subcontractors and subgrantees to be included in the database until january 1 2009 the delay reflected the fact that information on subrecipients was not collected consistently across federal agencies and programs to address existing gaps in the data on subawards the act required omb to implement pilot program that tested the feasibility of having primary recipients provide information on their subgrantees and subcontractors there was provision in the legislation that allowed federal award recipients and subrecipients to be reimbursed for the costs associated with collecting and reporting data on subrecipients the act also specified that any requirements for collecting data on subawards made by state and local governments under block and formula grants be costeffective according to cbo unfunded mandate would be placed on recipi ents or subrecipients for complying with the act 30 the act also required omb to submit an annual report to the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs and the house committee on government reform the report must include data on public usage of the website an assessment of the reporting burden on federal award and subaward recipients and an explanation of any extension of the subaward reporting deadline the act also required omb to post copy of the report on the web

funding accountability and transparency act is only as useful as the quality of the information it contains as noted previously the act referred to three existing databases as likely sources of information for the new public database faads fpdsng and grantsgov usaspendingorg draws extensively from faads and fpdsng but it is unclear whether data from grantsgov is also incorporated number of observers have cautioned that database of federal assistance relying on information from faads and fpdsng would be of limited value both government officials and knowledgeable members of the public descri be significant weaknesses in faads and fpds ngsuch as incomplete and inaccurate informationthat cannot be quickly corrected these observers suggest that substantial changes in the collection reporting and verification of information relating to federal assistance awards would likely be necessary before faads and fpdsng might be considered reliable sources of information in 2005 report gao noted that fpdsng users lacked confidence in the data provided largely because there was rigorous system in place to ensure the data were accurate and complete 31 panel of procurement experts recently attempted to use fpdsng in their evaluation of federal contracting operations but reportedly found so many errors in the data that the chairman declared that fpdsng is not reliable database32 one reason the data are inaccurate is human error contract information might be incorrectly entered into fpdsng by inexperienced users who have received minimal training33 moreover agencies might vary in the degree to which they fill out the fields in the database resulting in data of uneven quality in one instance fpdsng users reportedly complained that the database failed to consistently identify contracts related to hurricane katrina recovery efforts that were awarded without competition34 the problem has not been fixed and gaps in fpdsng data are now evident in usaspendinggov recent editorial stated that the new database might not provide information on whether 70 billion in fy2007 contracts was awarded with or without competition35 by ombs own estimation individual agencies have submitted only 61 to 73 of the information on contracts required by the ffata36 similar problems affect faads the governments primary source of grant award information in recent review of 86 federally

occurred because 1 the census bureau lacked the resources to ensure agencies were submitting accurate and timely data 2 agency program officials lacked knowledge of faads reporting requirements and 3 agencies had not implemented sufficient oversight to ensure they were submitting accurate data census bureau official concurred with these findings adding that number of data elements required by s 2590 are not uniformly captured by federal agencies or grant award recipients such as information on subrecipients and the congressional district in which federal funds are spent 38 the official also noted that agencies are currently required to update their information in faads on quarterly basis so it might take time for agencies to develop the capability to update faads within 30 days of making an award as s 2590 requires omb estimates that individual agencies have submitted only 53 to 65 of the grants data required by the ffata members of congress have also expressed concerns about fpdsng and faads during floor debate of the bill in the house one supporter cautioned that s 2590s potential to improve oversight of federal funds while substantial would be largely determined by the degree to which improvements in fpdsng and faads were made during implementation39 another supporter expressed concern that the problems with fpdsng and faads were so significant that if the administration is not committed to making this legislation work all we will get is another incomplete and hardtouse database40 omb acknowledging that data submitted and posted to fpdsng and faads in the past have been incomplete untimely and inaccurate has issued guidance on improving data quality so that agency submissions meet the requirements of the ffata the guidance issued november 9 2007 required agencies to submit plan to omb by december 1 2007 that identified gaps in their data on grants contracts and loans and outlined their plans to address any deficiencies41 in addition agencies were required to implement internal controls to ensure the accuracy integrity and timeliness of their submissions the guidance also indicated that agency compliance with the data reporting requirements of the ffa ta would be formally and publicly evaluated through inclusion in ombs scorecard initiative beginning in january 2008

and faads databases clay johnson the deputy director for management at omb reportedly said the new database will meet the requirements of the act within the time frame established by the legislation42 johnson was also quoted as saying that implementing the new public database will cost little money not lot because most of the data exists alreadya view that appears somewhat at odds with previously discussed evidence that there are significant gaps in the data43 moreover while the database was launched prior to the statutory deadline the information is so incomplete that some have questioned whether it meets the objectives of the ffa ta44 according to cbo it will cost 15 million to establish and maintain the new database of federal assistance between 2007 and 201145 the cbo estimate however was based on ombs assurance that the government currently collects all of the information needed to create comprehensive database on federal spending 46 the estimate might thus reflect the cost of simply combining existing systems without fully accounti ng for other costs associated with improving the quality of the data in those systems one expert familiar with fpdsng and faads said that an enormous amount of data cleanup will be necessary to correct inaccurate information in those systems47 another industry observer was quoted as saying that enhancing and integrating existing data sources to meet the requirements of the ffata was complex problem and that implementing the database might exceed the 15 million projected by cbo48

particular nasact noted that collecti ng data on subgrantees would be very very costly for state and local governments since federal grant funds are often passed down multiple levels eg state receiving federal assistance gives subgrant to organization which in turn gives subgrant to organization b additional costs might be incurred under the bill nasact said if state and local grant

the required information will be challenge50 some trade groups have made similar arguments regarding the collection of subcontractor information the council of defense and space i ndustry associations

significant administrative burden on both contractors and subcontractors 51 g11g141g142g151g157g146g143g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g515g7g138g155g150g138g155g148g156g516g561 although one of the stated purposes of the legislation was to enable the public to use the online database to identify congressional earmarks it is unclear how users of usaspendinggov might actually do this since neither faads nor fpdsng collect that information not all grants loans or contracts are congressionally directed some are at the discretion of the responsible federal agency unless the congressionallydirected items in the new database are specifically identified as such the database will be of limited value for purposes of earmark identification also the manner in which funding action is described under the award title field might lead the public to draw different conclusions about the value of given federally funded project for example an earmarked project that some believe has merit might be described in manner that puts it in an unfavorable light in this way award descriptions might influence the publics perception of whether funding action is wasteful or not

that by providing citizens with information on federal assistance awards through an online database government officials will be less likely to fund earmarks and arguably wasteful projects to put this argument succinctly greater transparency will yield greater accountability most observers agree that in order for public database of federal awards to provide maximum transparency it must encompass as broad range of financial assistance categories as possible the ffata database would presumably provide substantial transparency since it covers all forms of federal financial assistance including contracts arguably the database would also provide transparency by phasing in information on subcontractors and subgrantees thus allowing the public to track th flow of federal funds down to the level of the ultimate recipient although the creation of the database might require more time or money than some estimates suggest president bush the deputy director of omb and senator coburn have all

reform and the line item veto president bushs comments suggest that the administration is committed to the act and might be prepared to provide the resources needed to implement the database with complete and accurate information even if the costs exceed ombs current expectations the administrations commitment might also be reflected in ombs guidance that required agencies to develop and

database in accordance with the legislation 53 finally the new law might direct attention to increased transparency on the revenue side of federal fiscal operations in the senate report accompanying s 2590 the additional views of senators coburn and lautenburg included the statement that transparency in government decisionmaking should not be limited to simply spending it should be extended to the tax code this sentiment was echoed by senator obama who said during floor debate on the bill that greater transparency of targeted tax benefits was another step in improving government accountability and performance54 given this objective legislation seeking to increase transparency in the tax code might be supported by some of the same government officials and advocacy groups that supported s
