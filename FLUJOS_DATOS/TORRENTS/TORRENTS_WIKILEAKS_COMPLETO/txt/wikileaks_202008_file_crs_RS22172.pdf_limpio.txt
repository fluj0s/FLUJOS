financial economics december 31 2008 abstract the economic stimulus act of 2008 enacted temporary increase in the conforming loan limit for mortgages originated between july 1 2007 and december 31 2008 the limit was capped at 175 of the statutory limit or 729750 in certain highcost areas the gses are able to purchase these conforming loans after december 31 2008 the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 raised the limit permanently by up to 50 that is to 625500 in highcost housing areas allowing the gses to expand into markets previously served by nongse institutions if the gses supplant the existing securitizers of jumbo mortgage loans there is likely to be some reduction of mortgage rates in highcost areas which will enable more prospective buyers to qualify for or reﬁnance loans some would argue however that because the size of gse operations already poses potential risk to ﬁnancial stability it would be imprudent to permit signiﬁcant expansion of their activities this

agency fhfa announced that the national conforming loan limit in 2009 would continue to be 417000 in 2008 the economic stimulus act of 2008 pl 110185 and the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 enacted higher limits in high cost areas securitization of mortgages that exceed the limitcalled jumbo loansis done by private financial institutions gse status allows fannie and freddie to issue debt at lower cost than other private firms part of this subsidy is passed on to home buyers in the form of lower interest rates interest rates on jumbo mortgages are slightly higher than those on the conforming loans that the gses can purchase the spread between jumbo and conforming loan rates has been higher than normal since mid2007 the economic stimulus act of 2008 enacted temporary increase in

the modern conforming loan limit in the housing and community development act of 1980 pl 96399 the initial limit was 93750 for singlefamily home 39 above the fha ceiling at the time and the law provided for annual increases in the loan limit to adjust for rising prices as reflected in housing price index published by the federal housing finance board fhfb2 the loan limit was initially set at level significantly higher than the national average home price and with indexation it has remained higher in 2007 the conforming loan limit stood at 145 of the average new home price and 162 of the average resale price of an existing home since 2006 the basic conforming loan limit has held steady at 4170003

metropolitan statistical areasdefined as highcostwhere the median home sale price exceeds the current conforming loan lim it the conforming loan limit for that area will be 115 of the median home price in the area except that increases would be capped at 150 of the statutory loan limit the limit that now applies to alaska hawaii and the two island territories this system for determining the limit took effect when the temporary limits set by the stimulus act expired on december 31 2008 the gses are able to purchase highcost conforming loans after december 31 2008 subject to the requirement in their charters that loans purchased be more than one year old look at median prices in various metropolitan areas of the country shows that the conforming limit is rising in several localities under pl 110185 and in fewer areas has risen under pl 110289 the available data are for existing singlefamily home prices collected by the national 1 barbara miles former specialist in

their remoteness in those areas the conforming loan limit was set at 150 of the limit that applied to the rest of the nation in 1992 the virgin islands was added to the list of areas where the 150

of highcost housing areas implies that the benefits of the gse subsidy are not distributed uniformly gse status allows fannie and freddie to borrow at lower interest rates than nongse financial institutions4 portion of this subsidy is passed on to home buyers whose mortgage loans are purchased and securitized by the gses in 2003 fannie and freddie purchased 351 of all mortgages by dollar value originated nationwide this percentage varied from state to state in three states and the district of columbia the gses purchased less than 30 of new mortgages and all three and the district appear in table 1 california new york and connecticut in 15 states on the other hand the two gses purchased over 40 of new mortgages 5 4 the chief financial advantage conveyed to fannie and freddie by gse status is the implicit guarantee although gse debt is not explicitly backed by the full faith and cr edit of the treasury market participants believe that the government will not allow either gse to become insolvent 5 the 2006 mortgage market statistical annual vol 1 p 25 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22172g22g145g142g561g5g152g151g143g152g155g150g146g151g144g561g14 g152g138g151

gses mortgage purchase and securitization operations are constrained by the conforming loan limit loans that exceed the conforming loan limits can only be securitized by nongse issuers and there is large secondary market for jumbo mortgage loans in 2006 total prime jumbo loan originations were estimated at 480 billion while 219 billion in prime jumbo mortgagebacked securities mbs were issued implying securitization rate for jumbo mortgages of 4566 by contrast fannie and freddie securitized 83 of loans originated in 2006 in the conventional conforming mortgage markets where they are allowed to operate7 unlike the secondary market for conforming loans where the two gses are dominant dozens of private issuers are active in the nonagency market the top ten issuers accounted for only 590 of the market in 20078 conforming mortgage loans tend to carry lower interest rates than nonconforming loans number of studies have attempted to measure the spread between conforming mortgage and jumbo loan rates and the extent to which the rate differential can be attributed to the subsidy contained in gse status9 most estimates of the spread between conforming and jumbo loans fall into the range of 1860 basis points basis point is 1100th of percent all researchers assume that at least part of this spread is due to the gse subsidy but other factors are involved for example as properties become more expensive lenders worry more about price volatility that is as the risk of significant drop in the market value of the housethe loans collateralincreases lenders raise rates to compensate for that risk second the existing jumbo secondary market cannot realize certain economies of scale because market participants are largely frozen out of the conforming loan market due to their inability to compete with the gses these and other factors suggest that allowing the gses into the jumbo market would not cause the entire spread to disappear there is consensus as to how much of the 1860 basis point spread is due to the gse subsidyestimates range as low as four basis points 10 thus it is uncertain how significant the benefits would be if the conforming loan limit were increased during normal times as rough guide to the size of potential savings assume that the interest rate on 30year 625 mortgage of 625500 is reduced to 6 the home buyers monthly mortgage payment of 3851 at 625 would be reduced by about 100 over the 10 year average life of loan this reduction yields interest savings of about 15500 of course this figure shrinks if some portion of the rate spread persists if that is not all the savings are passed through to borrowers if the interest rate paid by the hypothetical home buyer in the example 6 the 2008 mortgage market statistical annual vol 2 p 3 7 ibid 8

the m onthly payments are lower by about 28 month and interest savings would be about 4400 over 10 years11 with the housing market downturn that began in 2006 there is new rationale for raising the conforming loan limit to stimulate the jumbo mortgage market which would in turn provide stimulus for the housing sector and the economy credit conditions in the jumbo market are said to be unusually tightthe spread between jumbo and conforming loan rates has widened exceeding 150 basis points at the end of 2008 high rates price many wouldbe buyers out of the market in an environment of falling prices lenders are less willing to make loans especially the kinds of interestonly and negative amortization mortgages that sustained the boom pressure on lenders is intensified by weakened demand for mortgagebacked securities mbs in the secondary market investors have seen many subprime mbs lose much of their value and are reluctant to purchase bonds with the exception of those issued by fannie or freddie who guarantee timely payment of interest and principal and are backed by the implicit guarantee 12 of their gse status which was underlined by the provisions in pl 110289 that authorized the treasury to purchase any amount of gse debt or equity securities it is hoped that allowing the gses to securitize some jumbo loans will restore liquidity to the secondary market enable lenders to transfer the risk of holding jumbo mortgages and make loans more affordable and available the gses conservatorship would appear to provide treasury backing for gse debt but not for stockholders for more information on the gses conservatorship see crs report rs22950 fannie mae and freddie mac in conservatorship by mark jickling g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 the case for raising the conforming loan limit is based partly on equity concerns home buyers in the conforming mortgage market may receive part of the gse subsidy in the form of lower interest rates since housing prices vary across the nation the geographical distribution of this benefit is uneven before the recent increases the loan limit was 417000 in many parts of the country this amount covers all but the top end of the housing market in highcost areas like san francisco or new york city on the other hand large proportion of real estate transactions take place well over that limit since current law sets higher limit for alaska hawaii guam and the virgin islands where housing costs are assumed to be high why not raise the limit in other high price areas counterargument is that the additional subsidy created by raising the loan limit would go overwhelmingly to mortgage holders with high in comes if the purpose of the gses is to foster 11 note also that under pl 110185 not all mortgages in highcost areas would become conforming loans loans for amounts greater than 150 or 175 of the statutory limit w ould still be treated as nonconforming in other words the top end of the housing market would be unaffected by the bills provisions also during the mortgage market turmoil of 2008 the difference in interest rates for conforming loans and jumbo loans that were not gsepurchasable frequently was more than one percentage point there was some evidence that there was difference in rates on jumbos that the gses could purchase eg 500000 in the washington dc area and jumbos that the gses could not purchase eg 800000 12 gse debt is not explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the government but bond buyers do not believe that the treasury will allow either gse to default this is calle d the implicit guarantee as result investors view gse issued mbs as less risky than debt issued by other firms ev when the credit quality of the underlying mortgages is better

those who would benefit from the change already have high homeownership rates another key issue is risk as noted above the jumbo home market is in trouble because perceptions of risk are sharply higher than they were during the boom lenders are more cautious because the value of their collateralthe housemay drop significantly mbs investors have the same fear making it harder for lenders to transfer price and credit risk to the secondary market gse entry into the jumbo market would appear to meet the needs of both lenders and investors the gse and the implicit treasury guarantee would reassure mbs buyers leading to resumption of securitization in turn encouraging nders to make loans at more affordable rates but gse participation would not reduce overall ri sk in the market if house prices continue to fall and delinquencies and foreclosures continue to rise the kinds of multibillion dollar losses that have been reported in recent months could fall upon the gses could they withstand those losses or would the treasury be forced to engineer bailout to prevent default that could be highly destabilizing to the global financial system what is the potential cost of such an intervention to the taxpayers these questions cannot be answered with certainty but it is worth noting that the systemic risk posed by the rapid growth of the gses in recent years has been major issue in the debate over gse reform former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan and others have called for reduction in size of the gses investment portfolios currently about 14 trillion on the grounds that they represent an unacceptable concentra tion of financial risk in two companies whose financial controls have been shown to be weak as director of ofheo fhfa director james lockhart has argued against raising the conforming loan limit unless the gse regulator also receives enhanced safety and soundness powers 13 if the current tightness in the jumbo loan market reflects an overreaction on the part of market participants in the grip of panic some argue that an increase in the conforming loan limit may be useful corrective and avert unnecessary damage to housing markets and the economy on the other hand if market fundamentals dictate that home prices still have long way to fall the assumption of more risk by the gses and more or less implicitly by the treasury could arguably slow the market adjustment process and foster an unwelcome expectation in financial markets that they will always be rescued from the consequences of their own mistakes
