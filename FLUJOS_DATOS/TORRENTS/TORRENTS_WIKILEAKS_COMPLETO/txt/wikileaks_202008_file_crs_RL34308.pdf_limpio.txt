established on january 1 2006 and intended to be fully in place by 2015 caricom is highly tradedependent region undergoing major changes to its economic relationships with the world adjusting to these changes through the csme is its primary development challenge to realize the csme vision the member countries would have to implement considerably deeper commitments to integration the caribbean basin has been longstanding strategic interest of the united states the success of caricom as well as the continued stability of the region have important implications for us trade investment immigration drug interdiction and national security policies although small in size caricoms trade and investment relationship with the united states may become more prominent issue as the region adjusts to the changing external environment caricom faces dual challenges in its quest for economic integration through the csme first it must complete the intraregional integration scheme including tightening loose common external tariff and intraregional trade policy integrating more fully labor and capital markets and deepening functional cooperation pooling resources to improve efficiency in the delivery of public services second it must devise and implement strategies for inserting the caricom economies into dynamic and competitive global economy in the wake of expiring preferential trade arrangements with its two largest trade partners the united states and the european union eu two trade policy issues command immediate attention implementing the eu economic partnership agreement epa completed in december 2007 is the first the epa is reciprocal wtocompliant accord that replaces unilateral preferential arrangements in place since 1975 second the caribbean basin trade partnership act cbtpa preferences will expire on september 30 2008 unless extended by the us congress although these preferences currently apply to only seven caricom members and have already been eroded considerably by us free trade agreements with other countries in the region caricom strongly advocates their renewal and expansion as it evaluates the costs and benefi ts of pursuing reciprocal fta of

table 1 their population land size economies per capita income and social indicators eg life expectancy can vary considerably reality that caricom responded to by designating some of its members as less developed countries ldcs making them eligible for special and differential treatment collectively these former british dutch and french territories constitute richly diverse cultural mosaic of european african and native influences that find themselves paradoxically united by the very sea that also divides them 4 the tension between unity and division is common theme throughout caribbean society leading to what might be considered the caricom challenge how to integrate diverse area in manner that will meet individual country and regional development goals in equitable and mutually supporting way without negating national identities and aspirations g7g138g155g149g162g561g11g151g157g142g144g155g138g157g146g152g151g561g7g143g143g152g155g157g156g561 caricom was established on july 5 1973 with the signing of the treaty of chaguaramas it was built on the trials and errors of previous unification efforts beginning with the ambitious west indies federation 195862 which sought political and economic unification despite encouragement by great britain it dissolved rapidly when jamaica and trinidad and tobago withdrew in favor of national selfdetermination in the midst of the failure to federate the hope if not the necessity of economic integration remained alive and took new form in 1965 with the caribbean free trade association carifta it marked the beginning of free trade area and was replaced five years later by deeper commitment under caricom 5 caricom began as two linked concepts the caribbean community and the common market although conceptually yoked they were devised as separate legal and institutional entities that provided needed flexibility to accommodate differing national preferences for regional integration 6 the caribbean community comprises multiple functional relationships and institutions designed to integrate the region politically economically and legally caricom was not given supranational authority however dropping any pretense of another federalist experiment which allowed for relative ease of ratification this arrangement however did not lead to full regional integration in the words of two caribbean experts caricom is structure created by national governments to make national policies more effective by pursuing them within regional framework7 continued dominican republic or cuba 4 attributed to dr claire neilson president of the institute of caribbean studies washington dc 5 pollard duke ed the caricom system basic instruments kingston the caribbean law publishing company 2003 pp 58 6 this arrangement was necessary compromise it accommodated jamaica which had little interest in joining multifaceted regional organization but desired to be part of common market that would promote exportled growth and the bahamas which preferred the opposite the bahamas is not part of either the common market or csme ibid pp 58 and 184185 ironically jamaica would become the largest importer rather than exporter of regional goods 7 payne anthony and paul sutton charting caribbean development gainesville university of florida press 2001 p 174

investment integration and was stretch from the start it proceeded from free trade area to become limited customs union complete with porous multiple exceptions common external tariff cet although the common market did not evolve much beyond loose trading regime8 caricom did succeed in bringing together diverse group of states the smallest islands subsequently formed the organization of eastern caribbean states oec s in 1981 to pursue an even deeper and some would argue more successful integration pact in part to strengthen their position visàvis the larger caricom countries in 2001 caricom formally adopted the csme concept in the revised treaty of chaguaramas the revised treaty effectively replacing the common market as the economic integration standard9 together caricom and the csme share the attainment of three fundamental goals 1 economic integration 2 coordination of foreign policies and 3 functional cooperation banding together to share resources in health education environment science technology transportation and other disciplines in each case overcoming the disadvantages of small scale has been driving concern whether seeking scale economies from an enlarged domestic market greater intraregional trade shared costs in the provision of public sector goods or integration of policy responses to negotiate from stronger unified position in the international arena see small countries are they naturally disadvantaged below some of these goals however have found greater success than others as caricom struggled to maintain its momentum 8 pollard the caricom

rising interest rates and growing ideological extremism in the caribbean that gave way to slow growth rising debt social unrest and political division in the 1980s although to lesser extent than in latin america the excesses of this period discouraged deeper integration caricom remained tied to europe through unilate ral preferential trade arrangements and would take up with some controversy the

rebounded but caricom actually began to experience declining growth in output and productivity in many cases with collective gdp growth on average falling from 39 in the 1970s to 22 in the 1980s and 19 in the 1990s11 in addition by the turn of the 21st century the world trade organization wto pressed the european union eu to eliminate their unilateral preferences accorded caricom exports eg bananas and sugar and the united states entered into string of bilateral free trade agreements ftas with western hemisphere countries that began to erode the relative benefits of the cbi preference programs as the benefits of trade preferences continued their relative decline the natural structure of caricoms trad patterns began to shift see next section as did incentives to move beyond customs union 12 as an inward looking strategy typical of 1970s integration efforts caricom was constrained as traderelated development strategy described by one caribbean scholar as integrating expanding and protecting the regional market for goods caricom did not enhance intraregional trade to the degree expected13 one study finds that from 1970 to 2003 although intraregional trade grew faster than extraregional trade as percentage of total trade it peaked in 1998 details are discussed in next section intraregional trade is also dominated by trinidad and tobagos oil exports net of oil which is not affected much by caricoms preferences intraregional exports have never exceeded 6 of total caricom trade the trends suggest that caricom trade policies were limited in advancing intraregional integration14 many have cited the lack of progress in implementing caricom policies as one factor that has inhibited intraregional trade growth15 structural factors particularly the similarity in economies and high concentration of export products however also naturally limited the potential trade effects of caricoms regional market for goods an effort recently characterized as doomed to be

vulnerability to external shocks and erratic shifts in terms of trade17 it is also important to take note of the asymmetries in trade performance among countries with trinidad and tobago and barbados having the largest growth in exports and smaller countries many with diminished agricultural output and increased tourism experiencing much smaller merchandise export growth jamaica has experienced marked decline in its exports while becoming the largest intracaricom importer of goods trend largely attributed to its macroeconomic instability that in particular has hurt the manufacturing sector 18 although caricom did not induce large real growth in intraregional trade it succeeded in other ways there have been significant gains to integration outside the trade area including the benefits of shared institutional responsibilities in the provision of public goods and services19 in addition complementary structures of production have been important for efficiency gains as well as early efforts to integrate labor and capital markets which promote efficient allocation of factors of production cost reduction and improved competitiveness these nontrade gains are at the heart of the csme and provide major rationale for moving beyond the limited customs union approach that caricom has embraced for three decades20 the oecs also offers valuable lessons macroeconomic stability for example has contributed to comparatively higher growth in output and income levels of these smaller states the fiscal and monetary discipline imposed by the monetary union is largely credited with maintaining macroeconomic policy discipline and points to one advantage of deeper economic integration by contrast the worse economic performance of the much larger states of guyana and jamaica is associated with considerable political and economic volatility and weak macroeconomic policies 21 g22g155g138g151g156g146g157g146g152g151g561g157g152g561g157g145g142g561g5g21g15g7g561 after years of preparatory work

institutions such as the caribbean court of justice23 in the drive to make the region internationally competitive the csme promises vision of much deeper economic integration than single market the transition to single economy entails significant new commitments to the consolidati on of national policies in support of caricoms longterm goals that have so far proven difficult to achieve distributive issues continue to rekindle debates over sovereignty issues but without some convergence in economic performance and policy coordination the csme will struggle to expand beyond the original intraregional trade regime 24 specifically the revised treaty proposes to transform caricom from limited trading regime into common economic space the plan calls for fully marketoriented approach to the regional economy deeper macroeconomic pol icy coordination increased harmonization of functional areas the free movement of goods services investment and labor and eventually currency union parts of the scheme are intended to unfold over an extended period of time the goal remains to adopt model of economic competitiveness directed in particular at overcoming the disadvantages of small firms working in economies that face economic restructuring in the face of disappearing trade preferences 25 the goals of the csme also highlight lingering challenges to deeper integration these include high reliance on tariff revenue hindering full commitment to the cet strong resistence to relinquishing national decisionmaking authority to regional institution diverse priorities among countries with export sectors heavily concentrated in either tourism agriculture or energy incongruent macroeconomic policies and divergent performance in trade and economic growth within caricom

narrow production structures from their colonial economic heritage as captive producers and consumers for the european states caribbean economies were developed to complement their counterparts across the atlantic ocean spawned by foreign investment and sustained by protected trade plantation economies arose based largely on sugar and banana production minerals extraction and tourism came along much later the colonies were equally dependent on european imports for manufactured goods and food relationship that endured for centuries and carried forward into the postindependence period as result the caribbean trade regime remained relatively undiversified sheltered from competition and poorly linked to domestic food and manufacturing production that could have promoted broaderbased development 29 the caribbean economies therefore were poorly positioned to make the leap to global competition as trade preferences eroded the caribbeans high production costs and tariff rates exposed its lack of competitiveness the encroaching global economy however began to force change on caricoms trade and investment relationships irrespective of the regions capacity or willingness to adapt the most significant adjustment to the trade regime has been the declining importance of trade preferences with the eu and the united states unilateral preferences with the eu are being replaced by reciprocal economic partnership agreement epa while the relative benefit of unilateral trade preferences with the united states continues to erode as multilateral liberalization and us reciprocal trade agreements beginning with the north american free trade agreement nafta in 1994 expand at the same time intraregional caricom trade shows little promise for growth and latin america and asia are emerging as increasingly important trade partners in the future the implications of these trends for caricom are still unfolding but at the least suggest that for many countries particularly the smaller ones manufacturing and agricultural exports may continue to decline relative to services trade tourism financial education these alternatives to traditional production and trade patterns however are not developing fast enough to mitigate fully income employment and outward migration problems economic transition will be the greatest challenge for the csme and perhaps defines its reason

caricom trade policy is formulated by the heads of state but coordinated and implemented through the caribbean regional negotiating mechanism rnm headquartered in kingston jamaica with second trade office in bridgetown barbados the rnm was created on april 1 1997 in response to increasing need for system to coordinate regional trade policy tasked to address all external trade matters of caricom it has organized trade negotiations into three theatres focused on the european union epa negotiations the united states bilateral accord or regional ftaa and multilateral negotiations the doha round there are also number of limited bilateral trade initiatives with central america and other countries 30 as with other aspects of caricom the rnm faces number of institutional challenges developing coordinated trade policy among 15 countries requires compromise tall order given the sometimes diverse priorities among those countries with different economic structures and historical reluctance to relinquish sovereign control over important policy decisions most members of caricom for example are also members of the wto and may pursue individual policies the rnm is also generally thought to be understaffed and underfinanced for the responsibilities it maintains but nonetheless offers trade expertise unavailable in some caricom countries lack of trade specialization can also deter consensus

most immediate trade policy challenge is to implement the epa concluded with the eu on december 16 200737 europes former colonies in africa the caribbean and the pacific the acp countries are all in the process of replacing unilateral preferential trade arrangements dating to the 1975 lomé convention with wtocompatible reciprocal trade agreements the lomé convention which defined these unilateral arrangements between europe and its former colonies was renewed three times lome iiv between 1975 and 2000 it provided dutyfree preferences import licensing quotas and set prices for sugar bananas and rum that supported vibrant trade for caribbean industries that otherwise would have struggled to be internationally competitive 38 the lomé convention however required waivers to the article i nondiscrimination clause of the general agreement on tariffs and trade ga tt an issue that became increasingly confrontational for example by the 1990s the united states and bananaproducing latin american countries had decided to challenge the eu banana protocol in the ga tt and its successor organization the wto the wto eventually ruled against the eu in 1997 and three years later new banana agreement was signed by all parties39 the nondiscrimination doctrine was further reinforced with creation of the wto in 1995 increasing pressure on the eu and caricom to replace the unilateral trade preferences in lomé iv in response the two parties formalized co mpromise in the cotonou agreement of 2000 it is comprehensive trade and development arrangement designed to be in place for 20 years to meet wto demands to transition toward nondiscriminatory trade however the cotonou agreement extended trade preferences only until january 1 2008 at which point it was to be replaced with wtocompatible arrangement the epa the importance of the epa for the caribbean countries cannot be overstated the protected banana sugar and rum trade has been the economic lifeblood for many of them for example the price paid for sugar in the eu has often been triple the world market price given the caribbeans relatively high production costs the treatment of these key traded goods in the epa will likely determine the extent to which they will remain significant contributors to the caricom economies 40 to conform to wto standards the epa had to replace discriminatory trade rules under the cotonou agreement with an agreement that would qualify as reciprocal regional trade area under article xxiv of the gatt as us free trade agreements do among the strict wto requirements the agreement forbids increasing overall protection and requires liberalization of 37 caricom and the dominican republic have been negotiati ng this agreement together in the caribbean forum group known as the cariforum 38

department of co mmerce as prese nted in t he wor ld trade atlas figure 4 also points to uneven growth in us imports from caricom since 1997 as with the export data the sudden rise in us imports after

this effect may be seen by comparing growth in total us imports with that of nonenergy imports in figure 4 the lackluster growth of nonenergy goods points of the dominance of energy goods in the

policy issue for uscaricom trade relations is deciding whether to continue with unilateral trade preferences or begin negotiations with caricom for reciprocal free trade agreement in general caricom has supported u s trade initiatives including designs for regional free trade area of the americas ftaa45 support for bilateral agreement however has been less enthusiastic the united states and caricom are discussing trade policy options in the trade and investment council tic currently the trade relationship is covered by two us unilateral preference programs the original cbi program as defined in the cari bbean basin economic recovery act cbera of 1983 and the caribbean basin trade partnership act cbtpa of 2000 although the original cbera program is in place permanently the preferences apply only to small portion of caricom goods the cbtpa covers more caribbea n products but only seven countries qualify and the preferences are set to expire at the close of fy2008 the cbtpa is also being challenged in the wto by paraguay which would like to obtain similar preferences both us and caricom policymakers have at least three not necessarily mutually exclusive options renew and expand the unilateral preferences initiate discussion for reciprocal fta or let the cbtpa preferences expire46 us trade policy in the western hemisphere has emphasized replacing unilateral preferences with reciprocal ftas one benefit of permanent fta with the united states is the predictability of trade rules the end to periodic congressional reauthorization of unilateral programs eliminates major uncertainty for foreign investors second the trade benefits tend to apply to broader range of goods under ftas than under unilateral preference arrangements third for many countries guaranteed us market access is another enticement although one with less appeal for the smaller caribbean countries because they export so little to the united states the caricom countries disagree over the desirability of the fta option the larger countries with significant merchandise exports tend to support the idea whereas the smaller servicebased economies remain highly skeptical another policy question concerns the issue of special and differential treatment caricom strongly advoca tes that some type of development component be included in an fta with the united states including lengthy tariff phaseout periods for sensitive products and financial assistance for trade adjustment and export capacity building the major costs to caricom of reciprocal fta involve the risk of opening the economy to greater competition from us firms and potentially failing to meet the obligations of complex and comprehensive agreement in particular caricom countries worry about the cost and their ability to comply with sanitary standards inte llectual property rights government procurement and investment provisions many caricom countries do not consider the overall tradeoff to be to their advantage at this point and prefer to initiate discussion over extending and expanding unilateral preferences others note that the transition to fully open economy is core element of the csme

discriminated against foreign crossborder gambling provided through internet services it considered these laws to be in violation of us commitments under the wto general agreement on trade in services ga ts protracted dispute settlement process ensued in which the wto ruled against us arguments that it had made specific obligations to gambling in its ga ts commitment the united states eventually acquiesced to comply with an april 2005 appellate body ruling but in subsequently failing to do so found itself subject to an adverse wto compliance review panel ruling in march 2007 47 on may 4 2007 the ustr announced that rather than comply with the wto ruling the united states would instead modify its services commitments to exclude internet gambling relying on provision in gats article xxi that is rarely invoked the united states maintained that it had never intended to include internet gambling as part of its ga ts commitments although technically permitted to make these modifications under ga ts the united states is compelled to compensate affected wto members it has or is negotiating settlements with the eu japan canada india costa rica and macao 48 in addition on june 21 2007 antigua and barbuda requested authorization from the wto dispute settlement body to suspend the application to the united states of concessions and obligations made under gats and the wto agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights trips equal to an annual valu of 34 billion the united states countered that an annual amount of suspended obligations trade sanctions of 500000 was more equitable figure and that it was inappropriate to allow for crossretaliation through trips obligations on december 21 2007 the wto ruled that antigua and barbuda was entitled to impose 21 million annually in trade sanctions against the united states it also found that because antigua and barbudas economy is so small and dependent on us services imports imposing services trade sanctions was not feasible alternative hence the wto also allowed for antigua and barbuda to be compensated by suspending intellectual property rights commitments 49 the final award ruling is controversial for

figure was extremely low letting the united states off lightly and raising broader questions about smaller countries ability to obtain equal recourse as larger ones under the wto third the united states argued that suspending trips obligations is poor crossretaliation precedent particularly given wto efforts to reinforce intellectual property rights in multilateral agreements because both

and bilateral investment treaties with barbados and trinidad and tobago both canada and caricom have expressed interest in expanding to reciproc trade agreement caricom has received mandate from the heads of state to commence negotiations but similar commitment from canada has yet to be made costa rica and caricom signed limited product reciprocal trade agreement in march 2003 the framework entails specific lists of products for which each country is willing to reduce tariffs and other barriers to trade it provides mechanism to increase market access on an incremental basis but does not move significantly beyond the limited products list approach in august 2007 members of the central american common ma rket cacm launched negotiations with caricom for an accession agreement to the caricomcosta rica fta the dominican republic signed limited market access agreement with caricom in december 2001 efforts have been made to expand the agreement but fundamental differences have kept negotiators from reaching an understanding over deeper commitments similar agreement was signed with colombia in july 1994 that has allowed for incremental growth in market access commitments on productbyproduct basis caricom currently has non reciprocal trade and investment agreement with venezuela in place since 1992 in july 2000 caricom signed trade and economic coopera tion agreement with cuba it too is in the mold of limited market access agreement based on selective product lists it has allowed for some incremental expansion of products to be given reduced tariffs but has not
