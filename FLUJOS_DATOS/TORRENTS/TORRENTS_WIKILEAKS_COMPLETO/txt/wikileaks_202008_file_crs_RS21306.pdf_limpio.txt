territorial it is proscr ibed investigated tr ied and punished under the law of the place where it occurs as general rule nations laws apply within the territory of another yet in surprising number of instances federal criminal law does apply overseas to us citizens and foreign nationals as long as there is some nexus to the united states federal law aut horizes prosecution practical diplomatic and procedural impedime nts notwithstanding in the 107th congress the usa patriot act and the legislation implementing the international conventions on terrorist bombings and on financing terrorism have extended the substantive authority for federal prosecution of crimes occurring elsewhere this is an abridged version of crs report rl31557 terrorism and extraterritorial jurisdiction in criminal cases recen t developments stripped of its footnotes and most citations extraterritorial jurisdiction the constitution provides the power to enact criminal laws with extraterritorial application it vests congress with among other things the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas and offenses against the law of nations and gives congress legislative jurisdiction over places acquired for the erection of forts magazines arsenals dockyears and other needful buildings the constitution also limits the manner in which this authority may be exercised the due process clause of the fifth amendment for instance bars the extraterritorial application of federal criminal laws in the absence of connection between the crime the defendant and the united states prosecu tion requires personal jurisdiction over the defendant and subject matter jurisdiction over the crime neve rtheless neither due process nor any other constitutional limitation have posed any serious obstacle to the enactment and enforcement of federal law for crimes committed abroad in fact the extraterritorial application of federal law is frequently said to be matter of intent rather than power of statutory construction rather than constitutional limitationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21306crs2 when statute contains statement of its extraterritorial application congresss intent is clear when the statute is silent the courts begin with presumption against extraterritorial application the nature of the statute however may be sufficient to overcome the presumption so long as the pplication beyond the borders of the united states does not offend the principles of international law the courts will find offense to international law as long as the application features reasonable contacts between the crime and the nation asse rting jurisdiction that standard is often judged by whether the case comes within one of five circumstances or principles under which international law recognizes nations prerogative to assert the application of its laws 1 the objective territorial principle where exte rnal conduct has substantial ffect within the country 2 the protective principal where the outside conduct is directed against the countrys national security 3 the nati onality principle where the offender is one on the countrys nationals 4 the passive pers onality principle where the victim is one of the countrys nationals and 5 the univers ality principle where the conduct such as piracy is universally condemned and ma be prosecuted by any country that can capture the offender the inventory of federal crimes with extraterritorial application already includes prohibitions on crimes of violence committed against federal officials and employees the theft or destruction of federa l property efforts to smuggle drugs or foreign nationals into this country and aircraft hijacking to name few legislation during the 107th congress augments the store with authority to prosecute crimes committed by or against americans on military and diplomatic installations and residences overseas b fraud involving american credit cards or other access devices committed abroad c laundering the proceeds of various federal crimes in foreign bank d laundering in this country of the proceeds of foreign political corruption and of an expanded list of other foreign crimes terrorist bombings abroad and f the overseas financing of terrorism common law crimes on american facilities overseas section 804 of the usa patriot act addresses diffe rence of opinion among the wer federal appellate courts over whether the federal laws that outlaw ch crimes as murder rape and robbery when committed within federal enclaves in this c ountry also apply on am erican governmental installations abroad with the enactment of section 804 they do at least when either the victim or the offender is us national the dispute centers on the construction of 18 usc 73 which defines the special territorial jurisdiction of the united states the fourth and ninth circuits contend that the definition in subsection 73 includes areas in other countries over which the host nation has afforded the united states privileges akin to sovereignty the second circuit argues that the subsection is intended to encompass only those areas over which congress may exer cise legislative jurisdiction of the kind ordinarily vested in the several states the fourth circuit has held that at least some areas located in other countries might be considered within the special territorial jurisdiction of the united states as described in subsection 73 united states v erdos 474 f2d 157 4th cir 1973 erdos upheld the conviction of an american diplomat for the crime of manslaughter committed in the american embassy in equatorial guinea erdos saw two grounds for territorial jurisdiction within subsection 73 1 any nds reserved or acquired for the use of the united states and under the exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction thereof or 2 any place purchased or otherwise acquired by the united states by consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be for the erection of fort magazine arsenalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21306crs3 dockyard or other needful building it concl uded that by virtue of the practical usage and dominion exercised over the embassy or other federal establishment by the united states government 18 usc 73 is proper grant of special territorial jurisdiction embracing an embassy in foreign country ac quired for the use of the united states and under its concurrent juri sdiction 474 f2d at 15960 courts in the second circuit read subsection 73 differently united states v bin laden 92 fsupp2d 189 sdny 2000 involved the terrorist bombing of american embassies in kenya and tanzania unlike erdos it held that the american embassies abroad were not within the special territorial jurisdiction of the united states and that statutes outlawing murder and maiming within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states 18 usc 1111 114 had extrate rritorial application 92 fsupp2d at 20416 the court of appeals for the second circu it came to much the same conclusion it reversed conviction under 18 usc 2243 sexua l abuse of minor within the territorial jurisdiction of the united stat for statutory rape whic h occurred in housing complex on us military base in germany united states v gatlin 216 f3d 207 2d cir 2000 gatlin based its conclusion that s ubsection 73 has extraterr itorial application on three factors first statute is presumed to have extraterritorial application absent clear indication to the contrary second gatlin read the subsections legislative history as an indication that congress intended the subsection to apply solely within the united states third it pointed out that after reid and kinsella congress the executive branch and commentators had all describe d as beyond federal jurisd iction those crimes committed by dependents and contractors on overseas military bases all assuming that subsection 73 had extraterritorial pplication 216 f3d at 21422 the ninth circuit could not agree united states v corey 232 f3d 1166 9th 2000 corey involved the conviction of civilian postal employee for sexual abuse committed in military housing in japan and in residence rented by the us embassy in the philippines corey found the presumption against extr aterritoriality unpe rsuasive and not particularly relevant in its mind jurisdiction was terr itorial not extraterritorial matter where the property was located as l ong as it was acquired for needful purposes and as long as us legislative jurisdiction over the property was exclusive or concurrent 232 f3d at 1170171 it found support in the hi story of subsection 73 which had been applied over time to territory beyond the confines of any ad mitted state or bey ond the continental boundaries of the united states 232 f3d at 1173176 congress resolved the dispute or at least greatly mitigated its consequences when it enacted section 804 of the usa patriot act and the m ilitary extraterritorial jurisdiction act of 2000 the m ilitary extraterritorial jurisdiction act treats felonies committed anywhere overseas by members of the armed forces or those accompanying or employed by them as if they were committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states 18 usc 3261 section 804 of the usa pa triot act creates new territorial subsection in 18 usc7 the special territorial jurisdiction of the united states includes the overseas business premises of federal governmental entities and the residences of the members of their staffs but only for crimes committed by or against americans other than those who come with in the military extension of 18 usc 3261 the split in the circuits remains of consequence for crimes committed in federal overseas facilities by foreign nationals who are not associated with the us armed forces in the fourth and ninth circuits such crimes may come within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states in the second circuit they do nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21306crs4 credit card fraud overseas fraud and rela ted activity in connection with access devices abroad section 1029 of title 18 proscribes counterfeiting or trafficking in counterfeit or unauthorized access devices or attempting or conspiring to do so if the offense affects interstate or foreign commerce thus prior to the addition of subsection h the section would have been thought to have extraterritorial application when the offense affected the interstate or foreign commerce of the united states subsection h might be construed to limit the overseas application of section 1029 to circumstances involving an american issuer of the depicted access device and some contact between the united states and the material used in the offense or the profits from it alternatively it might be construed as an explicit confirmation that th section applies under these circumstances but without intending to foreclose other circ umstances justifying application abroad money laundering the money laundering provisi ons of 18 usc 1956 proscribe money laundering or more exactly financial transactions related in various ways to specified unlawful activity it creates six distinct crimes 1 laundering with intent to promote an illicit activity 2 laundering to evade taxes 3 laundering to conceal or disguise 4 smurfing structuring trans actions to avoid repor ting requirements 5 international laundering nd 6 laundering part of law enforcement sting the extraterritorial aspects of section 1956 come in two forms first the statute prohibits transactions in this country related to certain cr imes in other countries second the section specifically asserts extraterritorial jurisdiction over transactions in other countries which involve more than 10000 and either the participation of an american or conduct occurring within the united states 18 usc 1956f section 318 of the usa patriot act expre ssly eliminates any requirement that the triggering financial transactions occur in an american bank or othe r american financial institution by changing the applicable definition of financial institution to include foreign banks whether this is intended as an implicit repeal of the requirements subsection 1956f is unclear the amendment allows for extraterritorial app lication in instances where subsection 1956f would not subsec tion 1956f for example does not reach transactions of less than 10000 or foreign tr ansactions by fore ign national relating to specified illegal activity committed in the united states the report of the house committee in which this proposal originated ma kes it clear that the provision was crafted to fill in gaps in existing law on the other hand the courts do not favor repeal by implication jem ag supply inc v pion eer hibred international inc 122 sct 593 606 2001the only permissible justification for repeal by implication is when the earlier and later statutes are irreconcilable yet it is possible to read the amendment and subsection 1956f consistently ie each independently desc ribes circumstances under which extraterritorial jurisd iction may be asserted without reference to the other section 315 of the act supplements the 18 usc 1956 definition of specified unlawful activity to include when the financial transaction occurs at least in part in the us wider range of foreign crimes such as crimes of violence foreign official corruption various smuggling offenses nd crimes for which we have extradition obligations under multinational treaty it also adds sundry smuggling offenses gun running computer fraud and abuse and fe lony violations of the foreign agents registration act of 1938 to the definiti on of the specified unlawful activityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21306crs5 treaty implementation contemporaneous with senate approval of the international conventions for the suppression of terrori st bombings and of the financing of terrorism congress enacted implementing criminal provisions that feat ure extraterritorial components subsection 2332fa bans the use of nuclear ma terials chemical weapons explosives or biological w eapons against public places or governmental facilities and utilities or attempting or conspiring to do s violations are punishable in the same manner as violations of 18 usc 2332aause of weapons of mass destruction against federal property or an american abroad ie imprisonment for any term of years or life and if death results from commission of the ffense the offender may also be subject to the death penalty the extraterritorial reach of the new statute runs parallel to several existing statues which prohibit international terrorism the unlawful use of chemical or biological weapons nuclear materials explosives or weapons of mass destru ction or attacks on aircraft airports mass transit diplomatic officials or fede ral employees it is somewhat distinctive in that it may be enforced when the offense is committed overseas and subsequently the offender is found here or has been brought here other connection to the united states is needed the section does not become effective however until the treaty provisions it implements come into effect for the united states limitation without which any claim to legislative jurisd iction in some instances might be suspect newly enacted section 2339c condemns 1 pr oviding or collecting funds to be used for terrorist purposes or 2 concealing info rmation concerning funds used to support terrorism subsection 2339ca the financing provision which also outlaws attempts and conspiracies applies where the funds are to be used in support of the commission of either an offense covered in any of the vari ous specified antiterrorism treaties or an act of terrorism intended to cause death or rious injury the underlying treaty offenses include the following federal crimes and their foreign equivalents 18 usc 32 destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities 18 usc 37 violence at international airports 18 usc 112 878 1116 1117 1201 assau lt threats murder manslaughter attempted murder kidnaping of internationa lly protected persons 18 usc 831 nuclear materials offenses 18 usc 1203 hostage taking 18 usc 2280 violence against maritime navigation 18 usc 2281 violence against fixed maritime platforms and 49 usc 46502 aircraft piracy violatio ns are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years fine of not more than 250000 for individuals or not more than 500000 for organizations andor civil penalty of at least 10000 18 usc 2339cd1f the financing subsection applie s overseas if the offender is an american if the target of the underlying terrorism is the united stat government an amer ican or an american entity or when the financing convention beco mes effective for the us if the offender is subsequently found in the united states 18 usc 2339cc the subsection has several counterparts elsewhere in federal law most notably 18 usc 2339b providing material support to terrorists organizations 18 usc 2339a providing material support to terrorists and 18 usc 2 aiding nd abetting the extraterritorial reach of subsection 2339ca when it may be based on the presence of the offender of the united states is more sweeping than the most expans ive of these section 2339b proscribes aid to groups designated foreign terrorist organiza tions by the secretary of state as threats to us national security or the national secu rity of us nationa ls and has general extraterritorial jurisdiction provision 18 u sc 2339bd there is extraterritorialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21306crs6 federal jurisdiction over an offense under this section subsection 2339ca is limited neither to designated terrorist organizations nor to terrorism directed against american national security interests th subsequent presence of the fi nancier in the us is enough section 2339a prohibits aid to terrorist in the commission of any of list designated for federal predicate offenses it has explicit extraterritorial provisions but almost certainly has extraterritorial application by virtue of the extraterritorial features of its predicate offenses subs ection 2339cas predicate offens list is more extensive than that of section 2339a and c onsequently its extraterritorial reach is greater section 2 imposes the same criminal lia bility upon those who aid and abet the commission of crime as those who actually commit it it carries the extraterritorial reach of the underlying offenses although mo re extensive than the predicate offense list of section 2339a section 2 cannot stand on the full range of foreign law offenses available to subsection 2339ca moreover this section requires completed predicate federal crime there is ordinarily crime to attempt to aid and abet nor to aid and abet an unsuccessful criminal effort subs ection 2339ca suffers from neither limitation prior to the convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism entering into force for the united states howeve r subsection 2339ca will not reach those overseas acts of financial support for terrori sm offenses whose only connection to the united states is the subsequent pres ence of the offender in this country concealment section 2339c also contains cealment offense with extraterritorial application subsection 2339cc concealment only extends to those violations abroad that are committed by us nationals or american entities section 2 appears to offer broader extraterritorial coverage since its parallel prohibition on aiding and abetting violations of subsection 2339c afinancing terrorism and 2339b enjoys the benefit of their extraterritorial application without an offender citizenship requirement on the other hand where their proscriptions overlap subsection 2339cc provides an additional penalty option since section 2 carries th same criminal pena lties as the underlying offense ie imprisonment for not more than 20 year s plus fine but not civil penalty
