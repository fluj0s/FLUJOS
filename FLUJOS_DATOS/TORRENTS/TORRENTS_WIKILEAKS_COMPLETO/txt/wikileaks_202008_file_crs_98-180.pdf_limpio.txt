information policies impact of the pelosi amendment summary in 1989 the us congress passed legisl ation that included provision known as the pelosi amendment after its s ponsor congresswoman nancy pelosi it requires us executive directors at the world bank and all the regional multilateral development banks mdbs to abstain or vote against any proposed action withsignificant environmental effects if it has not received an appropriate environmental assessment or if the assessment has not been available to the executive directors and the public for 120 days before vote this report describes reviews andevaluates the environmental assessment and information disclosure policies of themultilateral development banks that have been in effect in the period since the pelosi amendment went into effect in 1991 and actions taken by the us government to implement it environmental assessment and information access procedures have been adopted and put into practice by all the major mdbs due in large part mostobservers agree to the pelosi amendment these are widely credited withincreasing the attention paid to environmental concerns in projects and with creatinggreater environmental awareness in the banks however evaluations by the world ba nk and commentary by us government and nongovernmental organizations identif continuing problems in the actual use by mdb decisionmakers of information generated by environmental assessmentsand in the adequacy of their content in many cases environmental assessments may be done on parallel track not as an integral part of project design anddecisionmaking and they may overlook factors such as downstream impacts thatare not directly connected with the viability of the project itself there also have been problemsand benefitswith the way categories are used by the banks todifferentiate among projects that need full environmental assessments and those thatneed reduced level of environmental analysis or do not have environmentalimpacts examination of information availability reveals that while environmental information is much more available now than before the pelosi amendment thereare inconsistencies and gaps in how the banks implement their information policiesand procedures public access to environmental assessment information may notoccur in the early stages of project development when key decisions are made although the united states has invoked the pelosi amendment on both substantive grounds and because of failure to make information available on time and voted or abstained on numerous projects at the banks these projects are virtually always approved by the full boards however these occasions have been reduced significantly over the past three years due to the banks implementation of their environmental assessment and information policies and important informalinteraction between the bank staff and us officialshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180contents x c u t i v s u m m r y1 n v i r n m n t l s s s s m n

barney frank and congresswoman nancy pelosi it was released on july 21 1997 in somewhatdifferent format the present document is the same material that was released in1997 reformatted for release as crs report for general congressional use since the report was originally release d two substantive changes has occurred first congress mandated in the foreign operations appropriations act for fiscal 1998 pl 105118 that the international finance corporation ifc is to beconsidered multilateral development bank as regards the requirements of the pelosiamendment as noted on pp 9094 the ad ministration had argued that the pelosi amendment did not apply to the ifc second the african development bank has proposed adoption of an access to information plan that the treasury departmentbelieves is comparable to those in effect at the other multilateral development bankshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180multilateral development banks environmental assessment and information policies impact of the pelosi amendment executive summary environmental assessment at the mdbs in 1989 the us congress passed legi slation public law 101240 22 usc 262m7 that included provision known as the pelosi amendment after its sponsor congresswoman nancy pelosi it provides that beginning in 1991 the us executive director used at each multilateral development bank mdb isprohibited from voting in favor of any proj ect that might have significant negative effect on the human environment unless an environmental assessment ea orcomprehensive environmental summary has been done and made available to theused and the public at least 120 days before vote on approval of the project the pelosi amendment has achieved major portion of its intended effect establishment of environmental assessment procedures in the major multilateraldevelopment banksalthough mdb critics conti nue to express their concerns about the quality of assessments and the extent to which they are used in decisionmaking the amendment has been major factor most observers of mdbs would generallyagree in the environmental progress of the mdbs in the 1990s environmentalassessment ea procedures are in effect at all the major multilateral developmentbanks and are generally being carried out in accord with the mdbs policies as several observers agreed without pelosi we wouldnt be where we are today with respect to environmental ssessment and public access to environmental information recent world bank evaluation of its environmental assessment procedures reportedthat such assessment is now standard practice in development planning despite these improvements in ea pro cedures critics and observers find cause for continuing concern regarding the adequacy and content of the mdbenvironmental assessments and analyses they find cases in which there are major gaps in the analysis of impacts overly rapid appraisal techniques for large projects that may overlook important elements use of outdated material and poor data bases and other problems the effective use of environmental info rmation produced in the environmental assessments remains problematic on the plus side many observers find that the need for internalization of environmental concerns into project planning design isrecognized by mdb staff and the gree of emphasis on mitigation of environmental impacts has also generally improved this increased focus onenvironmental issues is attributed to the banks ea policies coupled withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs2 information disclosure policies however there remain serious problems with optimal use of ea analyses world ba nk evaluations of its experience with ea procedures indicate that the eas are frequently not available in time andor are notused in project design and decisionmaking environmental assessments are oftenconducted in relative isolation from project preparation and frequently have not been used appropriatelyor at allin project design the mdbs have responded over the past several years with similar approaches to environmental assessment all the banks have established categories forlevelsdegree of environmental impacts requiring full environmental assessmentfor projects with significant and serious nvironmental impacts second category includes projects with environmental impacts that must be analyzed but withflexibility for how extensive appropriate an alysis must be third category covers projects with environmental impacts th at do not require environmental analysis this process of screening and categorizing projects has produced some problematic results especially in the early years of most mdbs experience according to some bank staff project supervisorsmanagers have tried oftensuccessfully to get their projects placed in the second category requiring lessenvironmental analysis rather than in the first category in most cases roughly10 to an upper range of 20 of projects of bank have been placed in the first usually category bank staff and othe rs report that in recent years there seems to be less resistance to placing projects in the first category and that fuller analysis is more often done even on projects in the second category neverthelessappropriate scrutiny and treatment of second category usually b projects andinformation about them remains problematic recent world bank evaluationhighlighted this challenge partly in re sponse to these concerns the interamerican development bank idb recently abandoned the use of categories move which may raise questions of its own as discussed chapters i and iii of this report most mdb and us government staff and nongovernmental observers and critics generally have found the use of categories beneficial in terms of flag ging projects with major environmental concerns that bear close assessment and ongoing scrutiny however it has alsobeen the case that bank staff us agency staff and ngos tend to concentrate their relatively scarce staff resources on the projects with relatively little routine or systematic scrutiny of b projects some of which may be nearly as significant asa projects moreover it is unclear to many bank staff whether the pelosiamendment applies to projects that are not in category although us treasury is clear that it does as result less ttention is sometimes paid to deadlines and levels of environmental analysis and information availab ility in lower ranked projects as discussed in chapter iii the us government has invoked the pelosi amendment and opposed voted or ab stained mdb loans less often in recent years than it did in the early 1990s it has been invoked both on substantive grounds for example when an adequate environmental assessment has not been done ona proposed project and when mdbs have not adhered to the 120day deadline for information availability however projects opposed by the united states virtuallyalways win approval of the boards although additional interest and concern inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs3 environmental problems is reportedly evid ent among some other countries executive directors this results mainly in the queries about projects before they come to vote rather than opposition during the voting itself notwithstanding the limited ability of th us executive di rectors to impede projects that do not meet pelosi amendment requirements the legislation can be said to have helped sensitize the mdbs to environmental issues and to have stimulatedextensive examination of projects inquiri during project preparation expressions of concern and negotiation between us government agency staff and mdb staff this activity has resulted in additional information and some changes in projectoperations before projects come to vote thus the impacts of the pelosiamendment include sometimes extensive behind the scenes activity by usgovernment staff and undocumented inf ormal responses by mdb officials nongovernmental organizations ngos play key role in identifying problems in mdb projects networking w ith ngos in the field in the affected countries and documenting problems as well as directly negotiating with bankmanagers on such problems such ngo activity and assistance significantlyaugments the activity of us government st aff in treasury and other agencies this is relatively ad hoc processoften hi ghly effective but lacking in capability to systematically or rigorously review all mdb projects the pelosi amendmentappears to have significantly aided this process first because environmentalassessments provide critically useful information and second because theinformation availability requirements have made the information far more accessible many of the problems with mdb projects and loans reported or investigated by ngos and us government officials arise during implementation phase when theenvironmental mitigation and other measures spelled out in loan agreements are notbeing carried out satisfactorily though be yond the scope of the pelosi amendment this problem with implementation is ofte n discussed and documented in the world bank evaluation reports however the nvironmental assessment process has been useful in documenting the need for mitiga tion assuring that environmental measures are written into loan agreements or conditions and providing the baselinedocumentation for ascertaining where there are failures in implementation of suchmeasures access to mdb information much more information about mdb operations is available to the public today than was the case before the pelosi amendment was enacted the world bank international finance corporation ifc asian development bank adb andinteramerican development bank idb all have systems for informing theirmember countries and the public about projects they are considering theinformation is generally made public thr ough the banks public information centers pics the european bank for r econstruction and development ebrd implemented new information disclosure system in late 1996 it is stillincomplete the african development ba nk afdb has submitted to its board proposal for the establishment of an information disclosure policy similar to thoseused by the other multilateral banks httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs4 1the asian development bank has an operationa l directive to staff titled framework for mainstreaming participatory development processes into bank operations whichencourages such staff consultation with memb ers of the public the idb distributes through its web page resource book on participation which is both directive to staff and information for the public see httpwwwiadborgenglishpoliciesparticipateindexhtml see also normal schwartz nd anne deruyttere community consultation sustainable development and the interamerican development bank concept paper idbmarch 26 1996 ind101 the afdb has similar directives to staff procedures mechanisms and guidelines for cooperation between the african development bank and nongovernmental organizations in frica and policy paper on the promotion of cooperation between the african development bank and nongovernmental organizations in africa approved in 1990 and 1991 the wo rld bank provides through its web page number of documents promoting consultati on including the world bank participation sourcebook world bank environmental depa rtment paper 19 environmental management series 1996 the methods and cas studies in the sourcebook are what the bank calls good practices that staff are suppo sed to emulate the bank has also issued working with ngos toolkit for world bank field offices to help bank country officesin this area see httpwwwworldbankorghtmlhcovpngoproductstoolkitachtml and dfhtmlprior to identification and design of individual projects the mdbs develop country strategies that set forth their proposed country programs over the short tomedium term typically three years the adb makes these country operationalstrategies and country program notes available to the public after board approvalthis allows for public input into the adb planning process in many cases before individual projects have entered the proj ect pipeline the ebrd makes summaries of its country strategies available to the public the president of the afdb hasproposed that his bank should also make its country strategy papers publiclyavailable once they have been distributed to the afdb executive board the other mdbs do not disclose the content of their country strategies at the world bankfor example the public has way of know ing whether the suggestions or concerns of outsiders have been taken into account in bank planning documents the mdbs do not disclose much information to the public on projects in the earliest stages of preparation generally they release their project summarydocuments to the public after the projects overall scope and design have beendetermined and its likely environmental im pact has been assessed in recent years the banks have directed their staff to solicit views from potential beneficiaries andother members of the public during the ear ly phases of the project design process 1 reports differ as to the extent to which members of the public are involved in the project selection and project design processe s at the banks the burden of complying with these directives lies w ith the task manager for each project there is way of knowing whether task managers see such c onsultation as an opportunity or burden and whether they comply fully with the requirement many ngos complain thatthey are not consulted adequately or their input is not given sufficient weight in the project preparation process participation in the process seems to be at the invitation of bank staff none of the banks appear to have procedures for soliciting input from the general public during the preparation pr ocess as regards the likely environmental impact the environmental categorization or the remedial measures needed forprospective projects httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs5 great deal of information is available in mdb project or environmental reports once these are released by the banks these can be very useful to personsstudying planned projects the documents available in the mdb public disclosure systems are often outdated however or lack ing important information such as the name of the mdb task manager the exact location of the project the groups in the recipient country who might be affected by the projects and the projectsenvironmental classification as noted above the mdbs categorize loans according to their anticipated effect on the environment category projects are expected to have major diverse and irreversible effects on the environment category b projects are expected to haveenvironmental effects that are potentially less significant and more subject tomitigation by known procedures all but one of the mdbs have procedures in place providing the public with information on the likely impact of category projectsthe current afdb system informs its ex ecutive board but information is released to the public only if the borrower consents the 120 day timetable is built explicitly into the process only in the adb and ebrd it is also built into the proposed new afdb policy for category projects pub lic disclosure occurs early enough in the world bank and idb review processes howev er for there to be some assurance that information on projects will be available to the public for at least 120 days beforetheir executive boards consider prospective loans the mdbs provide much less information to their member countries and the public however about category b projects the world bank for example does notregularly provide environmental analyses of proposed category b projects in itsproject information documents although its information disclosure policy states thatit should likewise its quarterly environm ental data sheets for projects are neither as extensive nor as timely as the information disclosure policy says they should bemost of the regional mdbs provide little environmental information on category bprojects the ebrd however provides br ief summary in its project information documents the banks decide in accordance with thei r policies and procedures how projects will be categorized and how much information will be made available the usgovernment has some alternative sources of information though they lack thecompleteness and detail the mdb systems can provide ngos and us agenciescan identify particular projects they belie ve merit further study information about them can be sought from the mdbs however the breadth and thoroughness of theus evaluation process for projects are affected by the limited amount of information the banks routinely provide the paucity of mdb information oncategory b projects seems in particular constraint on the overall thoroughness ofthe us evaluation process the mdbs assert that they have made real commitment to openness and effective communication with the public great deal of information about the banks is available through their public information centers however closeexamination of the information provided by the centers shows that in many cases information promised in the banks policy statements about public disclosure was not available in other cases when information was provided it was sometimesoutdated incomplete or lacking in detail the issue seems to be one of performancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs6 shortfalls not policy or intent the mdbs could improve the utility of their systems if they each appointed person with the authority and responsib ility to ensure that the requirements of their information disc losure policies are met and their existing databases are properly maintained executive branch implementation of the pelosi amendment the administration adopted rules in 1992 establishing procedures for the implementation of the pelosi amendment despite initial concern by the center forinternational environmental law and other environmental organizations that theywould be used narrowly the 1992 rules have not limited public access to mdbinformation or constrained participation by nongovernmental organizations ngosin the us policy process in fact close collaboration between us governmentagencies and private environmental organiza tions is principal characteristic of that process without such collaboration and the foreign contacts and information itprovides the treasury department and other us agencies would most likely beunable to effectively implement the pelosi amendment between 1992 and 1996 the us representa tives at the mdbs cast more than 100 votes in opposition to mdb loans on pelo si amendmentrelated environmental grounds most of these votes were cas t in 1992 and 1993 since that time the procedures in the mdbs have been adjusted in ways that meet the expectations ofthe us legislation the united states rarely opposes mdb loans now on groundsthat their environmental analyses have not been publicly available for at least 120 days in the few instances where it has opposed mdb loans on environmentalgrounds in recent years the us government is more likely to cite specific concerns about the project or substantive problems with the environmental impact analysiseia as the reasons for its vote the administration supplies congress with memorandum every three months informing it about us votes and the reasons for us opposition to some mdbloans congress does not normally publish th is information there is comparable method for informing the public about us votes in the multilateral banks apart from the information provided to congress the annual reports to congress and the public required by law have not been filed for several years the treasury department and other us agencies seem to be making good faith effort to implement the pelosi amendment in the main they seem to havecomplied with its requirements however this study identified some areas ofuncertainty and some areas where improvement might be possible the pelosi amendment says the us representatives at the mdbs should oppose loans unless information on their environmental effects has been publiclyavailable for 120 days but it is not clear who counts the days and when availability begins treasury department officials say they presume thatenvironmental studies are publicly available the moment they are released locally by the prospective borrower the time needed to distribute the informationinternationally and to make it available to people in distant areas who may beaffected by the project is subsumed within those 120 days httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs7 2in effect the mdbs are the wholesalers and local development agencies in the borrower continuedtreasury officials maintain that the pelosi amendment does not apply to the international finance corporation ifc and other mdb private sector loanoperations key committees of congress ve indicated on several occasions their disagreement with treasurys interpretation of the pelosi amendment in this area in recent years the ifc has released about half the eias for its projects withpotentially the most serious environmenta l implications category early enough to meet the requirements of the pelosi am endment ifc rules stipulate however that this information needs to be released only 60 days prior to board consideration the proportion of mdb projects r eceiving the highest category environmental categorization is relatively small most are included in the nexthighest environmental category to some extent this may be due to the fact that thebanks are now emphasizing activities such as institutionbuilding which have fewer direct environmental effects to majo r extent though it may be due to seeming tendency of the mdbs to avoid using the higher categorization when possible the treasury department and other us agencies say they are not limited in their scrutiny by the environmental classification the banks give their projectsnevertheless relatively little information is available on the likely environmental impact of category b projects and that information is only generally available latein the review process treasury may rais questions about category b projects or ask the banks to upgrade their rating if it has environmental concerns the banks willprovide additional data to member country governments on request but they rarelyupgrade their environmental classifications treasurys interest in these projects is often sparked by sources outside the govern ments mdb project information system it is difficult to know how many potentia lly significant category b projects are not scrutinized by us officials because unofficial sources do not identify them asmeriting examination the pelosi amendment says that us executive directors useds shall oppose any prospective action by an mdb which is likely to have significant impact on the environment unless information is made available to the public beforehand therule the administration adopted in 1992 to govern its implementation of the pelosi amendment specifies that us agency st aff shall examine mdb projects in this regard the meaning of the term action as regards mdb operations is not clear treasury officials say that mdb environmental strategy papers or policy guidelines are not covered by the pelosi amendment full environmental impact study forpolicy papers and operational directives ma not be appropriate on the other hand it seems reasonable to expect that environmental issues should be considered in anyfarreaching mdb policy paper moreover it could be argued on the basis of thepelosi amendment that the public should be informed that the banks are considering such actions before they are approved by their executive boards often for mdb loans designed to f und range of smaller projects it is not feasible for the banks to identify the futu re recipients of subloans in advance 2 inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs8 2continued countries are the retailers of loans to the ultim ate recipients these loans are often too small or specialized for cost effective consideration by the mdbs frequently the recipient of microenterprise loan or private sector development project or small town water andsewerage project would not have thought abou t applying until after the mdb loan to the development agency has been approved and th agency had persuaded them to seek such assistance 1992 and 1993 the united states opposed on the pelosi amendment grounds several mdb loans which lacked sufficient procedures for scrutinizing theenvironmental effects of activities that would be ultimately funded by loan butwere not fully planned at the time the pr oject went before the mdb executive board the banks now require that borrower agencies have stringent procedures in effect to assess the likely environmental effect of such future activities they do not alsorequire however that borrowers have pro cedures for informing the public about the existence of these loan applications and th eir likely environmental effects treasury officials say that information on the poten tial environmental impact of subprojects is available to the public prior to their pproval however field examinations did not show this to be the case there is evident reason why the environmental review aspect of the pelosi amendment should apply to subloans but the public access toinformation aspect should not us repr esentatives at the mdbs have not opposed any loans on grounds that they lack procedures for informing the public about thepotential environmental impact of the subloans they will finance consultation with the public is key element of the us process for implementing the pelosi amendment nongovernmental organizations play avaluable role helping the us government identify and track projects for which there might be environmental concerns information from the banks is also very decisivein facilitating us compliance with the re quirements of this legislation the us government has few alternative sources of information other than those provided by the public or by the banks for assessing the likely environmental effects ofprospective mdb projects the early warning system maintained by the usagency for international development usa id is the only independent system the us government has for obtaining and analyz ing this sort of information the early warning system has not been major sour ce of information however with the closure of many us aid missions abroad its capacity may be diminished in thefuture in that case the administration will depend almost entirely on themultilateral banks and on members of the public for information about theenvironmental effects of prospective mdb operations this report was prepared at the reque st of representatives barney frank and congresswoman nancy pelosi and was released in mid1997 in adifferent format it was reformatted in 1998 for

development banks mdbs emerged as major concernamong environmental organizations the us congress and the us governmentgenerally number of provisions promoti ng increased priority for environmental concerns were enacted into law by the us congress during the 1980s and theworld bank and other mdbs responded with series of reorganizations and policydirectives central environment divisi on was established in 1987 as part of major reorganization of the world bank and has evolved over the years to staff of 90 with environmental divisions in each of the regional operations however by1989 there had still not been systematic effort put into place by these institutionsto carry out formal assessments of environmental impacts concurrent concern that emerged with environmental issues was the issue of adequate availability of information on pr oject design and environmental and social impacts of mdb loans and projects many of the environmental and social problems connected to mdb loan projects have been brought to the attention of policymakers by citizen organizationsoften environmental nongovernmental organizationsngos however these organizations usually found it extremely difficult or impossible to gain access to project plans and documents therefore theaccessibility of project planning documents is an issue closely related toenvironmental concerns and was included in the pelosi amendment by 1989 efforts in the united states to call attention to environmental problems and lack of information access had b een underway since hearings in 1983 with subsequent passage of provisi ons in both authorization and appropriations legislation to promote higher priority for these issues in the mdbs and to make improvements condition of future us funding alt hough the world bank and to lesser extent the regional mdbs responded with reorganizations andor formulation of policy andoperational directives on environment and information availability there was still nosystematic process of environmental assessm ent in place to assure that environmental impacts and consequences would be identified and it was hoped avoided ormitigated it was also clear that without an effective policy on making information on such assessments available to affected people and the public on transparency as this issue is termed there would continue to be major questions and concernsabout implementation of environmental priorities and policies in 1989 the us congress passed legi slation public law 101240 22 usc 262m7 which included provision known as the pelosi amendment after itssponsor congresswoman nancy pelosi this amendment provides that beginning in 1991 the us executive director use d of each multilateral development bank mdb is prohibited from voting in favor of any project or action with significant impacts on the environment unless an environmental assessment ea orcomprehensive environmental summary has been done and made available to theexecutive director and the public for 120 days before the vote following passage of this amendment the us treasury department actively engaged the mdbs to achieve its objectives they responded in most cases

implementation for each majormultilateral development bank and reviews available evaluations of theirexperiences it seems clear that all of the banks have integrated consideration ofenvironmental impacts of their activities into their procedures and there is extensiveconsensus that the pelosi amendment stimulated andor hastened this processhowever it is less clear that the environmental assessment procedures have hadoptimal influence on decisionmaking in these institutions the world bank has conducted extensive evaluations of its experience with environmental assessment concluding both that great deal of progress has beenmade and that there remain problems with implementation of the policies and with the degree to which they are used by d ecisionmakers the other mdbs have not conducted such assessments of their experiences and in some cases they have hadthese policies in effect for shorter time however many of the governmentofficials and nongovernmental organizations involved in evaluating mdbenvironmental performance express the view that similar problems and concernsseem to be shared by the mdbs on many of the issues discussed here environmental procedures at the world bank in 1989 the world bank adopted operati onal directive 400 requiring that all projects under consideration for bank loans must be screened for potentialenvironmental and social impacts

15 of these have been issued the 1991 operational directive and sourcebook updates provided for several categories into which loan proposals are placed category projects have majorenvironmental

other mdbs and development assistance organizations environmental screening and assessment process organizationally the world bank has established several focal points for environmental responsibilitiesa vice president for environmentally sustainable development was established in1993 under whom central environment partment staffed by approximately 90 professionals operates within each regi onal vice presidency there is regional environment division red with staff that has firstline responsibility for assisting task managers with environmental screen ing and for later approving and signing off on environmental analysis and assessment reports they participate in the scopingmonitoring and supervision on environment in projects in that region the staffing level varies considerably among regions from about 8 to 9 in th smallest division to up to 40 in very large divisions such as asia the environmental screeningreview process begins at the time of project identification and is the responsibility of bank task managers with the advice andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs13 4opcit supra note 5 p 8assistance of the regional environment division the categorization finding is included in the initial executive project summa ry ieps and is reviewed with the borrowing country the screening results are also supposed to be included in thebanks published monthly operational summary mos and the information recorded on an environmental data sheet see discussion in chapter ii it is the responsibility of the borrowing country to finance and carry out the environmental assessment or analysis ofte n after consultation with world bank task managers tms consultants specializing in such analysis are often used the taskmanager also approves the terms of reference to be followed for category aassessments by the borrowing country bank procedures require that the bank mustreceive the final ea report from the borrower prior to appraisal and it should beavailable before the staff appraisal report sar the sourcebook states the tm should agree with the borrowe r on which drafts if any the bank wishes to see and when at nimum however the tm should review final draft with red assistance in order to ascertain that the issues of importance to the bank have been ddressed to obtain any clarification needed and to provide other comments to the borrower in the interest ofhaving information on all the critical environmental issues ready beforeappraisal 4 the world bank sourcebook notes that in practice some final eas may be available only shortly before appraisal therefore it says preliminary review atinterim stages is desirable for example when significant environmental issues have been identified and mitigati ng measures described the sourcebook states in general most major concerns become known within the first few months theremainder of the ea period focuses on mitigating measures this statement appears to acknowledge that mitigation is often the main focus of an assessment yet it is the analysis of alternativeswhich the world banks ownevaluations identify as weak point in the ea processthat often provides for possible influence on changes in project design or location if eas focus almostentirely on mitigation of the chosen approach serious effort to consider anyalternatives in the ea as realistic opti ons is less likely on the other hand some informal and undocumented consideration of alternatives is likely to have occurredprior to and during the environmental screening process it is this informal processthat should according to bank procedures be done and documented in systematic way choosing or changing environmental categories changing categories into which project has been placed during th screening process has been problematic in the view of us government offici als and ngo bank watchers who attempt to negotiate such changes when they see proj ects that are not getting what they consider to be an adequate level of scrutiny the 1993 sourcebook update on environmental screening notes the option to reclassify project from b to if new informationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs14 5world bank

it may have mo re significant environmental impacts than originally thought or from to b if component with significant effects is deleted5 this update acknowledges the tendency to opt for lower categories and implicitly the difficulty in changing to higher category while the option to reclassify projects relieves some of the pressure on the tm to make the initial decision the co rrect and final one it may also result in tendency to assign borderline project to category b in the hope thatnothing more serious will emerge from the environmental analysishowever the reclassification of propos ed project is not free of cost for example if category b project is ter changed to category additional resources will be required for environmental studies public consultationand report preparation the schedule for project preparation will almost certainly be affected 6 reading between the lines there appears to be strong presumption here againstreclassification and this has been reflected in the difficulty that has been experienced by treasury and us aid staff who approach bank staffusually unsuccessfullyto try to get projects upgraded from b to in order to be able to obtain sufficient environmental assessment clearance by environmental officials the sourcebook states that the final ea report must be submitted to the bank for detailed examination before bank staffmay begin the project appraisal process world bank procedures require formalenvironmental clearance for the project this is to be issued by the regionalenvironment division based on information in the staff appraisal report sarthe sar is to contain summaries of the ea and its main findings and the ea itself the sourcebook states this clearance is nece ssary prerequisite to the regional vice presidents authorization to begin nego tiations in the negotiations themselves the issues and actions critical to environmental soundness and sustainability in theproject are discussed and appropriate covena nts are incorporated into loan or credit documents 7 according to 1996 world bank report evaluating the banks ea experience the ea process is not intended to termine whether project should proceed rather it defines the conditions under which projects may proceed8 as discussed in chapter ii the world bank and some regional mdbs do not require explicitly that an environmental an alysis or

subm itted to the executive directors for action however the banks argue that the policy of having the environmental assessment orsummary available before the staff appraisal report will in effect result in having this information available at least 120 days or more before submission to the boardas discussed in chapter ii treasury depart ment staff report that in negotiations with the mdbs regarding us requirements fo r 120day advance availability the united states agreed that this policy would be adequate with the understanding that this 120day period is critical to the us executive directors costs of environmental assessments the expense of conducting eas has been source of complaints by borrowing countries most cost between 60000 and 200000 and take more than year to complete those for very large projects maycost significantly more in most cases consultants are hired by borrowing countries to do the environmental assessment or analysis the cost of these studies may have an impact on the kind of projects undertaken or their design especially in poorer developing countries the issue of cost raises some problems discussed in the world bank evaluation reports the1996 report of the environment department env for example notes that in theafrica region most eas cost less than 100000 it suggests one reason is that large construction activities are less emphasized in africa than in other regions but thereport also notes that funding constraints may play role another reason might be that funding fo r ea work is less readily available in african countries relatively fe w countries have ea requirements of their own which would trigger financing through internal budgetaryprocesses and many are reluctant to finance ea work from internal orborrowed funds external grant financing is sometimes solution but isoften limited to smaller amounts thus eas may be somewhat scaleddown andor bank environmental specia lists may take on larger role in the ea preparation process

environmental assessmentpolicies have been carried out in accord with bank procedures the underlyingpurpose or objective influencing project design to reflect and avoid environmental concerns often has not been realized in november 1996 the environment division completed its second environmental assessment review providing another frank evaluation of the world banks experience with the ea process her eafter referred to as the env report for the acronym used for the environment division 11 among other things this report found progress in impact identification assessment and mitigation

evaluation the env report stated examining development projects for the impact they are likely to have on the environment is now standard practice in development planningenvironmental assessment ea and similar methodologies are requiredby most multilateral and bilateral development agencies and growingnumber of developing countries 12 both reports found great deal of progress in environmental assessment procedures there are many areas where the experience of the past six years has ledto improvements and remedies to previous problems that had led to frequentinvocation of the pelosi requirements by the us directors in 19921993 both reports present evidence of these improve ments in environmental assessments and analyses however in addition to ch progress they also found number of continuing significant problems discussed below problems found by the oed report the oed report found that since 1989 more than thousand projects have been through the screening process some 10 were

in the project design the oed report stated the study found that in 17 of the projects nine of the 53 projects evaluated two categor and seven category b projects design had been modified to some degree because of ea findings 13 moreover the oed reported that the banks second ea review found that supervision in theimplementation phase of projects in category is generally insufficient todetermine environmental performance nd may limit the banks ability to detect or address environmentrelated problems during implementation in timely fashion 14 in summary of its findings the banks oed report states that the ea directives some of the most comprehensive in the world have been followed by and large thus ensuring that environmentalconsiderations are reflected in bank project documents and that themitigation of environmental impacts is prerequisite for project approval still the impact of this process on project design and implementation may well be below its potential because most eas strive forcomprehensiveness rather than focus on major risk factors massivevolumes are generated that increase co st and are of limited use analysis of project alternatives in many eas when done at all is weak eas areoften prepared when the project desi gn is already well developed and the implementation of the agreed action plan is often not well supervisedthere is adequate

understaffed environmental institutions as further developedin chapter four finally sector nd area specific eas which can improve quality and save time are infrequent 15 summarizing the views of bank staff and borrowers the oed report showed that 76 and 81 respectively complain that by the time the results of the ea or analysis are ready it is t oo late to use them the oed notes because it often takes more than one year to conduct an ea project design evolves more quickly and often fails to take the environment into account especially if the task manager believes that ea is just pro forma ritual and fails to monitor the process closely16 the environmental screening process in which categories are assigned presents several problems the env report notes th at the bank has improved its consistency in classifications and that the problematic disagreements between operational andenvironmental staff which were evident in the early 1990s are rare the report indicates that the screening process resu lts in identification of environmentally sensitive components which are sometimes altered or dropped however it alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs18 17op cit supra note 13 env report p xv 18ibid 19ibid p 52 20ibid p 5152notes that nevertheless the need to d ecide on particular classification sometimes draws attention away from the actual environmental issues and impacts associatedwith proposed project 17 it goes on to identify problematic practices that have been used during screening in the past and which it recomme nds be avoided this review stresses that project environmental classification should be based primarily on informationobtained in the field and less on checklists past precedents with similar projects or external pressures 18 in discussing the influence of ea on project design the env report notes the possible negative role of high ea costs another problem is that borrowers arefrequently interested in cutting costs which may lead to the utilization of consultantswho do not have sufficient expertise to take an active part in the project designprocess 19 the env report notes finding also made by the oed review many eas are still not an integral part of proj ect preparation ra ther they tend to be relatively independent assessments usually carried out by consultants that may bedetached from the broader preparation process 20 the pelosi amendment has been invoked only rarely in the last two years by us executive directors but challenging s ituations continue to occur as recently as may 1996 the united states voted on transport sector project in cameroon because there was environmental analysis before appraisal reorganization and reformulation of environmental procedures the world bank is currently reformulating most of its policy and operational directives with the expressed goal of streamlining them and reducing what some regarded asan unmanageable proliferation of detaile d requirements for each project concerns have been raised in the case of some of these reformulations that previouslymandatory practices have become best pr actice guidelines that are discretionary and longer mandatory however according to bank officials these reformulations are not intended to change policy only to streamline it and make iteasier to apply early drafts of the environmental assessment operational directive seemed to narrow the types of projects in various cat egories and introduce other vehicles such as environmental audits perhaps as alterna tives to ea or environmental analysis it is not clear when final draft will be completed and submitte d to the board for approval the bank is also undergoing substantial reorganization process sometimes cited by bank staff as holding up some implementation of improvementsrecommended in the environmental assessment evaluations one change in theworld bank is to establish networks that will link staff throughout the bank withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs19

environmental issuesconcerns b environmental procedures at the international finance corporation ifc the ifc requirement in september 1993 the ifc issued its guidance document on environmental analysis entitled environmental analysis and reviewof international finance corporation projects it noted that this document and theworld banks operational directive 401 mmarized above and in appendix are similar in many respects and have identical goalsto ensure that projects are carriedout in an environmentally responsible manner and meet high environmentalstandards it also notes that the ifc s and world banks procedures differ in some details due to differences between ifc and the world bank in missionorganization project cycle and clientele private sector versus nationalgovernments one difference cited is that the world bank od 401 requires that an ea be completed prior to departure of the appraisal mission whereas the ifc has suchrequirement according to the ifc this is feasible for the world bank because it becomes involved in projects at the concept stage with relatively long lead timeprior to appraisal the ifc argues by contrast project sponsors normally approach ifc much later in the project cycle often after feasibility studies site selection and preliminary design work are completed many projects sponsors have already completed somelevel of environmental analysis prio r to contacting ifc however some project sponsors do not do any environmental analysis until required byifc since ifcs project cycle is s hortthree to six months for appraisal and management approvalin such cases it may be necessary for thesponsor to do the environmental analysis concurrently with the appraisaland other aspects of the project wh ile ifc recognizes that environmental analysis should be integrated into the feasibility study and encouragespotential project sponsors to do so prio r to approaching ifc for financing ifcs procedure is designed to allow the flexibility to accommodateprojects which are brought to ifc in various stages of development 21 however the basic ifc policy is th at all operations must comply with appropriate world bank environmental policies

ensurehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs20 22ibid p 7 23ibid p 13environmental issues are addressed early enough in the project cycle to consider all relevant alternatives mitigation measures and efficiency improvements22 in accord with this policy it would seem possi ble for the ifc to institute requirement that project sponsors complete eas prior to appraisal accepting some delays as anecessary cost of ensuring environmental soundness the ifcs environmental screen ing and assessment process the ifc procedure notes that environmental analysis is part of project preparation thus is the responsibility of the project sponsor the document indicates the preferability of use of independent consultants to do this work the ifc uses the same categories b and c as the world bank it adds

of having categories was to establish must category that required an extensive eia thepractical effect often was to establish in stead category that mdb staff made every effort to avoidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs23 reorganization and reformulation of environmental procedures new procedures in november 1996 the idb reformulated its environmental procedures and eliminated classification categories partly in an effort to avoid thebunching of environmentally sensitive projects in categor iii its new procedures say that every project should be subjected to environmental review and evaluation that is appropriate to its potential environmental impact the new environmental and social equity procedures retain the institutional focal point for environment in the cma renamed the committee on environmentand social equity but retaining the same acronym the general framework of the procedures states that the environmenta l policy of the idb require that all operations financed by the bank be environmentally and socially sustainable theprocedures are designed to implement thes mandates in manner that is consistent with the organizational structure of the bank and with the demands of itsprogramming and project preparation cycles the new procedures do not include envi ronmental classification categories for types or severity of environmental impact s instead during the identification stage of any proposal project teams are required to determine the scope ofenvironmental and related social equity issu at the center of the scoping process is an environmental and social equity brie f eseb as part of the profile ii report operations under 3 million will be screened without an eseb the procedures note that the eseb once approved by the cma establishes the environmental assessment requirements to be met in preparing the operation andidentifies the environmental and social equity issues that must be resolved to ensure that the operation is viable and eligible for bank support the procedures outline the contents required for the eseb these include an indication whether full eia or other mo re specific or limited study is needed and description of the depth breadth and analytical requirements to be met the eseb is to be made available to the public in accordance with the banks disclosure of information policy duri ng the evaluation stage for bank operation the eia if required is to be prepared the new procedures outline the objectives of an eia and state that an environmen tal impact assessment eia will be carried out for all operations with potential impacts on the environment the required elements of an eia are listed there must be an analysis of direct and indirect environmental and social equity impacts and risks summary description and evaluation of the alternatives considered and the rationale forselecting the proposed method is required record of the process and summary of the results of consultations with aff ected groups must be provided the eia must also provide details on options and budget for preventing avoiding and reducingimpacts of the selected alternative the new procedures say that some operations may require environmental andor social equity studies of limited sc ope and relatively minor importance to the overall design or impact of an operation these studies are not called eas

1993 44 ppbank says these studies are identified on case by case basis and designated by title which reflects the specificity of their scope continuing concerns these new procedures by avoiding establishment of entire categories that allow minimal or environmental assessment are among other things intended to avoid the pr oblem of bunching of projects and operations in these categories outside of the category that requires fullenvironmental assessment however decision must still be made under the newprocedures as to whether such full eia would be needed for projects that needless than full eia environmental evalua tionanalysis would be done at level of detail regarded by the team leaders and the cma as appropriate the supposition that there are categories that require minimal or analysis for projects with little orno presumed impact on the environment is avoided in the new procedures althoughit seems decision along these lines could still be likely for many of the projects thatare now in the lowestimpact categories the challenge under the new system will be that even without the need to categorize projects there could still be avoi dance of determination that full eia is needed and bunching at the lower levels of analysis what concerns somengos and us government staff is that the red flag of category iv or iiidesignation that has in the past served to ert them to the need for special attention and scrutiny will longer be used d environmental procedures at the asian development bank adb the adb requirement the asian development bank published in march 1993 its

expects that by the time of proj ect appraisal the environmental and social assessments should have been completed and at appraisal environmentalconcerns issues and proposed solutions are to be written into memorandum ofunderstanding that creates commitments to the obligations associated with environmental issues that have been iden tified during the preparatory phases the adb describes the categorization process as an evolving one an initialenvironmental examination iee is done during the project preparatory technical assistance prior to loan fact finding duri ng this process the iee may reveal greater or lesser environmental impacts that may ccasionally lead to recategorization of project from b to or viceversa summari of eias or iees are made available to the public full eias are available on request according to adb procedures the adb reports that it regards environm ental assessment as an integral part of project preparations in contrast to some other regional banks the adb notes that most of the its developing country members have established their own environmental procedures which are often comprehensive and include preparationof eias and public consultation the costs of preparing an eia may be financed the bank notes under project preparatory technical assistance however the borrowing and private sectorinvestment entities are in charge of the environmental

evaluation of afdb environmental assessment policy and procedures such as thestudies done by the world bank on its ea procedures in the 1994 report submitted by the treasury department to congress on

omittingessential information such as comp lete description of the project and project site analysis of alternatives or discussion of public participation the united states through its executiv

vary widely and constitute key va riable if task manager believes that environmental concerns are important he or she will assure their integration if they are seen as peripheral or an unwelcome obstacle to swift project design they may be treated superficially at best reorganization and reformulation of environmental procedures t h recent afdb reorganization has created an environment and

awaited since the ebrd beganfunctioning in 1991 the policy points out that the ebrd is the first international financial institution to be given proactive environmental mandate in theagreement establishing it the environmental policy cites article 21vii of theagreement which directs the bank to pro mote in the full range of its activities environmentally sound and sustainable development the ebrd states in its first item among its general principles and objectives that the bank will ensure through its environmental appraisal process not only that its projects are environmentally sound but that their environmental performanceis monitored it will seek to realize additional environmental benefits through its operations in particular if they also provide economic benefits 30 t h b n k generally uses the term environmental appraisal for the process that involvesscreening assigning categories and carrying out environmental assessments oranalyses in order to implement the mandate in its environmental policy the ebrd also formulated its environmental procedures to ensure that all of its investment andtechnical cooperation activities undergo environmental appraisal as part of theoverall financial economic legal and tec hnical due diligence which is carried out 31 the procedures indicate that the purpose of environmental appraisal is both to help the bank decide if an activity should be financed and if so the way in which environmental issues should be incorporat ed in operation financing planning and implementation an overall objective of environmental appraisal is to improvedecisionmaking project sponsor is expected to provide sufficient environmentalinformation to the bank to make decisions possible usually by commissioning orconducting necessary environmental investiga tions that would be satisfactory to the bank the banks environmental screening and assessment process t h operation leader in the bank has respons ibility within the bank for environmental aspects of the operation the environmental appraisal unit eau is to provideassistance in preparing terms of refere nce for environmental studies such ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs29 32ibid procedures p 9assessments or audits and to review any preliminary environmental information about an operation and identify concerns it then prepares an environmentalscreening memorandum outlining environmental concerns and the nature ofenvironmental investigations that will be needed this screening undertaken by the eau identifies the environmental categor b or c into which proposed project is to be placed it also decide s whether or not an environmental audit is required after terms of reference are completed by the operation leader with eau help the eau reviews the results of the environmental investigation including the public investigation the eau then prepares an environmental reviewmemorandum detailing which environmental control andor enhancement measuresshould be incorporated into the operation the eau also assists in monitoringimplementation of environmental aspects of the operation the procedures describe types of environmental appraisal work to be done by the ebrd they indicate that an envir onmental impact assessment eia is carried out to identify predict and assess the future environmental impacts of an operationwhere these impacts are potentially signi ficant and cannot be readily identified assessed or mitigated the procedures reference annex d in which types of greenfield projects operations in previously undeveloped areas major expansionprojects or transformationconversion operati ons are listed that will be subject to an eia regardless of their location due to thei r environmental significance it indicates that additional types of operations may also be subject to eia if they are inenvironmentally protected or sensitive areas like parks and nature reserves the procedures also describe environmental analysis it is carried out on operations or activities wher any future environmental impacts are potentially significant but where because of their na ture size and location they can be readily identified assessed and mitigated the content of an environmental analysis issimilar to that for an eia although the sc ope of environmental analysis is usually more limited 32 annex d of the ebrd procedures lists 24 types of operations as level operations although the procedures themselves and the discussion of operationsneeding an eia do not refer to categorie s b or c the 24 types of operations listed in the annex for categor include crude oil refineries nuclear fuel enrichment installations integrated chemical installations large dams andreservoirs large diameter oil and gas pipelines large scale logging large scaletourism development tanneries etc following the list of examples the level operations section states the above list is clearly nonexhaus tive and the types of projects it contains are

greenfield or major extension or transformation projects not receiving an rating are subject to projectspecific b level environmental analysis unless location scale or other factors require an level

specifies the treatment of c level operations operations which do not require either an level environmental impactassessment or b level environmental analysis are screened it says in categoryc which do not require an environmental assessment 35 annex d concludes by saying that opera tions in any category may be subject to an environmental audit which identif ies past or present concerns and potential environmental and health and safety ri sks and liabilities associated with the operation it may also identify base line conditions for agreeing on responsibility for environmental damage and may encompass one or more phases of an operation because the ebrd policy and procedures on environmental assessment are so recent there have been opportunities to evaluate how they will operate g evaluation of mdb environmental assessment procedures the following section provides general critique of the mdb environmental assessment procedures and summarizes some of the points made in the sectionsabove on the individual banks it is based on distillation of comments by interviewees at the banks the us treas ury department and ngos and an analysis of relevant documents the comments in this chapter reflect the preponderant viewof these sources but do not include all possible perspectives environmental operations of mdbs and responses to the pelosi amendment impact on mdb procedures environmental assessment policies are now in place in all of the mdbs and have become standard part of the operations of the banks although the banks point to an evol ution of policies on environment that led up to the environmental assessment procedures most observers outside the banksand some inside them credit the pelosi amendment with getting the process startedfirst at the world bank and then in the other mdbs and creating incentives forenvironmental assessments and related mitigation and planning httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs31 from the perspective of those who see all or most loan proposalswhose major focus is on overall bank performance not environment per seit seems apparent thatas one of them put it pelosi worked they see change in project preparation thatreflects the institutionalization of environmental procedures satisfactoryimplementation of these procedures and internalization of the need forenvironmental screening and analysis on the part of mdb managers moreoveraccording to many observers the inclusi on of environmental concern in scoping projects deciding on project location or design and the responsiveness toenvironmental concerns from outside the mdbs have all improved however from the perspective of those who are concerned primarily about environmental issues and whose attention is mainly on projects where environmentalproblems may still remain there are continuing problems with adequacy of analysisand with various elements of environm ental assessment such as participation analysis of alternatives etc from this perspective there is considerable reason for continuing concern about the adequacy of environmental analysis and incorporation of environmental issues into mdb decisionmaking mdb reviews of their own performance the world bank has developed great deal of experience in environmental assessment since its policy went into effect in 1989 and it has made extensive efforts to candidly evaluate the ea experience in the bank in two late1996 evaluations the bank found adherence to its policiesalong with problems remaining in several areas discussed in the section on theworld bank comparable evaluations have been done by the other mdbs and their experience is generally over shorte r time period because their environmental assessment policies were adopted later than that of the world bank however areview of pelosi votes and comments by obs ervers indicate that many similar issues and problems affect the environmental assessment process across all the mdbs critical role of task managers task managers vary considerably in their attitudes toward the incorporation of environmental issues into the project designprocess some have tendedand some reportedly still continueto viewenvironmental concerns as an unwelcome obstacle and will accept relativelyinadequate eas or analyses unless challe nged by other bank staff concerned citizens or treasury officials when approached by concerned us officials or ngos their cooperation may be problematic in addressing such problems however there are other task managers who are interested in assuring environmental soundness and take the view th at this is important to the success of the project when problems are brought up task manager with this approach is more likely to try to investigate problems and find remedies the world bankevaluations acknowledge that training for bank staff on environmental issues and concerns has been insufficient and needs to be broadened and spread throughout the staff the situation is likely to be similar at the other mdbs inadequate integration of assessments into project design one of the stated goals of most mdb environmental assessment policies is that environmentalconcerns should be addressed early in the project preparation process andenvironmental protection goals should be inte grated into project design both world bank evaluations found that environmental assessments often were completed toohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs32 late to have the desired influence on project design the need to upstream the environmental analysis and to integrate it into the project design remains majorchallenge at the banks effect of categorization on assessment procedures because category projects are almost by definition large projects with potentially seriousenvironmental effects they receive most of the scrutiny given to mdb projects by the banks by us officials and by ngos the mdbs use different terms for their categories but category is the one most commonly used for those needing full eia all parties cite their own scarce resources in describing their tendency toconcentrate on projects the category serves as red flag indicatingwhich projects need to be watched for qua lity of analysisand for conformance with pelosi amendment requirements on timing of information availability some 20 orso category projects come up for vote each year at the world bank for this reason the move by the idb to eliminate ll categories is viewed with concern by those who depend upon the categories to fl ag projects with especially sensitive environmental aspects the treasury department also routinel reviews environmental information on projects its attention to b project s is much less systematic however again due to scarce resources it is the policy of the us government that any projectregardless of category that has significant potential environmental effects must havean appropriate environmental assessment in several cases especially in the early1990s b projects were subject to pelosi abstentions or votes because theylacked the necessary level of environmen tal assessment thus when problems with b or c projects are brought to the atten tion of the us agency officials either through the aid early warning process th rough ngo contacts or other means the us government will enter into inquiries and negotiations with the relevant bank toattempt to get improvements and adequate analysis see discussion in chapter iiibelow however it remains the case that ngos us government staff and the mdb environment staff continue to concentrate most of their efforts on the large category projects with less routine attention to category b some us government officials view with concern the possibility of ending categorization as the idb hasdone problems of categorization and miscategorization miscategorization can be problem there have been number of abstentions by the united states in votes on secondcategory projects because they did not have the more thorough and comprehensive environmental impact assessment that us officials thought theproject needed projects placed in the second category thereby receiving morelimited environmental analysis do not recei ve the more thorough analysis that some of them may deserve information available to the public about such projects ismuch more limited some projects placed in the thirdno impacts or ccategory may have subcomponents that have environmental impacts that many feel should be analyzedone recent example concerns health services projects that have medical wasteincineration elements opposed by local people or ngos on environmental groundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs33 yet having been placed in category c th ey do not receive environmental analysis ngos concerned about these health services projects point out serious health hazards associated with emissions from medical wa ste incinerators that are not designed to control such emissions because of th c category alternatives favored by environmental groups and local ngos have not received analysis or consideration in these cases the world banks 1993 environmental screening update to its environmental sourcebook notes that some aspects of cate gory c project may have environmental impacts it states not all category c projects are entirely devoid of environmental impacts for example in health project the design may have to provide for disposal of medical wastes however the update does not go on to state how or if such components would be treated in terms of assessing impacts or whether someenvironmental assessment would then be re quired thus the medical waste disposal components of larger health projects have not always been assessed or alternatives examined despite concerns raised by ngos about harmful toxic emissions andenvironmental impacts of incineration categorization usually occurs at very early stage of the project identification process it is uncommon for bank to change category once it has beendetermined especially to one requiring more extensive environmental assessment or analysis in some cases this is tr ue even in the face of extensive urging by treasury andor ngos concerned about the project bank officials and critics alike acknowledge tendency toward oversubscription in the second environmentalcategory but it should be noted that system atic analysis of this concern has been made by the us government changes in environmental organization and procedures the current period continues to be one of extensive change several of the banks are reformulating their environmental policies as discussed in sections above on the individual banks insome cases this involves potentially major shifts in resources and in approachbecause of the current changes underway some not yet finalized the experience todate is more instructive as to the proce ss and what has been achieved so far than as guide to future outcomes once new policies take effect at the same timeproblems of miscategorization inadequate analysis bureaucratic inertia and other general problems appear deepseated and are likely to persist absent fundamentalshifts in lending philosophy that have yet to become operative project oversight evaluation and the approval process impact of us opposition on the approval of mdb loans the pelosi amendment has been invoked on numerous occasions albeit on small minority ofprojects considered by us executive dir ectors in all the mdbs with statements by directors explaining us opposition sometimes it is because of lack ofsubstantive analysis on important environmental aspects of proposed loan orbecause of lack of the 120day lead time befo re vote in virtually every case the proposed project has won board endorsement with few or directors from other countries joining the united states in its concerns and the projects have gone aheadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs34 staff of the us executive director at the world bank report that recently there has been more interest in environmental concerns among other eds who noware more inclined to join in the process of inquiring about environmental issues that have surfaced through us government or ngo processes they do not usuallyshare us concerns about the 120day dead line for information availability but they are more likely to join in substantive i nquiries and concern over the need for better analysis or mitigation effect of behind the scenes negotiations prior to invoking the pelosi amendment and in many other cases where it is not invoked the us treasurydepartment the us executive directors ffice the us agency for international development andor the environmental protection agency may have determined thata project has problems in these cas us officials will have conducted investigations andor entered into negotiati ons with the bankfirst to get additional information and then to try to get satisf actory remedy in some cases us officials and ngos indicate improvements are made as result of these discussions but the process is very ad hoc and these behi nd the scenes negotiations are not formally documented concerns about the adequacy of environmental analysis t h r i s widespread agreement that there has been significant improvement in meetingprocedural requirements in mdb policies on environmental screening andassessment as well as in institutional capacity among borrowers and consultantsinvolved however problem projects continue to be identified by bank critics inwhich the adequacy of analysis is challenged the world bank env and oedevaluations agree that analysis of alternatives is continuing area of difficulty aswell as targeting the need for remedying in sufficiencies in bank staff training and knowledge in the ea area some large assessments are done on rapid appraisal track sometimes in six weeks timeframe that many experts feel is too fast to allow appropriate datacollection and analysis or appropriate consultation with the public in the affectedareas moreover experts in us agencies have sometimes identified major gaps inimpact analysis such as lack of analysis of downstream impacts of dam projects at present it appears that neither the banks nor the us government have been able to establish mechanism for quality control that would consistently identify and rectify poor quality environmental analysis eias as benchmarks during implementation environmental problems continue to arise as the banks implement projects following their approval theexistence of an environmental assessment ma provide benchmark that is of critical value when problems arise the establis hment of the world bank inspection panel in 1994 arose out of implementation concerns recent preliminary investigations by the panel substantiate complaints that environmental and social elements includedin loan agreements are not always carried out according to one observer it can too often be the case that once loan is pproved the bank in question considers the matter closed and moves on to other thi ngs with little ongoing supervision and little effort to assure that environmenta l and other conditions or requirements are being met however bank staff point out that effective supervision requireshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs35 intensive environmental staff work and that the environment staff has been cut back in recent years as part of overall bank budgetary constraints the role and impact of ngos key role in the evaluation process according to us officials non governmental organizations play key role in the process of identifying environmental concerns in mdb projects and evaluating the quality of eas the treasury and other agency staff work to obtain environmental improvements in bank projects but these staff are few in num ber and cannot monitor all mdb projects on systematic basis they are highly dependent upon notification andor feedbackfrom ngos to identify projects with poten tial problems and to document the nature of problems in the field government st aff are both dependent on and responsive to ngos as has been the case since treasury first began tracking environmentalaspects of mdb operations in the mid to late 1980s this is an example of howgovernment and privatengo actors can work synergistically however thedownside is that the process is essentia lly ad hoc with effective work done on the relatively few projects that are identified as problems and become the focus ofintensive activity but little or attention to others that may also be problematic the process also is heavily dependent on the capability of ngo staff who volunteer their services to assistand pressurethe government and the banks to take action on the problems they perceive and document also as noted belowwhile eas of category projects are available and of value it is less clear how accessible and useful the less extensive analyses for category b projects are environmental assessments and public dialogue ngo spokesmen say that the existence of environmental assessmentse specially in context that provides for public accesshas proven to be very valu able to the proce ss of tracking mdb activity to identify and work to remedy environmental problems the eas provide documentation and data on project plans and environmental aspects of them andthey establish the need for mitigation op tionsoften written into loan documents as conditions covenants or requirementst hat can be tracked during implementation there is broad consensus that the pelosi amendment with its requirements for theea and for public availability of environm ental information has been instrumental in enhancing opportunities for public participation and dialoguehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs36 prepared by jonathan sanford analys t

introduction the pelosi amendment seeks to strengthen the environmental standards for multilateral development bank mdb projects by making information on mdboperations available to the public in timel fashion it says the united states may support mdb loans that are likely to have significant effect on the environmentonly if an environmental impact assessm ent or comprehensive summary of such an assessment is available to the us government and the public at least 120 days prior to the loans being considered by the mdbs executive boards this chapterexamines the mdbs policy statements regarding public access to information notingin particular their requirements for disseminating information and the proceduresused to put them into effect the chapter examines the project descriptionsenvironmental analyses and other relevant documents issued by the banks asample of each type of document fo r each bank was obtained from their public information systems and the contents were compared with the guidelines set forth in the banks policies on the disclosure of information the analysis is based oninterviews with staff from the mdbs and us government agencies andrepresentatives from various nongovernmental organizations ngos field visit to salvador and honduras provided insi ghts into the ways banks procedures for public access to information work in practice 36 b general characteristics of the disclosure process as result of the pelosi amendment and persistent us pressure all the mdbs have adopted or are in the process of dopting procedures giving the public access to information about their plans and ope rations previously the multilateral banks operated under confidentiality ground rules th at limited the amount of information outsiders could obtain about their procedures or operations beginning in 1989however with the adoption of the world banks environmental assessmentprocedures the mdbs began to adopt procedures making environmental assessmentsavailable to the public and member country governments prior to their executiveboards consideration of proposed loans in 1993 at the urging of the united states and with the concurrence of other member countries the world bank approved new information disclosure procedures giving the general public expanded access to certain kinds of information about bankhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs37 37world bank the world bank policy on disclosure of information washington dc the world bank march 1994 p 2 policy and operations also with strong us encouragement the asian development bank adb and interamerican development bank idb adoptedsimilar guidelines in 1994 the internati onal finance corporation ifc approved somewhat more limited procedures in 1995 the european bank for reconstructionand development ebrd implemented procedures resembling those of the worldbank and the ifc in 1996 in july 1996 top management of the african development bank afdb proposed draft policy on information disclosure that was less extensive and lessopen than those currently used by the ot her mdbs with the strong encouragement of the united states the afdb held symposium for ngos in december 1996 to discuss the draft policy and other key issues of concern to african ngos according to the treasury department new draft in formation policy similar to those currently in use at the other mdbs has been sent to ngos and member country governments for their comment generally the mdb procedures provide more and prompter access to information on mdbfinanced projects when government is the borrower or theguarantor for loan for reasons related to concerns about proprietary businessinformation less information is made availa ble to the public and that information is provided at later stage in the mdb deliberation process when the borrower is aprivate organization and the loan is not officially guaranteed c rationale for public disclosure in 1994 publication explaining its new information disclosure policy the world bank said it recognizes and endorses the fundamental importance ofaccountability and transparency in the development process accordingly thedocument reported it is the banks policy to be open about its activities and towelcome and seek out opportu nities to explain its work to the widest possible audience 37 the policy applies to the banks two largest components the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd and theinternational development association ida the world bank cited several justifications for its new policy broader distribution of information would help expand public understanding and support for development activities it argued the dissemination of information to local groupsand nongovernmental organizations would facilitate their participation in bankfinanced projects the bank said this would strongly enhance the effectiveimplementation and sustainability of thos projects finally it reported increased openness would help keep the bank accountable to its stockholders strengthen itsrelationship with its bondholders and improve its staffs understanding

created public information center pic as principalcontact for people seeking to obtain bank documents the bank directed that the staff should prepare variety of documents describing projects in the

effectiveness of their operations and improve accountability the idb and adb echo the world bankspresumption in favor of disclosure the idb states in its policy statement thatabsent specific reason to the contrary any bank policies which affect the controlof bank information should be interpreted as permitting public release of theinformation 39 the adb notes in its policy on disc losure that there

the policy it suggests the bank should instill amongits staff presumption in favor of disclosure of information in the absence ofcertain specified constrains 40 the institutions whose activities focus pr imarily on the private sector put more emphasis on the need for confidentiality the ebrd says its policy is based on thepresumption that whenever possible information concerning the banks operationalactivities would be made available to th public in the absence of compelling reason for confidentiality 41 the ifc has more reservations its policy statement says there is presumption in favor of disclosure where disclosure would notmaterially harm the business and competitive interest of clients 42 management at the african development bank recommended in its march 1997 policy

began listing summaries on its page in september 1996but the coverage is currently incomplete treasury officials suggest this may stemfrom the fact that the ebrd policy is not retroactive and from the greater confidentiality the ebrd accords to private sector projects afdb management says the afdb shoul d use similar procedure once the afdb formally adopts new information disclosure policy and once the afdb isfully connected to the internet reportedly scheduled for late 1997 its prospectiveproject briefs ppb will be available from its public information center at least 6months prior to the

effects world bank officials report that few if any sepa rate analyses for ida projects have been filed the world bank information disclosure policy also says that environmental data sheets for all

that more scrutiny will be given to category b projects which have special components that may cause additional environmental impacts56 project sponsors will be required to do additional environm

executive board at least 120days before board consideration howe ver the rules also say adb management may reduce the time period or block any re lease if it decides commercial conditions require that information should be rel eased publicly before the proposal goes to the board the rule proposed by afdb management in its february 1997 draftpolicy does not mention any similar limita tion on the release of eia studies for private sector loans it does indicate however that information on private sectorprojects including environmental categoriza tions will be available to the public 30 days

later agreed that sensitive or confidential portions of those papers should be removed prior topublication f information not available to the public several types of information on mdb activity are not accessible the proceedings of the banks boards of execu tive directors are not available for example this includes statements and votes by members of the boards text ofresolutions or documents prepared for consideration of the boards or similarinformation they chose not to release however individual executive directors can release information on their own votes and statements if they choose similarly internal documents reports or memoranda prepared by bank staff or by outside advisers for use in its internal decisionmaking process are not available to outsiders executive directors representatives of member country governmentsand the public operations evaluation reports on particular activities projectevaluation reports on projects currently under implementation recommendations or determinations about proposed projects information on some bank financial management operations or current procurement bidding and other similar data areconsidered confidential and not circulated access to information received on ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs51 confidential basis from borrowers countries or other financial institutions is similarly restricted the world bank idb and adb have established independent panels with authority to investigate whether the banks have complied with their established policies and procedures in specific situations at the world bank it is called theinspection panel at the idb and adb re spectively they are called the independent investigation mechanism or inspection committee private citizens groups or others may appeal to these panels for assistance if they believe they have been adversely ffected because bank failed to follow its own policies or procedures on bankfunded project if the world bank idb oradb executive board believe sufficient complaint has been made it may ask theindependent panel to study the problem the panels have full authority to interviewbank staff or management hold hearings conduct field inspections and examine all relevant bank files or information the pa nels file their reports with the banks executive boards however board action is required in specific period of time and the guidelines specify that the banks shall release these reports to the public within two weeks seven days for the adb and fifteen days at the idb of board action the independent panel procedure is not device for releasing internal bank communications and confidential data pub licly the world bank guidelines specify that documents of confidential nature will not be released by the panel without the express written consent of the party concerned the idb guidelines say the panel shall maintain the confidentiality of any information to which it has access but which is required by bank policies to be confidential nevertheless confidentialinformation can be communicated to the banks executive boards and the panels can make findings based on that information without revealing it publicly theprocedure seems to suggest that actions by the world bank idb or adb staff ormanagement that violate their institutions declared policies cannot be hidden frompublic view simply on account of the banks rules concerning confidentiality g limitations of the current disclosure procedures availability spokesmen for nongovernmental organizations indicate dissatisfaction with the adequacy of in formation disclosed by the banks for example they report that mdb resident missions mdb offices located in borrower countries have declined to supply ngo re questors with copies of eia studies or other project information that should be available publicly the used office at the adb says this has never happened at th asian bank spokesmen for other mdbs admit that some of their local personne l are not familiar enough with the new bank policies they acknowledge that more work needs to be done to attune them withthe new procedures some of the ngo reports about noncooperation by mdbcountry offices are quite recent there are indications that ngos in bo rrower countries may not be relying on mdb country offices for information on pending projects the idb offices inhonduras and salvador indicated for ex ample that they had received relatively few requests from local groups for environmental information on proposed projectsan ngo in salvador reported that its people had to travel to washington dchttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs52 to obtain information on world bank project of particular concern the world bank has office in salvador though it does have regional office in costa rica on the other hand staff report and interviews with ngos and municipalofficials in the two countries affirm that the mdbs often require prospective borrowers to consult widely with local groups and communities about environmentaland other issues during the project preparation process in honduras for examplelocal ngos were major source of environmental data for several idb projects to publicize and distribute information th mdbs rely heavily on the internet many ngos argue that this places an undue burden on local groups andorganizations spokesmen for local ngos in salvador and honduras told theauthor in september 1996 for example that they lack the funds and capacity to use the internet many developing countries have only been recently connected to theinternet via local networks see box on th following page telephone service is often very expensive and undependable and many users must pay longdistancecharges to connect with internet providers inside their country the ngos claim that local mdb offices have not been willing despite claims to the contrary byheadquarters officials to allow local ngos or communities to use their networkconnections to access information from th banks public information centers mdb spokesmen say that network connections will improve in most countries in the futureand the internet is the fastest and most costeffective method available for theworldwide distribution of information on their operations some mdb officials argue that it woul d be wrong to slow the pace of mdb operations by requiring the physical distribution of printed material to localrequestors because some local ngos lack the resources to subscribe to internetservices ngos say it is mistake to use technical fixes that are beyond theorganizational and financial capabilities of most potential beneficiaries both points have supporters but they argue from different perspectives the internet is an inexpensive way for the mdbs to disseminate information but it iscurrently an expensive way for private citizens and ngos in developing countriesto receive that information many developing countries lack effective internetservice and the service often costs more than most private citizens and most ngos can afford to pay see box governments ar sometimes reluctant to see private use of the internet expand because of concern about implicit challenges to their authority caused by the free flow of information and id eas foreign cultural influence security or the loss of revenue from their current telecommunications setup often the local networks in developing countries are connected only through intermediaries ineurope or north america this increases their cost and decreases their flexibilityin dollar terms the cost of internet serv ice is often higher in lowincome countries than in middle income countries this is pa rticularly so if relative income levels are taken into account the number of users par ticularly private or nonofficial users connected to the internet most developing countries is relatively small by worldstandards in subsaharan africa according to one expert those countrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs53 internet service in developing countries availability and cost most developing countries have some access to the internets world wide web though in some the extent and scope of the available service is limited many poor countries however lack internet connections in asia at least10 countries have connectivity these include afghanistan bhutanburma cambodia laos kiribati nort h korea solomon islands tajikistan and vietnam for the most part the mdbs do not have large loan programsin these countries on the other hand the world banks loan program in subsaharan africa is large and comprises substa ntial share of its concessional lending operations nevertheless at least 18 countries of the region have public internet connections these include burundi cape verde chad congodjabuti eretria equatorial guinea

internet providers score the least density of local connectivity in the world60 if the mdbs want to use the internet as their principal means for channeling information to the public they might help ngos in developing countries make more effective use of the medium61 in most countries the mdbs use leased lines to connect their resident missions electronica lly to their headquarters offices at little additional cost to themselves the banks c ould set up work stations in their country offices where ngos scholars and other ppropriate members of the public could connect via the internet to the banks public information centers or to other sourcesof information on development issues this need not hamper the work of the bankslocal personnel the mdbs would need to be sure that their local representatives understand and comply with their policies regarding public access to mdbinformation as discussed in chapter i the mdbs require full environmental assessment of projects only when they believe they might have substantial effect on the environment the decision whether project meets this standard is made at thebeginning of the process and is based on criteria set forth in the banksenvironmental assessment procedures and the professional judgment of bank staff mdb project officers have principal voice in the categorization process thedecision is not subject to appeal by out siders or member country governments generally projects environmental category is not reassessed or changed as itmoves through the review process httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs55 62for the world bank the sample examined all projects listed in the mos and pic data base for the first ten countries alphabetical order in each of the banks operational regions for the idb the projects listed in the pipeline document and pic data base for the first ten countries were scrutinized for the ebrd th projects for all countries in both sources were compared ngos and others argue that many projects with potentially significant environmental effects are given lower rating category b rather than in theworld bank system for example to avoid the delay that would likely be caused by preparation of full eia the banks study the potential environmental effects ofcategory b projects but in these cases thei r analyses are generally less extensive and the amount of information provided to the public is generally less than that availablefor full eias some mdbs provide minimal information to the public on theanalysis of environmental implications of category b projects confidence in the banks system for environmental categorization could be enhanced if the decision making system were more transparent and autonomousalso procedures might be adopted allowing the public or member countrygovernments to provide formal input during the categorization process or to appeal categorization decisions to the banks insp ection panels or their executive boards for reconsideration completeness of the banks lists of pending projects the world bank ebrd and idb have two main vehicles for informing the public about prospectiveprojectstheir monthly operational summaries or pipeline list and their projectinformation documents or project list ne ither seems to be complete description of all the projects currently under review at these banks projects may be discussed on the pipeline list but not on the project list or vice versa see table 2 belowcomparison of the two lists for the world bank showed that 40 of the projects in the sample 62 were listed only in the mos 20 we re listed solely in the project list pids on the world bank internet page nd 40 were listed in both sources there was more overlap in the idb and less overlap in the ebrd reporting systems the two systems have different goals the project pipeline list was originally intended to keep bank officials informed bout the status of pending projects it is also used to keep businesses informed about future procurement opportunities at thebanks the project summaries are designed to inform the public about the detailsincluding possible environmental effects of prospective projects projects the project pipeline lists for th ebrd and idb are available from their internet web pages the adb uses its list of potential pr ojects as its pipeline list it does not have separate list of projects currently in its project

bank and idb first 10 countries in each group only neither system seems to provide comprehensive and uptodate source of information on prospective mdb projects the mdb project development process can be quite lengthy typically one or tw years but sometimes longer and project concepts and specifics can change substan tially during this process projects are entered in the project pipeline document when country first expresses interest ina loan and the idea takes shape little detailed information is provided about them in the pipeline list nevertheless the pipeline list is published well before anyinformation about the planned project is available for distribution through the banks public information centers considerable amount of work will have taken placeand firm decisions may have been made regarding the shape direction andenvironmental categorization of the project before project information document is ready for distribution through banks pic the banks differ in this regard the world bank mos often says for example that identification missions or appraisal missions may visit country even though pid has yet appeared for the project in stion the mos sometimes says that the pid will not be written until specific actions have taken place the used office at the adb reports on the other hand that the pids for potential adb projects are written before fact finding mission visits its borrower countries this suggests that the adb makes its environmental categorizations before its staff inspect theprospective projectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs57 projects may occasionally go through most or all their development process without their being publicly identified several instances might be cited at the world bank loan for secondary education in sumatra indonesiawas approved by the executive board in september 1996 even though pidseemed to be available to the public the world bank executive board alsoapproved poverty alleviation loan for bangladesh on september 17 1996though the date of preparation for the pid for that loan was two days later at the idb the pipeline document for october reported that an urbandevelopment loan for bolivia was scheduled for board consideration infebruary 1997 though project information document was then availableat the pic the same document said an energy efficiency project forcolombia was scheduled for board ac tion in middecember 1996 the pid for this loan seems to have appeared on the pic menu in november at the time of its appearance environmental classification had yet been made forthe loan at the ebrd all 32 projects on the pipeline list for december 1996 wereinfrastructure projects with official public sector borrowers for 9 of theseconsideration by the executive board was the next step in the process projectinformation documents were available fo r only three of them commercial or private sector projects were shown on the ebrd pipeline list in fact an examination of the project information documents available from the ebrdpublic information center suggested that threefifths of the loans underconsideration by the ebrd mostly private sector projects were not shown on its pipeline list the adb does not issue both project list and pipeline list in effect it uses its pipeline document as its list of pendi ng projects unlike the world bank and idb it does not publish one document listing the proposals it is contemplating andanother showing in more detail the draft projects it is actually preparing for boardreview projects are listed in the adb web pages list of projects when they have received concept clearance presumably step comparable to the approval of aninitial executive project summary at the wo rld bank there is way of knowing how many potential projects the adb has under consideration that have not yetreached this stage of development as noted earlier 40to50 of the projects in the world bank or idb monthly operational summaries most of them at the earlystages of identification or conceptualization are not listed in those banks lists ofprojects in active preparation if similar situation pertains at the adb then noinformation is available from its pic on significant share of the projects the adb staff has under consideration projects often remain in both the proj ect pipeline document and the pic project information menu for several months after they have been approved by banksexecutive board they may even continue to be listed on the pic project information after they have been removed from the pi peline list according to the world bank this often occurs when task managers do not submit staff assessment report tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs58 63the reasons why bank staff did not submit sars to the pic are not clear the pic says in its description of its functions that certain types of projects structural adjustmentoperations technical assistance loans emergency loans do not have an sar world bankpublic information center p 7 however the instances in the sam ple where pid remained in the pic system after the loan had been approved do not seem to be of this sort thebanks information disclosure policy says that country director may restrict release of ansar in exceptional cases where extensive i ssues of confidentiality arise world bank the world bank policy on disclosure of informati on p 6 the instances in the sample did not seem to fit this criterion 64the environmental analysis of category b project whether it is separate document or is contained in relevant section of the sa r is attached as an annex to the pid and is publicly available through the pic the world bank policy on disclosure of informationp 8the pic63 the project information document is then kept in the system as source of data in lieu of the sar and notation is placed on the pid list to that effect if projects are not listed in the pipelin outsiders cannot easily monitor their progress or ascertain their likely schedule pipeline documents may be difficult to use for this purpose anyway since except for the project summaries reported by the adb none of them show dates one cannot tell how long prospective project has been under consideration or when the last action on the proposal occurred most mdb project information documents have dates showing when they were entered into the pic data base the wo rld bank and ebrd show when the pid was originally prepared and when it was update d the pids for the other banks often have indication whether they have b een updated the dates on pids are often months or even year or more old some times as at the idb there are dates on project summary documents availability of environmental information the environmental data available to the public from the mdbs are neither as complete nor as extensive as the banks disclosure policies might lead one to expect the banks all have or anticipate having procedures giving the public access to the full text or detailed summaries of the eias for all prosp ective projects with major category environmental effects their procedures for informing the public about the possible environmental effects of category b project s are often considerably less extensive availability of inform ation world bank the world bank indicates in its information disclosure policy statement that staff assessments of the likelyenvironmental effects of category b project s should be attached as annexes to the project information documents distributed by its public information center 64 inspection shows that this rarely occurs sample of 17 pids for category bprojects on four continents selected for this inquiry showed that only one had anenvironmental annex copy of the envir onmental data sheet attached in the body of each pid brief paragraph mentioned nvironmental issues in 11 of the 17 the paragraph said the project raised nvironmental concerns though by definition since all were category b projectssome environmental issues must have existedone said for example that the project was not expected to result in any significant negative environmental impact and has been rated category b three of the 17httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs59 65ibid p 7pids mentioned potential environmental concerns in general terms three others provided some detail or specific references to possible environmental issues andprospective remedies pid for small south american country selected at random during this inquiry had environmental rating and environmental paragraph the textmentioned however that the project would fund among other things solid wastedisposal and construction of marketplaces and slaughterhouses in secondary towns it also mentioned plans to expand and upgr ade the network of allweather roads in rural areas road improvements of this sort sometimes have led to migration intopreviously inaccessible or marginal forest lands the world bank distributes environmental data sheets for many of its projects through its public information centers these are potentially useful documents they ask the staff to list the major envi ronmental issues and other environmental issues likely to arise in the project and th actions the staff proposes for dealing with those issues they also ask the staff to specify the reporting schedule for action along this line environmental data sheet s are supposed to be prepared and updated quarterly for each project in the bank lending program the world bank reports 65 the quality of the environmental data sheets currently available from the world bank pic is uneven generally for category projects substantial body ofinformation is provided this information would have been generated previouslyin the eia study for the project for cat egory b projects however the content of environmental data sheets is more mixed in random sample of 22 sheets forcategory b projects selected for this study 10 indicated that the project had noenvironmental implications most limited themselves to describing the projectcomponents or goals one health project said the only environmental issue had to do with the disposal of toxic medical waste though it gave indication how thebank planned to deal with the question transportation project for baltic country said there are negative environmental issues other than the emission of fumes and waste from the asphalt mixing plants it did not say wh at steps might be contemplated to deal with this detail five of the environmental data sheets discussed possible environmental risks and countermeasures in general terms some were projects in the early stages ofpreparation for which little detail was likel available seven sheets provided catalog of likely environmental risks and description of the steps planned tocounter them there is little evidence that the envir onmental data sheets in the world bank system are updated quarterly many had old dates and said that issues would beaddressed during future period which often seems to be well before the date injanuary 1997 when crs drew the data from the system often the estimated dateswhen the projects will come before the executive board are several calendar quartersold if environmental sheets are out of da they are of little use to persons outside or inside the banks who are monitoring th formulation or implementation processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs60 they are also of little use to bank staff members who are responsible for developing procedures to mitigate potentially negative environmental effects the coverage also falls far short of th banks statement that the data sheets include all projects in the bank lending progr am the only data sheets available are for projects currently under consideration or recently approved data sheetsare provided for projects approved earlier where money is still being disbursed eventhough these projects are still in the bank lending program outsiders have nosystematic way of knowing what new envir onmental concerns or actions might have arisen since these projects were initially approved the regional scope of the system is limited in january 1997 environmental data sheets were available from the pic for only some of the projects beingconsidered or implemented by the bank these included 117 in subsaharan africa 41 in east asia 17 in south asia 78 in europe and central asia 28 in the middle east and north africa and 69 in latin am erica the bank had many more projects under consideration or in the early stages of implementation at that time availability of information idb for category iv projects which are deemed most likely to have substantial effect on the environment borrowers are required to prepare an eia and release it to the public early in the idb project cycle copies may be obtained from the banks pic category iv projects at the idb are the functional equivalent of category pr ojects in the world bank in april 1997 26 eias were available from the idb ma ny of these have been approved by the idb executive board and are longer pending the idb staff prepares environmental briefs or environmental reports for pending projects deemed likely to have significant though remediable effect on the environment these are category iii and ii projects roughly equivalent to the world banks category b operations the idbs environmental reports for category iiiprojects are very detailed often running to 11 or 12 pages in length those for category ii projects are generally shorter and less detailed in january 1997 the author examined the 67 projects then under consideration for argentina brazil and mexico ninet een environmental reports were on file 14 for category iii and 5 for category ii project s seven category iii projects had environmental report category iv pr

for category ii projects one project had an environmental report but environmental classification two category iii projects d environmental briefs one category iv project was identified environmental report was available but someinformation on its likely environmental impact was included in the projectdescription many of the projects surveyed in january and april 1997 seemed to be the kinds of projects that would have received cat egory b rating in some other mdbs many projects for port or highway construction velopment of sanitation systems water resource development and similar activities

critical information in particular many stressed the need for detailed explanation of th potential environmental and socialimpact of prospective projects many also said th pids needed to explain more

documentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs63 bic what information should be included in pids the bank information center recommended in 1995 that pids issued by the multilateral banks should include the following kinds ofinformation pids should identify the individuals and key agencies with primary responsibility for the project including their name andphone number for projects still being negotiated pids should name the individuals and agencies negotia ting on behalf of the borrower pids should show the name address and phone number for the mdb task manager responsible for the prospective project pids should show at the outset the projects environmental category pids should identify the groups most affected by the prospective project including names and addresses pids should indicate which non governmental organizations or individuals had been consulted during the preparation of theproject and they should inform readers about ways they canparticipate in the consultative process pids should indicate the specific location of the prospective project and not merely list the province or general locale pids should discuss the background and context for the project pids should explain the rationale for bank involvement in project pids should provide full explanation of the projects risks and not just discuss the major concerns pids should be translated into the predominant local language in the borrower country rather than being available only inenglish pids should provide full description of the planned project only sensitive or confidential in formation in the ieps should

project information documents from the world bank were originally supposed to be two pages in length following criticism by ngos and others about excessive brevit bank management decided in late 1993 to relax the length limits on pids69 the pids currently issued by the bank are now more detailed and informative running in th sample used for table 3 an average five of pages each single spaced small type most show the organizationresponsible for implementing the project though often the name of the responsible person was not included generally however even though many projects were inthe negotiating stage the pids did not i ndicate which agencies or individuals were negotiating on behalf of the borrower li kewise in many cases pids did not show which unit or individual at the bank was responsible for the projects thesedeficiencies can be an impediment to persons seeking further information about aproject the documents distributed by the bank pi c all seem to be in english the bank reports that its country offices in russia bulgaria india bangladesh brazil and cote divoire are translating pids fo r local projects into local languages effort was made by the congressional research service to determine if thesetranslations have taken place or if the resulting documents ar available to local users in most but not all cases world bank pids indicate somewhere in the text what the environmental category is for th proposed project very rarely however is this shown at the outset world bank pids generally provide substantial review of the background and context for the proposed loan though they rarely explain whythe world bank is involved with the project also very rare is any indication that ngos or affected groups were consulted during the loan preparation processoccasionally pids indicated what groups might be affected by the project though as with information on consultations further identification is shown pids didnot indicate how ngos or other members of the public could participate in theconsultative process most pids emphasized the likely benefits of the proposedprojects none provided what seemed comp rehensive review of the likely risks or adverse effects most pids indicated the location for the proposed project though none included maps specifying the exact site howeve r for projects with broad geographic distribution or with an institutional or sectoral focus the location for the activitiesfunded by the loan was often not indicated full texts of staff appraisal reports s ars for projects approved by the world bank may be ordered an abstract is also available for most projects from the picweb page according to world bank staff the country desks sometimes decide not to submit sar abstracts to the pic in those cases the pids for approved projects are left in the system sar abstracts provide oneparagraph summary of thecomponents and purposes of the project in only one of the 12 abstracts surveyed however was there any indication of the am ount of money the bank had lent for the project none revealed the environmental categorization only one noted anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs66 70for example according to us government and salvadoran sources the world bank approved loan in 1996 to improve the land regist ration system in salvador the original plan for the project included some policy s uggestions or comments by consultants which sought to encourage private ownership of land in order to strengthen the incentives andopportunities for higher production if farmer s owned individual parcels of land for instance they would have assets they could use as security to get loans to increase their productivity cooperatives often rely on gran ts or discount loans from government rather than commercial credit for such purposes campesino organizations and agricultural cooperatives saw these as efforts by the bank and government of salvador to break up cooperatives the project information document for this project prepared in february 1995 made mention of such goals or gave any i ndication that such issues had been raised see world bank public information center th original pid titled salvadorland administration project id svpa7174 prepared february 2 1995 was obtained from thepic by crs through special request an ex tensive survey of campesino and cooperative organizations and ngos in salvador duri ng field visit by crs in september 1996 found one who had seen the pid some had obtained the staff appraisal report howeverwhich contained the language that cerned the salvadoran organizations alerted to this concern representatives of the us government reportedly met withofficials of the bank and received assurances th at the table of policy recommendations and guidelines in the sar would not govern implem entation of the land tenure project this information was apparently never communicated back to the salvadoran organizations the sar abstract the world bank placed in the pic system did not address the issue the sar copies available from the pic are the same version that alarmed the salvadoranorganizations the government of salv ador persuaded its national assembly to pass legislation embodying some of the policy recommendations presented in the original sarthe government reportedly told salvadoran legislators that the world bank required adoption of those policies as condition of the land registration loan it is not clear whether the world bank intended to seek adoption of the policy guidelines notwithstanding its assurances to the us government or whether thoseguidelines were implemented solely at the initia tive of the salvadoran government it is clear however that the project was implemen ted in ways different from those the us government reportedly expected and the wo rld bank has been held responsible in salvadoran eyes for the new policy regime the banks information access system does nothing to clarify the situation or to show the banks actual objective in this situationenvironmental concerns to be addresse d none discussed other issues to be addressed in the projects once pids for approved projects are removed from the pic data base sar abstracts are the most detailed description of ongoing projects that outsiders mayobtain without incurring the 15 cost for the full sars sar abstracts are very concise they do not clarify issues or s how changes that may have occurred after the project was approved by the banks executive board 70 information in pids ifc the project summary documents for prospective ifc projects are concise and seem to follo w the original twopage model for world bank project information documents some examined for this survey were one page in length all the projects surveyed for this study identified the borrower and since the borrower negotiates on its own behalf the party negotiating on behalf of therecipient none identified the unit of th ifc or the ifc task manager responsible for the project all contained the types of project data the ifc said should be inthese documents see footnote 22 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs67 71these are found at httpwwwasiandevbankorgadbboadbbohtmlthe ifc project summary documents are sometimes vague as to the identity of the local partners the ifc disclosure po licy says this information will be included in these documents names are sometimes provided in many cases however the ifc documents say that certain number of unnamed local citizens will own the firm or they say that certain corporations would own stated shares of the projectcompanys stock in many countries the existing corporate registration procedures do not show clearly who the beneficial owners of corporation might be if thisinformation is not included in the ifc document the public may not be able toascertain it otherwise all the ifc project summaries examined for this survey had separate section discussing the projects environmental categorization and implications the categorywas not listed at the top of the report though in some cases the report being onepage in length the categorization was easily apparent the ifc project summaries and nvironmental reviews provided little background on the proposed project and ju stification for ifc involvement none discussed any consultation with ngos or local groups though three of the 12 project summaries mentioned in general terms th groups or types of persons likely to be affected by the undertaking four of the 10 environmental summary reports forcategory b projects provided some discu ssion of the broader risks or possible adverse implications the ifc does not release to the public c opies of the project documents which go to the world bank executive board when prospective projects are considered forapproval except for information provided in press releases and brief references in ifc annual reports detailed descriptions of ifc projects are available to thepublic once project is approved and the doc uments relevant to it are removed from the world bank pic data base information in pids adb the descriptions of projects not yet approved by the adb are very concise 71 none of the twelve lected at random were much longer than page in length and most were shorter the objectives and scope of the project are often stated in one paragraph another sentence shows its status in theproject preparation process the environmental category is one of the last entriesin some cases because of the shortness of the document it can be found in the top half of the page the adb task manager and the organization responsible forimplementing the project are always listed background for the project orrationale for adb involvement are usually shown nor is there any indication that any nongovernmental groups were consulted in one case the project description says poor people will be the beneficiaries in other cases there is identification of affected groups generally there is discussion of likely benefits or possible adverse effects from the projecthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs68 72these may be found at httpwwwasiandevbankorgprojectsprojlisthtml the office of the used at the adb says the bank may now be including on this list projects currently under preparation as of may 1997 the list did not show dates when projects had beenapproved by the adb executive board conse quently it was not possible to distinguish approved projects from those that were pending 73a crs survey of all 174 projects listed in may 1997 showed that one profile for project approved prior to 1997 in laos had been upda ted in 1997 two projects initially listed in 1993 one initially listed in 1994 and eleven orig inally listed in 1995 five of them in nepal had been updated in 1996 most profiles had not been updated since the year they went inthe systemconsiderably more information is ava ilable on projects already approved by the adb called project profiles these are av ailable from the adb web page and pic72 these are much lengthier documents they include discussions of the cost and financing arrangements for the project issu in the adb policy dialogue with the borrower environmental impact and mitiga tion measures social aspects and remedy measures target beneficiaries consultation with the public and participation bybeneficiaries in project implementation for some projects the entries in eachcategory may be more than sentence or two for others lengthy paragraph is provided projects are listed among the project profile s as long as they are in the process of implementation project profiles do not seem to be updated very often 73 they do not seem to include information about probl ems or new issues that emerge during the implementation process as device for informing the public about progressachieved in the implementation of projects they are not very useful adbmanagement and member country government s presumably have some other method for monitoring the implementation of proj ects previously approved by the executive board project profiles appear from their st ructure and content to be documents prepared for use by the bank during the pr oject preparation process in many respects they resemble the project info rmation documents issued by the world bank or project profiles released by the idb they appear to be information recordedbefore projects go to the executive board unlike the world bank or idb the adbdoes not put the information in this document online as it becomes available duringthe project preparation process information in pids idb the project summary documents project profiles for the idb provide considerable amounts of information on proposed projects the dozen idb summaries examined for this rvey averaged almost 5 pages single space small type in length one compri sed 12 and another 9 pages the project summaries and environmental reports in the sample were not dated so it isimpossible to determine the currency of the data they contain project summarydocuments are retired from the system on ce projects have been approved by the idb executive board the idb has documents comparable to the world bankquarterly environmental data sheets or adb project profiles for informing the public about projects in the implementation process httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs69 the documents available from the idb pic are usually available in the language of the borrower country however the project summaries in the sample for two brazilian loans were written in spanish and the environmental report for acolombian loan was written in english ot her project summaries or environmental reports not in the sample were in the local language most project summaries from the idb identify the agencies responsible for implementing the proposed project though fe w show the agencies responsible for the negotiations none of the 12 project summaries in the sample identified any of the key individuals involved only one identified the idb task manager almost half the idb summaries in the sample indicated somewhere near their top the environmental category for the proposed project most also provided asubstantial review of the background and context for the project and half providedsome rationale for idb involvement none mentioned any ngos or local groupsthat might have been consulted two of the 12 referred in general terms to groups likely to be affected by the project two provided an overview of the projects likely risks and implications the others were silent or very brief in their discussion ofpossible adverse effects from the project copies of project appraisal documents ma be purchased from the idb after the idb executive board approves loan the pic also provides twotothree pagesummary of the main points for each loan these generally include few paragraphs describing the purpose composition and sp ecific objectives of the project they also indicate what consultant services will be needed during the implementation of the project what goods and equipment are to be procured and what civil works willbe constructed persons familiar with the country or with the type of project under consideration might be able to mine this information for insights regarding theprojects likely scope and implications information in pids ebrd the project summary documents for loans being considered by the ebrd are generally one or two pages long depending whether summary environmental analysis is attached eleven project summaries weresurveyed by crs the agency or firm responsible for implementing the project wasalways shown but listing was provided fo r the ebrd task manager number is provided for all projects however where callers can initiate inquiries aboutpending projects the ebrd says that task managers can be reached through thatnumber if they are needed to provide further information the ebrd projectsummary documents show the environmental category only if summaryenvironmental analysis is attached the specific location for the project was generally indicated though this informati on was not provided for projects with broader institutional or geographic focus background or context or rationale for ebrd involvement was shown like wise there was discussion about consultations with ngos affected groups or the broader risks or benefits of the undertaking the ebrd also provides on its web page list of projects previously approved by the bank it identifies the borrower and the economic sector involved and it gives one sentence description of the undertaking information is given howeverhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs70 about its status of implementation or any problems or issues that might have arisen since the loan was approved the ebrd guidelines on public access and di sclosure of information say that after project has been approved by th ebrd executive board an edited copy of the board report loan document will normally be made available to the public onrequest it is not evident from the ebrd web page however how the public can request this information h mdb information access procedures evaluation and discussion 1 failure of documents to meet stated mdb goals the multilateral banks say in their policy statements on public access to information that their procedures are intended to inform the public about the content andpurpose of their pending operations increased public access toinformation about mdb projects is likewise intended to expand publicunderstanding and confidence in the multilateral agencies the project summaries and project docum ents available from the world bank and idb seem conducive to the achievement of these goals though as noted belowthey could be improved in several areas by contrast the project summariesavailable from the ifc adb and ebrd are either very concise or silent on issues of potential concern to outside observers on the whole these project summaries seem to fall short of the goals articulated in the ifc adb and ebrd policystatements on information access and public disclosure in many cases for all thebanks the project and environmental docum ents issued by the banks do not include information that the banks policy statements say they should include need for additional information one need not accept as necessary all the criteria suggested by the authors of the bic study and listed in table 3 however it seems reasonable that some background and context for the prospective project and rationale for bank involvement might be useful to outsiders and to mdb stockholders as well likewise it seems reasonable to expect that projectinformation documents will identify the pers ons at the borrower organization and the bank with principal responsibility for the prospective loan list of the ngos consulted for project might be counter productive and perhaps in some countries detrimental to the interests of the ngos themselves however some discussion ofthe groups likely to be affected by project and the overall risks and benefits mightbe useful both to the bank and to the public adb and ebrd too little information on pending projects the adb could enhance the effectiven ess of its information disclosure policy if it published separate list showing all the projects cu rrently under consideration at the bank and their status as with the monthly opera tional summaries of the world bank and idb the amount of detail provided in this pipeline document would not need to besubstantial but its comprehensive nature and its inclusion of projects in the earlieststages of consideration would enhance public confidence in the adb disclosureprocess separate list comparable to the one published on the adb web page could provide detailed information on projects that have received adb managementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs71 initial tentative approval this would parallel the current practice of the world bank and idb the ebrd would likewise enhance the u tility of its information disclosure system if it took steps to include more projects in its pipeline document and itsproject list the ebrd disclosure policy says that project summary documents are supposed to be listed as soon as they are prepared for public sector borrowers orat least 60 days before board action for private sector borrowers the ebrd does not seem to be adhering to either criteri on likewise the ebrd omits many private sector projects from its pipeline document pipeline document that lists onlyprojects which offer procurement opportunitie s may be useful to potential suppliers but it is not very useful to persons wishing to monitor the potential environmentalimpact of ebrd operations such list does not seem to comply with therequirements of the pelosi amendment side question arises as to whether the ebrd should fund projects where the international competitive bidding procedures do not apply and where procurementis limited in advance to certain providers inadequacy of environmental information in pids from all the banks written copies of the full environmental impact assessment can be obtained byrequest for category projects however only the world bank ifc idb andebrd make summary environmental analyses regularly available for category bprojects and these are often quite brief though less substantial in their anticipated impact category b projects by definition are expected to have significant effect on the environment the project informati on documents for category b projects would be more useful if they provided informa tion about the projects likely environmental effects and the steps planned to ameliorate those effects among other things thiswould help strengthen the readers confidence in the banks categorization system andin their judgment concerning the risks and benefits of prospective projects out of date documents the banks information access guidelines say that project summaries should be updated duri ng the preparation process as the project takes shape they also say that staff appraisal reports or other descriptions ofprojects previously approved by the banks should be updated if significant changes are effected in their plans often however the banks project information documentsreviewed by crs were undated or they carried dates that were several months orperhaps year old consequently it may be impossible for outsiders to know whether the information in those documents is current and if it represents the banks most recent thinking on those projects listing the dates for each update and the dates for each important benchmark would at least help the outside reader to monitor the status of the project preparation process unavailability of old project information the banks all retire their project information documents from their pic syst ems once the projects have been approved and summary staff appraisal report or project profile has been received sometimes however researchers may find they need copies of old projectinformation documents pids for example they may need to see whether issuesor problems that gained prominence during the implementation of project werediscussed in the pid prior to project appr oval crs encountered two such instances in the preparation of this report the world bank pic staff found that these old pidshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs72 were in an electronic archive and they provided crs with copies by special arrangement the mdbs would enhance public understanding if they created some mechanisms in their web pages giving the public access to old pids and otherrelevant documents or if they indicated that they were available upon request this information would be particularly useful to persons examining the projectimplementation process the mdbs could also facilitate bette r public understanding if they released more information about the implementation of projects they have already approved project information documents and environm ental impact assessments help predict what the effects of prosp ective projects might be the mdbs have effective vehicle however for informing the public or their member country governmentsabout the actual results of previously pproved projects the world bank quarterly environmental data sheets and the adb project profiles are efforts in this direction however they are not maintained in timely fashion and they do not seem toencompass information about new issu or problems encountered in the implementation process the pelosi amendment addresses the i ssue of public access to information about projects that have not yet approved by the banks it does not deal with thequestion of public access to information about projects as issues arise during theimplementation process or about the ultimate impact of projects once they have beenput into effect need for earlier availability of pids if the banks want to facilitate public information and public consultation in the project development process they might reexamine the timetable they use for their reports project information documentspids are the basic vehicles the banks use to inform the public about their prospective loans however these are ma available only after the bank staff and the borrower have reached agreement on the basic purposes and components of theprospective loan some information about projects in earlier stages of preparationcan be gleaned from the banks pipeline documents monthly operating summaryetc however the pids would be more useful if they were available to the public earlier in the project cycle while the basi c outlines and purposes of the projects are still under discussion need for more information on projects in early stages of preparation at any one time 40to50 of all the pr oposals under consideration by bank will be in the early stages of development this may be in fact the moment whenconsultation with ngos and local groups c ould have the most impact on the shape of the project the world bank and idb provide some information about projects in this stage of preparation in their m onthly operational summaries the other mdbs do not tell the public or their member country governments what projects they areconsidering until the project information documents have been written and bank staffhave given them an environmental cate gorization the banks could enhance the consultation process if they included more information in their pipeline documents about projects in the early stages of consideration alternatively as noted beforethey could issue their initial pid for project when it is still just an idea ie before bank management has agreed it should be potential candidate for assistance and before its environmental category has been determinedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs73 prepared by jonathan sanford analys t in international political economy foreign affairs and national defense division 74section 1307 of the international

after it was signed into law on december 19 1989 in april 1992 the treasurydepartment issued temporary rule establishing procedures the us governmentwould use to comply with the requirements of the amendment 75 the public was invited to comment on the temporary rule the 1992 temporary rule remains ineffect and has not been superseded by any newer rules regulations or administrative guidelines governing the implementation of the pelosi amendment or usparticipation in the mdbs treasury department officials say the rule is being followed albeit as one admitted rather loosely with the adoption of public disclosure policies and theestablishment of public information cen ters by the mdbs many of its provisions have been overtaken by events treasury has been waiting to establish final rule until the afdb adopts an information disclosu re policy comparable to those in force at the other mdbs afdb action on this score is expected in 1997 treasuryofficials say revision of the 1992 rule is currently underway in its preface to the 1992 rule the treasury department stated that the pelosi amendment requirement for us government and public review of proposed mdbactions is satisfied by circulating comp rehensive summary of an eia and making the full eia available upon request th primary purpose of the environmental assessment and comment process the department indicated is encouragement ofborrower countries to conduct wideranging and detailed environmentalassessment including consultation and full sharing of information with local nongovernmental organizations and affected parties the rule stated that the usgovernment will seek to encourage the mdbs to expand the consultative processand it will also work to ensure that the public will have direct access to eias and summaries thereof at the mdbs and in the borrowing countries without the usgovernments acting as intermediary the 1992 rule said the office of multilateral development bank affairs at treasury will assure that variety of us agencies and private organizationsconcerned with environmental issues w ill receive information on prospective mdb projects specifically mentioned were fi ve us government agencies the us environmental protection agency epa council on environmental quality ceq us agency for internationa l development usaid department of state national oceanic and atmospheric administration and one nongovernmental organization ngo the bank information center bic as noted in the previous chapter the latter is private ngo located in washington dc it is not an affiliate of the multilateral banks or their public information cen ters in particular the rule says the mdb office will see that the us agencies and bic receive copies of the relevant mdb project documents and eia summaries if copies of this information are not subsequently available to the public from bic the rule says members of the publicmay make arrangement to examine or copy the documents through the

indicated that documents can be viewed and copied at the treasury department library byarrangement if the world bank or idb do not have public reading room the two banks subsequently allowed public use of reading rooms the rule said that members of the pub lic may file written comments with the mdb office for any mdb documents they ve reviewed the public can make oral comments on prospective mdb projects i n the periodic meetings convened by bic 76 the rule indicated that treasury partment officials will summarize these written or oral comments and communicate them to the working group onmultilateral assistance wgma the interagency committee that coordinates uspolicy concerning prospective mdb loan the 1992 rule specified that if the wgma and treasury department believe prospective mdb project is likely to ve significant effect on the environment and they believe it has not received the appropriate environmental categorizationthey shall instruct the used at the rele vant bank to seek an upgrade upgrades would require the mdbs to do additional environmental assessments or analysesif the wgma and treasury believe project will have significant environmentaleffect but they believe full eia is not necessarily warranted the rule stipulatedthey are to obtain more information from the bank on the project examples citedwere the environmental chapters from feasibility studies or environmental datasheets the rule said treasury shall provi this material to the relevant us agencies and bic the 1992 rule said that treasury shall instruct the used at the bank to oppose project if this additional information does not provide an adequate basis for analyzing the environmental impact of the proposed project and alternativesto the proposed project public comments on the 1992 rule two comments were filed with treasury in response to the invitation for public co mment on the 1992 rule one was from the world bank the other was from the cent er for international environmental law ciel an ngo that focuses primarily on environmental issues though requested on several occasions the treasury depart ment and world bank did not provide crs with copy of the world banks comments on the rule the preface to the rule says that all comments will be available for public inspection the comments in 1992 by the center for international environmental law 77 said the coverage in the 1992 rule was too limited first it noted the rule covered only projects funded by the mdbs the pelosi amendment was considerablybroader ciel noted as it addressed whet her the united states could vote for any action proposed to be taken by the multila teral banks the proposed rule was too constrained ciel said as it ignored votes the useds might cast on mdb policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs76 guidelines or on policy reform or adjustment loans mdb policies and mdb adjustment loans might cause bank staff or borrowers to act in ways that would have negative environmental effect ciel argued it said the 1992 rule puts such mdbactions outside the scope of the pelosi amendments environmental requirements secondly ciel noted that the 1992 rule omitted several multilateral agencies from its jurisdiction the ifc ebrd and multilateral investment guarantee agency miga are not mentioned in the rule ciel held that these threeinstitutions are included in the term multilateral development bank as that term isused by the pelosi amendment the treas ury department has decided as matter of policy that the ifc is not an mdb within the meaning of that legislation and that the regional banks private sector operations are not be governed by the pelosiamendment see below treasury woul d presumably hold that the miga would similarly be exempt from its requirements ciel also contended that the 1992 rule fell short of the requirements of the pelosi amendment in several other respect s ciel argued for example that it was not enough for treasury to assign bic the principal responsibility for disseminating mdb information to the public ciel sa id treasury had responsibility under the pelosi amendment for assuring that citizens groups and environmentalistsworldwide have access to copies of mdb environmental studies without such global distribution of the information ciel argued the pelosi amendments goals concerning public dialogue about potential mdb operations cannot be realizedciel said treasury should publish mdb envir onmental studies and take other steps to distribute information on mdb activities directly to persons in developingcountries ciel said the period for comment two weeks after person saw an mdb document was too short it said 120 day period would be better and treasuryshould create method by which persons cated outside washington dc would have time to comment an internationa l electronic mail network accessible to ngos was one suggestion ciel also said the re quirement that oral comments to executive branch officials about mdb pr ojects could be made officially only at meetings held by bic in washington dc was unduly restrictive organizations located abroadshould be able to present oral comments it said to the useds at particular banks ciel argued that the procedures needed for implementing the 1992 rule were not sufficiently precise for example it argued there was mechanism for determining whether proposed mdb actionwould have significant environmental effects there was procedure for assuring that an environmental review occurs and is available to the public at least 120 days before board vote the rule does not say how treasury w ill assure that other us agencies receive mdb documents there is requirement that treasury consider the mdb environmental studyand the comments of other us agencies or the public in the formulation of its position httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs77 ciel suggested that the language of the rule should be changed so the wgma must rather than may meet to consider mdb actions with potential environmental effects it recommended that epa and ceq be given significant voice in the development of us policy on environmentally sensitive mdb initiatives finally ciel said the 1992 rule was weak because it did not require treasury to articulate rational basis for the us votes on mdb projects with environmental implications the rule did not require treasury to announce publicly how the us had voted on an environmentallysensitiv loan ciel recommended that the rule be amended to require explanation of the us vote in the federal register it said this would create public record and requi re the department to justify publicly its position c current executive branch procedures for implementing the pelosi amendment official forums for analyz ing mdb environmental issues the executive branch has two principal forums for analyzing the potential environmental impact ofproposed mdb projects the interagency working group on multilateral assistancewgma meets weekly to examine loan proposals scheduled for consideration bythe mdb executive boards during the next two to three weeks second interagency working group meets periodically to review environmental issues and impactassessments received from the mdbs for fu ture loans the executive branch also has several channels for gathering information from us official and nongovernmental sources about potential environmental problems affecting mdbprojects the wgma the wgma usually pronounced wigma was created in 1977 as the successor to the national advisory council on international monetary and financial policies nac an interagency coordinating committee originally created in 1945 by the bretton woods agreements act chaired by treasury the wgma includes members from the state agriculture and commerce departments theexportimport bank and the agency for international development wgma meetings examine wide range of us concerns and us legal requirementstouched by prospective mdb loans it doe s not focus primarily on the environment staff working on environmental issues generally attend wgma meetings only ifenvironmental issues need to be resolve d treasury officials say the relevant mdb documents are distributed directly by the ba nks to the wgma participating agencies following wgma sessions staff of the treasury department mdb office make recommendations to treasury policy officials about the instructions they might give to useds concerning their votes on mdb pr oposals if pelosi amendment issues are involved decision memo is prepared for top treasury decision makers treasury staff say they look during the wgma loan review process to see whether eias and other relevant documents have been publicly available for at least 120 days prior to the date loans are scheduled for action by the mdb executive boards they report that it is sometimes difficult to tell from mdb documents when the local release occurred officials say th ey generally give the mdbs the benefit of the doubt when counting days they also say that if environmental issues arisehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs78 during consideration of project enough ques tions can be raised to delay vote on the project until 120 days have elapsed acco rding to us officials significant self regulation takes place at the mdbs for example at the adb one project in 1996 was postponed by management because the ea had only been circulated 119 daysin advance of board consideration and the bank wished to be in full compliance with pelosi requirements the staff environmental group staff with environmental responsibilities from various us agencies also meet at irregular intervals to examine environmental issues and eia studies received from th multilateral banks the need for physical meetings is often obviated by telephone or electronic communications among thepeople concerned the banks normally send doc uments to the agencies directly the treasury department has three staff memb ers in the mdb office working primarily on environmental issues the state partment epa usaid and noaa normally have one person each dealing with these topics in the multilateral banks thetechnical assistants in the us ed offices participate in these discussions as they often have the prime responsibility for pursuing environmental issues with mdb staff treasury and usaid officials acknowledge that the interagency environment group has objective standard for determining whether project will have asignificant effect on the environment they say however that the members of the group can recognize significant projects when they see them they insist they do not use the banks categorizations as the only determinants for their agenda theinteragency staff discussions mainly fo cus on category projects however they do not normally review mdb staff assessmen ts of the likely environmental effects of category b projects occasionally the interagency group may decide that category b or even category c project may have significant impact on the environment information received from ngos or other members of th public is often instrumental in calling these projects to the attention of us agency staff in those cas us officials say they will ask bank staff fo r additional information and for assurances that environmental problems the us agencies perceive with these projects will be addressed they may also argue usually without success for change to categorya in such cases the treasury department says it is not aware of any systematic analysis of the mdbs record of changing the categorization of projects on the basis of new information or additional analysis although it has happened in someinstances other avenues for information in addition to these forums us officials have several established channels for ssessing the potential environmental effects of pending mdb projects these include the tuesday group and the us agency for international developments early warning system on mdb projects the tuesday group the tuesday group is gathering of ngo participants and us officials that convenes the firs t tuesday of each month to discuss the environmental implications of

periodic meetings convened by the bic shall be the official forum fo r the receipt of public oral comment about mdb projects treasury officials say they communicate information or viewsobtained from ngos at these sessions to the other wgma participant agencies discussion at tuesday group meetings normally goes well beyond the presentation of views to us officials however to include mutual exchange of information among the ngo and us participants about specific projects or mdb activities the usaid early warning system the early warning system was set up as result of legislation enacted by congress in 1986 the act making appropriationsfor foreign assistance and related programs for fiscal 1987 directed the administrator for usaid to create system in consulta tion with the secretaries of treasury and state for assessing the potential impact of pending mdb projects 78 overseas usaid missions and us embassies were to ld to analyze the likely environmental and social impact of mdb projects unde r consideration for their host country among other things they were to addre ss the economic viability of the project its likely impact on the environment natural resources and indigenous peoples and any alternatives that might mitigate or eliminat adverse impacts unless restricted under the us national security classification system the information gathered by these reports was to be made available to the public the usaid administrator was directed to report semiannually to the house and senate appropriations committees beginning in december 1986 on the informationdeveloped by the early warning system surv ey the secretary of the treasury was directed to instruct the useds at the mdbs to seek changes in projects in order to eliminate or mitigate negative impacts discovered by the system the early warning system was made pe rmanent in legislation adopted the following year 79 the 1987 law added to the duties enumerated the previous year

significant source of information bout pending mdb projects for us agency personnel the us agencies rely more on the us offices at the multilateral bankson information provided by the mdbs on md b staff and on members of the public to provide them information about mdb operations ngogovernment cooperation close relationship between ngos and the relevant us agencies is widely viewed as important for the effective functioning of the us process for monitoring the environmental impact of mdb projectstreasury and other agency staff are few in number and they cannot monitor all mdb projects on systematic basis they depend on input from ngos for helpidentifying problem projects soliciting information about local conditions anddocumenting deficiencies in the field this is often cited as good example of how government agencies and private organizations can work synergistically but there are some downsides to therelationship for one thing it tends to be ad hoc with effective work done on therelatively few projects that are identified as problems these become the focus ofintensive activity but little attention is paid to other projects that may also beproblematic for another the priorities of the ngos have considerable impact on the kinds of projects that receive speci attention the ngos have their own priorities and concerns that motivate their st aff to volunteer their time to assist the official environmental review process it is not always possible for us officials to be sure the ngos give equal weight to the governments own priorities or concerns in this area d us votes in the mdbs on environmentally sensitive loan proposals the record and rationale for us votes the executive branch takes the position that the united states can register its opposition to pending mdb loanseither through an abstention or through negative vote 80 in recent years the us representatives at the mdbs have opposed only few mdb loans because ofenvironmentallyrelated pelosi amendment concerns as tables 4 and 5 indicatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs81 table 4 reasons for us opposition to mdb loans on environmental pelosi amendment grounds 1992 1993 19946 eia 120 days in advance of vote 53 13 2 plus some project concerns 6 4 plus definite project concerns 11 1 3not enough public circulation for eia 5 eia available problems with project 3 1 1eia on time but inadequate 2 2 3the us government opposed large number of mdb loans in 1992 and 1993because it believed they did not confor m to the requirements of the pelosi amendment between 1994 and 1996 the ited states voted 10 times to oppose mdb projects because of the requirements of the legislation two projects thejumuna bridge in bangladesh and zhejiang power in china accounted for 5 of the 10 votes initially as table 4 indicates the mo st common reason why the united states opposed mdb loans on environmental grounds was concern that eias were notavailable 120 days before the votes occu rred in 75 of the 80 decision memoranda for 1992 and 18 of the 21 for 1993 this was the main reason why top treasuryofficials directed useds to oppose mdb loans on environmental grounds on 53 occasions in 1992 and 13 in 1993 it was the sole reason cited to justify usopposition to mdb loans on 6 occasions in 1992 and 4 occasions in 1993 treasury officials also believed some aspects of the proposed projects needed further study in 11 instances in 1992 and one in 1993 treasury had reservations about specificaspects of the projects on 5 occasions the united states opposed mdb loansbecause treasury officials believed the eias had not been sufficiently circulated to the public though they were done on time to meet the requirements of the pelosiamendment concern about the possible environmental impact of projects rather than concern about the availability or timing of the eia study also prompted usopposition to some mdb loans on few ccasions in 1992 and 1993 three times during those years treasury officials ordered us opposition to mdb projects because they believed there were still seri ous environmental problems in their design even though the eias had been circulated at least 120 days prior to board action on four other occasions the united states voted against mdb loans because us agencies found major flaws in the eia studies in recent years the record shows th at treasury officials believe the mdbs generally complete their eia studies on time they say the mdbs are aware of us pelosi amendment voting requirements and attempt to avoid running afoul of themonly twice between 1994 and 1996 did treasury officials require us oppositionto mdb loans solely on grounds that thei r eia studies were not available 120 dayshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs82 81in few of the instances listed here the administration explained its opposition to mdb loans on the basis of environmental concerns other than those specified in the pelosi amendment an argument could be made howev er that the administration would have had to oppose these loans on pelosi amendment grounds if it had not explained its opposition on the basis of other environmental concerns before the board votes on 3 other occas ions where eias were not available on time treasury officials ordered us opposition because they also believedsignificant environmental problems with the projects had not been corrected some of these were category b projects wher eia study was required by the banks but where us analysts believed there was significant impact on the environment on 4 occasions between 1994 and 1996 treasury officials ordered us opposition toloans because they believed the eia study had major flaws or because they foundmajor environmental deficiencies in the project itself much of the us effort in the initial ears went toward persuading mdbs to get their environmental impact studies done early enough to avoid triggering arequirements under the pelosi amendment for us opposition to pending mdbloan treasury noted in decision memorandum in february 1992 that the loan inquestion was the first where an eia had been received at least 120 days before aboard vote on several occasions treasury said the united states must insist thateia studies be prepared in advance of th board vote rather than being funded with the proceeds of mdb loans after they were approved table 5 us opposition to mdb

nonconfrontational initial approach in seeking to improve bank performance the treasury department chose not to be confrontational in itsapproach to questionable loans few examples might be noted in april 1992 at the world bank the used supported an i brd power loan for an asian country even though the eia had not been circulated and was only deemed to be available upon request treasury directed the used to inform the ibrd board that weexpect the bank in the future to adhere to the established practice of circulating eia summaries of category projects at least 120 days prior to board votes and areconcerned that this did not occur in this case in may 1992 the united states opposed an afdb loan for subsaharan african country because the eia had not been provided to the used or the public 120 days beforehand even though it was dated and presumably prepared earlierthe following month the united states suppor ted an ibrd loan to latin american country even though the eia summary was received by the used less than twomonths beforehand treasury accepted the argument by world bank staff that thestudy had been completed five months earlier and would have been available onrequest in september 1992 the united states voted for an ibrd education loan for latin american country even though it was category project and eia had been prepared treasury said the project had significant environmental effects in october the united states supported category bequivalent loan at the idbthough it argued that an eia should have been done because the project raised significant zoning and landuse concerns in december 1992 and february 1993 theunited states supported ibrd loans for tw large asian countries even though the eias had been received less than 120 days beforehand treasury again accepted the argument of world bank staff that the eia studies had been prepared much earlierhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs86 and would have been available upon request treasury expressed doubt in its analysis of one of these loans whether th public would have been able to acquire copies of the eia independent of us government request but it decided tosupport the loan anyway more recent us efforts to strengthen the process eias should have an impact on project design as the timeliness and availability of eia studies have improve d the united states had stressed other issues in recent years for example tr easury officials have argued that eia studies should be used to bring about improvements in proposed projects their preparation 120 days in advance of the board vote was not sufficient if the issues raised in the eia studies were not addressed in the subsequent project design as discussed inchapter i the world banks own recent evaluations of its eia performance havefound that environmental analysis is ofte n not used effectively in the mdb project design process the united states opposed loan to an asian country in 1994largely on account of these concerns likewise the united states opposed threeloans in 1993 and another in 1996 because the eias did not address resettlementquestions when these were relevant and when the project was not consistent with thepolicy of the bank financing the loan eias should be done for planned subprojects the united states has also addressed other environmental issues in its reviews of mdb loans the united states opposed an adb loan for large south asian country in 1996 for example because the eia studies for its major subcomponents had not been completedefforts to improve environmental standard s for project subcomponents have been constant theme in treasury department an alyses of prospective mdb projects in 1993 the united states opposed two ibrd loans for countries in north africa andeastern europe and an ebrd loan for country in central europe on grounds that eia studies were being done for identif iable subprojects the us vote in 1996 suggests that the united states believes that eia reviews for planned subprojects should not only be required but should be completed before the mdb loan isimproved eias should consider alternatives and consult the public the united states opposed other loans in recent years because their eias were deemed inadequate or because they failed to examine alternatives to the project under consideration orbecause the public was not consulted or involved in the execution of the eia studyitself the united states opposed an idb power loan in 1994 for example becauseof insufficient public participation in the eia and project design treasury officials argue and crs field study later confirmed that the us concerns on this scorewere alleviated after the idb stressed the need for public participation in its implementation of the project the examin ation of alternatives and increased public participation have been issues of continuing concern as discussed in chapter irecent world bank studies have confirmed that these are two areas of weakness inworld bank procedures since at least 1992 treasury officials have mentionedthem in decision memoranda as reasons why the united states should question andpossibly abstain or vote against particular mdb loans httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs87 82the pelosi amendment requires the executive branch to report to congress about the progress the united states has made encouraging the mdbs to adopt consistent and timely environmental review procedures for their pr ojects the question of publicizing the votes cast by us executive directors is not addr essed international financial institutions act sec 1307fe evaluation and discussion changing mdb procedures the strategy envisioned by ciel in its comments on the 1992 rule involved establishment of mechanisms in the usgovernment for disseminating information and informing ngos about mdboperations the strategy which the us government pursued instead envisionedestablishment of mechanisms in each ba nk for making information accessible to the public directly most analysts agree the latter has been preferable approach all the mdbs have created or are creating systems for disclosing information to the public the approach taken by the us government enabled it to sidestep many potentialconflicts that might have occurred between it and the banks or other member country governments for example it avoided the controversy that would have likelyoccurred if the united states publicly di stributed information the mdbs and other countries wished to keep confidential it also has contributed to changing the banks attitudes in many respects the mdbs are now more open and more willing to inform the public about their plansand operations as noted in the previous chapter there are problems orshortcomings with the banks implementation of their procedures in that area the mdbs now say officially nd many mdb officials seem to believe that disclosure of information and public discussion can help improve the prospects andeffectiveness of their planned operations information about us votes ciel recommended in its comment on the 1992 temporary rule that treasury be require d to publish statement in the federal register justifying its vote on every mdb loan affected by the pelosi amendment us officials respond with some frustration that they already lack sufficient timeand staff to meet all reporting requirements more reporting requirements they say would either put them further behind or reduce the time they have to monitor mdbactivities ciel may have been motivated in 1992 by concern that treasury wouldignore the requirements of the pelosi amendment ciel argued that the us government should tell the public how the useds vote on environmentallysensitive mdb initiatives the us government currentlyhas procedure for making this informati on systematically available to the public the pelosi amendment does not require the administration to inform congress or the public concerning about votes the useds have cast on environmentallysensitive proposals 82 other provisions of law require the secretary of the treasury to report annually to congress and the public about us policy in the mdbs

information in its public report onus participation in the international financia l institutions this report has not been issued for several years due to the shortage of staff at treasury and the pressures of other moreimmediate obligations relating to us participation in the ifis for the latest volume in theseries see international finance annual report of the chairman of the national

meet particular legisla tive mandates these do not require the administration to disclose how the useds voted on individual mdb loans the human rights provisions of the international financial institutions act require treasury to report quarterly to c ongress however about us votes in the mdbs each loan and each vote must be listed and information must be provided about human rights conditions in the borro wer country and any basic human needs orientation for the loans83 the administration has used this report to congress as vehicle for explaining all us abstentions and negative votes in the mdbsincluding all loans opposed on account of pelosi amendment requirements 84 the treasury department does not normally distribute copies of this report to the publicand the congressional committees do not normally publicize their contents the executive branch could delete references to the pelosi amendment and other legislation which prompts us opposition to mdb loans from its quarterlyhuman rights reports to congress this might be unacceptable to congress however as it could hinder congressional oversight of the executive branch and mdboperations quarterly reports to congress may be made available to the public by legal process under the freedom of information act foia some officials argue that the united states should not publicize its votes on mdb loans they say this will shift the focus of attention away from the overall content of the banks environment policy towards debate about the details ofparticular loans they also say more pub licity could hurt us relations with other countries and it could lessen the spirit of governmenttogovernment cooperationnecessary for the implementation of envir onmental reforms other observers argue though that the disclosure of us vot will help the public monitor the implementation of us policy they so say it will help the public determine whether the banks are complying in their loan programs with the principles and standards approved in their general policies in lieu of potentially being required to re lease the quarterly reports to the public under the foia the administration might establish system for releasing versionof the quarterly reports voluntarily the simplest procedure might be for treasury to give the commerce department copy of the quarterly report the commerceinformation service could then distribute it at nominal charge to the publichttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs89 85international financial ins titutions act sec 1307a1acompliance with the law some us votes in 1992 and 1993 seemed to be generous in their acceptance of propositions that seem only marginally in accordwith the requirements of the pelosi am endment noteworthy was the view that unpublicized eia studies would have been made available to the us government more than 120 days before the board vot if the us gove rnment had requested them also noteworthy was the assumption that these studies would have beenequally available to the public if requeste d even for countries where the concept and procedures for public disclosure are not well established arguably however the executive branchs approach to the disclosure issue in 1992 and 1993 has borne fruit the mdbs ve all adopted or plan to adopt procedures providing the public with cons iderable access to information in many ways the focus of debate has undergone major shift previously there wasconsiderable discussion whether the mdbs can or should disclose any informationabout their operations to the public now the issue seems to be more questionwhether enough of the right kinds of inform ation is being disclosed to satisfy public concerns the pelosi amendment stipulates that useds may not vote for environmentallysensitive mdb loans unle ss an eia or comprehensive summary has been completed by the borrowing country or the institution and has been madeavailable to the board of directors of the institution and to affected groups and local nongovernmental organizations at least 120 days before the date of the vote 85 the executive branch interprets the 120 day rule quite broadly leaving aside controversy about the applicability of the pelosi amendment to ifc and other mdb non guaranteed private sector loans see below however there is little evidence that it is ignoring the requirement the mdbs generally require that eia studi be released to the public in the borrower country before they are submitted to the banks and before the banks begin serious evaluation of the proposed project the executive branch has independent procedure for knowing when 120 days have elapsed between the public release of an eia and consideration of the relevant loan by an mdb executive board somemdbs require that 120 days must elapse others such as the world bank have such requirement but they say that environmental studies must be released in theaffected country at the same time they ar submitted to the banks key steps in the project preparation process cannot occur be fore the eias are released treasury officials assert that this procedure will normally allow enough time for publicdiscussion to meet the us time requirement the banks seem to haveacknowledged through their procedures that 120day waiting period is of criticalimportance to useds us officials argue that the 120 day rule has been satisfied if the eia is released early enough by the borrower country they say the us government doesnot need to determine whether members of the public inside or outside the country or us agencies have had possession of the eia for the requisite 120 days according to this interpretation docum ent is available to the mdb board of directors affected groups and ngos when it is publicly released in the borrowerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs90 country this interpretation seems to assu that it is the responsibility of the mdb board affected groups and ngos to acquire copies of the publicly releasedenvironmental studies it does not assume it is the banks duty to see that copies are made available to all concerned members of the public 120 days before the scheduled vote the language of the pelosi amendment does not appear to address this interpretation of the 120 day rule analysts can debate whether mdb documentsshould be assumed to be available everywhere the moment they are availablesomewhere most would agree however that the executive branch does have someleeway absent firm legislative history to the contrary in its interpretation of the law treasurys current position is more oriented towards disclosure than theposition it took in 1992 and 1993 at that time treasury accepted the banksargument that documents were available to the public and the us executivedirector if they had been written at least 120 days before loans came up forconsideration by the board even when they were held unpublicized anduncirculated in the files of mdb staff the pelosi amendment and mdb loan s to private sector borrowers the treasury department argues that the pelosi amendment does not apply to the ifcand the private sector financing program s of the regional banks many ngos and other observers argue by contrast that the pelosi amendment applies to themultilateral agencies private sector operations these ngos believe the executivebranch is in violation of its responsibilities under the us legislation in this regard the international finance corporation channels all its assistance both loans and equity investments to private firms without any provision for government guarantees of repayment the ebrd channels most about 75 of total commitments in 1995 of its funds to such recipients the idb and adb lend asmall portion in 1995 3 of all adb and 2 of all idb commitments of their funds annually to private sector borrowers the afdb has announced plans to begin providing such assistance in the near future the other mdbs and the pelosi amendment the world bank and the regional banks generally provide the public with information about their plannedloans to public sector borrowers well in dvance usually at least 120 days of their executive boards action on those loans fo r loans and equity investments involving private sector borrowers however they pr ovide the public with less information and they disclose it later in the process than they do information on their public sectoroperations for more details see chapter 2 of this report for example the ifcsays copies of its summary project information documents will be distributed to theworld bank public information center at least 30 days before the date the banksexecutive board is scheduled to consider the project eia studies for ifc projects likely to have major impact on the environment will be distributed at least 60 daysbefore the board vote the ebrd seems to model its procedures in this area afterthose of the ifc the idb applies the same disclosure rules to its private and public sector operations the adb requires that summary eias for category and some category b private sector projects must be available to the public and executivedirectors 120 days prior to board consideration as with its public sector lendinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs91 86thentreasury secretary lloyd bentson first made this argument to congress when responding to question by

90senate committee on appropriations foreign operations export financing and related continuedproject briefs for private sector adb projects are ava ilable however only 30 days beforehand arguments why the amendment does not apply the treasury department posits three reasons why it believes th pelosi amendment does not apply86 first it argues that the ifc is not multilateral development bank the pelosiamendment speaks on several occasions about assistance provided to borrowercountries treasury argues that an organization such as the ifc which lends onlyto private entities without official repaym ent guarantees is not an mdb within the meaning of the pelosi amendment because it has borrower countries second treasury says that application of the pelosi amendment to the private sector financing operations of the regional banks would be inappropriate whileagreeing that the ebrd adb and id b are multilateral development banks treasury officials argue that the need for confidentiality and the time requirementsfor mdb private sector operations are much more demanding than those for mdbpublic sector loans 87 these projects are often developed much faster than the 120 day timetable will llow treasury under secretary summers noted for example in april 1995 decision memorandum appr oved by treasury secretary rubin that the ifc project cycle is shorter than the world banks and often dependent onactions of private sector investor responding to market conditions 88 treasury officials say the same situation prevails in the ebrd and other mdb private loanprograms premature disclosure of the clients plans or other proprietary informationcould have negative effect on projects viability or the clients broader interestssince the pelosi amendment does not addre ss these concerns treasury officials say its application to the mdb private sector programs would be unwise third treasury legal analysts says congress has accepted the treasury departments interpretation of the pelosi amendment because it has not legislatively overturned or revoked it 89 they cite for example language in 1990 senate appropriations committee report 90 which notes that the committee includedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs92 90continued programs appropriation bill 1991 s rept 101519 p 55 91house committee on banking finance and urban affairs international development and eastern european recovery act of 1990 h rept 101590 pp 3942 though the issue didnot come up in discussion treasury would presumably interpret the fact that the bankingcommittee made reference to the pelosi amendment in its discussion of the ifc pp 424 as further evidence that th committee accepted the treasury departments interpretation 92section 567b2 of the foreign operations export financing and related programs appropriations act 1995 pl 103306 93memorandum from summers to rubin april 25 1995 the formal document determination required under pl 103306 s ection 567 subsection b is dated april continuedprovisions in the foreign operations appropria tions bill relating to the ebrd in order to ensure that efforts to broaden privat sector activities in eastern europe will not further aggravate the existing environmen tal crisis and actively promote economic activities which will contribute to the restor ation of the environment in the region these included procedures for consultation with and involvement of the public and interested nongovernmental organizations in bank operations including anopportunity for comment by local communities which may be affected by bankoperations treasury legal experts argue that congress knew in 1990 how thetreasury department planned to interpret the pelosi amendment theappropriations committees did not criticize th departments interpretation in their reports this shows the treasury legal experts indicate that they accepted thetreasury interpretation of the pelosi amendment in 1990 the house banking committee which had originated the pelosi amendment the previous year did not criticize th treasury interpretation in its 1990 report authorizing us participation in the ebrd the committee said thatenvironmental conditions in eastern europe are so degraded as to warrant specialaction by the ebrd 91 arguably by this line of analysis the absence of contrary language in the banking committee report is an indication that it accepts treasurysview of the pelosi amendment in 1990 problems with the argument for nonapplication whether congress could be expected to agree in 1990 with an argument the treasury department did notexpress publicly until 1993 is matter for conjecture congress has spoken morerecently on this issue in 1994 it included provision relating to the ifc and theenvironment in the fy1995 foreign operations appropriations act it specified that half the funds appropriated for the ifc w ould be available for payment after april 1 1995 only if the secretary of the treasur determined and reported to congress that the ifc is pursuing reforms comparable to those adopted by the ibrdregarding the environment information disclosure and resettlement 92 the house appropriations committee said in its report accompanying that legislation that itcontinues to believe that the ifc is lax in considering the environmental effects of its lending operations the committee believes that the ifc should come intocompliance with the intent of the pelosi amendment treasury secretary rubin determined in april 1995 that the ifcs environmental reforms are comparable tothose of the ibrd 93 that congress enacted this legi slation would suggest that it didhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs93 93continued 28 1995 under secretary summers notes in the memorandum that information on ifc projects with major environmental impacts is available 60 days and information on projects with lesser but still significant impact is availa ble 8 days before the board vote he noted that treasurys environmental group has opined that the ifc has not met the congresssconditions 94for further discussion of these points see jonathan sanford does the pelosi amendment apply to the ifc memorandum to the honorable john porter distributed by permission congressional research service august 12 1994 not accept the treasury departments argument that the pelosi amendment did not apply to the ifc or that di fferent standards should apply to the ifc and other world bank programs the pelosi amendment does not define the term multilateral development bank therefore the treasury department may have basis for arguing that the ifc is not covered by that gislation however there are other reasons for believing the ifc might be covered by the amendment 94 titles xii and x iii are the only parts of the international financial institution act which do not define the termmultilateral development bank the pelosi amendment is in title xiii theadministration has acted in the past as though those titles covered the ifc forexample it has never said the ifc was exempt from the title xii congressional consultation requirement likewise it never argued that the ifc is exempt from thetitle xiii language establishing the earl warning system information on ifc funding plans and ifc projects have been included in both the congressionalconsultation and the early warning processes the immediate recipients of ifc ssistance are not borrower countries nevertheless the idea of recipient countries is not foreign to the ifcs vocabularyits articles of agreement say the purpose of the ifc is to further economicdevelopment by encouraging the growth of productive private enterprise in member countries particularly in less developed areas thus supplementing the activities ofthe international bank for reconstruction nd development assistance to private sector firms is therefore means towards this goal not the goal itself the annualreports of the ifc and the regional banks report prominently the amounts of money they have provided to individual countri they do not organize their data as though the concept country is irrelevant governments have role in ifc operations even though they are not require d to cosign or guarantee the repayment of ifc funds the ifc articles of agreement say that it shall not finance anenterprise in the territories of any member if the member objects to suchfinancing areas of possible agreement there may be validity to the argument by treasury and world bank officials that th timetable and notification requirements of the pelosi amendment may not be appropriate for all mdb private sectoroperations there is nothing intrinsically determinative about 120 day requirementthe issue is whether the notification peri od allows sufficient time for the public and member country governments to assess proposed ifc projects and to inform the ifcabout possible problems httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs94 95house committee on banking finance and urban affairs international development and finance act of 1989 h rept 101271 october 6 1989 p 51 96the office of the used at the adb says ther have been very few cases where the united states has made formal request for recl assification hence it says the idea that reclassification happens only rarely is based on rather small number of cases where it wassoughtin some cases where the technology is known the project location is relatively accessible and the applicant has good environmental record shorter time periodmight be feasible the fact that potential ifc customer needs fast action on anapplication in order to protect its comme rcial viability may be legitimate concern but not necessarily one that overrides appropriate environmental review of theproposed activity likewise there may be times where the ifc needs to discloseproject information of proprietary natu re to its member country governments but not to the public however casebycase rather than general authority for such restrictions could meet these requirements the idbs private sector program seems able to function effectively using the same 120 day disclosure rule applicable toregular idb public or publiclyguaranteed loans the ifc itself reported that in1995 the eia studies for over half its categor projects were released to the public more than 120 days before those projects were considered by the executive board the house banking committee said in the committee report accompanying the original legislation containing the pelosi amendment that any waivers of public disclosure shall be the exception rather than the rule 95 the basic question is whether the pelosi amendment applies to u s participation in the ifc and the other private sector mdb programs the legal rationale the administration cites to justifyits position may seem strained howe ver the operational concerns the administration cites its assertion that the requirements for an mdb private sectorassistance program are sometimes different from those for mdb public sector loans seem reasonable this controversy lik ely complicates us participation in the ifc and exacerbates public uneasiness about the mdb program congress and the administration might want to consider whether they perceive any grounds for flexibility or compromise on this issue reclassification of mdb loans the 1992 temporary rule for implementing the pelosi amendment says that us offi cials should seek reclassification to put proposed mdb projects in higher categor for environmental sensitivity if they believe these projects need more environmental analysis than the banks intend torequire treasury and usaid officials say the interagency group has sometimesidentified projects with lower categorizati ons that us experts believe merit category classification 96 they indicate though that it is extremely rare for projects to be upgraded because of us request although they note they have not conducted any systematic analysis of the i ssue they say that mdb staff may order an environmental review including an eia for project if the united states raises persistent concerns the original b categorization though remains in effect the issue of reclassification is major one success in persuading the banks to sometimes order the preparation of nvironmental studies for category b projects is step towards that goal however it does not address the broader issue asdiscussed above those eia studi may not be available to the public as easily or ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs95 97the office of the used at the adb says th asian bank has formal mechanism for reclassification as the adb environment division is involved in project processingearly as are eia studies done for category projects as discussed in chapter i many analysts believe the banks current procedures result in too many projects withpotentially significant environmental consequences being listed as category bprojects us officials say they believe the banks current procedures identify most of the projects that are likely to have si gnificant negative effects on the environment the record shows however that the united states has opposed some category bprojects and raised questions about others regarding possibly ne gative environmental effects the banks generally do not have formal procedures for reconsidering the environmental classifications of projects determined when they are first listed withthe mdb public information centers 97 consequently there is way to know whether many or few of the projects on their category b lists have unaddressedenvironmental problems absent information on this score and absent proceduresfor gathering that information outsiders mu st trust that mdb staff will be correct in their judgments about the likely environmenta l effects of projects and their need for environmental impact analyses us officials have few expectati ons of success when they seek the reclassification of particular projects the executive branch might be more effectiveand arguably more in compliance with the sp irit of the rule if it promoted instead reform of the mdb classification system and adoption of an official appeal mechanism within the multilateral banks circumscribed scope of us review ciel argued in its comment on the 1992 temporary rule that the executive branch was improperly limiting the scope of the pelosi amendment the amendment limits how useds may vote on aprospective action by multilateral bank the 1992 temporary rule governs how the us government shall deal with pr oposed mdb projects which might have significant impact on the environment specific projects are only one of several kinds of activities the banks may finance through their loan programs othersinclude structural adjustment sal and sector

upon the environmen t in particular they mention mdb policies and operational directives and th environmental aspects of mdb country strategy papers in their environmental review the us agencies do not limit themselves to an examination of mdb projects as the language of the 1992 temporary rule might suggest it is not clear however that they take into account all the environmentalissues that might be associated with prospective mdb actions the world bank operation evaluation department oed has noted 98 in discussion of the lessons learned from the banks past programs of adjustmentlending that adjustment policies have both positive and negative implications forthe environment oed noted for example that trade liberalization exchange ratedepreciation or changes in taxes or subs idies may induce changes in the structure of production which inevitably affects the environment oed analysis said that more emphasis on the environmental implica tions of adjustment programs is needed experts from the world banks environment department agree 99 they found that the broad economic policies embodied in many mdb programs can have far reaching effects on environmental conditions although these programs are notintended to effect sic environmental quality they report they can easily do so for good or bad the linkages between economywide policies and theenvironment are not well understood the world bank environmental expertsindicate however that they hope further mpirical work may help identify and deal with the most important potential environmental impacts 100 an adequate methodology for determining the likely environmental effect of mdb adjustment loans does not currently exist consequently there is nohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs97 101in 1993 for example the world bank approved an ida agricultural sector adjustment loan for honduras which sought among other things to increase agricultural productionincluding nontraditional exports such as pin eapples and melons through reforms in the land titling and agricultural credit systems the us executive director voted for the loan the world bank did not attach any conditi ons to the loan requiring the honduran government to prevent the inappropriate conve rsion of forest to cropland to restrict cropping of steep grades or to regulate the postuse runoff of agricultural chemicals theloan document noted as an acceptable risk the fact that the institutional capacity of the honduran government was weak and it might ve difficulty monitoring the implementation and effect of the measures that were mandated by the loan the loan did not require thegovernment to strengthen its capacity observa tion suggests that the new incentives initiated by the secal may have had some negative nvironmental consequences south of san pedro sula for instance one can see fields of pineapples on hillsides that were reportedly planted in recent years some of this farmland is reportedly within the boundaries of forestreserve and was cleared without official permi ssion it seems possible that if such activity is visible so easily from the main highway between the two largest cities in the countrysimilar activity must be taking place less visibly elsewhere 102for example the world bank and idb said in the loan proposals for activities they financed in honduras and salvador in th early 1990s that the projects would in the words of one loan for honduras comply with all provisions of current legislation on environmental protection and the conservati on of natural resources idb multisector preinvestment program loan proposal august 3 1993 p 19 subsequently the worldbank and idb approved loans in 1995 to he lp these countries strengthen the agencies responsible for the implementation of their environmental policy to develop improved environmental policies and to strengthen their legal and regulatory framework for environmental affairssystematic basic on which the treasury can apply the pelosi amendment to these loans nevertheless consistent with the goals of the pelosi amendment and thefindings of the abovementioned studies the us executive directors might urge the banks to pay more attention to possible environmental impact in mdb adjustmentloans they might for example ask th eir borrower countries to document whether they have adequate environmental procedur in effect to deal with the conditions that may exist if the policies embodied in the mdb adjustment loans have their intended effects 101 the banks often report that the environmental laws and enforcement procedures in developing countries need improvement102 it could be argued that the pelosi am endment requires us executive directors to oppose mdb loans when the banks or the borrowers have mechanism in effectto inform the public that project funded with mdb money is planned and what its likely environmental effects might be as noted before the mdbs finance manyprograms where the ultimate recipients of the money lent by the banks cannot beidentified at the time the loan comes be fore the mdb executive board the banks require that their borrowers have proce dures for assessing the likely environmental impact of these future subloans but they do not require that they also haveprocedures for making this information available to the public treasury says thatthis information is available to the public in borrower countries the crsexamination of projects in central amer ica showed however that the mdbs do not normally require that their borrowers have procedures for informing the publichttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs98 103for example in 1994 and 1995 the idb made loans to salvador and honduras to help finance through their social investment funds fis the construction of infrastructure facilities designed to meet pressing communitylevel educational health water andsanitation needs in 1993 the idb made loan to the central bank of salvador to finance relending program for microenterprise in 1995 it made another loan to the central bank for relending program designed to stimulate growth in the private sector the usexecutive director at the idb voted for all f our loans the idb required in the loan documents approved by the idb executive board that the honduran and salvadoran fis and the salvadoran central bank have firm procedures in effect to assess the environmentalimplications of all the subloans financed by these operations interviews showed that the idb staff worked closely with the borrowers to see that the quality of their environmental review procedures was sustained there we re provisions in these loans however for public access to information about the likely environmental impact of the subprojects topmanagement officials in several of the borrower organizations told the author they wouldhave been willing to have public disclosure system if the idb had required it and included its costs in the loan given the nature of the activities financed it is likely that the idb would have required an environmental revi ew and public disclosure for many of the subprojects if they had been identified initially in the loan documents approved by the idb executive board 104prominent among the goals of the idbs 1994 salvador environment loan and the associated technical assistance were steps to improve the governments systems for obtaining environmental information and doing environmental impact assessments these wereintended to provide the basic tools needed to finish putting in place the environmental management system as an essential prerequi site for launching an environmental quality control program and for setting standard for sustainable development as set forth in thecountrys environmental strategy ibid loa n document 27 p 6 there was indication in the loan document or environmenta l brief that the agencies strengthened by the loan and grant were asked to institute procedures for info rming the public about environmental conditions in the country or bout the results of their environmental impact studies when asked the key officials of th relevant salvadoran agencies expressed strong reservations about the public disclosure of this type of information spokesmen forsalvadoran ngos said they thought the governme nt would institute disclosure procedures only if it were required to do so by donor organization beforehand or even afterwards about th likely environmental effects of these loans103 us officials might encourage the mdbs to require their borrowers to build systems for the public disclosure into the projects funded by mdb loans104 this would seem to be consistent with the goals of the pelosi amendment and the spiritof the banks own information disclosure policies consultation with the public considerable amount of informal discussion apparently takes place between ngos and us officials through telephone personal or electronic mail conversations on occas ions other than formal ngogovernment meetings there is indication despite concerns raised by ciel and others in1992 that the executive branch has sought to limit public comment to particularcontexts the 1992 temporary rule

after public reader sees document this type of access was seen as necessaryoption in 1992 when the mdbs were still sometimes unwilling to share information directly with the public treasury officials say this process has fallen into abeyance with the establishment of public information centers at the multilateral banks the 1992temporary rule says that public comments on mdb projects shall remain on fileand be open to public examination treasury officials say that few writtencommunications are received notes on oral comments by ngos may be kept byus officials but they are not normally shared with third parties the treasury department reports that th used offices at the banks receive considerable amount of information direc tly through faxes calls letters etc from ngos companies and other members of the public about projects the mdbs have under consideration this information is reportedly given serious consideration theconcern by ciel in 1992 that the formal requirements of the 1992 temporary rule would be used to constrain public comment has proven groundless there is indication that direct written public comments received by used offices are submitted to the treasury depa rtment as mentioned the 1992 rule says that all written public comments shall be av ailable for public inspection at treasury oral comments are supposed to be made in public forum 106 there is indication in the rule how treasury should treat oral comments received privately outside apublic forum information is currently available as to what interests contact theused offices most often the patterns may be similar to those for public contactsee section d above with the banks public information centers sources say that information developed by ngos is major way the us government becomes informed about potential mdb environmental problems orissues in some ways projects are deemed to have significant environmentalimpact if they elicit sufficient ngo cern close collaboration with ngos helps amplify the us governments ability to monitor the environmental implications of pending mdb loans the process is rather ad hoc however considerable attention is given to the relatively few projects that are perceived to be problems littleattention is given to other projects that ra ise fewer immediate concerns the process is heavily dependent on the capability of ngo staff who offer their servicesassisting and pushing the us government and the mdbs to take action onproblems they identify and document reports by us officials are likewise an important way the ngos ge t additional

abroad have neither the time nor the skills needed for an independent examination of proposed md b operations most draw upon discussions with mdb resident missions local or foreign ngo observers or local government agencies for much of the information they develop the number of projects studied by the usaid early warning system is normally only fraction of the total number of environmentallysensitive projectsunder consideration by the banks the march 1996 early warning system reportfocused on 21 mdb projects two in africa two in asia three in the middle east eight in eastern europe and six in latin america 107 by comparison in january 1997 the world bank had 190 ibrd and ida projects under consideration for sub saharan africa alone108 until the mdbs began implementing their public disclosure policies in 1992the usaid early warning system was one of the few publicly available documentsassessing the potential environmental impact of prospective mdb projectsarguably it helped identify projects whose environmental problems were mostserious and most evident ngo and us officials say it is unusual today for theearly warning system to identify problem

systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs101 have identified problems previously unknown to most wgma and tuesday group participants still the early warning system is th main mechanism the us government

for raising issues directly with foreigngovernments about mdb projects and for checking information provided to it byngos mdb staff or other sources as more usaid missions are closed overseas congress may want to monitor whether the effectiveness of the early warning system will atrophy without their input into the process congress may cons ider whether alternative means within the us government are needed eg perh aps separate funding for the system or transfer of its functions to different agency for gathering and assessing relevant information in the absence of compar able mechanism the us

classifying it in one of threecategories described below as noted in discussion of the international financecorporation the ifc uses these categories and adds fourth fi for financial intermediary loans which is discussed in the main text of this report category projects or project components require full environmental assessment if they are likely to have significant adverse impact s that may be sensitive irreversible and diverse and if the impacts are likely to be comprehensive broad sectorwide or precedentsetting negative impacts in category project would be expected toaffect the area as whole or an entire sector among the examples of projects that would likely be in category are dams and reservoirs forestry and production projects largescale industrial plants largescale irrigation

displacement of people and other significantsocial disturbances 1 the 1993 sourcebook update on environmental screening also elaborates on project location as criterion for classifica tion adding the significance of potential impacts is partly function of the natura l and sociocultural surroundings it adds that the types of locations that should cause the task manager to seriously consider an classification include those in or near sensitive and valuable ecosystemssuch as wetlands wildlands coral reefs in or near archeological andor historical sites in densely populated areas where pollution impacts might be significant or where resettlement might be required wher there are conflicts in natural resource use in areas already or potentially heavily developed along watercourses or in areasfrom which potable water is withdrawn or on land or waters containing valuable resources the update also suggests sources of information on such variables in the projects proposed location and if such information is lacking reconnaissancemission should be considered by the tm httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs103 2ibid 1993 update p 3 3environmental assessment sourcebook update environmental screening number 2 april 1993 environment department the world bank p 2 4ibid 1993 update 2 p 2particularly sensitive issues are also suggested in the 1993 update such as disturbance of tropical forests conversi on of wetlands potential adverse effects on protected areas and other such areas and i ssues it states that the best way to ensure proper treatment of such issues is to classify the project as category so that the level of effort will be adequate in rms of analytical expertise decisionmaking interagency coordination public involvement and disclosure2 the 1991 od 401 and the 1993 update on environmental screening further note the importance of considering cumula tive and induced impacts such as when an addition to an existing project woul d cause pollutant emissions to violate environmental standards or when the project being considered is small part oflonger term plans for much greater development category b projects in this category do not require full ea but require environmental analysis they may have adverse environmental impacts that are less significantthan category impacts few if any of th impacts are irreversible the impacts are not as sensitive numerous major or diverse the 1993 update onenvironmental screening to the envir onmental assessment sourcebook adds that category b projects often differ from projects of the same type only in scale 3 the od indicates that in this category re medial measures are more easily designed and mitigation plan may suffice the form at for the environmental analysis is also different few category b projects would have separate environmental reportmost may be discussed in separate chapter of the project preparation or feasibilitystudy examples of types of projects exp ected to be in category b include small scale agroindustries electrical transmission aquaculture and mariculture smallscale irrigation and drainage renewable energy tourism watershed projects the 1993 update indicates that projects entailing rehabilitation maintenance or upgrading rather than new construction will usually be in category b projectwith any of these characteristics may have impacts but they are less likely to be significant to the environment howe ver each case must be judged on its own merits 4 category c projects in this category do not normally require an ea or environmental analysis because the project is unlikely to have adverse impacts professional judgement finds the project to have negligible insignificant or minimalenvironmental impacts examples of projects that would be expected in thiscategory include education family planning health nutrition institutionaldevelopment technical assistance and most human resource projects httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs104 the 1993 sourcebook update 2 on environmental screening also notes special issues in screening intermediate credit operations and sector investmentloans when subloans or subprojects are not knownidentified at the time of projectidentification it states that the task managers responsibilities include assuring that the loan includes mechanism for conducting environmental screening of subloansand when appropriate environmental assessment or more limited environmentalanalysis the update states if it becomes evident that one or more subprojects will require full environmental assessment the entire loan should be classified ascategory interamerican development bank idb idb projects and operations are classified on one of four categories depending on the potential environmental impacts category i those designed specifically to improve environmental quality in general these operations do not require an eia however they do require intensiveparticipation of environmental specialists in the preparation anal ysis and supervision of the execution phase examples include watershed management air pollutionreduction land use planning and zoning and protected area establishment category ii operations in this category have dir ect or indirect environmental impact and therefore do not require an eia examples include education programs science andtechnology and dissemination of appropriate technology information category iii in this category are placed operations w ith moderate impact on the environment and those that have recognized and well fined solutions these usually require semidetailed eia and in certain cases specific components may require adetailed examples include potable water agricultural and forestry credit sanitaryengineering rehabilitation of existing infr astructure mini hydroelectric power and small irrigation category iv operations in this category are those which may have significant negative impacts on the environment including i ndigenous populations and other vulnerable groups in the area of influence of the project and which require detailed eiaexamples include road construction in eco logically fragile areas large hydroelectric developments large irrigation projects mining and toxic waste disposal according to the idb procedures screen ing and classification of specific and global loans is done by the idb country team with participation of theenvironment and natural resources division env it is reviewed by env and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs105 relevant operations division after initial scoping of the possible environmental impacts an environmental brief eb is prepared approval by the cma follows and the classification and eb are then inco rporated into the profile ii stage when it is approved if changes are required in th classification they must be made before the next stage in profile iii and subjected to cma review for final approval the procedures state while changes in the classification should be avoided if sufficient justification is presented the cma will review request forreclassification in cases where informati on is insufficient the procedures indicate that mission or additional studies may be required to justify final classification and changes in classification asian development bank adb the asian development bank uses three cat egories similar to those used by the world bank these three categories are category projects with significant adve rse environmental impact as predicted by an initial environmental examination iee an eia is required for activities placed in thiscategory projects in this category accordi ng to the adb procedures may include environmentally sensitive areas usually are largescale andor affect large numbersof people impacts may be irreversible and could lead to significant changes in landuse and the social physical and biological environment or cause harmful emissions or disruptdisplace large numbers of people examples given include largescaleforest industries large scale irrigation river basin development large power plantsand industries new transportation projects etc category b projects with adverse environmental impact but of lesser degree andor significance than category impact an eia may not be required but an iee isrequired the procedures note if the iee confirms that there are significantadverse environmental impacts requiring detailed environmental impact assessmentthe iee represents the complete environmental assessment report the impacts lessthan those of category are characterized as those that would cause some changes in land use or the social physical and or biological environment but would not normally include largescale nor envir onmentally sensitive areas examples provided include tourism projects renewable energy aquaculture and small scaleprojects in areas such as agroindustries industries without toxic emissions andrehabilitation projects the procedures i ndicate that an environmental specialist would be expected to assist in the formul ation of the terms of reference for the iee and in reviewing its adequacy category c projects unlikely to have adverse environmental impact eia or iee is normally required the procedures state an environmental assessment is normallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs106 5environmental policy paper african devel opment bank african development fund june 1990 p 4849 6environmental assessment guidelines african development bank african development fund côte divoire may 1992 p 11not required for category c because the project is unlikely to have adverse environmental impact by the very nature of these projects the social physical andbiological environment is not significantly ffected an environmental specialists input may be minimal and may involve only inhouse review examples given include forestry research and extension rural health services marine scienceseducation family planning capital market development study etc african development bank afdb the african development bank has established the categories described below into which projects are to be placed in the initial environmental examination during the project preselection or identification stage 5 category i projects with the potential for significant environmental impacts requiring detailed field review and in most cases an environmental impact assessment eiathe 1992 environmental assessment guidelin offer listing of some 18 types of projects that fall into this category in cluding airports dams and hydropower roads and railway construction river basin development mining largescale industrialplants projects with serious accident risk etc they also list some 13 types of ecologically sensitive areas in which any project would be category i includingcoral reefs tropical rainforests areas w ith erosionprone soils areas of importance to threatened ethnic groups etc 6 category ii projects with limited environmental impacts that can be routinely resolved through application of mitigation measures and design changes the types ofprojects listed by the environmental assessment guidelines for inclusion in thiscategory include reforestation smallscale irrigation and drainage smallscaleindustry development renewable energy development road rehabilitation etcunless the project is located in or close to the sensitive ecological areas category iii projects not anticipated to result in dverse environmental impacts that would not require detailed environmental review examples of projects that would fall into this category include institutional development health programs educationprograms environmental programs unless phys ical interventions in the environment were involved which would upgrade these to category iihttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98180crs107 category iv for projects with potentially beneficial environmental impacts the policy states this initial examination is considered as an important checkpoint in the projectreview process project will be allowed to continue until it has gone past thisinitial environmental examination and ever appraisal report will therefore contain an environmental statement based upon the above categorization
