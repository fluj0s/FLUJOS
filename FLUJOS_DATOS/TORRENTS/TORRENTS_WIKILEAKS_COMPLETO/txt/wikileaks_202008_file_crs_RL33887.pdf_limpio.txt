t act dmca in 1998 in part to help copyright owners protect their exclusive rights against infringement facilitated by digital technologies including the internet section 1201 of the dmca outlaws circumvention of any access control devices such as password codes encryption and scrambling that copyright owners may use to protect access to copyrighted works the dmcas prohibition on circumvention is not absolute however in addition to several statutory exceptions to the general anticircumvention provision the dmca authorizes the librarian of congress upon the recommendation of the register of copyrights to grant temporary exemptions in order to ensure that the public may be able to use certain copyrighted works in noninfringing ways including engaging in fair use of such works exemptions to the prohibition on circumvention of access controls are granted every three years following noticeandcomment rulemaking proceeding that the register of copyrights conducts there have been three determinations made by the librarian of congress to date in 2000 2003 and 2006 at the conclusion of the copyright offices third 1201 rulemaking proceeding the librarian of congress recognized six exemptions that are currently in effect these exemptions which expire on october 28 2009 permit the circumvention of access control devices under specified circumstances in order to 1 make compilations of video clips for film and media studies courses 2 archive obsolete computer programs or games 3 bypass dongles or hardware locks that are obsolete 4 use readaloud functions or screen readers with ebooks 5 connect wireless telephone handsets to communication networks and 6 test for or correct security flaws in works distributed on compact discs on october 6 2008 the copyright office initiated fourth 1201 rulemaking by publishing notice in the federal register that sought written comments from all interested parties concerning evidence of adverse effects of the dmcas circumvention prohibition on noninfringing uses of certain classes of works once these proposals for exempted classes of works are received the copyright office will publish notice of proposed rulemaking and then hold series of hearings in the spring of 2009 in which proponents and opponents of the proposed exemptions may present their views this report reviews the statutory basis for th

and trafficking in devices that may be used for this purpose7 the dmcas prohibition on circumvention is not absolute however much like the way in which the copyright act limits copyright owners exclusive rights with the doctrine of fair use8 the dmca allows for circumvention in certain limited circumstances9 first the dmca includes statutory exceptions providing that circumvention is not unlawful when library archive or educational institut ion accesses commercial work only to make decision about purchasing that work10 federal state or local law enforcement officer accesses work in the course of lawful investigation11 person who has lawfully obtained use of computer program accesses particular portion of the program solely to identify and study elements of the program that are necessary for interoperability and that have not been previously available to him or her 12 person who made good faith effort to obtain permission accesses lawfully obtained published work to conduct encryption research provided that doing so does not otherwise violate the copyright act or th computer fraud and abuse act pl 99 47413 or continued could undermine fair use and so added what is

universal city studios 111 f supp 2d at 322 the decision not to make fair use defense to claim under section 1201a was quite deliberate on congresss part however 1201 utilizes factors like those in

collect or disseminate personally identifying information about his or her activities14 second the dmca establishes rulemaking proceeding wherein the librarian of congress acting upon the recommendation of the register of copyrights may exempt for three years particular class of copyrighted works from the dmcas prohibition on circumvention15 according to the legislative history of the dmca the relatively short duration of these exemptions reflects congresss intent that the 1201 rulemaking functions as fail safe monitoring developments in the marketplace for copyrighted works and temporarily waiving enforcement of the prohibition on circumvention in response to those market changes 16 although these triennial exemptions apply to the dmcas anticircumvention provision they do not affect the dmca s prohibition on trafficking in devices that facilitate circumvention thus while the act of circumventing technological protection measure that controls access to an exempted class of work is not itself violation of the dmca during the threeyear period the making and distribution of technology that enables that circumvention is still prohibited and the exemptions cannot be invoked as defense to an action brought under the dmcas anti trafficking ban17 furthermore the exemptions only apply to persons making noninfringing uses of the exempted classes of worksan individual who circumvents an access control to engage in copyright infringement will still be liable for those infringing acts18

provides that the librarian of congress and the register of copyrights determine exemptions through rulemaking proceeding19 the dmcas legislative history specifies that this rulemaking proceeding is to be conducted through noticeand comment20 accordingly the librarian and the register provided notice of the rulemaking solicited initial and reply comments from the public and conducted hearings in granting the 2000 2003 and 2006 exemptions 21 on october 6 2008 the copyright office initiated fourth 1201 14 17 usc 1201i 15 17 usc 1201a1bc see 1201a1 exemptions 70 fed reg 57526 57527 oct 3 2005

users who are presently affected or likely to be affected within the next three years may propose exemptions to the dmcas prohibition on circumvention23 once the proposals for exempted classes of works are received the copyright office will publish notice of proposed rulemaking and then hold series of hearings in the spring of 2009 in which proponents and opponents of the proposed exemptions may present their views24 the new exemptions are expected to be published by the fall of 2009 proponents of exemptions bear the burden of proof25 based upon its reading of the dmca statute and legislative history the copyright office has determined that to meet this burden of proof proponents must 1 identify the specific technological measures causing the alleged problems and show that these measures effectively control access to copyrighted works 2 explain the noninfringing activities that the prohibition adversely affects and 3 establish that the prevented activities are in fact noninfringing under current law 26 only technological measures that restrict access are considered nontechnological measures that restrict access eg contracts or usage agreements are not considered nor are technological measures that control things other than access eg reproduction or distribution27 the technological measure must directly lead to the problems of which the exemptions proponent complains adverse impacts that flow from other sources are outside the scope of the rulemaking28 the problems complained of must be more than isolated harm or mere inconveniences29 and the adverse effects must be substantial30 claims of present problems and adverse effects should be supported by firsthand knowledge of verifiable problems occurring in the marketplace and preferably documented by factual and quantitative data31 claims of future problems and adverse effects should be especially well documented because the legislative history of the dmca provides that future harm should only be recognized in extraordinary circumstances in which the evidence of 22 1201a1 exemptions 73 fed reg 58073 oct 6 2008 available on dec 19 2008 at httpwwwcopyrightgovfedreg200873fr58073pdf request for

noninfringing activities must be recognized under the current law and must not be possible by alternative means33 proponents arguing for the renewal of existing exemptions must make their case novo34 the existence of an exemption that was granted in previous rulemaking proceedings does not create presumption in its favor rather it must be justified as if it were new exemption35 even when proponents demonstrate that access control devices adversely affect their abilities to make noninfringing uses of copyrighted works their exemptions are not automatically granted36 rather the librarian of congress and the register of copyrights weigh the proven harm against other factors prescribed by statute in determining whether to grant an exemption these factors include the availability of copyrighted works generally the availability of copyrighted works for nonprofit archival preservation and educational purposes the impact of access control devices on criticism comment news reporting teaching scholarship and research the effect that circumvention of access control devices would have on the market for or value of copyrighted works and any other factors the librarian deems appropriate37 these factors are intended to ensure that the librarian and the register balance the adverse and positive effects of access control devices which not only limit access but also promote copyright owners willingness to disseminate their works in new ways38 the register also must consult with the assistant secretary for communications and information of the department of commerce who heads the national telecommunications and information administration before 32 house committee on the judiciary 105th cong sectionbysection analysis of hr 2281 as passed by the united

granting exemptions the librarian of congress and the register of copyrights must consider to what class of works the exemption will apply the dmca states that an exemption may be granted only for particular class of copyrighted works upon sufficient showing of adverse effects 40 the statute does not define what constitutes class of works the register sought comments on this issue in the 19992000 rulemaking41 and concluded that class of works was to be defined in relation to the categories of copyrighted works in 102 of the copyright act of 197642 namely literary works musical works dramatic works pantomimes and choreographic works pictorial graphic and sculptural work s motion pictures and other audiovisual works sound recordings and architectural works43 however the register cited legislative history that expressed the view that the 102 categories were too broad to serve as the basis for class of works44 after consulting this legislative history and reviewing the statutory language the register determined that class of works was to be subcategory of the 102 categories that was based upon attributes of the works themselves and not by reference to some external criteria such as the intended use or users of the works45 the copyright office applied this definition of class of works in terms of the works attributes in granting the 2000 and 2003 exemptions 46 it also described class of works in terms of works attributes when seeking comments proposing exemptions for 200647 however in granting the 2006 exemptions the copyright office for the first time expanded class of works to include classes defined in relation to their uses or users48 the copyright office implicitly justified this shift by describing how adhering to the prior definition of class of works could harm either users or copyright owners in situations where class definitions are 39 17 usc 1201a1c based upon market factors prior assistant secretaries have promoted exemptions that the

in 2006 film and media studies professors described how their inability to circumvent access controls in order to make compilations of dvd clips for use with their students harmed their teaching the class here cannot be defined more narrowly than in terms of motion pictures and other audiovisual works on dvd however granting such an exemption would harm the copyright owners unduly by allowing anyone to copy any film on dvd failing to grant such an exemption would harm the professors and their students though 50 thus the copyright office reached compromise consistent with the congressional intent in enacting 1201a1 by allowing class of works to be defined in terms of its uses or users51 while several commentators noted that the copyright office essentially changed the meaning of class of works in the middle of the rulemaking process52 its doing so will likely not affect the status of the exemptions53 g22g145g142g561g344g342g342g348g561g7g161g142g150g153g157g146g152g151g156g561

spaceshifting which would have allowed circumvention in order to copy lawfully obtained audiovisual or musical work from the medium or device on which it was intended for use onto other media or devices 72 regioncoded dvds which would have lowed users to play dvds that are engineered to work only on players coded for one geographic region on players with different regioncodes73 works protected by access control devices that prevent the creation of backup copies which would have allowed consumers to make copies of lawfully obtained works to prevent their damage or destruction74 and audiovisual works and sound recordings protected by broadcast flags which could in the future allow users to timeshift formatshift and record for personal use television and radio programs75 many exemptions were denied because there was evidence of harm or harm involving access control devices and their proponents complained only of insubstantial inconvenience76 the 2006 rulemaking also marked the first time that the copyright office and the librarian rejected preexisting exemption proposed for renewal the exemption for compilations consisting of lists of internet programs blocked by filtering software which had been granted in 2000 and 2003 was rejected in 2006 because its proponents relied on the record from three years earlier 77 because proponents did not address the current market conditions or demonstrate that the exemption had been used it was denied78 71 rulemaking on exemptions from prohibition on circumvention of technological measures that control ccess to

to consumers generally or to specific user groups because the librarian granted more exemptions in 2006 than in prior years some predicted that this years exemptions will open big chinks in dmca authority79 others focused specifically on the cell phone exemption calling it good news for consumers consumers pay dearly for their phones itd be nice if they can keep them working with other carriers 80 the chronicle of higher education similarly described the exemptions allowing film and media professors to create compilations and computer scientists to research the security flaws of sound recordings and audiovisual works distributed on cd as wins for scholars81 some critics of the exemptions faulted the exemptions for not going far enough in protecting consumers proconsumer groups noted that num ber of the exemptions are tailored to narrow user groups not made up of average consumers eg the exemptions for film studies professors and archiving computer programs and that the exem ptions that would have been most beneficial to consumers eg spaceshifting were rejected82 they also objected that the exemptions are too limited to counteract the negative effects of the dmca which blocks good technologies83 in contrast some industry groups criticized the exemptions for their potential to harm specific industries the cell phone exemption in particular generated significant opposition from cell phone carriers and industry associations84 for example in december 2006 tracfone wireless inc filed suit in federal district court in florida challenging this exemption85 however the lawsuit was formally withdrawn by the company in june 2007 one reason for dropping the lawsuit according to the company was because tracfone has experienced success in suing resellers that make retail purchases of thousands of new tracfone handsets then unlock them for sale overseas 86 federal courts have held that the cellphone exemption does not apply to 79 new exemptions loosen dmca
