6301c15 shspec230 dead horses an emergency is an unpredicted event failure to predict anything else is life dead horses lists are problem often you do represent list and it misbehaves it is hard to complete it cycles the essence of cycling list is that the needle periodically goes beautifully clean then dirties up again when lrh first noticed this he didnt understand it was like list wrongwayto but how could that be on represent list the cycle on rightwayto list is dirty needle dirty read rock slam dirty read dirty needle rock slam rock slam then needle clean and it stays clean unless it rockslams on wrongwayto oppose list the rock slams increase in number the clean needles do too you can tell by looking at any pcs list whether it is ok or wrong way to you will need to be able to do this when you are auditing in the field where you will have to repair other auditors pcs pcs can get sick on r212 and you had better know what could be wrong so that you can fix it compare page two and page five of the list if there are more rock slams on page five its wrong you can list list each way for page or two observing how the pc looks before you start and when you stop you will get good at seeing changes in pc appearance as his bank caves in on him dont let anyone who isnt real expert do r212 on children because they wont sit still long enough to be repaired they are easier to cave in so getting back to dead horses and represent lists acting like wrongwayto lists the flaw in man is that he does not know himself he is much more able to observe enemies than self ask guy to name his enemies and he will give you list of names ask him to name himself and you will get joe that is why representlists tend to be wrongwayto sometimes and to give you oppterms they are easier to see than selves and they often dont rockslam properly the pc gets stuck flow of listing oppterms enemies and you must find wording that causes the pc to list himself his terminals list so the represent list is all oppterms and it doesnt rockslam and it gets clean needle dirty needle cycle if you are lucky there will be rock slams on it and you will find an item but often the pc will go greenish and the list is dead horse the case that gives you wrong way to represent list or dead horses is someone whose next available item is terminal not an oppterm the more the pc lists oppterms the worse he feels the missed item is the one that the pc is being right there in the session this also applies to the skunk list which runs out to item despite rock slams dead horse list is list with rock slams on it even with midruds in skunked list has rock slam but doesnt go on to an ri the pc doesnt know from which point of view to give you enemies so he has to give you everything say the terminal is bad boy we are asking to bad boy what does life consist of and we get just oppterms that is how you get wrongwayto represent list r212 can be run over another ptp and still get good results although under these circumstances the pc gets bit dispersed at times r212 gets the big hidden ptps and hidden standards out of the way so that goals can be found until these ptps are out of the way the pc doesnt have enough free attention units to do r321 most people dont think at all they just feed questions to circuits which answer special case of this is the pcs hidden standards hidden standard is circuit that is telling the pc what to think the pc has signal system rigged up scientology works if _______ it is quite complicated communication system like an automatic trainstopping system the guy who leaps up and says oh yes scientology works first had to ask one of these systems they dont think at all for instance the fda thinks the whole world is composed of two valences victims and victimizers there are other items for the fda the guy who makes food is victimizer and the guy who eats it is victim this makes the fda an enemy of all industry since industry emanates and those who dont are victims the fda lacking any other than those two terminals and wanting to be effective is victimizer and can only create victims this leads to whole country of victims communism etc all dogooder government agencies fall under this heading life is sort of dreary game that goes on between all of these victimizers who have to be stopped and all of these victims the government official in one of these agencies is trying to protect everybody from himself dogooder gone mad has nothing but victims left eventually these boys have more purpose in life because so much is now missing from it the way to handle this dogooder is to sympathize with him if you do this he will go right out of the victimmaker valence and straight into that of victim he is defeated instantly if you like humanity you will leave that kind of politics alone in fact you will leave all politics alone the thing that man is tuned up to see first is enemies when they go batty they can see nothing but enemies everywhere the dogooder never recognizes that he is victimmaker however he would never give you victimmaker as terminal you could ask him who would have your problems and get terminals cf expanded dianetics wants handled rundown nobody recognizes what he is being as easily as what he is facing terminals are harder to pick up than oppterms at the start of case so you get wrong way to represent lists dead horses and skunks and thats the source of all of these you want terminals and you must phrase questions to get them the last rung of cases is that of pt rock slams that would be pretty grim because now you cant do represent list the way to get someone to list terminals is to list in pt who or what would have your problems or who or what would live the life you are living or who or what do people think you are or who is looking at or who could be looking at or some such pcs have items stacked up in order as well as packages stacked up in order the majority of pcs are bit overwhelmed and the first item to come up is an oppterm they are being an oppterm other pcs not few have terminal as the first item they need terminal question if you said who or what are you as listing question remember that you is undifferentiated so you should somehow differentiate it if you have listed dead horse list ask the pc who or what would oppose all those things and get rockslamming list
