participate in employersponsored retirement plans has remained stable at about half of the workforce over the past 25 years however there has been shift by employers from defined benefit db pensionswhich pay retirement benefit in the form of lifelong annuityto defined contribution dc plans which are more like savings accounts maintained by employers on behalf of each participating employee one of the key distinctions between defined benefit plan and defined contribution plan is that in db plan it is the employer who bears the investment risk the employer must ensure that the pension plan has sufficient assets to pay the benefits promised to workers and their surviving dependents in dc plan the worker bears the risk of investment losses the workers account balance depends on how much he or she contributes to the plan and how the plans underlying investments perform once every three years the federal reserve board collects data on household assets and liabilities through the survey of consumer finances scf according to the most recent survey 479 of workers under age 65 participated in employersponsored retirement plansboth db and dcin 2004 down from 496 in 2001 the decline in retirement plan participation between 2001 and 2004 was most heavily concentrated among workers under 45 years old male workers nonwhite workers unmarried workers those who did not attend college and those with household incomes in the bottom half of the income distribution the survey of consumer finances shows th at 563 million households owned at least one retirement account in 2004whether an individual retirement account ira 401k plan or other employmentbased savings plancompared with 569 million households that owned at least one such account in 2001 the proportion of households that owned retirement account fell from 534 in 2001 to 502 in 2004 the median balance in all such accounts measured in 2004 dollars rose from 30462 in 2001 to 36000 in 2004 the number of households that owned defined contribution plan from current or past employment rose from 383 million in 2001 to 388 million in 2004 the median balance in these accounts in 2004 dollars rose from 19172 in 2001 to 28000 in 2004 the number of households that owned an ira or keogh plan for the selfemployed fell from 334 million in 2001 to 326 million in 2004 the median balance in these accounts in 2004 dollars rose from 28758 in 2001 to 30000 in 2004 the median value in 2004 of all retirement accounts owned by households headed persons between the ages of 55 and 64 was 88000 up from 58580 in 2001 for 65yearold retiring in may 2006 88000 would be sufficient to purchase level singlelife annuity that would pay 653 per month based on the federal thrift savings plans current annuity interest rate of 5375 this amount would replace just 15 of the median household income of 53400 among households headed by individuals who were 55 to 64 years old in 2004

employersponsored retirement plans has remained stable at approximately half of the workforce over the past 25 years however there has been shift by employers from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans defined benefit db plans usually ar funded solely by employer contributions and investment earnings on those contributions and they pay retirement benefit in the form of lifelong annuity the amount of the annuity usually is based on the employees length of service and average salary defined contribution dc plans in contrast are more like savings accounts maintained by employers on behalf of each participating employee in the most common type of dc planthose established under section 401k of the tax codethe employee defers portion of his or her salary which is invested in stocks bonds or other assets the employer often matches some or all of the employees contribution to the plan at retirement the balance in the account is the sum of past contributions plus interest dividends and capital gainsor losses the account balance is often distributed to the departing employee as single lump sum one of the key distinctions between defined benefit plan and defined contribution plan is that in db plan the employer bears the investment risk the employer must ensure that the plan has sufficient assets to pay the benefits promised to workers and their surviving dependents in dc plan the worker bears the risk of investment losses the workers account balance depends on how much he or she contributes to the plan nd how the plans underlying investments perform g346g342g343g507g148g508g561g153g149g138g151g156g561 in 1978 congress added section 401k to the internal revenue code three years later the internal revenue service irs published regulations for cash or deferred arrangements established under section 401k since that time dc plans have overtaken traditional defined benefit pensions in the number of plans the number of participants and total assets typically in 401k plan the employee must decide whether to participate how much to contribute and how to invest the assets in 1998 and 2000 the irs issued rulings that permit employers to enroll employees automatically in 401k plans revenue ruling 9830 allows employers to automatically enroll new employees in 401k plans revenue ruling 20008 allows automatic enrollment in 401k plans of current employees who previously had not elected to participate in either case employees who are enrolled automatically must be given the option to drop out of the plan in 2004 the irs published general information letter clarifying that the amount deducted from the employees pay and contributed to the plan can be any amount up to the annual contribution limit under irc 402g and that the plan can automatically increase the employees contribution over time such as after each pay raise again the irs emphasized that employees must be informed of these plan provisions and must have the option to change the amount of their contribution or to stop contributing to the plan altogether over the past 10 years many large employers ve converted their traditional db pensions to hybrid plans that have characteristics of both db and dc plans the most popular hybrid is called cash balance plan in cash balance plan the benefit is defined in terms of an account balance the employer makes contributions to the plan and pays interest on the accumulated balance however these account balances are merely bookkeeping devices that describe the employees accrued benefit they are not individual accounts owned by the participants as is the case with 401k plans because the employer is required to provide benefit that is equal to at least the sum of the employers contributions plus the accrued interest on those contributions cash balance plan is legally considered to be defined benefit plan httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30922g20g142g157g146g155g142 g150g142g151g157g561g21g138g159g146g151g144g156g561g138

retirement plan participation and retirement savings account ownership collected through the survey of consumer finances scf in 2001 and 2004 the scf is an interview survey sponsored by the board of governors of the federal reserve system in cooperation with the department of the treasury it is conducted once every three years to collect information on the assets and liabilities of us households the sources and amounts of their income their demographic characteristics employment and participation in employersponsored health and retirement plans data from the scf are widely used by economists at the federal reserve othe r government agencies and by privatesector research organizations and academic institutions to study trends in the amount and distribution of assets and liabilities among us households since 1992 scf data have been collected by the national organization for research at the university of chicago norc in 2001 4449 households were interviewed for the scf representing total of 1065 million us households for the 2004 scf members of 4522 households were interviewed 1 the 2004 interview sample represented 1121 million households most of the information collected in the survey of consumer financessuch as total assets and liabilitiesis reported at the household level the only data reported separately for the householder and his or her spouse or partner scribe these individuals employment pension coverage and demographic characteristics in the tables that follow table 1 and table 2 show participation in retirement plans by individual workers who were either the householder or the spouse or partner of the householder2 all of the other tables in the report which describe ownership of retirement accounts and the average balances in those accounts represent ownership of those accounts by households rather than by individual members of households

social security employersponsored retirement pl ans and personal savings are sometimes called the threelegged stool of retirement income but fo r many workers at least one of the legs of the stool is missing coverage of workers under social security is nearly universal but only about half of all workers in the united states are included in employersponsored retirement plans

threefourths of workers who participated in employer 1 for more information see httpwwwfederalreservegovpubsossoss2scfindexhtml 2 this report refers to households rather than to families because according to the researchers at the federal reserve board the unit of analysis in the scf is more comparable to the census bureaus definitio n of household than to its definition of family in the survey the head is designated as the male in mixedsex couple and the older person in samesex couple this designation is not intended to convey judgment about how an individual family is structured it is merely means of organizing the data consistently for more information see bucks kennickell and moore federal reserve bulletin 2006 3 the congressional research service crs found similar results in an analysis of the census bureaus current population survey cps data from this survey show that between 2001 and 2004 participation in employer sponsored retirement plans among working householders and spouses under age 65 fell from 505 to 488 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30922g20g142g157g146g155g142 g150g142g151g157g561g21g138g159g146g151g144g156g561g138 g151g141g561g10g152g158g156g142

congress has acted several times over the years to encourage workers to save for retirement mainly by allowing income taxes to be deferred on amounts that workers or their employers contribute to certain types of savings plans established to prepare for retirement for example the technical amendments act of 1958 pl 85866 added internal revenue code section 403b authorizing deferral of taxes on employer and employee contributions to retirement plans of religious charitable educational research and cultural institutions the selfemployed individuals tax retirement act of 1962 pl 87792 authorized taxdeferred keogh plans after representative eugene j keogh of new york for workers who are selfemployed the employee retirement income security act of 1974 pl 93406 authorized individual retirement accounts iras in which eligible contributions and investment earnings are taxdeferred the revenue act of 1978 pl 95600 added internal revenue code section 401k employers and employees can make pretax contributions to retirement plans established under 401k investment earnings accrue on taxdeferred basis until withdrawn the revenue act of 1978 also added section 457 to the internal revenue code permitting state and local government employees to defer income taxes on portion of salary deposited into retirement plan investment earnings are not taxed until they are withdrawn

average retirement account balances between 2001 and 2004 differed substantially according to the age of the household head the median combined balance in 2004 dollars of all retirement accounts owned by households in which the householder was under age 35 rose from 7456 in 2001 to 11000 in 2004 among households headed by individuals between 35 and 44 years old the median retirement account balance actually fell between 2001 and 2004 declining from 30888 to 30000 among households headed by persons between the ages of 45 and 54 the median combined balance of all retirement accounts grew from 51125 in 2001 to 6000 in 2004 the greatest increase in median retirement account balances between 2001 and 2004both in constant dollars and in percentage termsoccurred among households in which the household head was 55 to 64 years old among these households the median balance of all retirement accounts rose from 58580 in 2001 to 88000 in 2004 an increase of 50 the increase in retirement account balances in the age group that is nearest to retirement age is encouraging but the median account balance of 88000 is still not very large for an individual retiring at age 65 in may 2006 88000 could purchase level singlelife annuity that would pay 653 per month 7836 per year based on the federal thrift savings plans current annuity interest rate of 5375 this amount would replac just 15 of the median household income of 53400 among households headed by individuals who were 55 to 64 years old in 2004 moreover these median values reflect only the balances of households that owned retirement account when we take into account households that had retirement accountand thus had retirement account balances of zeroa total of 117 million households headed by individuals 55 to 64 years old had

contribution plans the rates of ownership and average account balances are shown in these tables in relation to the demographic characteristics of the household head in summary in 2004 ira ownership and average account balances rose steadily with household income through age 65 after which they declined households whose head was white were nearly three times likely as those in which the head was nonwhite to own an ira and their median account balance was 25 times greater married couples were much more likely than unmarried individuals to have owned an ira in part because these data measure retirement plan ownership at the household level and many married couples include two workers ira ownership rose with education and college graduates were more than twice as likely than those who had not graduated from college to have owned an ira in 2004 more than half of households in the top 25 of the income distribution owned an ira in 2004 compared to onethird of households in the secondhighest quartile onefifth of households in the third quartile and just 8 of households in the bottom 25 homeowners were almost four times as lik ely as renters to have owned an ira ira ownership differed little between fulltime workers and parttime workers ira ownership among employees of businesses with fewer than 20 employees differed little from that of workers at large businesses union membership appears to have little relationship to ira ownership many of the relationships between demographic characteristics and 401k participation were similar to the relationships between

with each age up to 65 401k ownership dropped in the 55to64 age category this could be attributable in part to the large number of people who roll over 401k account balances into an ira when they retire and also to the fact that older workers are more likely to be employed at firms that still offer defined benefit pension plans while 401k ownership was greater among households headed by white individual than nonwhite individu the difference was not as great as the difference in the rate of ira ownership by race likewise while 401k ownership was greater among couples than singles the difference was not as great as the difference in the rate of ira ownership by marital status fulltime workers were 25 times as likely as parttime workers to have owned defined contribution retirement plan in 2004 finally while ira ownership differed little among employees of small firms and large firms 401k ownership was substantially higher among workers at businesses with more than 500 employees than among workers at businesses with fewer than 20 employees in 2004 58 of workers at the largest firms owned defined contribution plan compared to 24 of workers at small firms t able 6 household

other assets that could be used to pay expenses during retirement for example the most valuable asset owned by many people is their home and some may find when they are older that they prefer to live in smaller house or apartment or they may choose to move to an area where property taxes and other living expenses are lower than where they lived during their working years in addition to equity in their homes many individuals have financial assets equity in businesses real estate or other valuables that can either provide stream of income through interest dividends or rents or that can be fully
