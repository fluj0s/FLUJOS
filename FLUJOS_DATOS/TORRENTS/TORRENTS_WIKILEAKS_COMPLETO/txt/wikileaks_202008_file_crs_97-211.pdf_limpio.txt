is appropriated in the agriculture appropriations bill further the foreig n operations measure includes funds for one activitythe exportimport bankthat is t regarded as foreign assistance but rather as us government activity promoting trad opportunities for american businesses in most years this results in foreign operation s appropriation including the eximbank that is slightly less 15 in fy1998

the exportimport bank and the trade and development agency from the perspective of congressional oversight nd involvement in us foreign aid policy making the foreign operations bill has taken on even greater significance during the past decade congress has not enacted foreign aid authorization bill since 1985 leaving most foreign assistance programs unauthorized as result foreign operations spending measures increasingly ve expanded their scope beyond budget issues and played major role in shaping authorizin g and guiding both executive and congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives it has been largel through foreign operations appropriations that the united states has modified ai d policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the cold war th legislation has also been key tool used by congress to apply restrictions an d conditions on administration management of foreign assistance actions that hav frequently resulted in

operations funding trends in recent yea rs as the united states has adjusted its foreign and defense policy to postcold war environment one of the major foreign assistance issues fo r congress and executi ve branch policymakers has been the question of resources and how to reduce foreign aid spending while sustaining the program as an effectiv foreign policy tool after peaking in size at 207 billion in fy1985 foreign operation s appropriations began period of declining levels falling to about 123 billion i n fy1997 representing 074 of the entire federal budget and 24 of tota l

pakistan and to countries providing the us wit h military bases funding peaked in fy1985 at 313 billion in fy1998 dollars 3 followed by sharp cut in fy1986 as the effects of the grammrudman defici t

disproportionately on th remaining countries and programs illustrative of this pattern congress during debates in 1995 and 1996 on th foreign aid spending bill protected funds for few priority foreign

fy1998 international affairs request placed foremost emphasi s on shoring up us diplomatic capabilities then secretary christopher launch ed this campaign for additional foreign policy resources in

addressed in the senate and house bills are discussed belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97211crs16 policy priorities of us development aid since the end f the cold war common theme of administration discussions and congressional debates has been what should replace the anticommunist foreign aid rationale of the past 50 years more fundamental question raised by some especially critics of development assistance is whether the united states still needs to maintain an active globally focused economic aid program or can it b transformed as smaller more targeted instrument with some elements bein g privatized that would support only the highest us foreign policy interests although there has been definitive consensus reached on these question s between the executive and legislative branches the clinton administration s strongly supported the retention of an activist foreign aid policy which can be used to bolster an number of us foreign policy initiatives around the world in earl 1994 usaid released its blueprint for postcold war development aid policy based around the goal of sustainable development and its four strategies f promoting economic growth stabilizing global population protecting th environment and advancing democracy while usaid has confronted some critics who question whether these are the right set of strategies that serve the highest us interests more fundamental issue has emerged given the reductions in development aid funding levels in fy199697 can usaid continue to pursue its sustainable developme nt strategies in an integrative manner that has impact and produces results usaid has maintained since adopting these strategies in 1994 that they mus t operate as interlinked mutually reenforcing elements of an overall us effort t promote the advancement of market economies and democratic transitions in th developing world until countries reach point of sustainability that longer requires external aid funding reductions congressional restrictions and fluctuatin g administration priorities however have required usaid to alter the mix of resources devoted to each of the strategies raising questions over whether the integrative mutually reenforcing principles can be maintained congress for example limited development aid for population programs in fy1996 and fy1997 to roughly two thirds the amount provided in fy1995 see below for more discussion on famil planning restrictions further the state departments bureau of global affair s places high priority on environment programs and presses usaid to allocate th maximum am ount possible to such activities as result the environment sector of sustainable development probably has not declined as much as it might otherwise but at the center of this issue for the past two years has been differences between congress and the executive b ranch regarding funding levels for programs supporting child survival basic education nd hivaids and other infectious diseases despite cutting overall development aid the past two years by about 2 3 from fy1995 levels congress has earmarked children and disease programs at levels equal to or somewhat greater than those allocated in fy1995 making the cuts on all other elements f sustainable development closer to 30 congressional proponents of the chil d survival earmark argue that even though budget pressures require the united states to reduce foreign aid spending the protection of children remains core america n value demanding that cuts should be implemented witho ut putting at risk the lives and wellbeing of small children in developing nations they further point out that th ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97211crs17 spread of infectious diseases pose s direct threat to us citizens and that american national interests require continued support for global efforts to reduce or eliminate such illnesses while agreeing with the importance of child survival and infectious diseas program s usaid officials apply broader definition to the terms arguing fo r example that efforts to protect small children go well beyond immunizations an d access to other health services the quality of childs life they assert also i s determi ned by an array of other factors including the degree of relative stability i n society protection of the surrounding environment access to adequate shelter and implementation of sound economic policies that will ensure jobs and economi c opportunities in the future consequently they contend the squeeze that earmarks place on other areas of sustainable

infectious diseases including polio tuberculosis hivaids yellow fever malaria and measles for other usai d sustainable development activities including economic growth democracy and the environment house funding levels substantially supported requested appropriations but would still requ ire an overall cut from the request of about 45 million 25 the conference agreement sets development aid funding about 30 millio n higher than requested by the administration reversing sharp downward trend the past two yea rs conferees adopted the houseproposed child survival and disease fund at 6 50 million an amount that includes 50 million increase fo r communicable diseases and 100 millio n for unicef although it will receive more funding than requested usaid will likely have to adjust somewhat its planne d program allocations for fy1998 in order to accommodate congressional priorities on children and disease programs since the enacted bill also reduces the request fo r populat ion assistance to 385 million some of the planned family planning mone could help fill the ad ditional congressional requirements whatever the adjustments however they are likely to be far less difficult to manage for usaid than during the past two years because of the higher overall amount approved by congress fo r fy1998 population assistance for over decade congress has engaged in contentious debates over us international population assistance policy often as part of the foreign operation s appropriat ions twice congressional positions on this issue have been one of th major reasons pro mpting presidential veto debate during the past three years hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97211crs19 focused largely on two intertwined elements 1 fundi ng for population programs and 2 restricting abortion activities funding for us international family planning programs had been one of th largest growth areas of the foreign aid budget in the 1990s f rom an average of about 250 million in the late 1980s fy1995 spending across all foreign operation s accounts totaled approximately 548 million when congress deadlocked ove r abortionrelated restrictions and us population aid policy situation that blocked movement of the entire foreign operat ions bill each of the last two years lawmakers adopted interim provisions that among other things strictly limited the amount f funding for usaid family planning programs the fy1996 and fy199 7 appropriation levels of 356 million and 385 million respectively are roughly two thirds the amount provided in fy1995 and represen t the smallest funding levels since fy1992 moreover also as result of the impasse over abortion restrictions congress established delayed timetable for making these funds available schedule that included monthly apportionments or metering of the appropriation second issue in the population aid debate and one directly connected t funding reductions and metering of the past two years dea ls with abortion restrictions and the eligibility requirements for foreign organi zations receiving funds to implement usspon sored family planning programs during the mid1980s in what s become known as the mexico city policy the reagan and later the bus h administrations restricted funds for any foreign nongovernmental organization that was involve d in any way in voluntary abortion activities even if such activities were undertaken with nonus funds several groups including international planne d parenthood federati onlondon ippf became ineligible for us financial support in some years congress narrowly approved measures to overtur n this prohibition but white house vetoes kept the policy in place president clinton in 1993 reversed the position of his two predecessors allowing the united states to resume funding for all family planning organizations so long as us money was not used in abortionrelated work during the past two years the hou and senate have taken opposing positions on the mexico city issue that in each case held up enactment of the final foreig n operations spending measure the house position sponsored by representativ smith nj supported reinstatement of the mexico city policy restricting us aid funds to foreign organizations inv olved in abortionrelated activities the senate on the other side has deleted the house provision dealing with mexico city policy leaving decisions in the hands of the administration moreover administratio n officials have stated that president clinton would veto the bil l if it included the house passed mexico city restrictions unable to reach an agreement satisfactory to both sides congress adopted for both fy1996 and fy1997 an interim arrangement that did not resolve the broa d population program controversy for congress but did permit the stalled foreig n operation s measure to move forward it was hoped that the arrangement whic h neither side liked would provide incentives for those involved in the debate to find middle ground under the terms of the most recently enacted temporar arrangement as included in pl 104208 the housesupported mexico cit restrictions were deleted and fy1997 pop ulation aid funding was set at 385 million down from 435 million requested like the previous year however the mone would be delayed u ntil july 1 1997 at which time usaid could program only onehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97211crs20 twelfth of the total about 32 million each month over the next year nevertheless the legislation offered the president second pportunity to accelerate the availability of funds to march 1 1997 instead of july 1 if he reported and congress agree d through passage of joint resolution early in the 105th congress that the delaye d funding restrictions were having negative impact on proper functioning of famil planning programs as expected president clinton issued the required determination on january 31 1997 stating that without the march 1 availability of fy1997 population aid funds usaid would face shortfall of 35 million between march and july 1 causing the agency to suspend delay or terminate 17 bilateral and worldwide programs additiona l management costs for usaid to administer its global family plannin g activities would total more than 1 million the president further asserted that four month funding delay w ould increase both the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions in developing countries raise the num ber of maternal and infant deaths and increase the level of births congress by narrow margin agreed with th presidents determination hjres 36 pl 1053 house passed

popul ation assistance programs early action in the 105th congress march 14 1997 with the house and senate and the admin istration still at odds over population aid policy the issue was prominently featured again during this years foreig n operations debate usaid requested approxima tely 441 million for fy1998 family planning prog rams including 400 million from the development aid accounts the total was up 14 over fy1997 appropriations congressional action hr 2159 as passed in the senate established separate 435 million account for population assistance subject to longstandin g policy prohibitions on using the money for direct ly funding abortions or for lobbying these limitations similar to those included in foreign aid bills for many years stopped short of the metering restrictions contained in the fy1997 appropriation or the mexico city policy because they would apply only to the use of us government funds and not to m oney raised by organizations from nonus sources the house bill also removed the fy1997enacted family planning progra m restrictions dealing with the tering of funds but limited spending to the fy1997 amount of 385 million during house floor debate lawmakers considered thre amendments concerning family planning and population aid issues the first proposal offered by representative paul and defeated 147278 would have deleted all populatio n assistance funding in the bill the house next took up an amendment proposed by repres entatives gilman pelosi greenwood campbell and others that was offered as substitute to pending amendment by representative smith nj the smith amen dment closely mirrored the mexico city family planning restrictions by prohibiting us funding to foreign nongovernmental and internationa l organizations unless they certify that they would not perform abortions in any foreign country while receiving us money except where the life of the mother was i nhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97211crs21 in related legislation the house had approved on june 5 an amendment proposed b y11 representative smith to the foreign relatio ns authorization act hr 1757 that applies the mexico city restrictions to us family planning programs senate counterpar t authorization bill approved june 17 had population aid provisions on oct 8 the house also voted 236190 to instruct house conferees meeting on hr 1757 to insist upon th smith amendment like foreign operations the family p lanning issue was major stumbling block to finalizing the authorization bill legi slation that also includes the consolidation of two foreign affairs agencies into the state partment and provisions addressing reform and the payment of us arrears authorizing conferees did not report bill in 1997danger or in cases of forcible rape or incest or lobby to change abortion laws i n foreign countries the gilman substitute on the other hand had the effect of banning funds to these organizations only if they promote abortion as method of famil planning for groups that perform abortions the gilman text would have continued current law that is us funds may not be used for performing abortions but n restrictions would apply to what organizations do with nonus money on separate but rel ated issue the smith amendment also prohibited contributions to the population fund unfpa unless the president certifies that the organization is not operating in china or that china s not engaged in coercive abortion practices during the past twelve months the gilman substitute did not change the certification requirem ent but would allow funds not available to unfpa to be transferred t usaid for bilat eral population aid programs after defeating the gilman substitute 210218 the house adopted the smith amendment 234191 the impasse over reaching an acceptable resolution to hous esenate and house administration differences blocked formal meetings of foreign operations conferees for nearly two months on october 7 the house voted 233194 to instruct house members of the conference committee to insist upon the smith amendment durin g conference delibe rations although conferees met on october 28 they had agreed11 in advance to defer the family planning and mexico city policy issue and the matter remains unresolved subsequent efforts to negotiate an acceptable altern ative yielded results one attempt ended on november 6 when confe rence committee leaders fell two votes shy of gaining majority of conferees in favor of modified provision subsequently the senate incorporated into hr 2607 n omnibus spending measure for three pending appropriations bills including foreign operations text sim ilar to the language rejected on november 6 by majority of conferees the revised family planning text section 592 division c of hr 2607 included the housepassed mexico city restrictions banning us funds to foreign nongovernmental groups and internationa l organizatio ns which 1 perform abortions with their own money or 2 lobby t change abortion laws in foreign countries although the text also included presidential waiver lifting these restrictions in fy1998 and fy1999 if exercise d usaid would have had its f unding for population programs capped at 410 million if one provision was waived or 385 million if both were waived resolution to the impasse came on november 12 when housesenat confere filed conference report on hr 2159 as approved population aid i s capped at 385 million the level for fy1997 but about 56 million less tha t requested the legislation also apporti ons or meters the funds at monthly rate of

but somewhat less rest rictive than congress enacted for fy1997 funding remains the same but instead of delay until july for access to the money as was the case last year usaid would begin to receive the 321 million monthl apportionments immediately mor eover there is not requirement for presidential certification and congressional vote early next year in order to accelerate th availability of funds regional allocations of development assistance the declining level of development assistance over the past several years coupled with congressional efforts to minimize th impact of these reductions first for africa and more recently for l atin america has heightened attention on the issue of regional aid distribution because there are separate accounts within the foreig n operations bill for assistance to countries in eastern europe and the former sovie t union congress votes directly on aid levels to these regions likewise since th economic support fund esf is comprised largely of middle east assistance with separate earmarks for israel and egypt the structure of the foreign operations bill permits congress more direct control over amounts provided to that region but the balance of usaids development assistance 1632 bill ion in fy1997 and 1698 billion proposed for fy1998 is distributed widely throughout africa latin america south asia and southea st asia among countries at various stages of developm ent and of varying degrees of importance to us interests in principle absent congressional earmarks or directives usaid an d the state department decide how to allocate funds on country and regional b asis task made more difficult with shrinking resource base africa had been afforded special treatment for ne arly decade between fy1988 and fy1995 when foreign operations spending bills annually included separat lineitem for the region known as the development f und for africa dfa through the dfa congress directly set the level of us development resources to africa thereby protecting funding levels for the region that might otherwise have bee n diverted to meet shortterm foreign policy crises elsewhere practice that d occurred routinely prior to 1 988 in fy1996 however over the opposition of some strong congressional proponents of the dfa congress and t he administration agreed to drop the separate lineitem folding africa into the worldwide developmen t assistance account nevertheless to ensure that the administration did not cu t african assistance dis proportionately compared to other regions congress directed the president to seek to ensure that africa receiv substantially the same proportion of worldwide development aid that it was allocated in fy1995 36 congres s repeated similar proportional requirement for fy1997 this time based on th proportion requested by the president for africa 412 alarmed over d eclining economic aid levels for latin america amounts that had fallen f rom 986 million in fy1991 to about 361 million in fy1996 fo r combined development and esf appropriations congress added in fy1997 fo r latin america the same proportional allocation directive as for africa under thi s nonbinding formula latin america would be expected to receive 286 millio n 175 in development aid while the allocation for africa would be 672 million although the administration asked congress to reinstate for fy1997 the df ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97211crs23 earmark it opposed the proportional allocation requirement for latin america an d africa arguing that with overall reductions in development assistance and changing global circumstances programs in asia would be unduly squeezed after extensive consultations with congressional committees us aid ultimately reduced the amounts slightly for africa 665 million and latin america 2735 million from what strict proportional allocation required by altering the formula usaid mad available an additi onal 20 million for programs in south asia southeast asia non esf middle east recipients and for centrally funded programs managed by th agencys global bureau despite these efforts to adjust the proportional requirements downward fo r fy1997 the request for fy1998 asks congress to reestablish the dfa at 70 0 million an amount 35 million higher than the fy1997 allocation but representing the same 412 shar of total development aid proposed year ago latin america would receive 2735 million the same dollar level as in fy1997 but totaling smaller 161 share the largest regional growth for fy1998 developmen t assistance is for usaids asianear east programs 310 million up 57 millio n from current levels the request includes increased funding for india bangladesh and indonesia but the largest growth would occur in 255 million asianear east regional reengineering dev elopment and support project intended to support the review of usaid mission strategic and action plans in the region congressional action neither house or senate bills estab lished separate line item for afric as requested or included proportional allocation requirement as has been the case the past two years nevertheless given the overall spendin g approved in each bill for development ai d worldwide it was likely the administration could accommodate the full 7 00 million request for africa in its report the house appropriations committee noted that the additional funds provided for th communic able diseases initiative should ensure that africa would receive more aid in fy1998 than in fy1997 the house panel further expressed its strong support for aid programs in latin america and directed tha t the administration increase spending by 20 llion from current amounts provided under development aid and f programs based on the housesenate conference agreement it appears that th administration will be able to allocate amounts for africa latin america and asia at roughly the levels proposed the conference committee however adopted th house position of increasing economic aid for latin america by 20 million middle east assistance since the late 1970s by far the larges t portion of us foreign aid has supported america n friends and allies in the middle east especially israel and egypt combined these two countries have received over 100 billion during the past 2 0 years for the past decade foreign aid bills have annually earmarked 3 billion fo r israel and 2115 billion for egyp t in economic and military assistance the fy1998 request matches these traditional levels as overall foreign operations funding amounts have declined the past several years however the proportion of funds going to israel nd egypt has climbed to overhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97211crs24 all us aid to israel for fy1997 had already been disbursed so unlike egypt it was not12 possible to transfer previously obligated but unspent funds40 in fy1997 some in congress and in the exe cutive branch have suggested that at time of overall budget cuts all aid activ ities including those for israel and egypt should be examined for possible reductions in order to fund other emerging initiatives for which new money is not available in this spirit the ad ministration announced on june 17 its intentions to provide jordan with an additional 100 million in economic assistance annually over the next five years amounts drawn largely from aid accounts for israel and egypt stat department officials say that it is important for the united st ates to send clear signal of support to king hussein for his efforts in adv ancing the middle east peace process and to bolster his countrys economic reform initiatives the first installmentfo r fy1997came from taking 50 million from previously appropriated economic aid for egypt and 50 million payment from israel for fy1998 the administration12 said it would ask congress for transfer authority to shift an additional 50 millio n each from israel and egypt to jordan according to july 11 state departmen t notification to congress israel and egypt have agreed with this arrangement th 100 million would come on top of 40 million estimated for economic and military aid for jordan in fy1997 and 70 million proposed for fy1998 cong ressional action the senate appropriations committee expresse d strong support for increasing aid to jordan proposing to go beyond the presidents initiative and provide 250 million in fy1998150 million in economic aid and 100 million for military support at the same time the committee registered seriou s concern over actions by egypt that they believed run counter to the peace process departing from practice over the past 20 years the senate panel did not include an earmark for egypt during floor debate however the senate restored the traditional earmark israels aid was earmarked at 3 bill ion while egypt would receive 2115 billion although the house bill did not recommend specific country earmarks th appropriations committee assumed full funding for both israel and egypt at the same time the committees report on the legislation encouraged the administration to consider options for reallocating middle east funding to address newly emerging us aid priorities elsewhere in the region and around the world conferees meeting on foreign operations funding agreed to 54 billion cap on middle east assistance of which israel 3 billion egypt 2115 billion an d jordan 225 million will accou nt for all but 60 million while supporting us aid to the region and efforts to move the peace process forward concern of some is that additional resources for the middle east often come at the expense of funding fo r initiatives in other parts of the world the cap which equals the dollar level f funding for last year will lower the proportion of foreign operations going to th region from 44 in fy1997 to 42 and permit the tr ansfer of 50 million each from israel and egypt to fund the jordan increasehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97211crs25 the 83 billion in export credits
