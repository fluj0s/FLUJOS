ill be updated periodically decision making in russia on key national s ecurity matters is widely believed to be firmly in the hands of president vladimir putin putins position on iraq has been described by many in russia and the west as an attempt to balance three competing interests russias mostly economic interests in iraq b moscows desire to promote multipolar world and restrain what it perceives as us tendencies toward global domination unilateralism and t ooquick recourse to military fo rce and c putins wish to remain on good terms with the bush ad ministration in furtherance of putins own domestic and national security agenda russian interests in iraq most discussions of russian interests in iraq focus on economic factors moscow however has cultivated friendly relations w ith baghdad since the 1960s as part of its general strategy toward the region in connection with the arabisraeli conflict and the broader cold war the ussr was sa ddams main arms supplier during iraqs 1980 1988 war with iran russia still perceives its elf as having strate gic interests and an historic role in that region and does not want to be seen as betraying longtime friend nevertheless many analysts assume th at economic factors have driven russian policy toward iraq baghdad owed moscow 78 billion for sovietera arms sales during the iraniraq war adjusted for inflation th is debt may total 1012 billion today it is widely believed that one of the reasons why russia regularly took iraqs side in debates in the 1990s over lifting sanctions was to f acilitate debt repaym ent especially as russia was very short of hard currency russi an oil companies have contracts that could be worth as much as 30 billion over 20 years to develop iraqi oil fields in

infrastructure in august 2002 iraq nnounced that russian firms would receive contracts worth 40 billion over 5 years to m odernize iraqs oil electrical chemical agricultural and transport sectors1 another russian interest is the price of oil the russian economy is extraordinarily dependent on oil and gas exports in 2000 russias oil exports earned 253 billion the total russian federal budget in 2000 was 48 b illion the price of oil peaked near 40 per barrel bbl in early march 2003 russia profits greatly from high oil prices the biggest single factor behind russian economic growth today but russian leaders fear that postsaddam iraq with the second larg est proven oil reserves in the world might maximize its oil output dramatically driving down the price of oil some analysts estimated that 6bbl fall in the price of oil could cut russias projected economic growth in 2003 in half sharper pri ce drop below 18bbl would severely impact russian government revenues jeopardizing moscows ability to pay salaries and pensions and to fund its already meager social expend itures with duma lower legislative chamber election in december 2003 and putin expected to seek reelection in march 2004 such development is dreaded in the kremlin2 counterbalancing us hyperpower many observers believe that russian policy is also motivated by desire to restrain us global domination and rein in perceived us tendencies toward unilateralism and excessive reliance on military force the idea of multipolar world not totally dominated by single hyperpower in which russia would be major international player still has strong appeal in russia although putin has adopted generally cooperative stance toward the united states he does not want to be perceived at home as an american vassal nor to give the bush administration blank check where russian interests are concerned thus russia may have had an inte rest in principle in opposing unilateral us military action in iraq putin does not seek to project russia into the forefront of an antiamerican coalition he seeks in cooperation with traditional us allies france and germany as well as with russian partners such as china to put some limits on us power especially its recourse to unilateral military force cooperation with the united states against russias economic interests in iraq and its interest in restraining american global domination is the strategic decision putin made in 2001 to reorient russian foreign and defense policy toward broa d cooperation with the united states putin sees russias economic reconstruction and revitalization pr oceeding from its integration in the global economic system dominated by the advanced industrial democracies something that cannot be accomplished in an atmosphe re of politicalmilitary confrontation or antagonism with the united states putin therefore shifted russian national securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21462crs3 3 crs report rl31543 russias national

overthrow the regime of iraqi president saddam hussein moscow reassessed its iraq policy by mid2002 some russian officials and scholars hinted that moscow might not object too strongly to us military action against iraq provided that washington did not act unilaterally and that russian economic interests in iraq were respected5 these discussions were reported in the russian and us press and undoubt edly were detected in baghdad iraqs announcement august 16 2002 of the 40 billion agreement for russian firms to modernize iraqs infrastructure may have been an attempt to ensure russian political support however in december 2002 iraqi authorities cancelled 37 billion contract with l ukoil russias largest oil company to develop the huge west qurna oil field many analysts viewed this as retaliation against lukoil whose ceo vagit alekperov reportedly he ld discussions with us energy secretary spencer abraham and iraqi opposition leaders about lukoils fu ture role in postsaddam iraq6 moscow can also be seen trying to balance its interest in preserving major role for itself in multipolar world in cooperation with france germany and china on one hand against its desire to void conflict with the united states on an issue washington views as vital on the other this was demonstrated in the negotiations leading up the security councils unsc approval of resolution 1441 n ovember 8 2002 in which france took the lead in pressing the united st ates for concessions while russia played more moderate role many observers believed that the conclusion of putins ba lancing act would be

based on us and russian press reports and discussions with us and russian officials it appears that the us response is as follows russias economic interests in iraq will receive due considera tion however iraq owes money to many countries its debt to russia ought not be put in special category in preference to all others b us oil companies among others have been shut out of iraq for years why should russian firms be guaranteed special privileged place in postsaddam iraq possibly at the expense of us firms c contrary to pe rsistent russian belief the united states does not control the price

february 912 putin traveled to berlin and paris and joined french president chirac and german chancellor schroeder in joint declaration stating that there was still an alternative to war and that russia france and germany were determined to work together to complete disarmament in iraq peacefully14 on march 2 putin rejected regime change as legitimate goal in iraq the international community cannot in terfere with the domestic affa irs of any country in order to change its regime the only legitimate goal the united nations can pursue in this situation is the disarmament of iraq15 on march 10 foreign minister ivanov declared that if the usbacked resolution authorizing war was submitted to the unsc russia would vote against it16 soon after the usled coalition began milita ry operations in iraq putin called the attack big mistake unjustified and insisted that military action be ended quickly russian media like that in many other eu ropean countries took generally negative attitude toward coalition military action emphasizing innocent civilian casua lties and coalition mistakes and problems in russia however the kremlin exercises very strong influence over the media especially tv russian public opinion overwhelmingly opposed what most russians saw as us ggression there were large antiwar rallies in major cities and spont aneous manifestations of antiamericanism there is something slightly alarming in russias new more hardline stance toward the united states over iraq observed the moscow times editorial page on february 27 president vladimir putin changed the tone wh he warned of the dangers of us and british warmongering and called on the military to be ready to defend russias interests then russia which had been straddling both sides jumped firmly into the french and german camp moscows shift suggests two questions why the more hardline stance toward us policy on iraq and has putin irrevocably j umped into the french and german camp there are probably multiple factors behind putins more hardline stance toward the united states there is russias interest in promoting multipolar world andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21462crs6 17 most russians oppose wa r

us war in ira q over 90 of russians also strongly opposed the war17 putin may feel that he cannot appear completely to ignore the opinions of his generals and diplomats the political establishment and the voters by early april the demonstration yet again of americas unrivaled military capability must have been very disturbing to many russians especially in view of moscows miserable experiences in chechnya russian military s pokesmen regularly claim that the us government is hi ding its true casualty figures which must be much higher than announced the wide and wide ning gap between us and russian military capabilities both embarrasses and frightens many russians finally and perhaps most important it appears that the bush administration has not given moscow the firm assurances it wa nts guaranteeing russian economic interests in iraq now that the battlefield aspect of the iraq conflict is essentially over it remains to be seen how strong russian opposition will be to us policy in iraq that may depend on how putin weighs the benefits of pri ncipled and domesti cally popular opposition to the united states against the costs of incurring the enmity of the bush administration on an issue that bush clearly considers to be of supreme importance the two presidents spoke by telephone on march 18 and reportedly agreed that despite differences on iraq bilateral cooperati on on other issues would be increas ed on march 20 putin criticized the us attack as political blunder that could jeopardize the international security system at the same time other russian officials
