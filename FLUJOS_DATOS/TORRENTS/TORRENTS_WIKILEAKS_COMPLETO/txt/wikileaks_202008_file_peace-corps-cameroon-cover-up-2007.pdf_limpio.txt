this is factual account of the circumstan ces pertaining to peace corps trainee erica williams summary dismissal from the pccameroon program in november 07 and the events which followed after her arrival in th states the central issue here is the unethical methods employed by peace corps administration in washington dc to coverup the grievous errors of country dire ctor ericas father david williams is the original author only minor edits have b een made namely repl acement of the term country manager with country director and some typo corrections from the original email text aside from this substantive content has been changed the following was written and emailed to family and friends on november 27 2007 from dave williams jdwilliams74centurytelnet date tues november 27 2007 mailedby centurytelnet erica is home from cameroon and will be re assigned to another country she lived through two weeks of hellish nightmare something one should have had to endure all at the direction of the peace corps we are still working to fully understand what took place and to determine who within the p eace corps organization was responsible for putting erica through this ordeal quite pos sibly those responsibl were not only the isolated in country cameroon peace corps repr esentatives but also people working for the peace corps in washington erica has meeting scheduled for december 18 with the director of the peace corps to try to get answer s answers that will help her decide if she will continue her plan to serve in the peace corps here are the high points of the ordeal it is an interwoven story of two alleged away from post violations and robbery ill do my best to make it as clear as possible but as you will see it is rather complex the net of it is that the peace corps trumped up some false charges against erica to protect camer oonian familys reputation they forced her to resign and then within ten minutes of her resignation they acknowledged that they made terrible mistake the resignation letter was torn up and she was placed on an interrupted service status which is used when peace corps volunteer needs to leave their country of service due to ci rcumstances beyond their control on two occasions the peace corps says erica was not at post she was not where she was supposed to be on the first occasion th ey are correct although the circumstances surrounding the away are fully understandable in fact she probably took the correct action the second occasion was at wors t combination of misunderstanding and miscommunication but quite possibly setup to lay the foundation for ericas removal from cameroon during this period of incidents ericas ip od and money were stolen from her locked room at her homestay familys house the p eace corps representative said not to involve the police and that he would tr to work things out bad situation turns worse the family is now tarnished forever as an ameri can was robbed in their home they take the position that the family is the victim not er ica they longer allow the peace corps homestay coordinator to visit thei r house erica is left to defe nd for herself it turns out that the host mother was the thief erica receives written repr imand for being away from post all of the other peace corps trainees 38 sign letter to the p eace corps declaring their support for erica and that all involved know it to be result of miscommunication and confusion surrounding the peace corps homestay policy the other p eace corps volunteers are told that when they signed up for the peace corps that they also signed up to support the organization and the letterpetition does not support their ob ligation to support the peace corps nonetheless all seems to be ok sort of except that one day later ericas homestay father delivers letter to the peace corps two days later erica is summoned to app ear before the peace corps cameroon country director james ham four hours away she meets with him the following morning does an hour presentation on what happened with the away from posts the robbery the homestay family problems her motivations sire to serve everything that she could possibly think of to say with discussion the country director tells her she can either resign or be kicked out of the peace corps reason is given fo r the termination indication of what happened or why was provided additionally the contents of the letter from the homestay father were not revealed and to t op things off she needed to decide within one hour if she would resign or be kicked out normally volunteer is given 24 hours to decide but since the next day is thanksgivi ng she needed to be on plane that day through the efforts of our good friends john an d maureen king i was able to speak with the director of the peace corp s as he was passing through an airport on his way to south dakota and thanksgiving holiday t hank goodness for blackberries this conversation led to postponing of the decision until friday and also that erica should be informed of the reasons for the separation after 4050 emails and many many phone calls ll looking for support or to get people to understand the rest of the story we finally get to friday after noon when erica again meets with the country director he inform s her that because she was away from post on two occasions she must resign or be kicked out she resigns nd with it her life long dream to serve in the peace corps is over while erica is getting the news in cameroon the peace corps chief of staff calls to give the news i press bit to find out what actually happened and why i asked what role the robbery and the family had in her termination his response was that erica had read the peace corps rules and signed stat ement indicating so one of the rules was that ipods needed to be locked up in thei r footlockers and ericas ipod was not locked up i laughed out loud belly laugh i apol ogized for the outburst and knew it was over but it gets better ten minutes after erica is forced to resi gn the country director calls her back into is office he was crying and apologized to her for their terrible mistake that they did not support her dur ing her dealings with the robb ery and the host family he tore up her resignation letter nd said she would be placed on interrupted service status would return to the us and would be reassigned all sounds good butthe country director says that erica could stay in cameroon and continue to serve there she says that sh would be interested in understanding how that would work would she be safe would the hos t family come after her to protect their reputation how would the country director support her differe ntly in the future as he had obviously failed her with this incident so the country directors respons is that she has five minutes to decide if she is going to stay in cameroon or return to the us and if she stays but later determines that she would not be safe or would not get the neces sary support from the peace corps that then she would be back to the original deal resign or be kicked out pa rt of the pressure to decide quickly was that they had already purchased nonrefundable ticket for her and couldnt afford another ticket on another da or did they want to do anything and everything possible to get her out of the country why erica left friday night and rrived saturday night in gatos she enjoyed leftovers from thanksgiving obviously there are many many questions to be asked and answered this is much more than some one handling situation poor ly after the robbery everything changed and it was clear that the peace corps wanted erica out of cameroon why hopefully she will have good meeting later th is month with the director of the peace corps if not you may be reading more detailed description of what happened in another medium besides the obvious story of an attempted wrongful termination there could be an interesting story about how the ited states operates in countries rampant with corruption and does the united states have to lower its values of honesty and integrity to achieve their goa ls in those countries as i said earlier this is complex seri of events interwove n with the hopes and aspirations of young woman wanting to help those less fortunate and large bureaucracy made up of individuals in pos itions of power with motivations not necessarily aligned with those who they are charged to keep safe in difficult situations thousands of miles from home dave ps ericas blog is httpericawilliamscameroonblogspotcom the last entry is prior to these two weeks of hell june 10 2008 the story got weirder and weir der and unfortunately the nightmare continued for some time when erica called to say that the country director tore up he r resignation letter i placed call to the deputy director of the peace corps i had been in regular contact with him from wednesday morning on he d heard nothing about the terrible mistake made by the country director and that eri ca could stay and continue to serve in cameroon his recommendation was that erica should come home under the interrupted service status sp end the holidays with the fami ly and then in january look at where she would be reassi gned i pointed out to him th at the peace corps had royally screwed over erica and that the peace corps ow ed her and that she should be offered any assignment in any country where the peace corps operated he agreed on monday after thanksgiving erica scheduled meeting with ron tschetter to be held in washington dc on december 18 she also had conversation with the africa regional manager who was supportive of her retu rning to africa and points out that more options would be available to her if she was interested in serving in more than french language only countries he commits to provide her list of countri and the departure dates for each so that erica can make the deci sion as to where she w ould like to serve during the beginning of december erica receives an email from the peace corps with attachments that must be filled out and retu rned to the peace corps so that she can re apply to the peace corps this is exactly contrary to her status and it turns out some of her concerns when she was leaving cameroon were valid erica emailed ron tschetter asking about the reapplication and receive d response from the deputy director reassuring her that she need not reapply also during this time erica receives several phone calls from the health department at the peace corps telling her that she needs to go through physi cal exams blood work etc if she is going to serve in the peace corps er ica finally gets through to them that she is not applying to the peace corps that she is in an interrupted service status has never left the peace corps and that if they have more questions to speak with ron tschetter as she has his assurance that she is in the peace corps and this might be the best erica receive s and email from the boston area college recruiter for the peace corps the woman that erica initially met to start the application process this woman says that she is sorry that erica had to l eave cameroon that she understands it was for medical reasons and that if erica did not want to talk about it that would be okay erica contacts the woman and finds out that the peace corps reason for erica leaving cameroon was becau erica had broken leg week prior to ericas meeting with ron tschetter she is called by someone at the african desk and is told that she has three country options mali senegal and mauritania erica speaks with the deputy di rector and asks about the commitment to offer her any country in africa and is told th at these are three good c ountries and that she should pick one this is not quite the res ponse one would expect after having the number two person in the organization acknowledge th at they screwed over volunteer and then that they would offer her any country in africa on december 18 erica arrives at peace corp s headquarters for her meeting with ron tschetter to her surprise in the room are ron tschetter director of the peace corps david leiner deputy director of the peace corps representative from peace corps africa and representative from the college re cruiting group one can imagine that this might have been very intimidating gathering for twentytwo year old she began her one hour presentation on her ordeal and he r quest to find what happened and why it happened and to do everything she could to make sure that another pcv would never have to go through the same thing one of her strongest motives to set up the meeting was to see how her story could help peace corps become better organization after her presentation tschette r asks the group if there ar any questions there being questions tschetter tells erica that both the peace corps and erica made mistakes and the best thing to do is to move forward he says that they have offered three good choices and she should pick one she described to that at this point she knew she was in the middle of bureaucratic coverup that was being orchestrated by pros nonetheless she continued to press on she pointed out that the supposed reasons for terminating her and the reasons for tearing up her resignation letter were not related she asked what happened to her and why the response was they could go back over ever ything and nothing woul d change and there were just too many volunteers t oo many languages to go back she was told just to pick one of the country options that pc had so graciously offered she asked what was in the letter written by th host father they would not tell her but did tell her to pick one of the three country options offered she stated that she felt the peace corps was not truthful to her and that people in that room were not being truthful to her that got rise from tschetter but again the response was they could go back over everything and not hing would change and to pick one of the country options in exasperation she said she was just tr ying to figure out why she was there in washington dc and not back in cameroon serving in her villag serving the hundreds of people she had met on her site visit and w ho were waiting for her expecting her to fulfill her promise of twoyear service tschetters response was that you called the meeting i met erica immediately after she left the m eeting and the peace corps headquarters father should never have to see his daughter in such distress pain misery and anguish as she realizes that her lifelong dr eam to serve in the peace corps and help others in need is over and all of this the result of bureaucrats who are more inte rested in their careers than in providing the necessary suppor t to those in their charge in march with her future still unsure eri ca calls the peace corps to keep her options open and tells them that she will accept the post in senegal their response is that she can not accept the post because there has been offer of post in senegal another call to the deputy director clears up this latest c onfusion this last confusion pushed erica enough over the edge to really say goodbye to her peace corps dreams attachment interrupted service pct jame s t hamdirector pccameroon 11262007 to ifov info cdu from james t
