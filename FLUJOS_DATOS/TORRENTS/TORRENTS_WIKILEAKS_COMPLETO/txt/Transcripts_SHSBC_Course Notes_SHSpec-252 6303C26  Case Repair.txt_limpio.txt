6303c26 shspec252 case repair worry is the occupational hazard of the auditor doing routine 2 and 3 the time to worry is when the pc looks and feels bad dont plow on at that point find what is wrong case repair can become necessary once goal has been found and run if the goal has not been run all it takes is prepcheck to straighten it out sometimes goal has been found which wasnt ready to be found or run and the auditor starts finding items that are out of another gpm then routine 2g comes into case repair see hcob 13apr63 routine 2g and 6303c21 shspec251 r2g series the actions you should take when one goal has been run and it has disappeared are resident in r2g1 or r2g2 not in r3m you list goals against items null old lists run r2g1 prepcheck an old goal etc if youve got items from different gpm in order to find goal from the items you have got you need to use r2g you will appreciate the fact that some class iv has checked out goal and verified that it rocket read when you try to find the matching items say you had an old goal which has been listed out on 114 lines and which longer ticks but on which there was once an fn or say someone had wrongly worded source list or someone made up his own line plot and got sick the primary datum of all case repair applies to all these situations all these weird actions are incapable of deranging gpm gpms are almost impervious to improper r3m though the pc can be made sick and caved in so at any stage of case repair anything that was done right will stay right and anything done wrong can be corrected r3m stops working where it is done wrong anything that has been found on the pc has been found even if it is not correctly aligned as yet that an item was found out of place doesnt alter the gpm where it belongs r3m will still work fine we can call the whole bank the goals problem masses and one gpm gpm one goal and packet of items equals gpm r3m is what handles the repair of messed up gpms if you want to know exactly what gpm is and the explanation for the formation of the gpm read dmsmh wherever it says engram in the explanation of why people have engrams put in item or gpm it is quite interesting there is reason why the thetan postulated each goal it was born out of the goal that the thetan has just survived only the first goal of the bank is postulated from nothing the only thing that can upset gpm is the exact auditing that we give it it hangs together by violence or lack of it so it is accustomed to violence and mistakes practically auditing goof can affect it though you can make pc unhappy and miserably uncomfortable by making auditing goofs you will upset the pc but you wont upset his bank however you are not running the pc you are running gpm with the pcs cooperation the varying length of gpm depends on how well it served the pc as survival mechanism that doesnt vary much although the difference of line plots gives the appearance of more variation this occurs because some items found are extraneous and others are strays from other line plots if you cant find anything while doing r3m you have goofed and you are looking in the wrong place it is not that there is nothing there or that the gpm has gotten messed up in case repair at any stage of auditing the gpm find the first wrong action that you can find behind you and do it right if piece or item of gpm is missing you can always find it and put it in you can do goals oppose list to start it and stop it also dont just straighten out the pcs straighten out the auditor who goofed get him to study the bulletins and find what he didnt get it could be that he never read them otherwise he will keep making the same mistake handle case repair as though it were clear test compare the goal to the line plot and see if they relate put in buttons on the goal get it to fire or at least tick go over your line plot and read each item against the meter if one rockslams even though it is from source list and has been opposed you know the source list was improperly handled any item that reads matter how slightly after having itself been opposed came off wrongly done or handled list that is stable datum if it rocket reads you have guarantee that there has been wrong way oppose the only guarantee is that the list it came from is wrong correct that list what you want is the earliest item on the line plot that now reads look behind it at the line plot on which it appeared and do that list correctly if you dont find something wrong with it the error is earlier look at items that were found earlier what happens when you do wrongway oppose it usually throws the pc out of the right gpm into another gpm and gives you stray item that looks out of place on the plot so seeing stray look at the list it came from one test for which way to list is to call the question each way the one that turns on more mass is the wrong one you should get good enough to recognize it by significance as all gpms follow the pattern in hcob 13mar63 in case repair having found the right item just proceed as though the subsequent items had never been found repair case that needs repair dont just blunder on if the pc arc breaks use the assessment bulletin bulletin not available but is based on list of fifteen causes of arc breaks in r2 and r3 given in hcob 14mar63 urgent routine 2 routine 3 arc breaks handling of p 3 to find out what was really wrong dont just try to spot it or guess the cause of rough arc break is withheld from both the auditor and the pc dont put figurefigure into what you are doing just be sure that you are doing r3m right
