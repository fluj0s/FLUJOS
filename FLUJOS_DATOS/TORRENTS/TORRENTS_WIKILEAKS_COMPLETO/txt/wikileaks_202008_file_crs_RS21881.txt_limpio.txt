national strategy to combat weapons of mass destruction wmd proliferation the bush administration highlighted its more activist approach while noting that traditional nonproliferation measures such as diplomacy arms control threat reduction assistance and export controls should be enhanced the strategy placed increasing emphasis on countering proliferation once it has occurred and managing the consequences of wmd use in particular interdiction of wmdrelated goods gained more prominence us policy sought to enhance the capabilities of our military intelligence technical and law enforcement communities to prevent the movement of wmd materials technology and expertise to hostile states and terrorist organizations2 president bush unveiled the proliferation security initiative psi in krakow poland on may 31 2003 deemed foremost among president bushs efforts to stop wmd proliferation psi appears to be new channel for interdiction cooperation outside of treaties and multilateral export control regimes3 it may informally expand the number 1 this update was prepared with the assistance of jill marie parillo research associate 2 white house national strategy to combat weapons of mass

group and the missile technology control regime ten nations initially joined the united states to improve cooperation to interdict shipments on land sea or in the air of wmd their delivery systems and related materials six other nations joined subsequently although denmark and turkey did not join as core members see table 1 below according to state department officials the core group defined the basic principles of interdiction and worked to expand support but was disbanded in august 2005 after india complained of discrimination among psi members the united states is strongly encouraging india to join psi but with little success so far4 table 1 psi founding members north america europe asiapacific canada denmark not core australia united states france japan

bush administration often states that more than 70 nations support the initiative5 but it is unclear what support means according to information released by the state department requirements for support appear to be fairly weak for example participating states are encouraged to emphasis added in italics formally commit to and publicly endorse if possible the statement of principles review and provide information on current national legal authorities and indicate willingness to strengthen authorities as appropriate identify specific national assets that might contribute to psi efforts

training exercises and actual operations as they arise be willing to consider signing relevant agreements or to otherwise establish concrete basis for cooperation with psi efforts6 psi has international secretariat offices in federal agencies established to support it database or reports of successes or failures and established funding many consider the lack of formal mechanisms an advantage and point instead to high level meetings in europe australia and the united states the agreement on set of principles in september 2003 and cooperative exercises to test interdiction procedures7 others however question the seriousness of the administrations effort as well as its sustainability as long as formal mechanisms are created8 the current configuration holds nothing particularly to bind psi adherents to this cooperative endeavor since its inception there has been little by which to measure psis success secretary of state rice on the second anniversary of psi announced that psi was responsible for 11 interdictions in the previous nine months9 on june 23 2006 under secretary for arms control and international security robert joseph reported that httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21881 between april 2005 and april 2006 psi partners worked together on roughly two dozen separate occasions to prevent transfers of equipment and materials to wmd and missile programs in countries of concern10 he also said that psi cooperation stopped exports to irans missile program and the export of heavy waterrelated equipment to irans nuclear program however it is unclear how this achievement compares with efforts conducted prior to the initiative even if psi has resulted in more interdictions than before can this be attributed to the success of psi or an upsurge in proliferation activity nonetheless many observers believe psi is good effort the 911 commission recommended that the united states seek to expand psis membership11 the european union and the g8 fully endorse psi12 and several proposed bills in the 109th congress have specifically called for expansion of psi or support for psi sconres 36 hconres 133 sconres 40 hr 422 hr 665 hr 5017s

related programs funds for psi activities and hr 5017 and s 3456 would authorize 50 million to conduct joint training exercises psi objectives methods and targets psis longterm objective is to create web of counterproliferation partnerships through which proliferators will have difficulty carrying out their trade in wmd and missilerelated technology13 the bush administration has emphasized that psi is an activity not an organization which seeks to develop new means to disrupt wmd trafficking at sea in the air and on land14 however very few new means of disruption appear yet to have been developed although old means may be applied more rigorously there are differing opinions on enhancing international legal authority for interdictions on the high seas and in international airspace some states prefer to continue working on psi within existing international law whereas others like the us would like to enhance or change international law to expand the capability to interdict potential wmdrelated transfers several approaches may help improve interdiction efforts first participating httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21881 states have agreed to review their own relevant national legal authorities to ensure that they can take action second participating states resolve to take action and to seriously consider providing consentto boarding and searching of its own flag vessels by other states15 third participating states seek to put in place agreements such as ship boarding agreements with other states in advance so that time is lost should interdiction be required so far the united states has signed shipboarding agreements in 2004 with panama the marshall islands and liberia and in 2005 with croatia cyprus and belize such arrangements typically allow two hours to deny us personnel the right to board ship the united states reportedly has consulted with two dozen countries on shipboarding agreements16 fourth approach is to conduct interdiction exercises psi participants reportedly have trained for maritime interdiction in the mediterranean arabian sea and western pacific ocean all areas that are particularly prone to proliferation trafficking17 in all psi has conducted 23 joint interdiction exercises as of august 200618 as many describe it psi relies on the broken taillight scenario officials look for all available options to stop suspected transport of wmd or wmdrelated items in practice cargos can be seized in ports if they violate the host states laws hence the focus on strengthening domestic laws on the high seas ships have the rights of freedom of the seas and innocent passage under the law of the sea convention and customary 13 bolton march 30 2004 hirc testimony 14 ibid 15 see september 2003 statement of interdiction principles 16

boarding but not necessarily cargo seizure19 according to state department lawyer as of 2005 authority had been worked out to legally seize cargo in addition key gap in the psi framework is that it applies only to commercial not government transportation government vehicles ships planes trucks etc cannot legally be interdicted thus the missile shipments picked up by pakistani c130 in the summer of 2002 in north korea reported by the new york times in november 2002 could not have been intercepted under psi the october 2003 interdiction of shipment of uranium centrifuge enrichment parts from malaysia to libya illustrates the need for multilateral cooperation the malaysianproduced equipment was transported on germanowned ship bbc china leaving dubai passing through the suez canal the ship was diverted into the italian port of taranto where it was searched passage through the highlyregulated suez canal may give authorities an opportunity to delay ships and find reason to board them in an interview in november 2003 thensecretary bolton suggested that wmd interdiction would target shipments to rogue states and terrorists that pose the most immediate threat20 in the case of rogue states it may be relatively easy to target httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21881 shipments to iran and north korea and their transhipment points but targeting terrorist acquisitions may place serious strain on intelligence gathering on february 11 2004 president bush proposed expanding psi to address more than shipments and transfers including shutting down facilities seizing materials and freezing assets21 to some observers it is difficult to imagine how national authorities could shut down facilities seize materials and freeze assets particularly if the material and equipment in question is dualuse which would normally place the burden on the export destination however on april 28 2004 the security council passed unsc resolution 1540 which requires all states to criminalize proliferation enact strict export controls and secure all sensitive materials within their borders22 unscr 1540 called on states to enforce effective domestic controls over wmd and wmdrelated materials in production use storage and transport to maintain effective border controls and to develop national export and transshipment controls over such items all of which should help interdiction efforts the resolution did not however provide any enforcement authority nor did it specifically mention interdiction or psi in april 2006 the security council adopted resolution 1673 which extended the mandate of the 1540 committee for two years and asked the committee to formally report to the security council later than april 27 2008 compilation of information on the status of states implementation of all aspects of resolution 154023 19 see crs report rl32097 weapons of mass destruction counterproliferation legal issues for ships and aircraft 20 the proliferation security initiative an interview with

which prohibits us persons from doing business with entities designated because of their proliferation activities24 on june 23 2006 66 psi states participated in high level political meeting in poland which focused on developing closer ties with the business community to further prevent any financial support to the proliferation of wmd25 issues for congress members of the 109th congress introduced eight bills and resolutions that call for strengthening expanding and funding psi sconres 36 hconres 133 sconres 40 hr 422 hr 665 hr 5017s 3456 pl 109102 section 599a and s 2566 geographic expansion is key issue particularly how to engage china and india as well states in important regions like the arabian peninsula26 congress may also consider how intelligence resources are handled is intelligence sufficient and are there intelligencesharing requirements with nonnato allies also how is psi coordinated with other federal interdictionrelated programs eg export control assistance one potential complication for congressional oversight of psi is the absence of way to httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21881 measure psis success relative to past efforts 24 see
