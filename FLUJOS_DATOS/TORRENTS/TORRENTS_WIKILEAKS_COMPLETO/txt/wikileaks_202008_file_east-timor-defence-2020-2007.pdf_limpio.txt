been to feel secure collective sec urity is phenomenon of the human psyche designed to collecti vely defend social purpose past insecurity resul ting from foreign occupation of timorleste has shaped our experience of defending ou r country collective ly defence is fundamental pillar in the construction of the timor nation the collective sense of security is now enshrined in the constitution as guarantee of the nations sec urity and stability defence is sensitive subject that merits special treatment in defining and analysing its essence in the process of development of nation integrated into the worl d strategic environment as coordinator of this arduous and difficult study i felt rewarded by the knowledge nd experience i acquired in the groups working discussi ons and from the research selectively carried out on matters of collective defence in the previous decade during the pr ocess of the liberation of timorle ste and until the restoration of the democratic republic of timorleste hasty and illprepared discussions t ook place between the leaders of the resistance about the future of independent timorle ste with or without armed forces various ideas were put forward on the armed forces option which were supported by leaders in the diaspora and insid the country meanwhile in the mountains the falintil continued to fight for freedom the uncertainties about the future of the falintil following the cantonment of 1999 made this option almost realisable the future of the falintil was abandone d to the plans of the united nations and became securi ty dilemma for timorleste bsequently an honourable outcome was fo und with the creation of the falintil fdtl in 2001 based on the kings college study th is was typical united nations study vehicle fo r the introduction of socalled externally imposed strate gic concepts study that led to delicate transi tion situation without the participation open discussi on and commitment of timorese leaders currently after five years of the development of t he falintilfdtl 20012006 various constraints nd successes have been identified as can be seen from this document however there continue to be omissions and inactivity on the part of the government of the democratic re public of timorleste in dealing with the subject of national defence demonstrated by lack f institutional experience political will and cons istent decisionmaking by intern compromises about the priorities for national velopment and external compromises whose strategic interests overshadow na tional interests and by constant procrastination i n reaching concerted strategic political understand ing after two years of constant work by the force 2020 study group we now present the 1st strategic blueprint for the development of the armed forces of timorle ste 20052020 this is first strategic reflection analysis and decision paper on the velopment of the armed forces of timo rleste it is timorese owned document that invites all the countrys leaders to participate in critical analysis and debate about natio nal defence and the armed forces that timorleste needs in the 3rd millennium it provides information to help them with their analyses and decisionmaking in that it provides the background anal yses and indicators about the geostrategic political economic and military impo rtance of timorleste and it offers conclusions and recommendations for the development of the armed fo rces of timorleste for the period 20052020 and futur perspectives for 20202050 and 20502075 ffoorrccee 22002200 9 this first strategic document on the issues of the defence of timorleste is the result of the work carried out between july 2004 and may 2006 by the force 2020 st udy group gef2020 multinational study group w hich i had the pleasure of coordinating the study grou p debated divergent and contradictory views and opi nions from members of different backgrounds but it formu lated conclusions and recommendations informed by the higher interests of timorleste this document could end up gathering du st on the shelves out of inertia and ck of will on the part of timorese leaders or because of past geostrateg ic commitments however we should not miss the opp ortunity to discuss this document with the timorese public with view to achieving an informed consensus on matters of colle ctive defence and on the strategic role of th armed forces in national development the leaders of the beloved people of timorleste ve duty and responsibili ty to promote coherent institutional dialogue and establish ongoing commun ication between the timorese be transparent and credible in the affairs of state encourage the participation f the people in national development be inclusive open to dialogue and convergent in the collec tive definition of the supreme interests of timorl and of concerted and integrated national defence policy in national strategic development and take the necessary decis ions for its implementation monitori ng and ongoing evaluation the errors of the past must not be repeated in arri ving at strategic decisions about the future the histo rical process has enriched the present with the confidenc to find again our future path the present in dialectical terms absorbs the inheritance of the past and pla nts and cultivates the timorese spirit of generations to come dili

current reality of the world with th intention of interpreting the past and placing it i n the present context of geopolitical and geostrate gic interests shows that nations by excessive use and abuse of power drag vulnerable countries into their economic dominion this is the clear reality that is visible even if inadmissible to th eyes and consciences of each one of us in timorleste war after war resistance grew to enormous proportions shared sense of peace emerged from its own vulnerability that was estab lished pedagogically in the spirit of the people this sentiment held the people together through the period of secular resistance the wars of foreign occupation the political conflicts of fratricidal violence and later the tragic military interventi on and annexation of timorleste by indonesia which led t continuing and widespread deaths destruction and suffering across all parts of socie ty it was in this historic framework that timor leste gained its sovereignty for peace and liberty an unconditional refusal to repeat the events impos ed in the past is constant indicator that moulds the character of national defence we must instil now and in the future convincing and overwhelming desire for peace and liberty in the ex ercise of national sovereignty to bring about durable independence that sees timorleste reborn s just and prosperous society timorleste as an independent country is subject to threats in the same way as other nations on the international stage as timorleste progressively d evelops in the direction of these global changes it is foreseeable that its needs will alter systema tically and its strategic environment will adapt to the dynamic reality that exists similar development must occur in the armed forces with the objective of affirming them as professional eff icient and integrated force indispensable for the defence of the nation 2 national challenges the dark shadows of the past show the vulnerabili ty of timorleste to other countries desire to impose their geopolitical economic and strategic interests future development must successfully integrate the exercise of democratic state with the establishment of political balance in the national and international context the dynamic concept of modern economic system and the definition of the objectives of security in holis tic strategy of national defence as foundation for these objectives the state of timorleste must as priority establish standard of national development and be responsible for investment in t he training of human resources as priority for the state and for systematically strengthening the intellectual fabric human capital structural capital and institutional capital as the principal objectives towards achieving national development national development must be guided by an integrate d perspective of two concepts the concept of continental territorial orientation and the cept of maritime orientation both must be balanced in the national development plan given the geographic characteristics and circumstances of timorleste which is an archipelago nation with the potential maritime resources to guarantee its sustainable development the maritime vocation may be political orientatio n of the state of the rdtl taking on the role of maritime state considering the strategic aspects t hat may sustain and reinforce the instruments of ffoorrççaa 22002200 14 economic power of the nation energy resources in the sea fishing maritime communication routes sloc sea line of communications maritime transport and portage maritime tourism management of the sea environment and marine resou rces maritime security and defence scientific research and the development of range of specialised human resource training measures in the maritime sector the national development pl an and the current development of the state do not reflect balanced perception that would lead t development paradigm integrating the concepts of maritime orientation and continental or ientation as recently born nation the creation of intrati morese platforms for public discussion is suggested in relation to the road map for national development in addition to the road map human development is indispensable to harmonise t he moral spiritual social and cultural condition of the population and the consequent reconstruction of national identity which are them selves fundamental conditions for ac hieving these national development objectives if not the emotional state and the distorted menta lity of the population after the difficult process of liberation during the various conflicts and wars of occupation and the complex integration in the process of national independence from the interven tions to the imposition of peace in timorleste may come to constitute abundant and latent grounds for new internal conflict 3 regional alliances the liberation of timorleste was paid for by the p eople themselves with very high toll of life its independence constituted the solemn commitment of t he state of rdtl towards its people and before the international community in this context the national development and affirmation of timorleste inevitably require global integrated nd participative involvement in the spirit of mutua l understanding with immediately neighbouring countri nearby countries and the rest of the world through the establishment of multilateral and bilat eral alliances and other partnerships of cooperation without geostrategic restrictions tim orleste will be able to conduct permanently the strategic exercise of conflict management by seek ing suitable solutions to respond to the types of common military and nonmilitary threats that may c ompromise national andor international security timorleste is nation situated simultaneously in asia and the pacific and for this reason it is justified in playing an active role in the councils of asia and the southeast pacific asean is an organisation that timorleste must join to gain cre dentials and exclusive political and economic opportunities as member of the arf asean re gional forum timorle ste will obtain some guarantees of security from its immediate and near neighbours from perspective of future cooperation in common security it is also necessar to consider the fact that participation in multilateral forums may lead to greater bilateral c ooperation in questions related to security it is imperative for timorleste to intensify coope ration with indonesia and develop trilateral dialogue between jakarta canberra and dili timor leste has crucial role to play in fostering triangular partnership with indonesia and australia the format of the trilateral ministerial meeting between australia indonesia and timorleste is s pecific organisation that must be considered within the scope of military cooperation possibly starting with the conversations that will result eventually in the intensification of the process f training and later combined exercises ffoorrççaa 22002200 15 the principal objectives of timorlestes regional security must be addressed through the creation of cooperative external security environment comp atible with the dimension of economic growth social development and national political stability the best way of achieving these objectives is to strengthen relations with indonesia and australia and to increase or enhance the nations diplomatic influence whenever possible by joining region organisations mentioned above timorleste must actively cultivate links with other states wit h influence in the region in particular china jap an and india and the asean states such as malaysia s ingapore thailand and the philippines timor leste must intensify its security links with the us as the worlds superpower vital component in terms of timorlestes ability to guarantee its future security is to become involved in broadbased local alliances and in oth er international and regional organisations with view to creating an environment where questions of regional relations can be covered in dynamic and significant way security is fundamental comp onent of international and regional involvement and the focus of many regional and multilateral for ums has been enlarged to include modern threats to security as well as establishing regional measur against these threats the overall stability and security situation in the region obliges timorleste to develop and decisively engage in international cooperation and in the peaceful resolution of conflicts thus the involvement of timorleste in wide range of inter national forums especially in the asiapacific region will be priority the contribution of tim orleste towards global peace and security will be provided in large measure by its strong engagement and active role within the scope of the and of other multilateral organisations among which the countries of the cplp and other neighbouring countries and the region mentioned above will be pecially important as set out in the constitution timorleste will maintain privileged links with th countries that have portuguese as their official language1 and timorleste will maintain special links of fr iendship and cooperation with neighbouring countries and those in the region 2 4 global strategy the threats and risks to national regional and int ernational security assume today multifaceted unforeseeable and transnational character as res ult of the nature of system characterised by interdependence multipolarity and heterogeneous p olitical cultural and social models in this new security environment to traditional threats and risks are added the risks of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction the dangers arising fr om the inappropriate use of new technologies those provoked by failure in the maintenance and co ntrol of nuclear biological and chemical equipment and materials using the concept of international concern literally in the meaning of strategic concern ab out the new and complex sources of instability to security and world peace the world powers have been developing broader concepts of security as an essential means of managing controlling and confronting the challenges tending to lead to crise s and conflicts in the present climate the concept has ceased to be concerned with objectives solely c entred on vital interests associated with the 1 constitution of the rdtl article 8 no3 2 constitution of the rdtl article 8 no4 ffoorrççaa 22002200 16 defence of the territory and sovereignty of states although they still persist and is now more exacting in terms of philosophy of proactive dip lomacy and of global vision of the growth of focal points of international insecurity connected with the arms race and the crises that arise from i t good neighbourly relations between states seek to p revent the aggravation of crises that may be provoked andor imposed with international repercussions timorleste experienced throughout the process of liberation various types of proactive diplomacy scenarios to strengthen the resistance following i ndependence timorleste may constitute strategic paradigm for its immediate neighbours to develop political cooperation for the purposes of the joint security of the countries on the international concern list one way or another timorleste may suffer an imposition of foreign forces in the s ecurity domain if it becomes concern to the pursuance of other states own interests the supremacy of force military power demonstrate d by world powers in the theatre of operations reorients the strategic vision of states in terms f world security by means of policy of broad cooperation in international organisations for coll ective defence timorleste must orientate its national defence policy and progressively adapt it to the circumstances and conditions of the regional and world strategic environment to maxi mise its geopolitical framework and make it relevant to the new millennium 5 national overview it is therefore within this geopolitical and geos trategic picture that the leaders of the state of timorleste will have to define and take the decisi ons that will best serve the national interests specifically on matters related to defence and nati onal security it is considered fundamental to recognise and rigorously evaluate the vulnerabiliti and permanent and constant potentialities that explain the interests that may compromise the secur ity of timorleste taking into account an analysis of the geographic demographic and economi c factors natural resources political administrative factors national identity the poli tical action of its leaders the creation of elements of consensus and participation of mechanisms for nati onal cohesion and the circumstances and fundamental values defined in the strategic environ ment of timorleste 51 geography geographically the island of timor is located i n southeast asia it is around 480 km long and 105 km wide with total surface area f 32350 km2 around 430 km from the australian continent to the south and approximatel 1000 km from the island of java to the north west historically timorleste is made up of the astern part of the island of timor the western part of the island is under indonesian sovereignty the frontiers are defined to the north by the straits of ombai and wetar both important commerci routes to the west by the province of nusa tenggara timur indonesia to the east by the sea of arafura and the island of leti indonesia and to the south by the sea of timor which contai ns reserves of natural gas oil and other abundant marine resources the archipelago structure of timorlest has total surface area of 18899km2 distributed in the following way the principal territory with an area of around 17900km2 the enclave of oecusse with an area of approximately 850km2 the island of ataúro measuring around 144km2 and the islet ffoorrççaa 22002200 17 of jaco measuring around 5km2 it is approximately 265km long and at its widest point is 92km wide the land borders with west timor indonesia total around 220km the coastlines 700km territorial waters 16000km2 and the eez around 75000km2 the geographical position of timorleste may bring benefits if we consider its strategic relevance in the global context to do so we must address and f ocus on the following aspects the geostrategic situation of timorleste between the two great regional powers one to the west and the north with high human potential that accounts for the major share of the land and maritime borders the other to the southeast with high economic potential the maritime frontier with which is still disputed both constit ute situations of high vulnerability for timor leste and constant attempts at strategic influence from one or other of the regional powers b timorleste is situated in critical geographic po sition strategically compromised and must therefore remain firm with decisive and affirmati ve voice the great sunrise agreements bring immediate benefits to the country although t hey suspend the demarcation of the maritime border for 50 years as reciprocal exchan ge with australia fact that generates less lucrative impacts for timorleste these impacts ar felt on at least two levels the first impact directly affects the fishing sector due to the fre eze on the definition and legislation of the eez the second impact is from an anticipated loss of stimated receipts from the maritime transport and ports sector and sea lanes sloc if indonesia demands reciprocal exchange along the same lines c the geographical position of timorleste is fact or of crucial interest to its immediate neighbours for indonesia due to its politi cal and security situation the process of democratisation and its economic development austr alia may from the point of view of security place timorleste within one of its arcs of protection chains of security ie as security insurance in the context of its immediate defence we must remember at this point the bitter experiences of the people of timorleste during the second world war currently the strategic pretensions of both countries remain late nt and continue to be relevant to the development of timorleste d in accordance with the archipelago features that fine timorleste as maritime nation statecentric policy must be adopted in designing t he national defence policy and in the strategic concept of national defence the archipelago structure of the national territory makes timorleste vulnerable to new threats by sea and by land this fact requires the author ities of the state to update the capabilities of the armed forces studying and defining military defence capability that provides for the development of an adequate light naval forc and the restructuring of the land forces f new sophisticated and modern light naval force mu st have the interoperability capability to secure the maritime route through the straits of om bai and wetar which constitutes an important commercial maritime passage for the world market in particular for the escort and security of the tankers that transport crude oil th rough the sea of timor and for other parties who use our territorialjurisdictional waters and exclusive capability for the high level of security required on oil extraction platforms g in the interests and for the development of timorleste the opportunity to invest in the maritime sector must include the possibility of bui lding ports of international calibre for commercial goods transport cargos and containers and the transit of maritime fleets ffoorrççaa 22002200 18 h the importance of ataúro to the security of territo rial waters and the opportunity to establish the disposition of strategic arms of the world powe rs in the region i the importance of baucau airport for use as point of support for indepth aerial attack or as an advanced point of immediate or rearguard defence against other countries constitutes buffer zone that may well be an area of intelli gence operations and permanent surveillance of immediate neighbours j having proactive capability along the land borde rs maintaining the armed forces in coverage zone to establish security interoperabili ty with immediate neighbours and maintaining permanent surveillance of territorial w aters coastal oceanic and eez and in the air and space k opportunely the topographic land characteristics f timorleste the elevations of the north and south slopes offer suitable conditions for the installation of radar and sensing equipment to intercept incursions into territorial waters and maintain strategic surveillance l from the point of view of internal threats the mountainous massif situated in the interior of the territory is difficult to access with various part s of the territory becoming increasingly hazardous in the rainy season and presents part icular difficulty in terms of communications and therefore may constitute an excellent refuge fo r future groups hostile to national stability equally because the principal intradistrict commu nications network passes through dili the capital baucau and maliana these population cent res are all major targets for future actions by hostile groups m we must establish strategic routes as alternatives for communications suitable and integrated maritime and air transport for the purposes of def ence and security and simultaneously to cover public transport needs n the surveying of detailed cartographic and population data using gps global system positioning communications system is sophisticated contribu tion by external agencies to the efficiency of the work of the government of the rdt l however from the point of view of national defence this constitutes vulnerability for timorleste since the external agencies can access and manage detailed information about th geographic and cartographic coordinates of national territory to attain their own strategic objectives airspace as well as being strategic space of permanent national interest mus t be legally protected before any management of usage rights gps airlines transm ission frequencies and others is conceded 52 demography based on the data from the census of population and housing of 2004 we can point out some characteristics that currently defin the demographic profile of timorleste this young rapidly growing population is heavily rural poorly qualified educationally and professionally and mostly living from subsistence activities wheth er in rural areas or urban areas with the exception of dili the capital city where contract ual and remunerated employment opportunities are concentrated although this available employment st ill coexists with vast informal sector commerce and supply of various services as facto rs of social cohesion at the national level catholicism and the tétum language among the immen diversity of national languages stand out as complement more detailed analysis shows tha t the generational factor reveals some elements of internal differentiation within the more generic demographic profile showing in the young and young adult generations for example p ositive variation in rates of schooling and in ffoorrççaa 22002200 19 linguistic ability in the official and working lang uages of the rdtl and strong tendency towards rural exodus in search of employment opportuniti and advanced schooling however even within the young adult generation there is still low lev of qualification associated with high rate of economic activity in the subsistence sector and in the informal sector generating very low incomes corresponding to deficient standard of living tha t characterises the majority of the population at the level of the principal factors of national cohe sion tétum and catholicism both the older and younger generations remain its guardians timorleste has very young demographic profile and rapid growth trend at present the total population of timorleste is approximately 1 millio n people in 2004 there were 923198 inhabitants with an annual growth rate of 32 i n terms of age structure people with an age below 15 represent 43 of the population of timor and the rest of the age structure is made up of the ages between 1519 years representing 10 of th population giving 53 of timors population below the age of 20 in contrast to 41 of the population with ages between 2060 years and only 6 aged 60 or more of whom only 35 are 65 or over contributing factors to this extremely young demographic profile are high fertil ity rates an average of 7 children per woman and low average life expectancy 555 years3 the population is distributed in an unequal way acr oss national

of these languages6 among the schoolage and youngest generations and educated young adul t generations with tendency towards exodus and emigration the proportion of individuals with full linguistic ability is much higher than in the older populations due above all to the high rate of illiteracy and early school leaving that predominates in these last groups and their conseq uent lack of linguistic achievement in terms of religion the timorese population is st rongly homogeneous with catholicism being an important factor in national cohesion the catholic majority 965 of the population cohabits with other minority faiths protestant 22 muslim 03 buddhist 007 hindu 003 amongst others7 in regard to the educational profile of the populat ion in average terms the rate of illiteracy is high 47 of the whole population and the level of scho oling of the population is low only 15 of the population aged 18 or over has gained high school diploma the generation gap means that lower level of illiteracy and longer school educati on can be observed in the generations up to 34 years old however the rates of illiteracy are still hi gh among the younger generations 35 in the 1014 age group 20 in the 1519 age group 26 in the 2024 age group 31 in the 2529 age group and there is still high rate of early sch ool leaving at all educational levels the average proportion of those with diplomas is low whether at the level of secondary education 154 of the population aged 18 years or over or higher educat ion 17 of the population aged 25 or over which in any case represents positive variatio

of timorleste to the level of training and skilling of the nations huma n resources in terms of the profile and structure of employment principal occupation and sectors of economic activity timorleste is still predominantly count ry whose active population is mostly dependant on the subsistence sector in which the high weighting towards subsistence agriculture which occupies 78 of the national workforce is notable the rema ining sectors are largely underdeveloped although there is some employment growth betwe 2 and 4 of the workforce created by the 6 idem tables 205 504 and 508 7 idem table

labourers civil construct ion domestic services etc that occupy approximately 80 of the total workforc and dominate the national picture versus only 20 of the workforce remunerated in the formal sector ie f ullyemployed active population whether for other people or themselves and fully remunerated is one of the principal challenges for the states policies this challenge which is associated wi th growth in the private business sector and the educational and professional qualifications of the population will be even greater if the current hig h rates of fertility an average of 7 children per wo man are maintained as these contribute not only to rapid growth in the active population in medium term but also to maintaining the growth rate of the nonactive population above the growth rate of the active population and will cause strong pressure on the active population in the short term analysing the relation between the age structure an d the structure of economic activity of timors population the census of 2004 shows that among the active population the age groups between 2044 years contribute most to the actual workforce among these it is in the age groups up to 40 years of age that the best educated and best qu alified workforce is found and therefore the workforce that is absorbed by the formal employ ment sector in which the principal employers are the government the ngos the agencies and the p rivate sector strongly dependent on the work force whether qualified and employed in the f ormal sector or unqualified and occupied in the informal and subsistence sectors is the inactive t imorese population which consists of the child population 015 years of age the majority of th population between 1519 years of age although included in the active population category only 15 of this group claim to be in work and most of those are working in the informal and subsistence s ectors and the elderly population with an age of 65 or over which represents only 35 of the na tional population this demographic profile is characterised by high economic dependency index n the part of the child population and rate of growth of the nonactive population higher than in the active population facing very specific challenges at the level of education and profession training policies and of conditions and mechanisms for the creation of real employment pri ncipally in the private sector whose current employment capacity is minimal in the short and medium term offering diversity of formal and contracted economic activities to absorb this workf orce in the near future in terms of being an employer the public sector is not expected to ex pand greatly its principal function must be to create the necessary conditions for the emergence of favourable environment for the creation and growth of employment combining this with strong in vestment in the areas of education training and qualification of the nations human resources nd in the institutional capabilities of the state the complex demographic profile of timorleste scribed above is an important strategic factor for national development below some critical elem ents that emerge from this type of demographic profile are set out along with their impacts in rms of economic growth and national security how to absorb an active and rapidlygrow ing population and improve the levels of per capita income and family life and simultaneously train t he new generations to respond to the future 9 idem tables 603 and 604 ffoorrççaa 22002200 22 challenges of sustainable growth and national devel opment this may constitute the most critical population factor to which we urge soluti ons in the short medium and long term the state of timorleste is responsible for finding an swers and facing the challenge of visualising and creating scenarios and defining effective stra tegies and policies whether in rationalising the framework and participation of the actual activ population in real economic development or in investment in and preparation of the younger generations for the medium and long term challenges in terms of sustainable growth and natio nal development b there will be multiple implications in terms of edu cation training and qualification in the creation of work opportunities decentralised by geo graphic area and by sector improvement of income levels of increase in the quality and quant

that will allow the younger generations to integrate into the trends of internationalisation and globalisation c young people must be given priority in investme nt in active and productive training for the development of the nation there is need to re juvenate the institutions of the state with new dynamic in the framework of global development the institutions of defence specifically the armed

training institutions becoming an emp loyer that offers standards of professionalism ethics and technological progress that meet international standards d over roughly half century there will be dramatic growth in the population of timorleste if effective mechanisms of demographic awareness are not adopted with serious consequences for the socioeconomic framework in the strategic p lan of

it is time to learn the lessons of an exemplary historical process and also think about the enormo us economic and social challenges that timor leste has in front of it despite the terrible expe rience of the indonesian transition the largest questions for timorleste are of an internal order only by guaranteeing democracy to its citizens and defending the human rights will it preserve its international legitimacy and the attention and support of its partners timorleste is an exemplary case due to the politic action of its leaders president xanana gusmão constantly maintains his allegiance to democracy t human rights to pardon reconciliation tolerance unity and national cohesion the international campaigns in defence of the liber ation of timorleste resulted in the nobel peace prize being awarded to the colaureates dr josé ra mos horta and monsignor dom ximenes belo international recognition of the struggle of peop in the name of the values of resistance and humanity however this international mobilisation would be of little value if the crisis and destruction that followed the referendum had not oc curred at the moment of affirmation of the belief that the fundamental values of man are above the in terests of the world powers and as result demand international intervention even when this presents dilemmas to the strategic interests of certain countries in the eyes of the international community it was not in the name of sovereignty that timorleste became independent but in the name of the primac of the rights of all men even those that are not essential to stability in the world as resul t the legitimacy of timorleste resides in its lea ders respect for democracy and the rules of healthy coex istence the identity of timorleste is much more today the result of its struggle for liberty than of its language culture religion or anything that would result from the definition of suppo sed regional enemy timorleste must above all seek its unique place in the world community from position of openness to the world the heritage accumulated during the national lib eration process will be much greater than the capital that results from the exploration of oil or natural gas which will ensure the future of timor leste and guarantee that it will be heard and will have the support of the international community to build truly democratic state the convictions of the current leaders are not sufficient however elements of consensus and participation need to be created along with mechanisms for national cohesion training and skilling the citizens and th functionaries of the state and creating solid institutions appropriate to democratic state building national identity with the values of res istance liberty human rights and democracy in the development of an ethical and patriotic conscio usness constitutes present challenge in the national and international strategic context timor leste must create and continue to develop new

confer unity on it subordinate to the fundamental law whi ch is the constitution of the rdtl authority established in harmony with the law and in accorda nce with international law the institutions of

has become the 191st member of the an affirmative global framework for its soverei gnty an inalienable sovereignty is merited by all independent states in the exercise of their interna tionally recognised legal power this privilege of being sovereign has moved beyond the efforts of com mon feeling of the international community to converge on sovereignty of equality and of solidari ty the international community has systematically given timorleste its support for velopment has stimulated the strengthening of the systems of construction of the state and the p reservation of the values of liberty fully attained by the supremacy of the national resistance struggl national resistance that for 24 years brandished its right to the independence that was d enied to it and ignored by neighbouring states and by the international community the facets of the transactional historical process ie the process of transformation from the bottom up culminate with the achievement and construction of free and sovereign timorleste we enjoy today our liberty in newborn democratic state th at we need to build strengthen and make credible to enable us to complete the systematic c onsolidation of our independence in framework of global development with clear definition s of our coexistence as free and democratic independent and sovereign nation among the other nations of the world the development of the internal policy of timorleste has democratic des tiny in light of the national interest the tangibl development of national cohesion poses permanentl the political challenge of the construction and strengthening of the exercise of the democratic sta and of its institutions of pluralism of inclusiveness dialogue and reconciliation of repr esentation and legitimacy of credibility and transparency of constitutionality of respect for the rights freedoms and guarantees of all citizens of the supremacy of the common collective intere st over individual partisan and corporative interests the political system of timorleste is founded on semipresidential regime with power divided between the president of the republic and the nati onal parliament although the president has the power to dissolve parliament in practice executive power is in the hands of the prime minister who takes decisions in the forum of the council of mini sters simultaneously the system promotes the coexistence of foreign policy with preventative d iplomacy along national interest lines for the promotion and establishment of interstate cooperat ion in regional and international dimension in order to achieve the global objectives of developme nt and lasting peace in timorleste ffoorrççaa 22002200 25 timorleste is dedicated constitutionally to the principle of administrative decentralisation of its territory currently it is divided into 13 distric ts 65 subdistricts councils 498 sucos parish and 2336 villages each one of these districts has capital and is m ade up in its turn by sub districts between 3 and 7 with an average of five of all the districts viqueque is largest in area 1884 km2 and the district of the capital dili has the smal lest area 364 km2 each of the 67 sub districts also has capital and an administrative subdivision into parishes varying between 2 and 18 per district the largest subdistrict is lospal in lautém which has an area of 635 km2 and the smallest is nain feto in dili which is 6 km2 the geographical division of the districts and b districts shows trend towards greater administrat ive segmentation in the central and western zones of the territory the recent administrative division of national terr itory into four regions under the stewardship of 4 secretaries of state and secretary of state in r esidence in oecusse constitutes new stage in the consolidation of decentralised administrative power however this objective will only be fully accomplished if it is transformed into process of real politicaladministrative decentralisation an d accompanied by decentralisation of productive ca pacity 55 natural resources natural resources are one of the vital and strat egic vectors sustaining the development of country however natural re sources are also subject to global dispute phenomena providing opportunities for multidimens ional conflicts characterised by strategic interest wars timorleste has been endowed by natu re with various types of abundant natural resources distributed as category and b vital and strategic and category c nonvital and non strategic minerals oil gas and possibly hydroe nergy list follows of the natural resources in timorleste defined by category energy resources oil and natural gas hydro energy solar energy wind energy b minerals manganese gold silver tin chromium p hosphates bentonite marble dolomite wollastonite gypsum china clay raw material for ceramics and porcelain potassium deposits the government of rdtl has prioritised the deve lopment of an energy economy centred on the petroleum sector as complement the extraction nd exploration of other types of energy resources and existing minerals may come to re ceive state investment such as investment and development capital and as reserves for the benefi t of all the people 56 economy as result of the division of the receipts from ex tractionexploration of oil and natural gas in timo r gap strong petroleum sector has emerged that has strengthened the general state budget and contributed to an encouraging growth in gross natio nal product pnb in the 45 years of sovereignty although without any direct or indire ct corresponding creation of employment income and improvement in the standards of living of the t imorese people as result of the prioritisation of petroleu m sector economy the current development of the economy of timorleste presents clear duality wi th petroleum sector and nonpetroleum sector clearly demarcated and unbalanced in terms f their contribution to economic growth and the structure of national employment according to fficial analyses by the government of the rdtl ffoorrççaa 22002200 26 presented in the general state budget 200405 docum ent 10 the petroleum sector is solely responsible for strong growth in gdp since in 2004 05 real petroleum gdp grew by 991 contrasting with growth in real nonpetroleum gdp of only 1 inversely the proportion of timorese employed in the petroleum sector is minute 007 according to the data in the population census 2004 11 the nonpetroleum sector has modest but stable contribution to growth in gdp without the oscillations and volati lity that characterise receipts from the petroleum sector it has been estimated that nonpetroleum gdp grew steadily by between 6 3 in the period between 2005 and 2009 respectively however when the structure of nonpetroleum gdp is analysed the reality that it is strongly dependen t on the governmental public administration and the food sector can be noted the emerging privat sector has an insignificant input in terms of growth in gdp even though it presents growing trend in strong contrast the subsistence sector subsistence agriculture and fishing and the infor mal sales sector labouring parttime activity that occupies the majority of the timorese populati on represents 76 of the national workforce and generates very low levels of average income one of the major economic challenges for timor leste will of course be the channelling of petroleum receipts towards dynamic real economic growth and development that will benefit all the timorese population and reduce the duality and im balance of current economic growth the national development plan12 recognises the imperative need to transform the economy from subsistence production to market economy p32 the general state budget 200506 states t hat13 the government is engaged in further work to develop an d implement policies with view to increasing the rates of growth of nonpetroleum gdp including gts utilisation p26 given that large increases in petroleum gdp will not have direct ffect in terms of an increase in incomes creation of employment and increase in the standard of liv ing of the timorese since the number of timorese nationals who work in the petroleum sector is minim however petroleum gdp will have major indirect contribution to employment incomes and th reduction in poverty in timorleste as it will generate large receipts for the government the fun ds from these petroleum receipts will create jobs and provide incomes to the timorese people in direct effect p25 primarily the principal source of growth in the long term will be the pr ivate sector and private investment in commercial agriculture and nonagricultural activity will be v ery important secondly the government will try to generate employment next year and in the med ium term by means of an increase in public construction activities p26 in addition to development in the petroleum sector sales of crude to the refining industry the commercial agriculturalforestry sector sandalwood vanilla coffee pine etc and in the private infrastructure construction sector it is imperativ to develop and reinforce other strategic sectors in the economic structure of timorleste to estab lish balanced development of the national economy between the exploration of energy resources the resources of the land and the resources of the sea among others one sector can be highlighted th at has not had due attention paid to it in the 10 government of the rdtl general state

enormous potential the maritime sector the territoriallybased orientations and the mariti mebased orientations must be balanced in national development even if external strategic interest influences seek to limit our vision to economic development exclusively based on agricultu re and land infrastructure the regional and global economies nevertheless face major ongoing ch allenges that we must interpret by not abandoning favourable opportunities related to the return from other resources that exist in the permanent strategic national interest space eeinp an integrated vision of the development of the maritime sector in national development aimed at ma ximising the economic potential of the routes and maritime resources could constitute an importan t complementary vector for the essential economic diversification of the national nonpetrol eum sector 57 developing the maritime economy the state of timorleste must of course commit to its new vocation and orientation of maritime base in an integrated way as fundamental instrum ent for economic growth and national development maritime economy opens up field of opportunitie s in relation to which we urge defining the aspects and strategic sectors that might be explore d and assured so that timorleste receives an appropriate income from rental or use of its ma ritime resources currently inexistent due to unregulated exploitation of these sources in addi tion it must plan the development of industrial and service sectors within the maritime economy sp ecifically the industrial fishing sector the export of fresh frozen and canned fish b the maritime communication routes sector sloc c harges for maritime passage risk and safety insurance defence and security meas ures in the straits of ombai and wetar c the maritime transport and portage sector transport charges imports and exports mooring international transit ports and the trans port of goods for economic social and political ends d maritime tourism scientific research r d we urge development and viability studies of the ma ritime sector to be carried out looking at the potential and opportunities present in the vast sea off the north coast of timorleste and particularly study of the scenarios for sustaina ble receipts arising from utilisation of the strait s of ombai and wetar and exploration of the maritime res ources that exist there subsequently it will be essential to define policy of training and develo pment of technical human resources qualified and semiqualified that will professionalize the timor to be absorbed into the potential employment to be created by the diverse subsectors of the mar itime economy in this period plan of advanced and academic technical training must be t out for the various sectors of the maritime economy in timorleste 6 types of threats in the current situation timorleste is confronted with diversity of threats to its security of military and nonmilitary nature economic social political and various types of criminality each type of nonmilitary threat may be considered in is olation as soft threat but it is the combined ffoorrççaa 22002200 28 impact that is critical in an overall evaluation t he conventional military threats are latent characterised in accordance with the degree of inte rests and the dimension of conflict among the states that border timorleste the trend towards n onconventional threats terrorism is common and global the vulnerability of timorleste varies according to the typology the size the scope the category and the level of internal threats wit h an international impact but overall timorleste is subject to any kind of imposition of collaborati on with the immediate neighbours motivated by their own interests below the question of the land border is presente d as the principal factor of vulnerability and with major visibility of threats serving as reference in addressing the type of threats 61 threats of an economic nature the two indonesian provinces that border timorl nusa tengara timur ntt and maluku have the lowest income per capita in indonesia the whole area is poor and the population densities are relatively h igh especially in ntt in relation to the resource s available and development in general is lower than in other areas in the region in addition during the decade of the 1990s the whole region and timo r in particular suffered long periods of drought provoked by niño with the state being pendent on the supply of rice from java the development of the region is marked by lack of infrastructure and by seasonal cycle that limits activities during the periods of the heavy monsoon rains in general terms the economic boom in indonesia collapsed in 1997 and it is still on the road to recovery annual growth which was in the order of 7 is now around 2 the financial system is still recovering and international investment has still not totally returned to the country currentl indonesia does not have the economic capacity to pport adequately its poorest regions analysing this situation to the extent that poverty is fac tor that produces impacts on the stability of the political environment in the immediate neighbouring regions timorleste may be vulnerable to the impact of this economic instability and if there was an economic collapse in indonesia timorleste might suffer severe consequences due to its high pendency on products imported from indonesia to the south australia as an industrialised countr has other perspectives of economic interest in the region timorleste still does not have the cap acity to penetrate the australian market however there is factor of common interest to ustralia and timorleste the dispute over energy resources in the sea of timor that directl affects the sovereignty of timorleste in regard to demarcation of the maritime frontier and the dam age deriving from the delay in developing important nonpetroleum sectors of the maritime economy of timorleste such as for example fishing maritime transport and ports maritime com munication routes sloc etc 62 threats of social nature timorleste is located in region of wide socia l diversity the linguistic and social diversity present in timorle ste reflects this regional norm to this diversity must be added the variety of religious differences which in recent years has fuelled tensions between different ethnic groups additionally in r ecent decades other ethnic groups have migrated to the region disturbing the delicate balance that exists between specific groups all these social elements together with economic crises tend to fuel ethnic tensions and open conflicts in the past some of the most prominent immigrants in timorleste were bugi muslim businessmen from the south of sulawesi who were particularly s uccessful in dominating local markets and fishing from the middle of the 1990s the timorese became active again in these areas particularly ffoorrççaa 22002200 29 in markets in muslim circles this reaction was co nsidered an attack on islam this then moved on to oecusse and kupang where in an explosive in cident in 1998 the largest establishments were systematically burned these attacks were also cons idered by muslims to be directly aimed at islam and contributed to wave of violence during which churches were burned in other places in the eastern region of indonesia the fuse leadin g to discontent is very short and may ignite and there are grave ethnicreligious conflicts with mov ements of refugees between islands it may be that some of these refugees will try to find exile in timorleste thereby calling international attention to their cause this situation might caus major pressure on the security of the frontier and on the development of appropriate immigratio n controls as preventive mechanism to free passage of refugee populations from nusa tenggara t imur to timorleste that may have repercussions at social economic political and ad ministrative levels in addition the indonesian armed forces and police are an uncertain factor in these tensions since there are indications that they will be affected in terms of their discipline and operations and that together with the preman reserves an organised network of civil operations involved in illegal activities wellorganised and with connections to the military and the exmilitias they will be th principal reason for destabilisation in the region 63 threats of political nature the social tension that exists in the different regions of indonesia is also political factor related to the current interplay of political forces politically indonesia is unstable with one of the major causes of this instability being the large differences th at exist between political leaders there are leaders who are determined to maintain local instability s that they can achieve their objectives these diffe rences and uncertain policies make economic recovery difficult which in turn affects the socia l conditions of the country the probability of soc ial agitation becoming uncontrollable opens the possibi lity of return to military rule and to the disintegration of the state in the worst case scen ario which would have consequences for regional security and possibly in very visible forms for t imorleste it is important to state that the central governmen t is currently apparently powerless to halt the collaboration between elements of the tni and the xmilitias which persists in terms of actions incursions into timorleste with the support of b ases installed in west timor the government of indonesia must focus its operatio ns on the maintenance of national unity and on its leadership capacity for dealing with the intern problems related to politics the economy the separatist movements and religious conflicts in ad dition it must try to balance the need for interna l support with the need for international support in the political and diplomatic context relations with indonesia continue to be crucial element that wil l affect the security of timorleste knowing this the political leaders of timorleste have been extr emely cautious in adopting an attitude of cooperation with its more powerful neighbour the two countries have made progress in establishing the diplomatic representation necessary to maintain normal relations and increase cooperation this includes the very successful visit of prime ministe r mari alkatiri to jakarta in june 2003 and the implementation of joint ministerial commission the signing of cooperation agreement between the two countries and the regular official visits t hat the president of the republic xanana gusmão has made to indonesia for the purpose of strength ening the bilateral relationship between dili and jakarta ffoorrççaa 22002200 30 there are guarantees that the current clos eness between the government of indonesia and timorleste will continue postunotil political developments in indonesia are unpredictable even after the results of the presidential elections tha t take place with new democratic dimension initiating conjuncture that will apparently be f v u r b l to t i mo r l s in n v n t th possibility remains that their political leaders ma come to adopt nationalist positions and try to capture the military component that has still not l ost its influence looking at the present and the future from perspective of peace the leaders of timorleste intend to reconcile the harm perpetrated on the people of timorleste by indo nesia and its direct collaborators australia and usa in the past transmitting message of pardon reconciliation and amnesty although process of forgetting the past has taken place as sharin g of interest in the future the wounds perpetrated in past conflicts are always latent in older genera tions and doubts also persist about the concrete solutions to the collective future challenges that sometimes result in divergent policies between states and that may lead to conflicts with serious dimensions 7 analysis of threats 71 the threats to internal stability vary in dimension and are related to the following aspects subversive actions against national identity and co hesion with political objectives contrary to constitutional order b internal wars subversion popular insurrection coup detats military rebellions and internal conflict with international repercussions c organised crime drug trafficking piracy contraba nd illegal immigration money laundering and others 72 in addition risks related to external threats to security based on

22002200 31 8 scale of threats 81 land general situation reports about the movements of armed groups close to timorlestes border reveal the occurrence of significant security incid ents resulting from constant incursions along the frontier it is important to note in studying the perational environment of the tni on the land border that the capability of the forces that may constitute potential threat has changed in some aspects since the arrival of missions in timorl the border has been defined as combat zone that is militarised frontier with the wit hdrawal of the vacuum was created in the management of the frontier timorleste opted to militarise the frontier however the tni remained along the land frontiers and has not re moved nor disarmed the significant number of ex militias and other timorese associations with conne ctions to them the central question remains what is the nature of the security of the frontier what political indicators relate to the operational environment of the armed forces of timorleste on i ts frontiers the land border of timorleste was defined as com bat zone by the which provided peacekeeping force unpkf combat detachment from the start of its intervention until its total withdrawal the ministers of the rdtl opted to demi litarise the frontier and normalise it with new mechanisms of political and diplomatic detente ou r political preevaluation of the situation along the frontier led us to demilitarised frontier an d we assigned upfpntl to control the frontier the government of indonesia continues to place its comb at forces along its land frontiers with the rdtl military operating area daerah operasi militer dom according to its evaluation and definition f its modus operandi or order of battle equivalent to the pkf force pr eviously stationed on its borders consequently it is natural that the tni c ontinues to feel uncomfortable about the fact that its timorleste counterpart is not of the same natu re ie military forces in addition the presence of the tni on the land frontiers with the rdtl may be analysed from the point of view of strategic military defence as being the deployment of an adva nced force for defence purposes in the areas of strategic interest to indonesia itself according to information from the tni there are about 3000 exmilitias in the area in operational terms the organisational distinctions between timo rese exmilitias tni troops milsas timorese who work for the tni but have lower status than the soldiers probably continue not to be significantly practised the term militia is used to refer to large number of individuals from illiterate adolescents to relatively well trained v eterans of the most stable paramilitary groups despite the continuation of long but unproductiv discussions and proposals it is considered improbable that indonesia will relocate away from west timor any significant number of exrefugees including exmilitias and other timorese associated with the tni to the contrary the tni has announced plans to build permanent accommodation cl ose to the frontier for around 800 to 900 milsas timorese who are found there the tni does lso not have any plans to leave or demilitarise the frontier there is for better or worse cont inued nexus between the elements of the exmilitias and the tni that according to the arguments of tni officers will allow them greater control over personnel on the part of the rdtl there have been various initiatives to encourage the remaining refugees to return to timorleste including the continued and tireless efforts made by president of the republic xanana gusmão ffoorrççaa 22002200 32 attitudes of tni since the incidents at the start of 2003 the threat to the peacekeeping force unpkf along the frontier has been constantly cla ssified as low it is clear that small tni or ex militia elements have the courage to provoke direct confrontations with that force unpkf made considerable efforts to establish cooperative relat ions with the tni the fruits of which allowed incidents to be resolved in an effective way howev er it is uncertain if this type of relationship will continue in the postunotil period the friendly re lations that exist between the tni and the forces of the missions in timorleste are not necessari ly indicative of the way in which the tni and the indonesian police will relate to their timorese cou nterparts there are indications that some of the officers of the tni allegedly maintain their ideas about the events of 1999 considering the referendum the consultation vote of 30th august 19 99 to be fraud perpetrated by the and refusing to assume any tni responsibility for the violence of 1999 such sentiments are exacerbated by the continued incidence of serious crimes th at are directly attributed to the tni possible conventional operations scenarios the fragility of the state of timorleste constitut strategic interest vulnerability that may create op portunities for external interventions in terms of humanitarian or security operations by immediate neighbours such as australia in regard to indonesia evaluating the possible diplomatic and economic consequences it is improbable that the government or the military leadership in jakarta wi ll openly promote destabilisation in timorleste however in setting out the possible scenarios it must be taken into account that the probability of political destabilisation may increase considering that the current mission in timorleste unotil has different characteristics from the pre vious missions elements of the tni may collectively or individually encourage exmilitia elements to reenter the territory and become involved in destabilising operations or at least close their eyes to such activities given that the elements have decreasing ideological motivation as suming that there are plans to reintegrate timorleste into indonesia and that they continue to be motivated primarily by material incentives it is improbable that these exmilitias can act as an unassisted force that could conduct large scale operations with clear political objecti ves in accordance with the pattern already established it is most probable that they will dicate themselves to theft illegal trafficking or making localised demands provoking instability in certain border regions even though these incursions may be limited to the this type of activity they may have destabilising effect in timorleste and there is probability of more incidents like those of 19 september 2003 and 21 april 2005 in which an elem ent of the upf bpu fatally shot prominent exmilitia leader and shot at military leader of the tni wounding him details of which are still n ot very clear the incidents provoked in oecusse sinc september 2005 and the flagrant act of sabotage on the water courses in the frontier areas of motain as well as in memo according to recent reports by the government of the rdtl an d subsequently the death of three exmilitias in the malibaka river fatally attacked by the bpu so mething that occurs constantly may develop into trend and consequently increase the instability close to the frontier psychological factors at present the exmilitias seem to have few bases of possible support in timorleste but this may change if the internal si tuation in timorleste becomes unstable or if the exmilitias acquire the capacity to intimidate the local populations close to the frontier the regula r ffoorrççaa 22002200 33 carrying of arms air powered by the exmilitias i s an act that demonstrates the lack of control of the indonesian authorities over the exmilitias an d there are indications that they also have lethal firearms stored even during the presence of miset the local populations in the areas of the frontier showed that they were highly susceptible t rumours and continued to be afraid of the activities of the exmilitias some reports and our own nonofficial sources reveal the lack of confidence of our population in the capacity of our police forces to protect them given the perception of the imbalance in the nature of the forces located on the two sides of the frontier these psychological factors may act in favour of ex militias infiltrating the incursions at the start of 2003 demonstrate that relatively small groups of ex militias with unclear objectives may despite that create climate of insecurity across large reas 82 sea it is important now to analyse the nature of the threats taking into account the specifics of the maritime environment in timorleste which will all ow evaluation of the risk related to this type of threats considering the archipelago structure of timorlest the richness of the natural resources in its maritime base and the vital importance that these nergy resources in the sea of timor have for national economic growth and knowing that in addi tion there are other industries connected to the maritime sector with development potential and wh ich are generators of growth in nonpetroleum gdp arising from the economic exploitation of the straits of wetar and ombai as the sloc and maritime and port transport tourism and fishing as mentioned above in the section on the maritime economy justifies the imperative for the country to have adequate maritime legislation and maritime capacity to deny and dissuade any ex ternal attack and threat as well as impeding illegal and criminal incursions the maritime environment of timorleste is very sp ecific presenting unique challenges in terms of security and defence specifically in regard to trol of frontier and safeguarding economic aspects therefore timorleste has the right to claim the xclusive economic zone zee in accordance with conventions and international maritime law wh ich includes the surface subsoil and airspace timorleste must face up to the problems related to its territorial waters and the eez while knowing that the level of threat is of low intensit and of nonconventional nature being related t incursions of illegalcriminal activities as res ult the analyses of conventional threats do not exclude from the strategic environment the need to define the eeinp in this context it is important and determinant for the security of th country that the armed forces of timorleste have the effective naval capacity to impede and duct operations against any type of threat it being an imperative of national sovereignty to gu arantee the protection of its sea borders without this capacity the government of timorleste will t be capable of contributing to regional and world security disputing the argument of supremacy of fo rce contributing to decisions in partnership and impeding illegal activities by ships in its territo rial waters which will consequently affect direct ly or indirectly national sovereignty in addition the passage and transit of internation shipping in the region is not always declared and so there is wide disparity between the ro utes declared and those used the change of sovereignty in timorleste determines that the decl aration of international routes must be altered ffoorrççaa 22002200 34 as must the type of ships that use the sea lanes of timorleste the status of the ships in transit in the enclave of oecusse must be clarified in accord ance with international maritime law and taking into account that the waters of timorleste and tha t enclave are separated by the territorial waters of indonesia country with these characteristics has to have the capacity to patrol its own waters and strong diplomatic links to guarantee that ships in transit respect the international legal order recently there have been some incidents related to the violation by indonesian fishing vessels of territorial waters and the eez claimed by timorles finally the increase in maritime traffic by small vessels may constitute an indication that contraban d activities are about to increase this indicates th at the possibility of dangerous products explosive s and armaments and drugs entering timorleste has lso increased it should be remembered that in the most recent thr eat assessment by unmiset may 2005 it was considered that at the regional level the risk of violation of territorial waters by conventional ans was assessed as medium however taking into acco unt the intention of the conventional forces in the region the risk related to the threat to stabi lity by means of the maritime environment is very low in this context it is important to remember t hat the electronic warfare capability of the naval assets in the region is sufficient to cover large reas of timorleste although its capability for detailed analysis of the information collected is u nknown the risk related to the capacity of the crews of fishing vessels and other commercial and foreign ships to illegally exploit the waters of timorlest is assessed as medium taking into account the lack of patrols in its territorial waters and the ez this level of threat means that timorleste mus t maintain more effective naval capacity which wil l ensure the surveillance and protection of these territorial waters therefore there is high prob ability of incursions occurring related to illegal activities along the sea coast this being so the risk related to an external threat to the stability of timorleste provoked by small incursions of noncon ventional character may be assessed as medium 83 air to be developed in the next strategic blueprint for the development of the armed forces of timor leste on future perspectives 20202050 84 space to be developed in the next strategic blueprint for the development of the armed forces of timor leste on future perspectives 20502075 85 global and transnational terrorism independently of its targets and objectives terror ism while violent clandestine and surprise action may be considered to be an instrument of policy of the weakest against the most powerful using terror as weapon as method of destabilis ation and demoralisation of discrediting and disparagement as means of pressure or simple desire for vengeance the clandestine character the toughness and radicalism the mystery and unpre dictability the threat and fear that terrorism provokes strengthens its devastating and destabilis ing effects among its enemies in the world of terrorism there are adversaries but only enemies its targets are preferably people and through them political and social inst itutions social and economic infrastructure and ffoorrççaa 22002200 35 the strategic networks and systems of defence security production supply communication and transport with new tactics benefiting from globalisation and transnationality the new terrorism is able to cross frontiers attack potentially longrange targ ets remotely activate its detonators installed in territory enemy contact activists reservists and material resources by electronic means create diffuse and tentaclelike structure with ramificat ions in all parts of the world bring together and take advantage of the transverse solidarities ident ified with the same hate and the same revolutionary motivation against the west and enjoy the impunity that it gains from its unpredictability its clandestine nature its distr ibuted support and the manifest inability to control this new international threat it is important here to evaluate this type of thr eat in timorleste credible information received t the start of september 2002 indicated that terror ist group known as jesmaah islamiah may be operational in timorleste the information also in dicated that terrorists may try to detonate explosive devices in dili despite this information and subsequent reports of alleged terrorist activity in the territory there is evidence tha t proves that the jesmaah islamiah or any other group terrorist is operating in timorleste the state of timorleste and the mission are t likely targets however some of the nations that make up the mission are countries that are involved in the struggle against terrorism and so if there is an active terrorist threat in the co untry the targets will probably be australia the u sa or the united kingdom in that order of priority if an attack occurs it is most probable that it wil l be against infrastructure rather than against perso nnel despite one of the objectives of terrorist organisations in the past being to cause many death s some targets may be embassies prominent national structures and other military infrastructu res if terrorist cell plans an attack in timorleste it will probably need the support of third parties or support from inside the country timorleste shares its entire land border with indonesia and is in the same volatile zone as the philippines thos two countries both have radical islamic groups indonesia has two principal groups known as jesmaah islamiah and atskar jihad jesmaah islamiah allegedly connected to alqaeda and is accused of being responsible for bombings throughout southeast asia including the devastating attack t hat occurred in bali in october 2002 the philippines has group known as abu satyaf the probability of these groups infiltrating into timor leste is low although they have the capacity to do so easily finally alqaeda openly criticised the for separating timorles from islamic indonesia this means that the successive missions may have been target for potential terrorists who shared the same idea similarly any aggression against an islamic state as happened with iraq executed by the united states and its allies will be seen s an attack on islam the possibility of terrorist attack in timorlest is not very high there is clear intention amon g terrorist groups to attack american and australian targets and other western targets in asia given ffoorrççaa 22002200 36 the types of western targets that exist in dili and the uncertainty of the existence of terrorist cel l in timorleste the risk of terrorist attack in dil i can be considered medium the professionalism of the armed forces and police forces of timorleste will be determining and decisive factor in facing these type of threats th threats most frequently mentioned by the politica l leadership related to the activity of internal gro ups with political or other motivations and the occasional urban disturbance appear to have been r esolved passively the key to success will be how the armed forces and the police forces securit forces are led in such situations 86 specific context we do not see the case of the incidentsprovocation s that recently occurred along the land border as factor that may cause crisis between timorlest and indonesia in this analysis there is distinction between two approaches one diplom atic and the other tacticaloperational first we consider that the constant provocations n the frontier are instruments of opportunity that generate multiple impacts with an important strategic dimension to the immediate neighbours taking into account that the maritime border is sti ll disputed with australia and the airspace is question to be defined in the near future with the immediate neighbours we must then focus our interest beyond the frontiers by means of proact ive diplomacy in the field of cooperation towards the objective of common security with the immediate ly neighbouring states and those nearby diplomatic effort second we consider that the actions of provocation on the frontier may be managed and controlled by the creation of effective management and control mechanisms on the frontier at the tactical and operational level with legal framework to be fined bilaterally the definition of these legal mechanisms of bilateral management and control spe cifically the funnelling of areas of access and control in certain identified inhabited areas must allow the exercise of the sovereignty of each state without interference with specific considerations related to the traditional aspects of both populations tacticaloperational effort the management of the land and sea borders definit ion and authority improving the capability of the armed forces and security forces of timorleste with suitable resources and the establishment of smooth transition mechanisms time and preparati on of resources required are indispensable and demand input from the state of the rdtl we judge that the participation of the armed forces of timorleste is indispensable whether in fulfilling its constitutional missions or in assim ilating the operational environment of both sides and in particular from perspective of the strategi c national development of timorleste only by placing the armed forces in the framework of this p rocess will it be possible for them to maintain an adequate level of readiness for any eventual operation when it becomes imperative 9 circumstances determining regional crises and c onflicts 91 regional strategic environment ffoorrççaa 22002200 37 in view of the current context of international concern weapons of mass destruction terrorism and crises provoked by natural disasters are the three circumstances in the world strategic environment that justify immediate and unilateral military inte rventions of humanitarian character and the imposition of peace by the world powers as resp onse to their national interests although these interventions

race and military modernisation in the southeast asia region and the implications for regional security during the decade of the 1990s after the cold war the asean states showed consistent trend of increasing their national expenditure on the defe nce sector defining their armament procurement programmes to correspond to the imperatives of lfsustaining reinforcement in the growing strategic uncertainty that characterised the postc old war period this increase in expenditure on the defence sector is inseparable from growth in na tional economic capacity which created the opportunity to respond to the growing strategic co ncerns about regional and global security in general terms asean demonstrated positive correl ation between economic growth and defence ffoorrççaa 22002200 38 expenditure on this topic the countries with th highest rates of growth in gdp showed higher rates of growth in defence expenditure as was the case with singapore and malaysia the countries with lower rates of economic growth also increased their spending in the sector although at slower growth rate as was the case with indonesia and the philippines during the decade of the 1990s and until the asian financial crisis that occurred in the middle of 1997 the principal trends towards modernisation of the forces were the following modernisation of the naval force application of aerial force over t he sea development of conventional war capacity for regional armies and development of national fence industries the dynamic of modernisation of the naval forces of the asean states led to the navies increasing their operations in coastal areas to the outer limi ts of their eezs and beyond their frontiers several navies have developed threedimensional capabilitie s with the introduction of highend submarines aerial combat and interception capability and cont rol and support capability for ground combat the principal focus was the transition from coastal def ence and law enforcement to the development of capabilities to patrol escort and attack over nger range the principal elements acquired that characterise this modernisation of the naval force are ocean patrol vessels rapid assault ships equipped with ssm corvettes frigates naval air capacity asw capacity and diesel submarines indonesia updated its capability to control its mar itime choke points defence of maritime communication maritime routes sloc and protection of deepsea platforms offshore the philippines increased its naval budget to cover cos ts of maintenance structural reforms and limited procurement of

modernisation of the asean air for ces all the air forces of the asean states were equipped with sidewinder aim9 missiles in the 1990s electronic warfare capabili ties and equipment were also introduced and sam and radars acquired singapore is the country that has the most sophisticated system of air defence which operates in three dimensions rapier sam and blindfire radar covering low altitudes hawk sam covering medium altitudes and bloodhound mark 2 sam for high altitudes brunei indonesia and malaysia acquired the surfacetoair rapier missile thailand acquired the redeye blowpipe

russia australia intends to buy 100 nextgeneration planes the f35 joint strike fighters malaysia singapore and china also intend to buy advanced jet aircraft ind icators that may be considered in terms of an arms race in the region with the objective of prote cting and surveillance of disputed borders strategic national interest spaces eein ffoorrççaa 22002200 39 thayer 2000 synthesised the principal modernisat ion trends of the armed forces of the asean states during the decades of the 1980s and 1990s u p to the asian financial crisis 1 the development of structures of more convention land forces including the introduction of armoured vehicles heavy artillery and selfpropelled artillery 2 the introduction of new systems of armament in the land forces led to the formation of rapid deployment forces with varying capabilities in the cases of indones ia malaysia singapore and thailand 3 the structuring of naval forces for surveillanc of the eez and to patrol and protect the sloc became possible with the acquisition of highercapa bility ships modern surface combatants destroyers frigates corvettes and ocean patrol vessels equ ipped with surfacetosurface and surfacetoair

introduction of ew systems including air transport capacity for electronic war air defence radars surveillance and fire control at the level of national strategy and in the tactical intelligence system 7 this modernisation of the armed forces increased an d updated the capability to inflict remote attacks on the enemy with high level of precision however there are still only few countries in the region that have the appropriate p latforms jet fighter aircraft or surface combatants in sufficient number to sustain an attack some implications for regional security arise from this type of modernisation of the armed forces of asean despite all the asean states having the comm on objective of regional security there is lack of mutual cooperation in matters of military d efence for collective understanding of common security accentuating the tendency to define defen ce with selfsustaining capability that may create security dilemma for some countries leadi ng to an action and reaction arms race the constant growth in defence expenditure associated w ith the objective of modernising the armed forces has led the asean states to adopt offensive postures consequently asean may lose effective control of armament and the process of mo ulding strategic posture asean showed critical deficiency in terms of integrated logist ics support maintenance support for the defence industry combined forces operations and common doc trinal concepts despite conducting joint exercises for example this deficiency was clea rly shown by the incapacity of any of the asean states to use their rapid intervention forces to co nduct the operations with forces in timorleste asean may come to pay price because of its lack f commitment to the arf in its turn the arf which includes northeast asia southeast asia au stralasia and some nations in the subregions of south asia and the south pacific must go beyond ph ase 1 confidencebuilding measures and phase 2 preventive diplomacy

permanent and fixed objectives that involve amongst others protection of the property of the population of national heritage the guarantee of freedom of action of its sovereign bod ies and the ability to carrying out the fundamental tasks of the state in the context of the strategic environment the na tional defence policy must accommodate the overall objective of the state of timorleste and t ake

timorleste is democratic and sovereign country because it has legitimate powers sovereign bodies and democratic governmental institutions tha t permit it in normal conditions to exercise its

must be prepared to def end the lives and interests of the timorese at any moment and wherever required in accordance with international law therefore the state cannot avoid its responsibility to promote suitab spirit of security and defence among the population of timor and as such the articulati on of the defence policy alongside the education policy must constitute priority the armed forces must in this context play highly active role that will also involve increasing awareness among t hose that will enter its ranks 14 the nature of national defence to go to the nub of the character of national defen ce we must investigate the reasons behind national defence timorleste nation that has emerged from bloody war and the brutal occupation by indonesia has found today sort of cautious peace in the region situation that sometimes appears to legitimise the question that i s frequently posed today will it still be necessar to have defence for the country today will nati onal defence have determined function in the security policy of the state of the rdtl will th is defence which yesterday was indispensable to fortify the timorese nation and ensure its territor ial integrity retain its validity and relevance if the state and the society that personify the nat ion stop representing to themselves and to the eyes of the world combination of dignified values to be safeguarded if the inheritance of these values transmitted by older generations is not va lued or conserved and consequently not handed on to later generations if this inheritance even when it remains as nucleus and foundation for the ffoorrççaa 22002200 45 national identity why subject the nation to sacr ifice of such size if threat can be seen on the horizon that will affect it we will hazard response if timorleste preser ves the right to the respect of others it must protect its interests that ensure its sovereignty the choice of its destiny in the world and if we admit that it is not yet possible to exclude the ch ance of local regional or world disturbances and that there are clearly focal points of conflicts d angers and threats then we must conclude that the principle of national defence remains and will rem ain fully valid and current independently of the regional framework that may be apparent to validat the presumptions and hypothesis we must move towards national consensus associated with t he idea of defence it falls to each citizen of timorleste to discover the values to defend explore them and evaluate their impact on daytoday life in the framework f national responsibilities the national parliament government political parties and compe tent authorities must take on the task making the nation permanently aware of its defence whic h includes the preservation of stability and the independence of the state without nation there i s defence much less national defence without national defence there is sovereign stat consequently the construction of the nation of timorleste must necessarily include its nationa l defence if this is the consensus it is worth reflecting on the setting in which th idea of defence is developed andré malraux affirmed national defence is the will to defend yourself the idea is clear but the problem appears to go beyond the foundation of the will to national survival increasingly frequent voices have advocated in the face of neighbours as powerful as those of timorleste that this conviction is always present in the condition of th spirit of defence of the timorese as was demonstrated during twentyfour years of resistan ce there is not nor will there be cohesive society without community spirit and consequently without common will to defend itself since without this will national existence disappears to validate the reason for national defence in the form of national consensus it must be accepted that defence is fundamental and basic that there must be something to defend and an evaluation of how to defend it and with what measures the measures referred to must be minimally compatible with the national defence policy that th ey intend to follow since without means there is policy much less national defence policy the refore the national consensus for the construction of national defence must be exclus ively matter of dogma and not of politics the government national parliament political parties and other authorities are responsible for promoting dialogue with the citizens about national defence this may seem to be an obsolete subject but is preferable for nation to be suffi ciently strong in tradition and have men courageous enough to admit their mistakes without ever forget ting the reasons to be proud of itself after these first years of independence timorleste may be pro ud of having defended and preserved national independence to negate this would be to negate all the foregoing discussion raises synthesis affirm ing that national defence has the general purpose of security which translates into the preservation of independence to be independent one must first of all have an autonomous capacity for nation defence since the independence of people can never be assured by another party this affirma tion does not deny recognition of the ffoorrççaa 22002200 46 inexistence of total independence and that this reality concurs with those texts that seek to present collective mechanisms of regional defence nd others as legitimate substitutes that make national defence unnecessary or impossible we must not disregard the steps required in the direction of this collective defence however we m ust not lose the selfconfidence that the resistance taught us timorleste must fight to tak partners role and not that of subordinate in the various collective mechanisms of defence wh national defence underlines the individual affirmation of nations it is not intended to dimin ish the role of the systems of collective security such as the and others that exist or may come i nto being but to affirm its character of interdependence and advocate its character of core sponsibility we make this digression about guardian of internat ional actions because we take the view that the concept of national defence whatever view we may h ave of defence in terms of states or nations is also related to the issue of international relation s and the reality of defence and national security interests is also related to the internal environme nt with the disappearance of the bipolar world system the heterogeneous cultures of economic velopment political regimes and forms of power of the 191 sovereign states that belong to the are coming together and are in permanent dialogue with each other generating either sources of agreement and mutual enrichment or sources of conflict and misunderstandings the accelerated dynamic of these changes and the ffect of globalisation multiplies dependencies and interdependencies as well as multiplying the op portunities for conflict of interests whether at the regional level or on world scale consequentl the old ideal of independence based on autarchy with its traditional support of neutrality that was isolationism is today mere theoretical abstraction it is the combination of all these sit uations that results in the weakening of governmental control over the life of society bei ng replaced by complex forms of exercising power within international relations the combination of reasons and situations set out bove means that war and peace will continue to coexist as they have always unfortunately done throughout the history of humanity few new characteristics arise since both war and peace ter the civilisations and cultures that practise them in terms of national defence there is an intera ction today between the interior and the exterior between internal and external policies between the world within the borders and the outside world and interaction that ever existed has been so op to the point that sometimes it appears almost indistinct therefore it is important in thi s context to state that the ultimate objective of ny state is the security of its citizens security tha t protects people and goods is internal security social security and civil protection against natura l events fires floods and seismic events however it is only when the threat is seen as comi ng from outside other communities other agents of the international community that one can speak strictly about security and national defence it is equally opportune to ask the question what i s national defence what phenomena does it cover there is unanimous agreement about the co ncept or even about the principle of national defence and national security however all accept that the objective of national defence after independence is the territorial integrity of the c ountry others include national cohesion andor th constitution andor the lives of the population ot hers also include the political regime in the ffoorrççaa 22002200 47 definitions of different schools and authors one c ommon element can be found the conservation of the statecommunity as such ie as distinct ent ity sovereign over its territory and people with its own political power imposing itself decisivel involved on the parts that compose it and making it respected by the other entities that make up the international community the national defence policy for timorleste cannot be interpreted simply as the combination of the definitions of internal and external defence const itutionally external defence is not restricted to the complete and exclusive action and dissuasion capa bility of the diplomatic sphere under the guidance of the ministry of foreign affairs and coo peration and in diplomatic and historical figures similarly internal defence cannot be limited in it s definition of responsibility of the ministry of t he interior turning the national police into an appar atus for safeguarding the internal political structure the permanent character of national defence must t therefore be politically interpreted in terms of internal and external defence but must be ca tegorised in military and nonmilitary terms in accordance with the threats we must dismiss any at tempt to mortgage the sovereignty of timor leste with geostrategic interest commitments assum ed in the past 15 analysis of concepts below we present systematic analysis of the rela tions and concepts of national defence identified previously the differences between the various cepts of national defence are centred on two principal questions which may be dealt with in ter ms of breadth and the semantic context in regard to breadth the diverse concepts and defi nitions fall into two andor three groups restricted concept and enlarged andor integrated c oncepts the restricted concept considers national defence as equating to military defence or centralised on it and to which the other aspects economic so cial sometimes even political are subordinate under this concept the threats to consider are onl external threats in the form of the military might of other states this restricted concept of n ational defence corresponds to vision that has been definitively inadequate since the end of the s econd world war the enlarged concept and or integrated concept some authors do not make distinction between the two consider that national defence s well as national security not only cannot be exclusively assured by military defence but also i n time of peace may be challenged and need to resort to nonmilitary means that is starting from the characterisation of the system of international relations and the perception of the interpenetration of the internal and external factors it may be concluded that the actual surviv of states may brought into question in sectors such as the economic cultural psychosocial and political this concept is also considered to be modern because it reflects the actual notion of ind ependence and admits the possibility which is relatively recent in human history that the politi calsocial system of state may be attacked without first destroying its military force partly due to the complexity of societies and the openness of states according to this school of thought the threats an d the risks to survival of communitiesstates may arise in almost all sectors and activities of natio nal life given that military response has clearl ffoorrççaa 22002200 48 been insufficient or even completely inadequate in certain situations still within the area of breadt h it is important to emphasise that there is nexu s of logical necessity between the adoption of the enlarged concept of national defence and inclusion within the scope of internal threats where these may be directly or indirectly related to external gents or interests this is intended to underline t hat the limitation of national defence to the exclusive consideration of external threats only makes sense within the former concept of defence carried out along the borders by military forces and would only be effective in world in which the onl way of defeating nation would be by force of arms when the issue is viewed in this way the tim orese concept must also take into account internal threats at least in given circumstances and determined forms it is important and necessary to encourage discussi on at national level about the type of concept of national defence that is of real importance to timorleste which after approval by the competent bodies must be clearly defined in the national defe nce and armed forces law ldnfa in relation to the variation in the concept of nati onal defence in semantic terms ie in the choice of the most suitable terms to designate the concept two widely published currents of thought stand out the first current of thought preferred by the angl osaxons and brazilians employs the term national defence to refer to an essentially militar defence and is still connected to the restricted concept while the term national security encomp asses the aspects covered in the modern concept of national defence the second current of thought preferred by the spanish and p ortuguese uses the term national defence in the developed sense of the concept in w hich military defence is the restricted concept of national defence and component part of the enlarg ed concept it should be stated that opting for the solution of the enlarged concept or restricted concept brings with it the problem of knowing what is important r not what is relevant or not to national defence the enlarged concept implies plurality of activities situations and events whose nexus with defence is still not established and which ar often difficult to establish with the influence of globalisation whether on defence or on threats do uble relations are multiplied with implications both for defence and for economic development or n culture internal administration or social questions amongst others there is one further pertinent question how do we distinguish what is of legitimate importance to national defence this is new dialogue that must be pursued by us in timorleste the criterion must now be that related to the ultimate purpose of national defence since almost everything is defence interest in the enlarged concept and th nature of the facts ceases to be relevant in addition and also as consequence of the chang that have taken place it is imperative that national defence is exercised in time of peace as w ell as war which combine to require high levels of readiness to be maintained this permanent chara cter of national defence is another aspect added to its recent global character this permanen ce implies that national defence consists of three modes of action prevention or anticipatory action b dissuasion persuasion intimidation or virtual act ion c combat reaction retaliation or actual action ffoorrççaa 22002200 49 winston churchill wrote the need to prepare defence does not mean that war is imminent on the contrary if war is imminent preparation of defenc has come too late in fact defence is longer useful if it is limited to combating actual or immi nent aggression we can synthesise this incursion into the theory of national defence by affirming th at defence has not taken place if not in relation t the threats or risks whose possibility arises from the emergence of conflicts of interests therefore the reality of interest to the studies of national defence can be organised into three main themes communities independence and conflicts in view of the points set out above it can be ffirmed that the ldnfa should characterise national defence as being duty and honour for all timorese citizens b permanent exercising it all the time and in any p lace c global encompassing all sectors of national life d interministerial involving the different ministe rial sectors in ensuring the conditions that are indispensable for its execution composed of two components one military an d the other civil nonmilitary components the national defence policy must be divided into litary defence and nonmilitary defence both must try to find an overall political balance of na tional security to best apply national resources in prosecution of the objectives defined for national development the framework of the military component of nati onal defence has dissuasive dimension in the definition of the global strategy of security as definition of an affirmativ political posture for the development of the nation 16 military component as set out above the enlarged concept of nation defence encompasses military and nonmilitary components the military component of defence refers specifical ly to military defence the responsibility of the armed forces which in general are orientated to fa ce an external threat in addition missions of intervention in the internal order may occur in sp ecial circumstances and of an exceptional character which must have suitable legal framewo rk whether in the constitution or in the ldnfa military defence consists in the readiness of fo rces and resources and the conduct of military operations aspects that will be covered in the cha pter on the missions of the armed forces later however it should be stated here that in general terms that the main principle of its mission in society is to serve its current and future aspirati ons within the idea that its role is not to promot war but keep the peace by means of suitable organis ation and preparation in time of war and in peace its mission is to advise on the use of milit ary might without advocating its use 17 nonmilitary components in doctrinal terms the fundamental sectors where t asks activities or services comprising the non military component of defence may be grouped are i n general external policy in the hands of the mini stry of foreign affairs and cooperation b governmental and administrative political action ffoorrççaa 22002200 50 c internal security and public order d survival of the population and safeguarding of property cultural social and other assets public information and reinforcement of the collect ive will for defence f supplying the population g public health h system of national alarms and prevention of natural disasters i telecommunications it is important to underline that this combination of vectors set out the combination of measures necessary for the defence of the country whose nat ure is clearly civil are nonetheless closely connected to military defence and may unequivocally contribute to it under the heading of civil defence overall it may be said that the nonmilitary components of national defence civil defence consist of combination of prepared measures ando r activities to be executed or simply coordinated by the civil authorities to face emerge ncies whether these are accidents calamities or catastrophes national or international crises bel licose conflict and that make it possible to act promptly to avoid chaos and disorder and save resou rces these are as can be recognised actions of an emin ently civil character even when they may contribute directly to military defence and that are equally important for national defence there i s mutual dependency between military defence and ci vil defence whether in time of peace crisis or war that imposes an irrefutable need for cooperati on and coordination between them without discharging the tasks of civil defence it is not po ssible to complete the task inherent in military defence and viceversa since they are complementar it is important to underline that the nonmilitary components of defence are mesh of responsibilities and demands whose structuring and coordination are of great complexity and that other ministries as well as the ministry of defenc are responsible for that part of the execution f these components that falls within their brief for this reason the ldnfa must clearly refer to the interministerial character of national defence tablishing the basis for solid and cooperative contribution to the common objectiv that is national defence 18 the defence spirit the national defence policy cannot be reduced to as pects of material order we must also consider the psychological and moral factors that confer exp ression on the collective will of the citizens to engage in the military activity of the state what ever the perceived threat there is purpose in acquiring and accumulating armaments if those wh may be called on to use them shrink from fulfilling their mission because they do not have strong spirit of defence deliberate involvement in military conflict launche s supreme challenge to the will of any political entity is the risk of death worthwhile in the defence of territory resources or other national interests that might be threatened it is in these circumstances that the old axiom of liberty or death assumes its literal concrete and genuinely tragic sense because of this in order that the political decision does not incline towards capitul ation the employment of the armed forces must be ffoorrççaa 22002200 51 supported by an unshakeable collective determinatio n therefore how can political entity find the necessary courage to assume consciously the risk of war in timorleste during the 24 years of resistance gainst the indonesia invasion the crucial words for national mobilisation were my country or death to resist is to win the struggle continues some political and military analysts show ed great surprise at the unanimity of the guiding and mobilising will for the struggle conduc ted by the armed front falintil in the defence of the national sovereignty of timorleste some of them were convinced that the political and ideological fractures which were seen among th elites and between them and the people would not allow the nation to resist militarily for mor than few months they were totally wrong because the timorese during that period were imbu ed with the most important value of the spirit of defence patriotism and consequently grow ing will to defend the sovereignty of the country until death however the threats that currently ex ist do not appear to support similar conviction and it is necessary to take into account the eventual d ivision of timorese public opinion in relation to t he large questions of external policy whether in re gard to membership of regional security and cooperation organisations to bilateral and multil ateral relations or the attitude in relation to indonesia to australia to the countries of south east asia and the cplp different points of view and fault lines imbue the political parties which have different concepts of the spirit of defence since its expression and content depend on the syst em of ideological references that each of them adopts it may be thought that in the event of co ncrete and clearly recognised danger suitable broad national consensus would be reestablished h istorical tradition merely confirms this possibility in the face of threats of great serious ness and after they have passed in other situations the divergences persist country that is consider ed by some as close ally is thought by others to be potential aggressor in addition future parti cipation in peace operations under the aegis of the may give rise to public debate in the futu re the legitimacy of these interventions may be contested and argued against as result mobilisi ng national efforts in response to any distant danger when the adversary is liable to change its face and name according to ideological beliefs or political trends is an onerous task for any govern ment in the absence of suitable spirit of defence in the current state of international relations and timorese public opinion the notion of threat s lost significant part of its traditional acuity the independence gained by timorleste and the current strategic environment have removed the pers pective of armed aggression directly and in the short term threatening national territory the intervention of the and the international community in the independence process fin 2002 minimised or eliminated the spectre of an indonesian invasion consequently the threat may n ot be seen in classic terms powerful military nation that attempts to impose its hegemonistic ambitions the conceivable forms of aggression to the country today are multiple see the detailed analysis in the pr evious chapter about the typology characterisation and dimension of threats varying between the virtual aspects of the armed struggle economic attack social disturbance or cl andestine political action in national territory i n addition for timorleste the military defence of liberty and independence may be conceived only in terms of the armed forces this is necessarily conn ected to responsible participation in supranational security system duly integrated wha tever structures may materialise it follows that the old notion of frontier so profoundly instill ed in the spirit of the vast majority of people s lost substantial part of its rigid absolute and almost sacred character due to all of this it is ffoorrççaa 22002200 52 difficult to take full account of the moral and p sychological factors linked to defence of the terri tory to supply suitable spirit of defence in view of this situation it would be highly advan tageous to the international affirmation of timor leste for the government programme to include measu res that allow an educational and informative action of an innovative character which raise the level of comprehension and acceptance of the timorese about the legitimacy of the supreme sa crifice to which they may be subject such abnegation implies that the fundamental values that will be demanded from those who fight should be clearly defined and divulged without doubt the persistent adherence to the sentiment of patriotism and the values of falintil will always c onstitute for nation like timorleste powerful psychological and moral factor of resistan ce and cohesion in any event it is clear that the current conditions of its interiorisation expressi on and manifestation are significantly distinct fro m those seen in the past it is equally important to reflect on the actions that will allow the adhesion of all timorese to the forms of collective life that i t is desired should be defended and to adequately position them in the current context it is theref ore in the context of education information and civic duty that we must today in timorleste plac the problem of the development of defence spirit 19 the national consciousness the national conscience must be considered as component of the defence strategy of political regimes that are extremely vulnerable to internal s oc ial phe nome na t his fac t is due to the influence that the beliefs values and traditions c ommon to society the actual factors that make up the national conscience have on one of powers components national will this is the reason why strategic action associated to disputes over co nflicting interests between states initially focuse s on psychological coercion to provide desirable i nfluence and to discredit or demoralize the hostile government specific groups within the state and pu blic opinion in general even though strategic action based on psychologi cal coercion has been moulded and modernized by wars fought due to marxist inclination and for free dom from colonialism the definitive and paradoxical demonstration that perceived physical v iolence never inhibits strategic action was provided by the nuclear option strategic action as result became more sophisticated more indirect and less demanding in terms of material nd thus more frequent and more accessible to all actors on the international political stage subsequently defence strategy that exclusively p ursues objectives aimed at safeguarding or achieving position of material superiority capab of dissuading war ensuring an easy victory or destroying the opposing forces does not possess the same validity or importance nowadays as it did before modern defence strategies also aim to stre ngthen national conscience which by lucidly determinedly and cohesively permitting the pursuit of national interests contributes in decisive manner to the consolidation of institutions that or ganise civil society and govern the exercise of power accordingly states reduce the possibility of success of counterstrategies that seek to win over society through the exploitation and manipul ation of socioeconomic tension or ideologically related dissent by using propaganda and indoctrina tion techniques in carefully chosen subject areas and stimulating pacifism or carrying out intimidati oncausing terrorist action ffoorrççaa 22002200 53 defence strategies are not however all occupied w ith strengthening national conscience since this may be devalued by technological advance or ideol ogical outbreak and on its own it is insufficient in the event of an armed conflict considerable ef fort is likewise required to build and sustain the material action resources which make up the other component of power national capacity these are the resources that permit the direct employment of force to either protect or achieve specific interests of the nation of timorleste or to contri bute to initiatives to defend the common interests of number of states the scope of such contribu tions includes military action aimed for example at forcing compliance with international law suppo rting the pacific resolution of conflicts promotin g regional stability enforcing the respect for human rights guaranteeing the nonproliferation of weapons and free access to natural resources essent ial to the economic development of all states states tend to associate into collective defence or ganisations the effectiveness of which is based on solid and sustained relations of interdependence since as previously referred to the idea of exclusively autonomous defence without sovereignty related limiting factors has been resigned to the past these organisations are characterised by coresponsibility for strategic work which obviously provides sharing out of losses and gain s matter what the force status and hierarchical position of state in relation to its allies one of the most significant gains is credibility moreover in world characterised by the sophisticated exercise of political influence and p ower credibility especially that resulting from t he effective and responsible participation of the stat in collective defence activities is of the utmos t importance to the state so that it may not only emanate positive image and reputation but also possess the moral and political legitimacy that is necessary to conduct foreign policy adjusted to the defence of national interests moral and political legitimacy seems to be determ ining factor in timorleste making its own mark in the international and regional arena it is ass ociated to the fact that timorleste is defender of human rights of minority rights democratic values and the rule of law and in order to maintain coherent stance it cannot remain indifferent to th violations occurring as result of the new climate of conflict and which may affect regional nd international security as member of the and fully aware that the role of that international organization is irreplaceable in maintaining world security to preserve the responsible states credib ility timorleste cannot fail to assume the perspective related to the need to employ military force in operations aimed at promoting peace and

classified document due to its specific nature along with the military str ategy concept cem must be preceded by public and institutional debate on the subject and be based on proposals presented by the government andor by parliamentary groups of the national parl iament the approval of the cedn must not only possess national and institutional consensus on the lines of action for national security but in particular sufficiently clear guidelines on the pr imary tasks and principal priorities of the armed forces this will mean commitment from those app roving the cedn so that coherent defence policy is effectively pursued over time body composed of specialists in the different are as of the state that contribute to security should exist in order to ensure that all studies of secu rity proposals are appropriately implemented the inclusion of members of the information services is essential during the period that the state does not possess such body an interdisciplinary gr oup should be appointed and led by the prime minister to carry out this task it should be noted that the definition of the refer red to concepts is not for number of reasons an easy task ffoorrççaa 22002200 56 firstly there does not exist anywhere safe and uniform doctrine on national defence particularly in relation to the use of military means secondly even after establishing doctrine its practical implementation is almost always improbable due to economic reasons which are only surpassed with great difficulty in peace time this almost always leads to reduced forces system with risks in proportion to the necessary force system as eric muraise wrote when doctrine can be effectively implemented eve rything is not resolved for there will always be discussio n between those demanding the necessary means to meet the doctrine and those that support the doc trine of possible means these factors must be taken into account though th ey do not hamper the need to define the basic concepts through which the national defence policy should be projected in strategic terms correctly defining the armed forces their missions and suppl ying them with the suitable means to fulfil those same missions without such definition even of nly temporary organised armed forces will be able to survive in view of the mo bility of existing data the comme ncement of this task is therefore pressing need even if these concepts ve to undergo later review and amendment doctrine is not pacific in relation to the underlyi ng pillars of the strategic concept of national defence or national security concept there are those that believe it should be static concept repeatedly or didactically establishing the permane nt and historic objectives of the country by which successive governments must be bound and there ar those that on the contrary uphold dynamic concept that puts into practice the defence policy of the governments programs in the strategic area in addition to upholding the countr ys highest values it is often said that the difference between policy and strategy resides in the fact that the former determines what to do and the latter how to do i t based on which it is commonly said that strategy should be governed by policy and not polic by strategy the national defence and armed forces law ldnfa m ust establish the strategic concept of national defence in general terms this ma be composed as follows for example the definition of the fundamental aspects of the states global strategy for implementing the objectives of the national defence policy this text expresses broadened concept within the modern conception of national defence policy that i s the global responsibility of all sectors of the state and of citizens in general this notion must undoubtedly be in strict harmony w ith the governments program and the respective legislation must estab lish the following for example the government intends to pursue policy of na tional defence that defines this as global strategy of the state in the political economic s ocial cultural and foreign relations fields as w ell as in purely military context with the end objectiv of guaranteeing national independence and the territorial integrity of timorleste as well as th freedom security and assets of the population and nation in general against any outside threat and ggression in this context the strategic concept of national defence cedn must consider all related sectoral environments and provide useful meaning to them transforming them into the general practice of the administration and the community under the sup ervision of the government through its ffoorrççaa 22002200 57 program for the country the main pillars of defenc the main options must be approved by the national parliament the following level is that of establishing the mil itary strategic concept cem this can be represented as the breakdown of the strategic conce pt of national defence for the military field thus the terms of the cem must also be expressed i n the national defence and armed forces law which may be worded as follows for example the military strategic concept is composed of the set of measures that take into consideration the execution of the military component of national defence according to the strategic concept of national defence the military strategic strategy must accordingly so not be static in nature it must on the contrary evolve according to the circumstances ad apting to the rate of changes occurring in the national and international environment it forms par t of so that it is possible to constantly optimize the conditions in place to face threats nowadays more than ever military strategy needs to be constantly updated due at the very least to the rapid and profound alterations that the corr elation of forces in the military and threat ambit have undergone the low level of flexibility and immobility that strategic concepts are often tackled with and the entire resulting system is due to predominantly i deological and not operational stance but the desirable definition and update of both concepts do not imply that this is done in an imprudent fashion it can be acknowledged that the threats have been s trongly lessened and diluted but there has still not been sufficient time to find balance we ar currently in an interlude that may even produce greater power sharing which up to now has been cen tred on two blocks disarmament reduced tension and promises of the creation of new world order favouring peace are all very positive but the international climate continues to be less than comforting and so all these alterations must be looked on with great care history tells us that times of euphoria following n from lessened threats do not always result in peace therefore the current strategic environmen t must not cease to be of concern to timorleste which is small recently independent country wi th very limited resources and one of whose major vulnerabilities is its strong dependence on the ext erior where the national defence sector is still not conveniently structured and organized and defence p lanning still has significant limitations the basic end purpose of the armed forces is to gu arantee the military defence of the country on the occurrence of external threats or aggression the manner in which this defence will be performed will be defined through the concepts established in the military strategic concept thus this will b the fundamental element based on which the strategi c decision may be implemented permitting the drafting of one or more general military defence pl ans in conformity with the hypothetical threats considered the general military defence plans correspond to an operational strategy limited in time in other words they need to contain systems of force that re not immediately available but which may be achievable in due time as the result of suitable p lanning of forces and an effective mobilisation system ffoorrççaa 22002200 58 based on the attempt to define the development of t he armed forces in the national strategic development plan defence di alogues were undertaken 1st dd 2004 and 2nd dd 2005 by means of which we aimed to promote understanding of the impo rtance of national defence to the development of timorleste and establish the necessary mutual and synergic relations between ministries given that it would be in the interest of all the states bodies to maintain conceptual alignment in securit and national defence strategies by means of gu iding framework for national development some significant critical reference points were obtained from these dialogues and these steered us afterwards to the need to produce an integr ated strategic defence plan which defined the objectives of the military component in the pursuit of the total strategy ie the national objectives 21 legislative and conceptual framework the permanent objectives of national defence are t clearly defined in the constitution of the rdtl these may however be established in the ldnfa thereby requiring that the sovereign bodies of the state and the armed forces themse lves provide coherent uptodate and effective strategic planning it is the time to update conce pts redesign the security and wellbeing binomial to substantively weigh up the options assess the r espective consequences and principally make decisions the production of the legislative and conceptual framework for the national defence and armed forces of timorleste is fundamental to the consoli dation of the current restructuring proposal and to contextualizing its development in the future the inclusion of the legislative component of national defence was deemed suitable in the current strategic framework highlighting the hierarchy of laws the structural concepts and enti ties responsible for proposing appraising approving and implementing items in the area wh ich allowed the starting point of the organization and the missions of the armed forces to be tackle d in detailed manner and in the context of the new planning of forces the legal and conceptual documents comprising th legislative framework of national defence can be placed in the following hierarchy 1 national defence and armed forces law ldnfa defi ning 11 set of conceptual documents strategic concept of national defence cedn b military strategic concept cem c specific missions of the armed forces d national forces system sfn forces apparatus 12 and organic laws armed forces organic law lobofa b ministry of national defence organic law 2 military service law lsm which establishes th rules and regulations concerning the status career and recruitment of military personnel

personnel plans force personnel armaments infrastructures and finance serves as t he basis for the drafting or review of the forces development project in accordance with th sfn this project constitutes the new forces proposal which is drafted in biannual cycle of f orces planning cbpf lastly it is important to note that the drafting of the legislative hierarchy of all these levels of national defence cannot be immediate but it must b successive coherent and complete given that each level is dependent on the previous ones 22 national defence issues necessary decisions the immediate priority is for the high council for defence and security csds to propose the legislative framework of national defence to the na tional parliament pn and approve it this will consequently permit the creation of the ldnfa wh ich establishes the strategic concept of national defence cedn and defines the objectives of nation defence policy according to the states global strategy and establishes concrete guidelines for t he general strategies compartmentalized in the external and internal political plane in the above mentioned sectoral policies including the military plane the hierarchical matrix of the ldnfa will allow th mission to be analysed and any situation to be studied in accordance with the new strategic envir onment the transformation of which translates as an important evolutionary element from which strat egic planning factors must be drawn for the redimensioning adjustment and restructuring of the armed forces so that these can wholly fulfil the objectives set down under national defence policy the definition of national policy is deemed urge nt this would steer global strategy and make it possible to guarantee the systematic and continuous coordination and control in the drafting and implementation of national defence policy in prac tice the definition of national policy implies the subsequent sequence of drafting the cedn integrate d planning of budgets for integrated programs and the cohesion of the activities that c ontribute in each ministry to the implementation of national defence strategy the subsequent definition of military defence stra tegy will comprise the establishment of military objectives military potential the type of forc the national force system and the concept of operations that in turn defines force readiness the concept of employment the sustenance of means and other military objectives 23 strategic planning the ldnfa must set down structure and establish methodology that meets its end purpose in other words the definition of missions and the s fn and the human and material resources required by these forces to fulfil those missions after th necessary debate of the main options of the cedn by the national parliament the csds provides its pinion which is then approved by the government next the ldnfa must forecast that the governmental national defence directive and ffoorrççaa 22002200 60 the directives of the different ministries namely the ministerial directive on military defence dmdm of the ministry of national defence are approved next this minister approves the cem proposed by the cemgfa the minister then prop oses and the csds defines the missions and sfn based on the grounds stated in the cem see the concepts diagram at the start of the chapt er it is only possible to set down basic idea of how to maintain the security of country over certain timeframe 10 to 15 years after performing an in depth study of the actual strategic environment threats to be met and interests to be preserved as regards the principal objectives with the longest terms contained in the constitutio n and other fundamental laws influenced therefore by prevailing political causes and taki ng into consideration the means that can possibly be made available the priorities assigned the diff erent areas of the state only then will the conditions be in place to indicate the measures to the taken through the establishment of the cedn the existence of the armed forces is intimately nected to the essence of the state and to the concept of sovereignty and national independence the constitution of the democratic republic of timorleste states that the primary and core missio n of the armed forces is the military defence of the republic article 146 in order to guarantee national independence territorial integrity and the freedom and security of the population against any external aggression or threat the concepts of external aggression and threat are indeterminate concepts that cannot be excluded from updated integration to encompass new forms of external action that are likely to affect the legal assets that constitute the obje ct of the concept of national defence as expressed in the constitution b on the occurrence of an external threat or aggressi on which due to its significance and scope seriously and profoundly impacts on the lega l assets that are the object of the national defence concept as established in the constitu tion military defence may involve an external component characterised by the exercise of the right of legitimate defence within the ambit of international commitments and an internal compo nent orientated towards the strict protection within the physical space comprising na tional territory of the same legal assets against external threats there must be liaison bet ween the constitution and ldnfa legitimate defence c military defence against external threats to the op erating capability of the manufacturing food industrial energy transport and communicati ons sectors given that these constitute vital interests to the wellbeing and security of the general public it must be supported by the constitution and ldnfa the armed forces may be assigned other missions in addition to the primary mission attributed by the constitution these may be internal civilmil itary cooperation and missions in the public interest or external resulting from international commitments to humanitarian and peacekeeping missions under the or regional cooperation and s ecurity organizations such initiatives provide the nation with prestige guaranteeing that timorl plays its part in the international arena th armed forces can and must support missions of publi c interest inside the country which result from extraordinary occurrences that require their inte rvention and which in all cases meet the populations needs ffoorrççaa 22002200 61 on the organizational front the armed forces are rganized into national forces system sfn the sfn must be primarily composed of modular units the characteristics of which can be subsequently made more appropriate in the theatre f operations prepared for integrated action in joint andor combined forces namely in situations of partnership with allied forces these forces must have highlevel capacity in terms of mobility and selfsufficiency and be skilled to intervene i n peacekeeping and humanitarian missions such as pri mary missions of national sovereignty distributed throughout the territory an analysis of the current organizational structure of the armed forces indicates that the ratio of operational to support component is not duly dimens ioned and there is the primary need to converge all means towards the objectives to be ach ieved and that these means must all be operational in nature given that this is the main task preparing forces the operational modules and structural levels must be standardised accordin g to benchmark doctrine it is essential that increased efficiency and effectiveness be guarantee d in their operation the current structure must be restructured at all levels of command advancement to the following stage can occur only fter all of these definitions have been formulated the following stage will encompass more practical and incisive issues such as the number of fulltime personnel and total personnel n umbers as well as the establishment of military material planning it is obviously extremely thoug htless and haphazard affair to establish the organizational structure of the armed forces as s occurred with the current structure of the armed forces the general staff specia l forces units personnel material equipment and uniforms or plan public investment in reequipping the military or in defence infrastructures without advance knowledge of the size of these armed forces and th is size should only be quantified within the ambit of the referred to concepts it has become necessary to readjust and resize the current organizational structure of the armed forces in fu ll awareness of the conditions that led to the creation of the armed forces in 2001 and which infl uenced the options taken and taking into account the characteristics required for the sfn to be established the role of the different forces components naval land support and service air component instruction and training and command as well as the necessary joint action of the rmed forces it is important to define the legal framework of the forces structure and applic ability through lobofa given that the current armed forces organic law solely refers to the struc ture and mechanisms of institutional liaison in general terms but does not effectively establish t he general bases for the organization duties and attributes of the armed forces leaving this instea d to governmental legislation which does still not exist the restructuring of the armed forces must be directed toward the constant requirement to modernize and the streamlined use of available mean s despite the fact that the human factors value as the main motor for the development and tra nsformation of organizational structures was recognised in the twentieth century this resource which is the principal agent of change was not given priority military recruitment in many count ries during the twentieth century was based on the compulsory military conscription model which alway s allowed the military to be supplied with the necessary quantity of personnel however re structuring that was carried out including the ffoorrççaa 22002200 62 consequent reduction of numbers meant that militar conscription was longer universal and it was even wholly opposed in some countries particul arly by political actors in positions of government this fact led to its reduced use and meframe for its complete termination often supported by decisions not fully justified with due grounds the process of approving the military conscription law lsm must include the assessment of whether military conscription is of interest to tim orleste for specific reasons in falintils past related to the need to guarantee an effective nati onal identity through greater and more improved link to the general public or whether professional military service is better suited to national interests it should be noted that the profession alization of the military meaning that all militar personnel will be volunteers will mean greater emp hasis on results in addition to increased technological and financial requirements in the current climate in which the benchmark fram ework is profoundly altered and the need to adapt to new requirements is imperative all action must be thoroughly lucidly honestly and courageously undertaken to introduce the structural alterations that will allow these challenges to be conquered the necessary objectives are to make the causes motivational and provide the guarantee to the nation that the armed forces are capable of carrying out their role of fulfilling th missions assigned them the state of timorleste mu st supply the armed forces with the defence capability to ensure that the permanent objectives are exercised and to meet the following challenges 1 full performance of duties with the view to fulfil the responsibility of the military defence of the democratic republic of timorleste guarantee natio nal independence territorial integrity and the freedom and security of the general population against any external threat or aggression in full compliance with constitutional system 2 develop the capacity for generalized reciprocal dis suasion under the scope of national cohesion 3 prevent dissuade and negate any type of internal w ar or conflict subversive war peoples insurrection coup military revolt civil war and or internal conflict with international repercussions 4 observe and participate in the fight against any ty pe of nonmilitary threat that aims to compromise the countrys defence and security 5 define timorlestes military potential from force numbers and types to the composition integration of means and operational employment an d liaise the contextualisation and active participation of citizens in the defence of the nat ion ie establish military service model taking into consideration the fact that the general public is the hub of timorlesteese development and to also take various fundamental aspects into c onsideration the global strategy of the state to implement the objectives of the national defence po licy established in the cedn the characterising aspects of the military and limiting factors of the missions of the armed forces set down in the cem and lastly the national and international duties nd responsibilities of the armed forces related to the specific missions assigned them ffoorrççaa 22002200 63 24 roles of the armed forces 241 introduction in view of the abovedescribed and taking into cons ideration the definition of timorlestes strategic environment there may currently exist more doubts than certainties regarding the missions to be assigned to the armed forces in the areas of the security and national defence only national effort based on an intelligent and prudent converge nce will thus provide the responses that meet the profoundest and most legitimate national interests the current strategic orientation blueprint contrib utes to that debate firstly critical analysis of the current constitutional and legal framework is d eemed to be important in order to comprehend the need for comprehensive review of the organi c law of falintilfdtl in force and adopt the contextualization of other missions of public inter est under the scope of the missions of the armed forces namely militarycivil cooperation and firs tclass citizenmilitary instruction secondly t he organisation and categorisation of the armed forces missions and the detailing of the underlying assumptions is proposed thirdly these are adapte d through the analysis of cemgfas missions in forces planning context finally the detailed des cription of the constitutional concept of national defence and the constitutional model for the armed forces is proposed thereby contributing to the review of the constitutional statute of national fence internal security and the armed forces 242 current legal and constitutional framework defence and national security is tackled by part v of the constitution of the democratic republic of timorleste article 146 of the constitution estab lishes relative to the armed forces 1 the armed forces of timorleste falintilfdtl exc lusively composed of timorese nationals are responsible for the military defe nce of the democratic republic of timorleste and its organization is uniform and covers the whol of the country 2 falintilfdtl guarantees national independence ter ritorial integrity and the freedom and security of the general population against any exte rnal threat or aggression in full compliance with constitutional system 3 falintilfdtl has political party allegiance and must obey the competent sovereign bodies pursuant to the constitution and laws the are not permitted to intervene in the political sphere in any capacity from article 146 of the constitution of the democra tic republic of timorleste the legislator adapted the somewhat limited range of the missions of the armed forces established in article 3 of the falintilfdtl organic law law 72004 of 4 may 1 the basic mission of falintilfdtl is implement the military defence of the democratic re public of timorleste against any external threat or aggression b guarantee national independence territorial integr ity and the freedom and security of the general population against any kind of exter nal threat or aggression 2 falintilfdtl in addition to be generic mission re ferred to in the previous paragraph can also legally collaborate with the pntl in the event of strike or generalised disturbance of public order which does not justify the immediate declaration of martial law or state of emergency thereby preventing th consequent suspension of the exercise of basic civil rights ffoorrççaa 22002200 64 b provide assistance to the civil population when so requested by the government collaborating with administrative authorities on pr otection and aid missions to the general public in the event of catastrophes or calamities of natural or manmade cause which do not justify the immediate declarati on of state of emergency thereby preventing the consequent suspension of the exercise of basic civil rights 3 the employment conditions of the armed forces on the declaration of martial law or state of emergency are established in specific laws gover ning any situation of martial law or state of emergency 4 falintilfdtl can also be tasked under the terms f legislation with participating in technicalmilitary cooperation action implemented u nder national cooperation policy and in conformity with international commitments that have been undertaken despite the fact that there still isnt national defence and armed forces law ldnfa but taking into consideration the falintilfdtl organic law an d that the activity of any government essentially though not exclusively comprises the fence of the collective population in its broadest sense this end purpose governed over by the princ iple of predicting the possibility of an attempt to stifle independence demands in the context of the integral strategy of the state and in line with other structural action the maintenance of the arm ed forces to guarantee the military defence using its own means or via prospective alliances these are the facts by which the armed forces embod the visible statement of the will of the people of timorleste to remain free and sovereign nati on this is the reason why the constitution and falintilfdtl organic law assign to the armed force s the generic mission of guaranteeing the military defence against any external threats or ag gression but the specific missions of which should be duly detailed in suitable legislative instrume nt still to be drafted ldnfa in addition to the main missions the armed forces of timorleste like those of any other country are increasingly assigned missions in the public interest this fac t makes its institutionalization increasingly more necessary in todays world another field of equal importance is that of meetin g international commitments that have or will be undertaken in worldwide and regional political co ntext as already referred to the major transformation registered in the international po litical system had an impact of the stance and missions assigned the armed forces obliging in dep th reforms that naturally expanded their field of action the armed forces were arranged under the legitimising governance of the mandates issued by international organizations into joint and comb ined forces in order to perform the missions relative to the management and control of internati onal crises the provision of support to ensure peace is kept humanitarian and cooperation mission s which are executed outside of timorlestes borders these are commonly known as other mission s or new missions and they constitute powerful instrument of support to the states forei gn policy these missions will certainly imply adjustments to the armed forces training and reeq uipment programs and they are generally extremely well supported by the general public pro viding an impulse to all subsequent initiatives of the government in the implementation of its foreign policy objectives ffoorrççaa 22002200 65 nevertheless it should be emphasized that even though other missions new missions have earned particular exposure in the media and are currently gaining increasingly more importance they should be implemented without jeopardising that whi ch is the traditional and principal mission of the armed forces defending national territory against any external threat or aggression the planning of forces must constantly equate that possibility i n accordance with the national defence policy and the strategic concept on national defence these m issions are legitimized by the conventions and treaties that timorleste enters into as member f such international organizations and alliances they must nevertheless be well justified and poss ess appropriate legal and regulatory grounds the armed forces have to be prepared for armed conf lict but above all they must serve to guarantee peace contributing to national an d international development and cooperation 243 organization and classification of the armed f orces roles an uptodate reading of the organization of the missions of the armed forces of timorleste based on article 146 of the constitution and on the revi ew of article 3 of the falintilfdtl organic law provides the following categorization proposal 1 the generic mission of the armed forces guarantee national independence territorial integrity and the freedom and security of the general population against any external threat or ggression in full compliance with constitutional system review of article 3 of the organic law of falinti lfdtl proposes the organization of missions as follows 2 specific missions of the armed forces main mission the national defence of timorleste i take on guarantee the military defence of the dem ocratic republic of timorleste against any external threat or aggression ii guarantee national independence territorial integr ity and the freedom and security of the general population against any kind of external thr eat or aggression the armed forces may even be used in other missions of public interest other than those related to civil protection tasks related to meeting the bas ic needs of the population may be assigned even though these are not yet set down in legislation however since this subject is quite sensitive it is important that the law specify the terms of perform ance of the armed forces so that the main mission may not be jeopardized in any shape or form b missions in the public interest i providing support to civil authorities collabora with the pntl in the event of strike or generalised disturbance of public order which does not justify the immediate declaration of martial law or state of emergency thereby pre venting the consequent suspension of the exercise of basic civil rights ii providing civil protection provide assistance to the civil population when so requested by the government collaborating with administrative uthorities on protection and aid missions to the general public in the event of cata strophes or calamities of natural or man ffoorrççaa 22002200 66 made cause which do not justify the immediate decl aration of state of emergency thereby preventing the consequent suspension of the exercise of basic civil rights iii in the event of martial law or state of em ergency the employment conditions of the armed forces on the declaration of martial law or state of emergency are established in specific laws governing any situation of martial w or state of emergency iv providing civilmilitary cooperation the armed fo rces develop civilmilitary activities for the implementation of the states final objective ie security and national development proposed subparagraph v training the armed forces serve in accordance wi th the law as centre of training of citizens par excellence proposed subparagraph c other missions regional and global security 9 falintilfdtl can also be tasked under the terms f legislation with participating in technicalmilitary cooperation activities implement ed under national cooperation policy and in conformity with international commitments th at have been undertaken article 3 paragraph 4 of falintilfdtl organic law cur rent version in force 9 proposed wording the armed forces of timorlest can also be tasked under the terms of legislation with participating in technic almilitary cooperation security and military defence humanitarian operations pe acekeeping and peacebuilding activities in order to achieve the objectives of national defence policy and in conformity with international commitments that have been undertaken in schematic terms the generic mission of the arme d forces is subdivided into specific missions missions in the public interest and other missions which must be specified in the strategic concept on national defence in turn the national defe nce and armed forces law ldnfa must define the organizational bases for the fu lfilment of those missions the full and effective implementation of the abovem entioned missions requires the increased organization and discipline of the armed forces of timorleste as well as scope and management appropriate to the human and material resources it has become necessary in the context of reorganization and restructuring of the armed force s to provide the same with credible capacity to defend the land and sea borders principally by mea ns of defensive posture and proactive dissuasion moreover the reorganization of the armed forces of timorleste must be based on coherent legislation that underpins the newly adopted concep ts and should have the end purpose of conferring an eminently operational dimension that equips the armed forces to possess high standard of operational effectiveness in fulfilling the different tasks and responsibilities attributed i t in both national and international arenas ffoorrççaa 22002200 67 244 contribution to forces planning by cemgfa the general commanderinchief of the armed forces cemgfa is responsible for analyzing the missions and the military situation relative to th forces planning procedures of the military component of national defence this task comprises i an assessment of the threats risks and cha llenges forecast for the short and medium terms and ii detailing the evolution of the armed forces own po tential and vulnerabilities as well as those of its allies in order to update the militar ystrategic situation of timorleste it should be noted that this planning occurs under the scope of the already mentioned strategic planning of national defence which provides for the intervention of the different sovereign bodies in particular the president of timorleste nati onal parliament the high council on defence and security the government and cemgfa the procedures must be established in ldnfa the missions of the armed forces on their own if we just consider those currently described in the different manuals of doctrine add little or nothin g to the definition of the forces systems that timo r leste must possess in order to face up to the thre ats that may develop and to defend the countrys interests after the legitimate political power has defined the threat that must be met and the interests that must be defended using military mean s which must have specific capacity the missions of the armed forces detailed in th constitution can be established in another fundamental law ldnfa these missions reflect op tions related to the political regime and they embody general objectives that are applicable to great range of strategic scenarios the predominating fact of these missions is the politic motives that originated them an analysis of the missions of the armed forces for the purpose of forces planning is focused on the specific missions of the armed forces ie the crete missions to give the armed forces in certain strategic context in time which give rise to the c orresponding forces system these must be kept constantly uptodate in relation to the associated strategic situation even though significant changes to the same only occur when marked chan ges occur in the related strategic environment namely the type of threats to contain the level of interests to defend and the specifications of the means that the armed forces possess existing techn ology and qualified human resources the timeframe normally used is 1015 years which i s period of time that is compatible with the reasonable probability that the main parameters def ining the respective strategic situation remain unchanged these specific missions are further demarcated by t wo main limits the global objectives that the state intends to achieve using the armed forces an d on the other hand the human and material resources that it decides to make available almost all of which depend on the assigned funds in other words taking into consideration that which i s usually called the interconnection between strategy of end purposes objectives and strateg of means resources thus based on all that stated above the establish ment and constant update of an uptodate strategic concept is proven to be indispensable the strategic concept on national defence cedn or the strategic concept on national security thi s is deemed to be more comprehensive according ffoorrççaa 22002200 68 to some authors this will result in the military strategic concept cem the specific missions of the armed forces and the forces systems to be prod uced in order to fulfil these missions as already mentioned in summary the cedn will indicate the actual missi ons to fulfil by each national strategic vector foreign policy economy and finance culture and media homeland policy transport etc so that security is obtained the maximum freedom of action compatible with the reality that limits our activities for the proposed end purposes those related to the defence vector and therefore to be implemented by the armed forces the concrete ssions of the armed forces for the time period should be highlighted the cem resulting from the cedn moulds these missions to the rules and characteristics of the military means and the respe ctive use and it indicates the concrete missions for the time period ie the specific missions of the armed forces 245 cooperation between the security forces in this context it is important to note that the circumstances surrounding the attack on civilia n buildings and strategic military points on 11 septe mber 2001 in the usa brought to the fore the fact that any state can be the object of an act of aggr ession that places at risk freedom integrity and the security of people and assets at risk at any t ime and anywhere even if these forms of aggression worry the majority of states in timorl estes specific case it is faced with the question of knowing whether it has the legal and constitutio nal mechanisms in place that would allow it to find the best way of preventing the risks of ccurrence of such events and of finding the most effective response to such concerns the following case study is accordingly presented the armed forces may be assigned to take part in ssions aimed at preventing collective risks and supporting or reinforcing security measures at site s where significant installations of sectors deemed essential to the nation are located namely on borders and important industrial premises in the energy oil refinery and telecommunications sectors and even shipping ports and airports etc in the event of external aggression or threats before moving on to the analysis phase we must set down the following assumptions the constitution of the democratic republic of timo rleste states that the primary and core mission of the armed forces is the military defence of the republic article 146 in order to guarantee national independence territorial integrity and the freedom and security of the population against any external aggression or threat the concepts of external aggression and threat are indeterminate concepts that cannot be excluded from any update to encompass new forms of external action that are likely to affect the legal assets that constitute the object of the concept of national defence as expressed in the constitution b on the occurrence of an external threat or aggressi on which due to its significance and scope seriously and profoundly impacts on the lega l assets that are the object of the national defence concept as established in the constitu tion military defence may involve an external component characterised by the exercise of the right of legitimate defence within the ambit of international commitments and an internal compo nent orientated towards the strict protection within the physical space comprising na tional territory of the same legal assets ffoorrççaa 22002200 69 against external threats there must be liaison bet ween the constitution and ldnfa legitimate defence c military defence against external threats to the perating capability of the manufacturing food industrial energy transport and communicati ons sectors given that these constitute vital interests to the wellbeing and security of the general public it must be supported by the constitution and ldnfa the stated case initially refers to missions aimed at preventing collective risks and s upporting or reinforcing security measures which seems to indicate nonmilitary intervention b the armed forces performing duties that do not imply the use of armed means however the reference in the final part to in the event of external aggression or threats seems to indicate verification of the underlying principles for military defence reacti on the armed forces mission as suggested in the case study is analysed taking into consideration the text and the context in which it is formulated 246 contribution to the review of the constitu tional status of national defence and of the armed forces it was deemed appropriate to start by analysing ev if briefly the existing legislative framework in order to correctly handle the issue this purpose f this brief legislative analysis would be to provi input to the adjustment of the constitutional statu s of national defence internal security and the armed forces current constitutional law possesses quite limite d range of missions for the armed forces article 146 associated to more restrictive co ncept of national defence which is still not constitutionally established nonetheless the constitution article 147 assigns to the police the role of defending democratic law and guaranteei ng the internal security of citizens b in reality the legislator adopted more restricti ve definition of national defence which was essentially designed as an instrument that would gu arantee the components of the state national independence territorial integrity and the general public and would be exclusively externally directed providing it with exclusively military responsibility the fundamental concern of the abovementioned prin ciples was to separate national defence from the defence of internal order internal security nd to establish the constitutional model of the armed forces in conformity with that in force in t he democratic constitutions of the west via unequivocal and full submission to political power the core vector of the constitutional concept of na tional defence not stated is safeguarding the country against external threat or aggression vi the armed forces this is separated from the defence of internal order which is constitutionall assigned to the police national defence should be expressly referred to in the constitution as one of the tasks and responsibilities of the state that results from the very duty of guaranteeing national independence the legislative framework should also detail the pa rameters that must be complied with and the end purpose to be pursued by national defence for exam ple ffoorrççaa 22002200 70 the objective of national defence is to guarantee t he democratic institutions and international agreements national independence territorial inte grity and the freedom and security of the general population against any external threat or aggressio n in full compliance with constitutional system concept adopting the middle ground should be asse ssed when the constitution is next reviewed this intermediate concept should restrict the conce pt of national defence to the protection from external threats but state that as result nati onal defence has to take on global and inter ministerial posture and cannot be solely confined to the military plane this concept must be in conformity with the concept of national defence pro per given that the policy of national defence is global in nature comprising military component nd nonmilitary component also the policy of national defence has interministerial scope an d all bodies and departments of the state are responsible for fostering the conditions that are ssential to its execution as indicated above though military defence is an essential component f national defence it continues to exclusively belong to the armed forces as defined in the const itution of the democratic republic of timor leste and should be appropriately liaised with ldn fa this fundamental law establishes the possible use f the armed forces in exceptional or extraordinary situations of public necessity such as in situation of martial law or state of emergency as is the general case amongst pluralist democracies this is established in the falintilfdtl organic law and in complementary legi slation as yet unpublished these are exceptional circumstances in which the armed forces can be called on to carry out security missions inside the country which are consequently not with in the ambit of national defence in addition to the general mission primary and specific of the armed forces as defined in the constitution and the falintilfdtl organic law the re is provision for their use in missions in the public interest which would allow the armed fo rces to collaborate in tasks related to meeting basic needs and improving the quality of life of th general public article 3 of the organic law provides for support to internal security forces an d assistance under the scope of civil protection nevertheless the constitution should pave the way for governmentlevel lawmakers to assign missions in the public interest to the armed forces which have nothing to do with the use of armed means and which should be included in the ldnfa the constitution could for example have provision worded as follows the armed forces can be ordered pursuant to law to collaborate in civil protection missions in tasks related to meeting basic needs and improving the quality of life of the general public 25 ministry of national defence the development of ministry of national defence w ith the decision making capacity to handle issues related to national defence is essential the approval of the organic law of the ministry of national defence and the general staff of the armed forces is necessary in order to define the structural framework of the military component of n ational defence this organic law will also establish the integrated duties for the implementat ion of military strategy in order to prepare and make the forces battleready ffoorrççaa 22002200 71 the cemgfa is responsible through the minister of n ational defence to the government for implementing the operational strategy which the nisters task is to draft and execute national defence policy and the same is also responsible fo r planning and steering military strategy particularly in relation to the development of the force the cemgfa exercises the operational command of the armed forces and therefore commands the land air and sea components of the same th us each component will be responsible for the readiness of its forces and their preparation and training all operational units will be dependent on the components operational command the minister of national defence is politically res ponsible via duties inherent to the post for the drafting and implementation of the military compone nt of national defence the current ministry of defence should improve the institutional liaison ca pacity with the general staff of the armed forces relative to the drafting of strategic and political guidelines and directives for cemgfas forces planning process structural review of the human and material resources of the ministry of defence should be performed which includes the int ernational bilateral and inutil consultants and which could effectively contribute to the soca lled capacity building of national human resourcesfn building the institutional nature of the armed for ces and transform the ministry into functional and competent governing body in accord ance with the objective vision of the state of timorleste14 all other ministries besides the ministry of natio nal defence are politically responsible for implementing the nonmilitary components of nationa l defence policy in the fields within their ambit thus each minister is especially responsible for c oordinating and contributing within the scope of their areas to the drafting of the strategic natio nal defence concept to managing the activities of their ministry that impact in any manner of the execution of the national defence policy and to be answerable for the preparation and use of the mean s dependent on their ministry in the national defence tasks assigned them 26 military defence the aim of this strategic document is to provide vision that lays down the strategic guidelines that are of use to the armed forces in better designin g the strategic plan while including consideration s on the subject of national defence and the military defence component in particular in order to achieve this the security of timorleste should be analysed from global perspective that is expanded from historic past legacy that we cur rently bear strategies that define the best way forward must be assessed taking into account the p ossible compromising scenarios open to the country in relation to the full and total withdra wal of the military component we have dedicated few critical words to the vacuum left i n the transition period to the government of timorleste taking over control of security the military defence component must therefore embod an essential pillar

we had to defeat timorleste is to knock over the mountains the invincible spirit of its nature while in the future we shall have its on the mountains the seas horizon to protect and defend the sea is to make timorleste i ndependent today it is sovereign nation it has its independence in front of it and the nationa l objectives to be achieved the abundance of its natural resources in the sea mark out the path for the future it is thus vital that strategies defin ing the sea as the source of development and prosperity are established defence in the broadest sense is pillar of the af firmation of sovereignty which fundamentally establishes the equilibrium for the development of the state if the country has an appropriate defence posture its stability will be guaranteed the nations most important missions are assigned to national defence which is the institution repre senting the sovereignty of the state military and nonmilitary tasks and responsibilities are depo sited in it to defend national interests defence arose in the countrys historic past and it is nowadays new embryo of conventional defence on one hand it constituted factor of i nternal stability within the geographical boundarie s of the country and on the other it sought out new horizons by looking beyond its sovereign borders to better preserve and defend it in strategic man ner falintil have left legacy for an independent timo rleste that is immeasurable in terms of wisdom capital and experience for the defence of th nation the values of falintil translated into legacy of sacrifice and dedication of hono ur and pride of glory and victory of unity and cohesion of the liberation and independence of tim orleste constitute an unalliable legacy to be transmitted to future generations the transition effort from responsibility in def ence and security matters was systematically orientated as well as prioritised and exclusively steered towards the pntl this imbalance which was created by the low proportionality assigned to the performance of falintilfdtl is probably due to the uns lack of experience in creating and developing armed forces and also to the unconvincing commitment taken on by the multilatera l mission to support the creation and development of the armed forces of timorleste this lack of guidance and endeavour by the left independent timorleste with the challenge of gaining experience testing its capacity to define its strategic panorama to define and steer the par tnerships while it makes use of its sovereignty to establish bilateral relations according to national interest the theories on how to defend timorleste whic h have been imported by number of individuals and organizations connected to timorlesteese insti tutions solely serve as benchmarks for the development of any strategic document on timorlest because it is up to the timorese to define their own path for the future and nobody better th them is able to select the best way of defending their country this capacity has already been demonstrated in the past when falantil were deemed to be group of fugitives and rebe ls against the occupying indonesian power and its allies and there were number of attempts to exti nguish falantil and the people of timorleste it is well known that the armed forces of timorles were created from an embryo known as falantil and left in conditions less than suitable for them to take up operational duty however ffoorrççaa 22002200 73 once the ffdtl was created it was not provided the capacity to develop with clear indications on the transition of tasks and responsibilities adapte d to the real situation in timorleste there was on the contrary reluctance to defend the strategic interests of timorleste there existed and there still exists lack of co herent and sufficient multilateral endeavour to assis t in defence and prepare the formulation of plans fo r the development of the armed forces of timor leste the armed forces may become deadweight to the nation due to the lack of structural and functional military defence mechanisms technical military equipment and material resources infrastructures and financial resources established for the armed forces in conformity with the interests of timorleste we believe multilatera l contribution in line with the commitments made in the various donor conferences on defence would id in minimizing and overcoming the real deficiencies existent in the armed forces but as we have found out to the contrary the external influence of donors tends to convert our national i nterests into their strategic interests 27 ministrial directive on military defence dmdm while the establishment of the strategic national d efence concept is in the drafting process the approval of

the terms of reference contained in the same as benchmark in order to as sess the operational state of the force however the pdfs were never fully implemented with the monitoring cycle and concise assessment of the force development strategy the growth of timorlestes armed forces over these last five years is deemed to have been positive despite the range of difficulties that it has faced this growth has simultaneously weakened its reputation amongst the national and in ternational general public through constant incidents provoked by persons and groups of people not as disposed to military life and who joined the institution through cooption volunteering or simply by means of the sympathy forged for the good of the nation this fact has consequently tributed to making the institution

which encompasses the military budget upkeep and real investment on the other hand taking into consideration the requirements and demands of the general public related to the v alues of democracy

speed of social mutation in this age of globalization the prospective brutal increase in national economic social and political burdens and even the incapacity of those in government to respond to the new and constant needs for change therefore clear strategic path is required from timorlestes leaders in order to modulate nat ional policy toward quickly overtaking the fissures and competition

based on the experience of falintil ie possess light fl exible and versatile structure with the capacity to establish controlled hubs of action and combat thro ughout the country this is factor that boosts forces and national cohesion and is preferentially orientated toward the defence of the sea as dissuasive factor and one in the national interest the pdf in force provides some conventional indica tions that clearly indicate the operational tasks assigned the structures of the armed forces design ed according to the doctrine and system strategically attributed to timorleste restrictin g the immediate dimensions of the defence of the sea this pdf simply aims to turn the armed forces of timorleste into symbolic force into force to guard or secure strategic points in order to consolidate the regional strategic defence of other countries including world powers using the dominant doctrine in order to achieve its strategic interests we deem this stance to be problematic nd compromising the aim of which is to blackmail the future of the people of timorleste who fought sacrificed and died for that future for their own freedom and independence efforts to reestablish neighbourly relations with indonesia are along the lines of harmonizing relations between timorleste and indonesia as two sovereign and neighbouring countries and mutual understanding of direct security and defenc in this vein we must guarantee and develop the capacity of the armed forces in order to implem ent combined operations or interoperability between indonesia australia and timorleste or on another level with the end purpose of near and extended defence according to the definition gi ven the national strategic defence concept 293 objective of military defence in the abovementioned guideline the objectives in the military component of national defence are as follows modularly create and develop module system m ilitary institution that incorporates the historic

and lightly equipped at the combined intervention compa ny level and with the light naval force acting in the marine operational environment throug h patrol boats and marines in this manner the armed forces may be able to systematical ly develop dissuasive capacity in conflict prevention action as well as be able to serve as factor of national cohesion d develop and employ exclusively military capaci ty in the light naval force from the coast to zee with the broadened participation of other bodies that possess administrative authority in the ambit of the defence and security of the mariti

and democratic state governed by the rule of law steering interna tional relations through the clear pursuit of national values and interests and through endeavour fully respecting international law and human rights and based on the ideals of peace secu rity and cooperation f prevent any attempt to impose secondary strate gic commitment on the armed forces this would prevent the armed forces from

to prevent limit or manage tension generating situations which may thr eaten global and regional stability and security identifying the areas previously cited in the strategic environment of timorleste as bearing priority the aim of dmdm in the area of strategic planning i s to obtain the operational commitment of the forces according to the specific and generic missio ns attributed under the armed forces organic law ffoorrççaa 22002200 82 it takes into consideration the nonexistence of legislative framework for national defence which in turn defines the strategic concepts of national defence military defence and the use of forces and subsequently sets down operational requirements military planning or force planning to be develo ped in other words may subsequently provide global view related to the new panorama of th operational environment of timorleste and its integration into the general background for nationa l development military planning liaises with short and mediumterm objectives in fulfilling cons titutionally assigned missions related to the current climate of development of the armed forces military defence is applicable in the coverage zone or zone of probable combat the armed forces are guided in peace time or war time by an ao are of responsibility that is militarily defined to establish institutional integration and develop centrated proactive activities within the context of the objectives established according to the operati onal environment 294 conditioning factors number of limiting factors to the development of the armed forces of timorleste were found and identified these factors limit its capacity to ac hieve the abovedefined objectives outstanding amongst these factors is the economic and financial aspect which based on the countrys real situation require that the allocation of means and resources to the annual military defence budgets be carefully weighed up nonetheless we must be g uided by an overall and integrated perspective of the state where defence is public sector that deserves strategic investment that contributes to the countrys sustainability timorlestes armed forces are currently in preca rious situation in regard to the effective and conventional fulfilment of their mission this fac t is due to the lack of legislative structure military planning material resources equipment infrastruc tures and technical military resources it is also due to the readjustment of the doctrine and fundam entally at the operational level where there is difficulty in obtaining coherent bilateral consulta ncy to draw up military programs orientated towards military defence objectives in the operational cont ext of timorleste further influencing and compromising factors are t he political stance of the state the decisions tha t need to be taken and the willingness categorically demonstrated in the multilateral partnership models for the necessary development of the milita ry defence sector some analyses which were simplistic and indicative of underlying political nd strategic interests were transmitted through the force development plan in which the logical conclu sion was reached that timorleste can only have force with limited number of men and weapons 1 500 regular personnel divided into 2 light infantry battalions and supported by 2 coastal patrol boats and without any other necessary capacity for conventional dissuasion given the unfeasible economic situation in the country b specific orientation the specific orientations are aimed at contextualiz ing and detailing the particular aspects of plannin g in the areas described below ffoorrççaa 22002200 83 295 forces in order to maintain continuity in the development of the force in modules the forces system the missions and forces deployment the number of perso nnel actually authorized versus the decrease andor increase of personnel that the force restruc turing and resizing process implies must be re discussed and reorientated by the authority of the state the current pdf continues to be the force planning reference in some areas of the forces upp er echelons though the cedn may foster definition of the cem and the adjustment of the abovementioned requirements the issue of national financial constraints may be the determining factor in the definition of the forces system however systematic effort to str eamline the forces system would allow the full use of existing structures to fulfil some of th specific and fundamental missions of the military defence of national territory and the surveillance of the permanent strategic national interest space eeinp in this context an operational force defined as nd force and light naval force should be urgently organised and be ready to intervene from 2007 to 20 10 the characteristics of this force will include high level of readiness size that is appropria to the countrys real situation and it should be capable of being projected outside of the country in task force modules on peacekeeping missions if so requested 296 armaments and equipment it is essential bearing in mind the principle of i nstitutional interoperability and the probable combined operations for security purposes that the armed forces think about making maximum use of the means already allocated and apply for new ans according to force planning needs and operational

guarantees the systematic monitoring of the deve lopment of the crisis to provide decisionmaking support this plan must be in harmony with the dev elopment of the national alert system and develop the detailed plans associated to each measu re resulting from that system develop plans for the use of the nonmilitary compo nent of national defence in coordination with the natural catastrophe and

neighbours and friendly countries may also participate in these exercises ffoorrççaa 22002200 85 30 development of the armed forces the constitution states that the armed forces of morleste falintilfdtl are responsible for the military defence of the democratic republic of timorleste the armed forces guarantee national independence territorial integrity and th freedom and security of the general population against any kind of external threat or aggression they ensure the safeguarding of the sovereignty of the state the armed forces must therefore po ssess an organization with the capacity that allows them to effectively respond andor act in the circumstances of their operational environment in order to 1 exclusively confront prevent andor combat any ty pe of external threat as national guarantee as last resort delay for sufficien t time to allow external support to intervene 2 intervene against any type of internal threat that jeopardizes national stability in exceptional circumstances laid down in legislation the armed forces of timorleste must be created in modules of small light units the armed forces units must be created at company level and graduall evolve to brigade level in future perspective the armed forces must accommodate professional and conscripted personnel which will progressively comprise the military potential of th three joint force elements the total potential of timorlestes armed forces must be structured accor ding to operational combat forces land and sea and territorial defence forces land and sea supported by the air support and service support components the armed forces of timorleste must possess the ca pacity to fulfil various types of mission in different theatres of operation in both peace time and war time in peace time

operational freedom 31 investment in military defence 311 introduction there exist doubts in the heart of the civil and military community regarding the relevance of the national defence policy in the context of the gover nments programme and the respective grand options of the plan for national development ffoorrççaa 22002200 86 after five years of development the armed forces s uffer from constraints that are critical to their survival if the armed forces must exist to consti tutionally defend the national interests of timor leste then they deserve to be treated justly and w ith dignity and be considered as strategic and priority institution for strategic investment from the state in the public sector if on the ry the armed forces are not priority in the national development plan then this option must be publicly stated by political leaders so that the h istoric value acquired by falantil during the fight for national freedom and the consequent creation of new regular force falantilfdtl is not undermined the pragmatism of the armed forces of timorleste has its own existence which is embodied in the veterans persistence in maintaining notable stat us and regular institutional standing however the position of the leaders of the state shows inst itutional scepticism demonstrated by the lack of decisions and leadership solutions in relation to t he development of the armed forces produced by the ministry under the jurisdiction of which nation defence falls the documents of the general state budget for the 200405 and 200506 financial years show lack of political will to plan the programs for the development of the armed forces similarly the 2005 and 2006 sector investment programme pis indicate the same less than encoura ging content regarding investment to guarantee the development and capacitybuilding of the armed forces 312 assumptions another facet of the lack of development of litary defence is the absence of mechanisms legislative framework defence budget planning system and defence plan program and project management which must be established in the mili tary programming law later on the development of these mechanisms is assessed in the biennial forces planning procedure cbpf which assesses the budget for military defence stituting funds for the real investment in the development of the armed forces the real investme nt must be steered towards achieving the political objectives of national defence the development of the armed forces is performed in line with its missions it would be necessary to possess information that is individually impossi ble to obtain in order to provide response to th issue of the precise details of the specific missio ns of the armed forces satisfactory response can only be obtained based on the conjunction of multip elements from different ministries briefly described above these elements include political orientation strategic information knowledge of existing resources human material and financial and others that may exist within defined timeframes the satisfactory response will allow real investment plan to be drawn up and included in the defence budget it becomes necessary after the real investment pla n has been drawn up and included in the defence budget to identify the main capacities that th armed forces of timorleste must possess and based on which its will be feasible to deduct the c oncrete missions and respective priorities regarding means which is formed into the national forces system and implementation timeframes the state after establishing the required capaci ties for the armed forces in the context of the current strategic timeframe 15 to 20 years and th detailing of the priorities regarding the analysi s ffoorrççaa 22002200 87 of structures and the deployment of forces that may be available at any given time in the event that the financial means are not immediately availa ble may resort to bilateral agreements to meet the needs for developing the armed forces in conformity with the set objective assuming that the maritime underlying guideline for ms part of the steering option for national development the state must assume investment in the armed forces light naval force as priority in relation to military planning management invest ment in the light naval force component must be prioritised to the following areas instruction and training human and material resources equipment uniforms and infrastructures 313 recommendations it is recommended considering the strategic role f the armed forces in national development and its inseparable inclusion in strategic public inves tment that real investment for the development of the armed forces be included in the general state b udget the state must maintain the thinktank method for th sustainable development of the armed forces this thinktank studies and advises on mili tary defence matters including the details regarding the acquisition of war equipment and mate rial recommended for the armed forces of timorleste national defence consultant model w ould be advisable if compulsory military conscription is the option chosen then the creation of small scale domestic defence industry would be advisable the objective of which would be to produce uniforms and footwear dry rations ammunition and other types f military items and basic needs for

its geographical value and is still the object of dispu tes and conflicts over its appropriation and contro l just as elsewhere the various wars waged on timor lesteese territory have always been difficult and punishing experience for the countrys inhabita nts the falantil have marked the countrys history leaving behind unique heritage for independent timorleste which is of immeasurable importance in providing experience and knowledge to defend the nation the falantil are highly regarded by the timorlesteese people and participate unfailingly in the national reconstruction proc ess the current armed forces falintilfdtl emerged from this past and now form the embryo of conventional military defence structure on one hand they represent point of stability withi n national borders and on the other they can bring pressure to bear externally in response to the challenges posed by the wider world outside their sovereign borders with the aim of better defending these borders both militarily and diplomatically in terms of shared strategic interests 38 land strategy the strategic importance of the land forces has is fundamental in any conflict wherever it may be for two reasons firstly the use of territory as n land forces base is unequivocal in the eyes of society and awakens hope thus guaranteeing nationa l backing giving it decisive political value secondly the land forces has the unique ability to take occupy retain and guarantee territory and can maintain permanent presence over long perio d the land forces seems to embody the whole conflict in that winning or losing on the gr ound is synonymous with victory or loss for the country the falintils experience demonstrated bo th the operational capacity and the relevance of territorial defence the land forces can maintain and sustain its influe nce from or for the land during peacetime crises and wars it can be used to defend timorlestes so vereignty protect national interests and guarantee national independence military operation s by the land forces are an obvious way for the armed forces to contribute to state objectives and also to assist civilians during peacetime for example through peace missions evacuation opera tions humanitarian assistance and aid and assistance to civilian populations since the land forces is an operational force which can provide strategic support to the state and has adequate res ources at its disposal to allow it to adapt to any changes in strategic circumstances 39 developing the land forces the model of joint force has been gaining ground in armed forces across the world in our case this is strategic principle which should be adopt ed by the national defence policy since it offers maximum flexibility and versatility and also compli with the proposals in the military defence strategy the timorleste land forces should be st ructurally integrated into units of operational land combat forces and units of territorial defence forces both units should be small well equipped with arms or specialised troops have si gnificant firepower and manoeuvre capacity structure troops vehicles weapons logistics an d communications at their disposal and be ffoorrççaa 22002200 96 coordinated in such way as to allow increases in firepower and combat capacity to destroy the enemy if necessary the policy adopted on timorlestes military potent ial must dovetail with the new model for the armed forces this model is based upon greater flex ibility and versatility and reflects the ideas contained within the military defence strategy th multidimensional nature of the land forces means that its command must be perceptive intuitive innovative competent and cisive as well as being highly motivated to design define predic t and plan the use of means and resources against enemy during wartime and construct the cou ntry during peacetime the land forces should maintain the philosophy of the falintil as doctrine laying down the principles of any war

capacity and is highly efficient allowing autonomy flexibility and mobility given the need to assure the security and defence of national territory this can be achieved by bestowi ng certain areas of

forces timorleste is an archipelago and given the nature of maritime threats and the vital role the sea plays in national interests the country must either guarantee surveillance and control of its seaspace or have minimum force at its disposal t sea which can act as far as possible as deterrent against any external risk or threat and can provide constant support to the land forces s operational tasks if this objective is to be met it is imperative that the naval component of the structure be given greater importance via streaml ining and restructuring process short term with view to achieving functional efficiency in fulfilling missions and eventually developing li ght naval medium term timorleste does not need large naval force capab of defeating its most probable enemies but rather lightweight component of an integrated nav force that is light naval force able to defend national interests and act as deterrent i n pragmatic terms timorleste must begin with an integrated and light naval force capacity and st eadily develop it into light naval force this light naval force should be compatible with nationa l resources and responsibilities and possess interoperable operational resources with emphasis placed on good investment in uptodate recent technology and appropriately trained crews if it fulfils these requirements the light naval force will be able to carry out eez surveillance patrol the slocs escort and assure the safe passage of oil tankers and guarantee the security of oil platforms it must act as deterrent against possible attacks possibly contribute to peaceful conflict r esolution participate in operations of common interest under the terms of the partnership and sentially cooperate in missions of public interest carried out by the state in future perspective th is naval capacity could take on more offensive and proactive stance in defence of the szpnis in r esponse to the regional requirements in addition participation in the asiapacific secu rity forums as possible member of regional security and cooperation organisation will create xpectations of security guarantees in timorleste and this is inextricably linked to the effectivenes s of our foreign policy and our ability to set up complex network of bilateral and multilateral relat ions the volume supporting documents annexed to this s trategic blueprint for the

coordinate and fulfil the national defence objective of using nava l resources in the main defence and security missions of public interest involving humanitarian aid this political and legislative framework is indispensable if timorleste is to establish itself as maritime state when defining the deployment strategy the link b etween naval resources and the naval fusiliers it is important to match its use to the vectors to be defined leaving open the option of future growth nevertheless during the first phase sho rtmedium term deployment should be in small detachments able to embark and carry out boarding ctivities inspectionseizure of vessels and provide humanitarian support to populations which for environmental reasons are isolated and where access is only possible by sea coast particu lar attention should be paid to the oecusse enclave and atauro island which have armed forces presence to guarantee their territorial defence within the future scope of the national fo rces system the naval fusiliers with their specific characteristics and capacities could ev constitute the cemgfa operational reserve 421 the sea and naval power in national defence st rategy timorlestes archipelagic characteristics and reso urces in the timor sea indicate that it is essentially maritime nation the sea vector shou ld therefore constitute determining factor when defining national defence strategy timorleste is linked by sea to its main regional partners maritime economic activities can become significa nt factor in national progress and wellbeing maritime communication circuits have considerable influence on the national economy the countrys foreign policy commitments have maritime foundations this statement is not intended to limit national interests resulting from our peopl desires needs possibilities and culture to exclusively maritime aspects it is merely intended to emphasise the fact that maritime interests should be considered as relevant factors when condu cting political economic social and military affairs in the sense that the sea emerges as rea l asset which has not always been regarded as such in national life and that of the timorese stat the sea has vital dual importance to timor leste and it is for this reason that it should be c onstituted and recognised as maritime state on the one hand the maintenance of its own identi ty and sovereignty depends on the use of its maritime characteristics on the other hand the ec onomic importance of the sea namely the timor sea is essential to its economic viability and tainability international conflicts originate in the collision of states interests although timorleste is sma ll country its most important interests mean that it is unrealistic to consider it possible to overcome foreign controversies without the use of armed forc the new strategic environment and ffoorrççaa 22002200 101 developments of the current conflict confirm that diplomacy without force is nothing more than an exercise in abstract and inconsequent rhetoric the refore in any of these crises the versatility of naval power used in accordance with appropriate li nes of action will contribute to the success of timorese foreign policy it is known that during the last decade the medi ation of land peace operations has fascinated some publicists who hurried to prepare strategic concep tions of national defence limiting the role of the navy to logistical support however such strategic conceptions reveal substantial lack of understanding of the role of the naval forces in th defence of national interests they also illustrat the lack of understanding on the part of their au thors and defenders of the nature of conflicts and the importance of coherence and equilibrium between land air and naval forces in addition to the indispensability of joint action in addition they demonstrate strategic myopia phenomenon which is very characteristic of extreme and corporative p ositions which when guiding and conditioning the organisation edification and deployment of the arm ed forces for very specific situations ignoring it s main mission reduce the leaderships flexibility t deal with future events which are difficult to predict and whose relative probabilities are diffic ult to evaluate civil society and rulers understand that the coste ffectiveness relationship of an armed force whose constitution is based on such strategic conceptions will be irrational and will require sacrifices from the nation to which it will not provide due compen sation in the form of security consequently the absence of logical starting point for the choice and orientation of the main guidelines for national defence strategy can make the harmonious developmen t of the armed forces unfeasible in timor leste and may have negative impact on the milita ry due to lack of motivation amongst personnel the redirection of individual skills to private act ivities and the involvement of the military in poli tical affairs in the case of timorleste if our country loses the capacity to defend itself and to participate equitably in collective defence efforts it will co nsequently cease to have voice in international organisations moreover when sudden conflict eme rges in which timorleste cannot remain neutral or participate with forces its national so vereignty and independence will be put at risk thi s situation will reduce timorleste to the condition of colony of the nationstate providing its defence regarding this point it should be noted that in th study by kings college18 commissioned by untaet united nations transitional administration in east timor in 2000 and the basis of the creation of the falintildefence forces of timorle ste the majority of the donor countries with the exception of portugal did not agree that the falin til defence forces of timorleste should have naval component which can be seen in the explicit reference made after the analysis and discussion of option 3 where the following is stated coastal security will be minimally assured in the s hort term by the frontier and customs services whose modest capabilities are bet ter than nothing the informal indication that australia may be disposed to patrol east timors territorial waters should be analysed to ensure greater degree of protectio n p58 18 independent study on security

other naval equipment and contribution towards operational costs which the timorese defence forces may benefit from in the future p60 these statements indicate situation which puts morlestes sovereignty at risk by proposing that responsibilities related to national sovereign ty are transferred to other countries this situati on can be avoided if there is intelligence and the pol itical will to readjust and restructure the operational organisation of the armed forces makin g them effective and deserving of national credibility through measures appropriate to the morese culture and reality not influenced by politicomilitary mistrust and the interests of oth er countries in this task it is important to bear in mind that timorleste cannot lose the capacity to d efend itself at sea and to look after its main resources therein which implies having truly ope rational naval capacity an essential instrument to maintain national power at suitable level to meet the requirements of its national defence strategy within the wider context of national development t he sea should be one of timorlestes most valuable resources which if properly used can cou nterbalance limited influence in the regional context in fact the sea has enormous future poten tial within economic scientific research security and defence areas and is capable of constituting n ot only source of wellbeing but also an element of prestige and national affirmation the identific ation of each of these areas leads to the conclusio n that the sea is vital to timorleste and that the conomy scientific research security and defence should form the vertex of new strategy based on t he sea 422 the use of naval power in the current scen ario and the structure of naval strategy given some of the prospects for the future use of t he armed forces the enormous responsibility of the navy becomes evident however possible future naval military missions will be more complex possibly going beyond these scenarios and will inhe rently be an essential component of the maritime policy of each state in practice taking on militar functions and functions of public interest on the one hand the diversity of the possible uses of naval power in areas which do not always imply the existence of combat and the capabilities of naval forces constitute irreplaceable advantages for obtaining favourable decisions when interests exist between elements of the international political system on the other hand the characteristics warranting the use of operational naval forces in tasks inherent to publi c interests in times of peace crisis or conflict enable an excellent costeffectiveness relationship to be achieved within the components of these forces given the scenarios referred to above naval power can contribute significantly to dealing with future challenges by confronting the following threats to countries interests resulting from thnic and religious conflicts and from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction requi ring the timely presence of naval forces in common strategic areas ffoorrççaa 22002200 103 threats resulting from the abuse of jurisdictiona l waters illegal immigration smuggling drugs and arms trafficking maritime terrorism eco logical problems and the conservation of resources related to pollution and overuse etc requiring the permanent exercise of effective control of the sea in the maritime areas adjacent t national territory the doctrine of timorlestes naval strategy should therefore be based on longstanding principles since it is unquestionable that naval capability i rrespective of its forces statute should be conceived to guarantee the use of the sea through the deployment of force along the coast dominating vital coastal waters and controlling cri tical oceanic regions whenever necessary currently the use of force along the coast is carr ied out by making the most of the naval resources mobility concentration surprise command and co ntrol capabilities and firing power enabling the intelligent use of force the objective of challenges presented by potentiall antagonistic powers will not be control of the sea since this would be excessively demanding an d is therefore unfeasible for any country in the near future except where one of the parties is in situation of overt overall weakness however these powers will try to weaken the national capaci ty for control in critical oceanic regions in orde r to cause external ramifications for the economy or to create difficulties for naval operations it is therefore essential that timorlestes light naval force contributes to the free use of the sea as communications route for rightful national interest s and possibilities which may imply the capability to defend vital interests including the reprovisi oning of parts of national territory in light of the discontinuity of the territory in addition to the assumption of sovereign responsibilities in maritim areas under national jurisdiction the arguments presented above indicate structure for naval strategy which includes concept of action in which the objective of naval power is the defence of national interests through conservation of international order norms and prin ciples and affirmation of national sovereignty state authority contributed to by mission wh ose purpose is to guarantee the use of the sea based on the tasks of coastal force deployment dom ination of vital coastal waters and control of critical oceanic regions any one of these tasks can cover multiplicity of elementary actions varying from nuclear deterrents to hydrooceanographic studies adjusted to the timorese reality and available resources given the analysis of the international and regiona l context the current reality and prospects for the near future the tasks referred to above deploymen t of force along the coast domination of vital waters control of critical oceanic regions repre sent the greatest challenges to the deployment of naval power as essential characteristics of this structure for naval strategy it should be emphasised that apart from considering the balance between the need to deploy naval forces along the coast and at high sea possibly participating in joint andor combine d operations the central role of the combat capability of the naval component is clearly establ ished this should be guaranteed through units with amphibian capabilities namely the marines in order to obtain good results in situations of ffoorrççaa 22002200 104 peace crisis or conflict in addition evidence is hereby provided of the extraordinary utility of th characteristics of naval power mobility freedom w hen faced with political restrictions sustainabili ty and flexibility to provide appropriate levels of ffort in support of the states political economic social and military action confronting situations with different degrees of complexity and great unpredictability the proposed structure also places equal relevance on the joint deployment of military force without meaning that the naval units are in any way subordinate to the land component or the air component to be constituted the distinction be tween naval tasks according to each of the functions referred to above is found at the level of the predominant nature of the forces used and the geographic areas of action when exercising fun ctions to preserve international order forces are normally multinational and deployed outside maritim areas under national jurisdiction with respect to functions related to sovereignty forces are usu ally national and deployed within these areas in maritime nations the navy is traditionally heav ily relied upon assuming position of oceanic capability in the specific case of timorleste in order to assume our responsibilities in the processes and activities of the alliances we may pa rticipate in and also for the defence of our frontiers and maritime areas under national jurisdi ction it is indispensable that we possess credible naval power timorleste is experiencing relatively stable str ategic situation although it is not entirely free of dangers and uncertainties we should therefore main tain the capacity to resort to whatever means are necessary to protect our national interests pecially those related to the economic importance of the sea for national economic growth and develop ment naval power in times of war as well as in times of peace can be subdivided into three categories diplomatic military and public service currently these areas are not fully operational in timor leste although in the short run some areas of publ ic service can be guaranteed capabilities inherent to these three areas must be developed if we wish to maintain the status of maritime nation with naval power with effective participati on in international organisations in general terms states foreign policy is given credibility by the existence of both types of powe r military and nonmilitary naval power can contribu to achieving advantages within the context of the states external action defending or enlarging positions and interests the following elements are especially important within the context of principles of naval strategic doctrine i naval resources offer an immense and varied set of roles of military and diplomatic character able to serve foreign policy aims in the best way ii the light naval force component of the military sys tem presents multiplicity of characteristics making it particularly advantageou s for transmitting an extensive range of significant political signals this quality is main ly derived from the versatility mobility freedom of access capacity for graduated responses and selfreliance of naval resources iii navies play an especially useful role when th objective is friendly approach or avoidance of the actual use of force to resolve disagreements ffoorrççaa 22002200 105 iv joint and combined operations are realities to cons ider given that they represent solidarity and the opportunity to participate interoperabili ty and technological differences should be evaluated as soon as possible v despite the modern tendency for operations to be on the conflict scale prior to war and for the navy to be close to the coast facing opponents of whom they have prior knowledge far from their bases the underlying principles of the mahan theories still remain valid especially in respect of the concept of contro l of the sea and the inseparable link between naval power and the use of the sea to benefit the conomy vi the importance of naval power in times of peace or crisis is good subject to explore at public level participation in peace operations is wellaccepted by public opinion because people tend to associate usefulness with acceptabil ity the media plays an important role in preparing public opinion for any expeditionary acti on the media should be an added concern for force commanders in the sense of the n eed to transmit favourable image of the actions which are witnessed and of the personne l involved vii the falintil defence forces of timorleste compon ent can provide strategic visibility giving prestige to timorleste as long as measures are taken towards its consolidation and development in the next 15 to 20 years mainly with respect to surface oceanic and command and control capabilities political decisio ns regarding the budget will be based on their inherent beneficial value to the country viii there is still lack of institutional coordination between foreign policy and national defence policy during times of peace or crisis which can c ompromise the success of military action especially that of the naval component but this is not difficult to resolve 423 security and national defence at sea one of the key factors of commercial maritime devel opment is freedom for inoffensive use of the sea through the centuries the international community has attempted outside of belligerent contexts to maintain free access to navigation rou tes and has achieved this with varying degrees of success however the security of states themselves requires even in times of peace that the sea should not be used for illegal or risky purposes s uch as terrorism illicit immigration arms or drug s trafficking smuggling etc in addition the interests of maritime states canno t be jeopardised as result of threats to their vital interests at sea and they cannot have their terri tories attacked from the sea consequently in times of peace these states seek to deter the appe arance of risks and threats at an incipient stage through daytoday controls and to prepare reso urces capable of deploying force at sea timor leste is exception in its justified need to gua rantee the surveillance and control of its maritime areas in addition to having available minimum fo rce to act as deterrent at sea whenever possible to any risk or threat in order to do so the timorese state requires st rong naval authority coordinating the efforts of the various police forces and the civil authorities with competence in the area of maritime control in the sea and adjacent waters and which if necessary is able to resort to military naval and aerial means if and when these exist to intervene in the abovementioned areas ffoorrççaa 22002200 106 the risks and threats which can lead to more tradit ional situations of conflict require capabilities enabling timorleste with its allies to be prepar ed to move from deterrence to another stage of coaction if necessary maintaining set of resour ces permitting the deployment of missions in an autonomous form and with level of power which acc ords with its size 43 developing the capability of the light naval f orce within the context of timorlestes relationship wi th the sea it is herein argued that the country should possess light naval force with four main v ectors to be developed systematically in an integrated way 431 first vector in order to modernise and resize the light naval f orce in accordance with state objectives it is necessary to urgently acquire new coastal patrol vessels with defence and attack capabilities and greater flexibility and autonomy low cost investment operation and maintenance rapid assault launches and medium landing crafts f or the main security tasks such as supporting military operations search and rescue collaborati ng in the fight against drug trafficking terrorism illicit immigration smuggling piracy surveillanc against the overuse of sea resources polluters etc the naval resources acquired should be ap propriate to the type of sea on timorlestes northern and southern coasts and should be adeq uately supported by network of naval bases simultaneously to begin training the naval combat operational force marines possibly by external or internal recruitment through the conver sion of soldiers from rifle companies based on strict criteria and specific training the navy mar ine force will have to guarantee the states authority at sea from the land deployment being co ordinated with the maritime defence forces as defined in the future 432 second vector the light naval force should possess an autonomous naval logistics support capability for military purposes and have light an d medium landing crafts and multivariant logistics vessels ldl and ldm this capability can be used as an alternative transport service if and when requested for missions related to humanitarian aid and public interest 433 third vector education and naval training of technical personne l for the conventional strengthening and institutionalising of the light n aval force in order to respond to the structural needs defined in the first second and fourth lusofrench vectors and to the considerable investment in the maritime sector 434 fourth vector the light naval force should possess the capabilit to discourage any act of humiliation of the state of timorleste at sea or any offensive against its vital interests it shoul d also be able to participate effectively and with di gnity in any alliances which the state may commit itself to this capability should be progressively comprised of combat vessels frigate and corvette categories equipped with landtoland and landto air missiles in 3d supported by an ocean patrol vessel core support and attack helicopter units c uttingedge radar and sensors marines and anti mine divers until this capability has been establi shed the dret state can provide militarytechnical cooperation mechanism at the op erational tactical level within the scope of bilateral agreements aimed at the systematic and ex clusive creation of this capability franco portuguese given that it is indispensable to safe guard the interests of timorleste in relation to issues of naval authority ffoorrççaa 22002200 107 44 the system of naval authority the new realities and new challenges appearing with in the naval sector present new security requirements which accompanied by the evolution of international technical regulations maritime legislation have focused the attention of states on maritime security issues whose very nature is multidisciplinary the new vocation and basic maritime orientation of the state of timorleste should develop in an integrated and interministerial way it is urgentl necessary to define the strategic sectors which can be exploited and guaranteed so that timorleste can benefit from the relevant income derived from its maritime resources which have not yet bee n regulated in the sectors of industrial fisheries maritime communications circuits sloc mariti and port transport maritime tourism and scientific research i d considering the characteristics of the maritime are of national interest whose surveillance must be guaranteed effectively and the geostrategic situat ion of timorleste corresponding to confluence of the most important and most frequently used inte rnational maritime circuits additional attention must be paid to the prevention of potentially dange rous situations for national and regional interests related to the abuse of jurisdictional waters especially maritime terrorism timorleste possesses reasonable eez which also requires the existence of instruments able to respond effectively to the challenges posed as result of this the logical consideration of collective national in terests is therefore urgent in order to proceed wit h the evaluation of strategic aspects related to the development of the maritime economy first the state of timorleste should have policy of maritime orientation which includes all aspects of the strategic environment and in partic ular all sectors covering the diversity of the maritime economy potentially representing addition benefits to the country mentioned above the maritime vector cannot simply be guided towards maritime energy and fishing resources the importance of the international maritime route of t he wetar and ombai straights should be considered and evaluated both being consider ed strategic within national defence policy sloc defence and security other strategic aspects of the sector should be covered in order to evaluate and define maritime policy in coordinated integr ated and consolidated manner within national development policy second orientation towards an integrated and convergent maritime policy empowering the naval authority to defend its national strategic interest s and making the national maritime economy at sea viable thus minimising the impact of foreign strat egic interests which sometimes affect national sovereignty and force the country to accept less pr ofitable reciprocal commitments these impacts can in extreme cases escalate into disputes causi ng conflicts of diplomatic and military nature with predictable economic repercussions in terms of uncertainty and vagueness within the private and foreign sector in relation to bringing largesc ale strategic investments to timorleste third an evaluation of the consequences of an unbalance d maritime policy as an example one possible case study amongst others to be studied nd evaluated is the predictable backwash effect in the industrial fishing sector due to the nonreg ulated extraction of massive quantities of fishing resources which in the medium to longterm can we aken or even drain this sector this overuse of ffoorrççaa 22002200 108 resources will continue until the current situation is reversed amongst other factors the situation is characterised by the absence of an integrated fish eries law negligence in the definition of fishing licenses conceded to foreign fishing fleet owners in conformity with policy of regulating controlling and managing fish stocks lack of defin ition of compensation in terms of creating an employment quota for timorese human resources in th is sector strategic evaluation must be carried out with the aim of protecting national interests an unbalanced relationship between national human and other resources on board versus fishing profits will have unprofitable consequences for our country loss of control in definition and regulation of variables such as the duration quantity period of the year authorised for fishing carried out by fishing fleet owners in fishing zones has negat ive impact greater than the levies and taxes paid by these fishing fleet owners to the timorese state since this revenue will not produce any direct effects whatsoever it does not benefit the income level of national fishermen nor is it channelled into the development of an infrastructure capable f attracting real investment in the national maritime sector fourth the general state budget should consider the basi c orientation of maritime development as strategic investment vector for commercial indus trial and international security purposes in other words the synergetic conception of vision of mar itime development based on the maximisation of existing potential resources to be included in the national development plan as complementary vectors to the indispensable economic diversificati on of the national nonoilproducing sector given these and other concerns considerations and priorities the government of the dret can order the surveying of needs for the implementa tion of the abovementioned system of naval authority proceeding with the overall evaluation f the characteristics and types of entities bodies or services within an interministerial context re sponsible for naval authority especially through t he use of instruments for linking and coordinating these aimed at improving the effectiveness and operationally of their activities independently of the scope of this evaluation spec ial importance should be given to the gradual intervention of the light naval force in socalled missions of public interest especially in the ar ea of application and verification of compliance with maritime laws and regulations in areas under national sovereignty or jurisdiction amongst other s vessel control inspection of fishing combat of pollution and the repression of other illicit marit ime situations whose legitimation still resides within international law providing tools to combat drug trafficking terrorism and human trafficking the legal statute which will be defined should adhe re to this logic for consolidating the institutiona l and organisational resources of the light naval for ce as the essential pillar of the naval authority the system of naval authority should possess the ans for national coordination at ministerial level and for high level operational coordination in order to enable new dynamics in the convergence of efforts this will optimise the cap abilities of defence and security bodies in order to carry out governmental objectives in relation to th naval authority systems organisation and attributes the system of naval authority should ac t as the national naval authority creating conditions

character capacity and culture of the soldier of the f uture currently respect for the dignity of the human bei ng is the result of various conditions which the people of timorleste have experienced and has not always been the basis on which relationships between people and by extension between the milita ry have been built the notion still prevails that everything has to be subordinate to individual personal needs and only after this are collective needs satisfied it is not possible for this indivi dualism to prevail within an institution with the characteristics of the armed forces the exercise f military functions at all hierarchical levels fr om commanders to soldiers should clearly and unequivo cally reflect that the human rights established in the constitution and law are to be totally respe cted as well as being held as permanent guide on how to behave the right to use force in its v arious forms will be ruled by the use of the minimum force necessary to achieve decisive results and maintain cohesion and discipline within the armed forces discipline discipline should not be seen as inevitable but s cohesive factor in the armed forces to which all are equally subject disciplin has to be internalised by the soldier it is conscious responsibility of the soldier and cannot be imposed through the use of force all have equal obligations from the commander to his subord inates to maintain discipline as an institutional standard for everyone military discipline consists in the exact observati on of military laws and regulations and of the resolutions essentially derived and resulting from state of mind based on civic spirit and patriotism voluntarily leading to individual or gr oup fulfilment of the armed forces mission in order for discipline to constitute the basis on which the armed institution should stand the soldiers of timorlestes armed forces should stric tly observe the following in the present and the future all soldiers should internalise the fact that disci pline being condition for the success of the mission is consolidated and strengthened through c onsciousness of this mission through the observation of the law and exact fulfilment of duty through respect for everyones rights through competence and correctness in procedures r esulting from civic sprit and patriotism thus leading to natural acceptance of hierarchy nd authority and to the sacrifice of individual interests in favour of collective ones b commanders and leaders especially and all hierarch ical superiors in general should not forget that in all cases the attention of their subordinat is focussed on their actions and that as result their competence their irreprehensi ble firm but humane behaviour using and encouraging dialogue and clarification whenever appropriate and possible are the surest means by which to maintain discipline in addition comma nders are responsible for offences committed ffoorrççaa 22002200 116 by their subordinates or those who are hierarchic ally inferior whenever these offences originate in defective action on the part of those in command c the hierarchical superior can through his relation ship with his subordinates seek to be an example and guide he also has duty to care for t he interests of his subordinates respect their dignity help them with advice and appropriat attention never forgetting that all are linked through solidarity in performing common ssion d hierarchical superiors bear the responsibility for instructing and training subordinates serving under their command in knowledge of the legislation in force they are responsible for the orders they give which should be in accordance wit h the law and regulations or in cases to the contrary or extraordinary cases based on the be st reasoning obedience to these orders should be timely and total in exceptional cases in which the fulfilment of an order can be potentially disadvantageous or harmful the subordinate can if his superior is present and the situation is not one of military formation or work respectfully address the superior once precise authorisation is obtained with any reflections sidered appropriate but if the superior insists that the orders given must be carried out the subo rdinate should obey in timely manner although the subordinate has the right to report th complaint to the competent authority obedience is always due to the highest ranking pers on and amongst equal ranks to the oldest person except in special cases appropriately estab lished by law commanders should rely on style of leadership fav ouring communication and the participation of subordinates always seeking freely accepted discip line peoples selfesteem should be as highly valued as possible but should always derive from t he satisfaction of fulfilled duty all should understand and assume that the infringement of disc ipline is any omission or action contrary to military duty responsibility all soldiers when carrying out their responsibili ties within the falintil defence forces of timorleste structure have inherent res ponsibilities with respect to the positions or functions performed all should have the capacity to make decisions within the freedom of action attributed to each but will always assume the cons equences of the acts or omissions performed it is the responsibility of each one to use his capaci ties to the maximum level in the function performed in order that the results obtained best satisfy the entire institution and provide the best relationship between resources used and ends achiev ed courage members of falintil have had the courage to fight for cause despite the sacrifice of many thousands of lives it is in the shadow of those who preceded us that the armed forces of timorleste were built looking with courage to th future means recognising that the armed forces falintilfdtl will face dangers during their proc ess of institution building admitting our own fears and weaknesses but above all not being overc ome by them and always acting calmly firmly and responsibly it is indispensable that all fight for their convictions for what we believe in for what is just and for the truth the courage we will have to show cannot allow us to be carried along ffoorrççaa 22002200 117 by exaggerations but will make us act with ca reful reflection only thus can we overcome the challenges ahead of us team spirit it has already been mentioned that individualism groupings based on the suco municipality and regionalism must disappear and be replaced with collectivism with the need for common wellbeing there is doubt that with the continued and sustained development to be experienced by the armed forces the importance of collective action will be even greater in addition to spirit of unity and appropriate and c orrect team spirit based on the highest moral standards of its members all of whom should be subordinate to the interests of the military organisation and the institution of the dret state it will be the responsibility of the commanders to create an appropriate team spirit and atmosphere in order to stimulate group action to the detriment of the individual actions of each person professional competence it is not possible to consider the armed forces s credible if their members are not professionally competent and capabl the armed forces are usually the mirror of the nation we want valid and competent people in t he armed forces with high levels of knowledge of their profession in tactical and technical aspe cts in addition to other fields of knowledge rangi ng from administration to law commanders should be co nscious that as the soldier of the future becomes increasingly more professional greater dem ands will be placed upon the commanders themselves and as such they cannot permit themse lves to become outofdate their professional development should be continuous and centred on soc ial cultural intellectual and technological development as well as on constant concern for the evolution and maintenance of the equipment and material at the disposal of the armed forces the change from the old structure respected by all the falintil to the new structure the defenc forces of timorleste falintilfdtl still pose s substantial challenges these challenges must be ov ercome through the efforts of all by demonstrating the competence of the new force it is not an easy task to transform guerrillas into conventional armed forces but it has to be achieve d flexibility the new armed forces soldier must necessarily be flexible soldier adaptable to the new requirements of constantly changing world th soldiers of the defence forces of timorleste falintilfdtl should achieve high degree of ada ptability not only in the procedural area but also in the interoperability of material resources permitting greater exchange with neighbouring or allied defence structures being flexible is normal ly synonymous with intelligence intelligence is on of mans most important resources and man is the mo st important resource of organisations including military organisations the new soldier m ust learn to be more efficient and this will only be possible if his knowledge reaches an appropriate vel the soldier or warrior of the future should possess professional qualifications innovative cre ativity and be an individual who as soldier reacts and adapts to any circumstances 48 development of human resources the indonesian military occupation caused not only immense destruction and damage to economic structures infrastructures and institutional syste ms but also led to lack of skilled and experience d human capital it had an influence on education and thinking which currently affects the development of institutional systems and the socio economic and sociocultural fabric of the ffoorrççaa 22002200 118 country this legacy influenced the intended develo pment character and culture of institutions in the timorleste defence and armed forces sector dur ing the postindependence period as in other national sectors institutional reform and the rein forcement of human capital are essential and imperative if these objectives are to be achieved if on the one hand the educational academic and cultural training of the postinvasion generations had critical impact in terms of the difficulties experienced in articulating and incorporating them within the new institutions established by the stat of the dret which includes the armed forces the transformation of the existing forces falintil the national liberation forces of timorleste which has an unconventional structure and guerrilla characteristics is urgent and imperative for the institutional development of conventional armed f orces only in this way is it possible to plan the national defence sector and the armed forces make them viable and incorporate them within higher national interests and strategic national velopment objectives both now and in the future therefore any assessment of the needs training and development of human resources in the defence and armed forces sector should be anchor ed in the institutional training of the entire defence sector ie in the creation of an inst itutional environment with clear efficient and sustainable structure in terms of governance chai n of command policy definition planning and management provided with legal and ethical fram ework that governs all institutional practices and commitments defining mediumlong term strategy for both the human and the material resources of the armed forces is need which paral lels the need to define an institutional development strategy for the national defence secto r as whole including not only the armed forces but also the ministry of defence the present institutional administration situation with regard to both the ministry of defence and the armed forces reveals lack of planning or weak pl anning for training and education leading to strategic development in the area of management and command and in the creation of sustainable system for human resources the state should ad opt precise systems and pragmatic objectives for the effective management of military personnel inc luding both the command chain and the subordinate ranks and propose and approve the nece ssary regulations to enable this to take place two fundamental questions must be considered with regard to the strategic development of human resources in the armed forces of timorleste 1 the military character we intend to create within the armed forces the type pf soldiers we need to defend the nations interests and the ty pe of military leadership we need to command and administer institutional interests in rder to achieve all the stated objectives 2 the institutional character we intend to create for the nation the type pf ducation training and resources provided for soldiers to ena ble them to carry out their mission the type of programmes and initiatives the land forces shou ld carry out in order to maintain national prestige the guarantees of wellbeing protection and security offered to soldiers doctrinaire principles exist which respond to the above questions such as the mckinzey theory 7s military organisations should posses strong institutional character in order to instil patriotism in soldiers ffoorrççaa 22002200 119 in the armed forces as in the ministry of nation defence the human resources required to fulfil this mission are as rule established within th eir own organisational staff structure in timor leste the ministry of defence still lacks its own organic law and although the armed forces falintilfdtl have current organic law law 72 004 of 4 may it is clearly inadequate and urgently needs to be reviewed currently there appears to be contradiction withi n the armed forces in timorleste falintil fdtl with regard to the management of human resour ces concerning estimated number of troops for the organisational staff structures considered inadequate for many situations and personnel costs the solution must involve reassessment of troop numbers and improvements to quality at all levels of the hierarchy this will also involve reformulating structures in terms of missions and establishing troops in terms of the structures that are defined within the system for the national armed forces these troops will need to become bett er qualified through an integrated training system since the human factor must be prepared for incorporation into career structure which is increasingly complex and diverse demanding higher levels of knowledge yet which despite the evolution of technological systems and procedures still remains an essential element in warfare and military organisation it is therefore imperative to recruit highly qua lified competent and experienced human resources t provide support for leadership command managemen t technical assistance etc for the armed forces in timorleste it is considered essential t gain urgent approval for an organic law for the timorleste ministry of defence itself which shoul d cover certain key areas pertaining to the recruitment of qualified competent and experienced human resources specifically for strategic defence studies defence policies and the planning and management of the armed forces amongst other areas recourse to selected bilateral and commercial mea ns appears to be the most advisable solution for selection and contractual procedures which must be jointly decided and managed by the ministry of defence and the armed forcescemgfa these human re sources must be able to work within onetoone system of onjob training based on the transfer of knowhow knowledge aptitudes and skills behaviour and professional attitudes to nat ional human resources in order to enable them to work at the same levelpositionoffice 49 training and instrution system the training system plays structuring role in solidating and developing the forces soldiers in the timorleste armed forces must be considered the most important element in the armed system and must in themselves constitute system that i s decisive to the successful accomplishment of missions the creation of training system for the armed for ces of timorleste must be the direct result of the operational requirements that have been defined and for this purpose multidisciplinary working party should be formed which is capable of designing the architecture of the training framework for the armed forces of timorleste large number of different questions arise out of the issue of training firstly it involves definin g and characterising the profile of the armed forces soldier and prior to this it must include ffoorrççaa 22002200 120 definition of the concept of the operational use of units and equipment and an understanding of which responsibilities and duties arising out of th is should be assumed by soldiers and how the remainder should be allocated following th is it will also be necessary to define what which areas or segments of knowledge or educational values science and technology military techniques and tactics and operational and strategic leadership should be imparted for whom which ranks officers sergeants soldiers only certain ranks all ranks only certain sections when at what career level or stage should each type of knowledge be acquired where in which educationaltraining establishment in timorleste or abroad if abroad in which country or countries initially outside the rmed forces then afterwards administered through falintilfdtl instruction centres how through courses providing training promotion ad vanced skills qualifications specialisation or updating of knowledge all of these modular tra ining courses by attendance only or self study mixed system by whom which trainers should be used trainers from the falintilfdtl internationa l trainers as part of technicalmilitary initiatives accordin g to need in formulating the model for the intended trai ning the following may serve as guidelines 1 there should be three levels of training ba sic most personnel to be administered by the metinaro instruction centre intermediate sergean ts and subaltern officers bilateral cooperation initiatives higher officers in posit ions of leadership basically provided abroad 2 the matrix should consist of basic training supplem ented by training courses offering advanced skills updating of knowledge qualificati ons and specialisation within the same occupational or professional area 3 basic training must be guaranteed for officers of t he timorleste armed forces trained under bilateral cooperation agreements 4 the training carried out at present through militar cooperation initiatives must be duly integrated into the training framework and managed by an appropriate department training directorate 5 training syllabuses national and foreign must be produced 6 course design must include definition of the huma n resources which meet the established operational requirements and must stipulate the pur poses occupational standards and training profiles skills in relation to functions together with clearly defined training skills and aptitude learning objectives 7 teaching methods in prestigious instruction centres in other countries indicate learning through subject units orientated to wards specific professional duties 8 the statutes for soldiers in the armed forces will be an important influence that must be taken into consideration in relation to the trainin g framework 9 career planning should generate the appropriate typ of training 10 education and training may be established within th context of reciprocal trade cooperation agreements involving packages of resour ces and materials finally it is important to note that the system fo r unit operational training should pay heed to and attempt to establish appropriate links with this tr aining these links are important in relation to on ffoorrççaa 22002200 121 job training which is understood to be an ongoing means of acquiring and assessing the knowledge required to undertake specific professional duties 50 the idealised training centre education and training component cfet the education and training component is the base st ructure for training the military forces it is the component which prepares ordinary citizens from scratch to the point where they are professional soldiers or citizens with an understanding of the d efence of the country and its people basic trainin g in patriotism for citizens takes place through oppo rtunities to serve the nation in the armed forces if the armed forces possess centres of excellence for military training the concept of defending the nation will be guaranteed in the hands of citizens it is necessary to build up the structural capital of the nation through the military institution as n element in national cohesion the historical capita l gained by timorleste during the process of liberation discloses essential values that provide us with reason for existing and acting in the wor ld as free and independent nation the values that give prestige to the armed forces through their knowledge and experience of serving the country sh ould be institutionally preserved and cultivated in order to shape the character of soldiers in the future it is imperative to define the doctrine and the ventional institutional character reflected in the basic training provided for soldiers through new sy llabuses already mentioned in the previous point concerning education and training when the operational requirements of the armed fo rces have been defined in accordance with the system for the fulfilment of missions by the nation armed forces the education and training system for soldiers will be designed the instruction centres should be strategically loc ated in command sectors and in the respective components of the forces all candidates must under go an integrated basic and elementary training course either on voluntary basis or as an obligat ory part of their service in the armed forces after basic and elementary training solders may be given the opportunity to take part in specialist technical courses an added qualification which all soldiers should possess those who have the opportunity to engage in military career should ttend training courses at the infantry school naval academy or other specialist training schools as part of the training of specialist military staf f either within the country or abroad the military academy may be an option for strategic investment in shaping the military officer of the future the academic training course may be taken w ithin the country in coordination with other state academic institutions or for obvious reasons with recourse to outside support through technical military cooperation agreements leadership including both tacticaloperational and strategic leadership is another important aspect of training it prepares higherranking military of ficers to occupy positions of command all superior officers should follow as minimum requirement staff officers course and receive training in ffoorrççaa 22002200 122 leadership and command to meet the previously desc ribed challenges for the development of the armed forces in timorleste it is intended that the missions of the armed fo rces of timorleste should include international commitments in the near future such as deploying national contingent of the armed forces on united nations missions the education and training component would be the ideal structure for preparing task force at company level for unite d nations missions in accordance with operational requirements and on the basis of poli tical decisions concerning the readiness of the contingent and the rota established 51 bilateral and mult ilateral programmes combined analysis of national challenges regiona l alliances and global strategies see chapter 1 defining the strategic environment for timorleste postulates that timorleste will never be able to survive in isolation as nation whilst ignoring th phenomenon of interdependence amongst states this therefore presupposes the urgent need to establish cooperative bilateral and multilateral relations with immediate close and more distant ne ighbouring countries for the purposes of economic development and world security in additi on to ensuring peace and shared stability the cooperation established through alliances is orient

objectives are the same ie keeping in permanent contact with the population and maintaining the capacity to mobilise on national scale to defend the nation ffoorrççaa 22002200 128 the combat structure of the light infantry battalio ns should be redefined and reorganised into small company units within territorial organisations ope rational areas would be decentralised to create greater flexibility and mobility in combat and in the cover zone greater firepower section of the light infantry battalion should be converted into multipurpose force and naval fusilier detachments should gradually be formed to join the light naval fleet three command sectors should be established to direct these units establish contac t networks with the civil authorities and provide cimic actions and humanitarian aid given the present situation of the armed forces wit h regard to fulfilling the military objectives established within national objectives it would be more beneficial to the country to maintain armed forces operational units based or organised at batt alion level when they are systematically able to act as deterrent force in preventive actions in s ituations involving internal conflict in addition to constituting element of national cohesion the intention of these strategic specifications is to define the military plan for the development of the armed forces and achieve full operational use f the forces in accordance with their constitutionally defined missions the successful conclusion of the strategy for devel oping military defence presented here may contribute towards

has been given to the concepts of mobility and versatility rapid engagement and total cover this operational reconfiguration will provide our troops with greater mobility and fighting capability by planning and developing the forces through the crea tion of small welltrained units orientated and equipped in terms of the multiple aspects of deterr ence and increased strength the units are to be constituted in accordance with the previously propo sed system for the national armed forces this new form of organisation for the forces will make c4irs more efficient and will reproduce the living example of the valuable experience of the fali ntil during its historic struggle for national liberation whilst also taking into account the cur rent restricted technical military resources which are still being assembled 534 some considerations dispersal of forces in small units although the degree of dispersal must increase in proportion to the size of the enemy attack some restrictions must be

guerrilla grouping which has greater mobility and f irepower relative to the platoon structure responsible for one area of operations c concentration of forces into battalion units the combat structure at battalion level does not co rrespond to the timorleste operational environment although it provides greater potential for combat manoeuvres and reduces reliance on conventional logistics

defined in accordance with the sfn within the cedn in terms of military defence the concept of engagement is orientated towards areas which are considered combat zones ie zones subject to possible direct threats from enemy advances military defence is applied to the combat zone or c over zone in times of peace or of war the armed forces are orientated towards militarily defined op erational areas or areas of responsibility to establish institutional integration and develop int ensive proactive measures within the context of the operational environment the administrative definition of the national terri tory of timorleste designated an archipelago includes the eastern half of the island of timor t he oecusse enclave the island of ataúro the jaco islet the batukoecusse islet is disputed and th vast seas to the north and south of timorleste at present national territory is defined by 13 adm inistrative districts 65 sub districts and 497 sucos villages in military terms national territory must be divid ed into three military command sectors east central and west ie the eastern sector the cent ral sector and the western sector these sectors are geographically distributed by administrative di strict the westerncentral command sector covers the oecusse enclave and the centraleastern comman d sector covers the island of ataúro and the jaco islet the territorial waters off the south co ast of the timor gap and the north coast of the timorleste sea are the sole responsibility of the light naval fleet within the concept of the military defence of timor leste national territory we should consider the ways in which the enemy can be denied access to par ticular areas of national interest in order to maintain tactical and strategic objectives the maritime and terrestrial air and space border s are our areas of responsibility the terrestrial operational areas established within the eastern ctor covering the northern and southern shores will be considered cover and combat zones zoco t he central andor eastern sector resistance reorganisation and refuelling zone zoro and the astern sector reserve zone zores the western sector covers the oecusse enclave the cen tral sector covers the island of ataúro and the eastern sector covers the jaco islet the southern and northern expanses of the timor sea would be configured as the various zones of

expanses of sea to the south th timor gap and the north the ombaiwetar straits we should however consider areas of int erest and influence as nonengagement zones within all terrestrial and maritime areas constitut ing national territory 536 armaments and equipment bearing in mind the principle of interinstitutiona l operations with regard to national security it i s essential to make maximum

the armed forces should be improved based on the concept of combined logistics with regard to the purchase of consum ables and fighting materials and equipment which guarantee not only improved coordination but also b etter use of scarce state resources within this framework we should proceed towards rationalised combined and coordinated use of services and infrastructures shared by more than on institution particularly with regard to public healthmilitary services studies should be commissioned on the implementatio n of an advanced telecommunications infrastructure with integrated strategic and tactic military communications systems 5311 infrastructure situation at present the infrastructure of the armed forces including the actual ghq is not worthy of an institution which represents the sover eignty of the independent state of timorleste the entire historic period of the glorious falint il represents the dignity of the resistance the cantonment and attempts to disarm the falintil represented regression in the understanding of the defence of the sovereignty of timorleste and c onstituted security dilemma for the transitional administration in timorleste we believe that it was hard and difficult decisio n for the authorities to create defence force for timor leste even so the armed forces of timorleste were founded through the determination and co nviction of the members of the falintil themselves as part of the historic cycle of accomp lishing their mission following studies produced by kings college the f ormation of the armed forces began involving multilateral initiatives countries such as portuga l and australia led the process of forming the armed forces despite the worst of unworthy and in human conditions experienced in the aileu cantonment fighters from falintil were recrui ted to form the embryonic armed forces later following the offer by the australian government of the new military base at metinaro timor lesteese soldiers were finally provided with accommodation worthy of their status ffoorrççaa 22002200 135 with the dramatic growth and successive increase in the number of new recruits versus the limited period of time for reducing the military forces the first batch of troops which constituted the 1s t bil was transferred to lospalos to occupy the base left by rokbatt metinaro grew constantly due to the numbers of soldiers and the structures desi gnated to complete the pdf without taking into consideration the limited infrastructures conseque ntly many different types of problems built up in terms of logistics maintenance physical space and the structures required to accommodate the armed forces framework however with strategic operational pla nning there is the option of redefining the structure of the forces the resources and the uses of the troops with the aim of relieving the military institution of some of its enormous costs options 1 economies must be made with regard to ex isting resources and maximum benefit and use must be made of the resources at the disposal of the state of the dret within an integrated system dedicated to national defence 2 planning system must be developed for

the armed forces should c ome from the definition of the military strategic concept cem which should in turn co from the national defence strategic concept cedn itself in the scope of the cedn guidelines should also be defined for the strategy in the military plan which initially may come to contemplate the follo wing vectors interest of the armed forces in the defence of the drtl and in the satisfaction of commitments which will be made in the scope of regional organis ations and the b interest of the armed f orces as an instrument of g vernment policy namely through the cooperation with multinational forces in operations to support the upholding of peace and humanitarian assistance and also in the participat ion of military cooperation actions with cplp countries so as to reinforce already existing solid arity and friendship ties c the realisation of the national forces system shou ld take into consideration the need to improve the operational mobility and flexibility of existin g resources so as to satisfy the needs laid down by the archipelago characteristics of easttimor an d dispersion of the national territory as well as the subsequent characteristics of the interterr itorial space namely in the scope of reinforcement and quick intervention at any locatio n with special attention to the districts by the border bobonaro and cova lima and in the oecusse enclave and the island of ataúro therefore it is necessary to guarantee minimum c apacity to manoeuvre through the sea and the employment of small units with amphibious skill s to defend the territory and national interests as well as provide humanitarian support to populations and support to civil authorities in emergency or catastrophic situations d the amphibious capacity which is understood in the geostrategic context in which easttimor is inserted and keeping in mind the evaluation of thre ats and risks to security and national interests does not initially imply projection of force in punctual cases of opposition to the landing of these units one should resort to the fa ctor of surprise and dominating techniques of the environmental factor in the sealand interface area namely through the infiltration of special action groups who are capable of preparing the nding and eventually taking out the opposition and also to the use of quick flexible and small si zed landing means in the present development phase of the armed forces specifically in the restoration and strengthening process it is imperative to define an employment concept time of peace and periods of tension crisis and war which taking into cons ideration the strategic environment should ffoorrççaa 22002200 137 assume that the cem believes that the occupation of the national territory is unlikely and admits the need to use small detachments with amphibious skill s that are based at naval units to carry out the inspection of territorial waters inspection of ves sels carrying out illicit activities and marine interception operations search and rescue humani tarian support to populations and the landing of small units aimed at carrying out the actions desti ned to reach the limited objectives namely the neutralisation of important sensitive areas hence the cem should admit and deduce the need of light force which is made up of elements who are hi ghly skilled in tactical mobility which guarantees the possibility of applying potential combat at an opportune location and moment and whose main advantage comes from the capacity of bei ng able to choose battle field that is more favourable to the movement which is sustained by i ts combat potential be it in offensive or defensive terms with the objective of gaining advan tage over the opponent who has greater mobility or combat potential through the deployme nt of the force furthermore the force should have its own specificity to carry out operations on the seafront through getting closer to the objective in discreet manner this force should b identified with the marine infantry marine which is made up from the conversion of other infan try units and whose training process will need to include solid evaluation of operational requirem ents in light of the employment concept and the specific missions to be defined in the scope of national fence legislation for better perception of what has been mentioned above we briefly present the characterisation of the naval marines the naval marines are specia l forces from the infantry light flexible and highly prepared for combat and are used for combat on land while using the sea as an approach vector furthermore they have highly dissuasive capacity and being an integral part of the snf can make up the operational reserve of the gcsaf an d give to political power on its own or in association with similar forces from other countrie s large margin to manoeuvre in terms of national external policy in the concentration of i nterests of the nations with naval recourses and adequate equipment using the sea as an immense are to manoeuvre in the marine forces can be used at any point on the seafront as an instrument of naval power according to political strategic and tactic convenience and with the flexibility of being able to remain in the objective area during specifics periods of time depending of the defined level of support in light of the determined parameters force emplo yment concept available naval resources and the appropriate doctrine operational employment f marines who are articulated in forces with structures similar to those in deployment 80 men will have to be faced in the future so as to be able to constitute specific taskforces to in tegrate c42 resources and the indispensable combat support this formula will allow for the optimisati on of the integration with naval resources small and medium sized the employment concept of the na val component and the conceptualisation of employment of the marine units in the maritime area with national interest should be defined in structured documents here we simply present some elements which allow for more adequate analysis of the employment concept to be defined i n addition to the usual marine resources assault boats their operational employment should be cons idered in an articulated and integrated manner with the use of more appropriate asb means assault speed boats keeping in mind the characterisation of the south coast ffoorrççaa 22002200 138 under the dependence of the gcsaf the naval marine s can be used in vast number of actions which involve exceptional expertise and bear remark able risks both in the support of other units and acting as an independent unit carrying out spec ial operations of military nature in actions with the aim of providing humanitarian assistance and th security of people against illicit acts of criminal nature on vessels platforms or in areas w ith national maritime jurisdiction the operations carried out by marine deployments normally assume discreet or covered up form its protection and recuperation require the use of naval surface or speed boats and air resources of different types while resorting to diving or other technique s to be carried out from helicopters and which involve the skill to 1 carry out amphibious raids deep reconnaissance struction of objectives which are done in an isolated manner or within an advanced forces operation joint or combined character 2 carry out special actions with humanitarian chara cter or against marine terrorism which mainly involve rescuing people or providing urgent humanitarian care on platforms or locations which are difficult to reach or high risk interven tion actions on platforms vessels and ships keeping in mind the safety of passengers and crew or the protection of the property against illicit criminal acts the performance of the marine deployment should be independent from the environment in which the insertion or progression is carried out for the objective and techniques involved demanding ability equipment training and exceptional skill and bearing remarkable risks for the unit the expected operations area for this intervention inco rporates the pacific ocean and the coastal areas of easttimor the operational capacity for combat is maximised through training preparation and specialised readiness of its elements weaponry an d resources which are provided to the unit the group of menresources will be defined in the light of the mission which will be articulated with the concealed needs and safety for its execution the r esources previously defined can be used from port vessel or from air means this flexibility to gether with is great autonomy and speed allow one to operate in the entire eez area with the appropri ate integrated support the mixed intervention companies should be conv entionally organised on location so as to guarantee an effective control of its constituting elements with the necessary fire power great flexibility and employment autonomy each mixe d intervention companies should be organised based on three specialised squads and fire suppor t component light armoured artillery squadron with antiair and antivehicle weapons this base organisation should allow for the organisation of other temporary operational organisations in accord with the attributed mission deployment of forces in the case of oecusse the mixed inte rvention company can be independently used by foct or focn providing that it has logistic support in this perspective it is the smaller scaled manoeuvre which can receive combat and service supp ort by forming an operation component taskforce for complying with specific mission 57 operational requirements and equipment needs once the employment concepts of the main units have been defined the operational requirements of the force can also be defined from the character isation of its operational objectives which should be deduced in function of the tasks foreseen in the respective employment concepts and other conditioning tactics which are relevant to the oper ational employment the force provides an ffoorrççaa 22002200 139 organisational flexibility which guarantees an adeq uate response to the diversity of tasks and foreseeable operations 1 tactical mobility which allows the location and pen etrations lines of the objective to be selected 2 command capacity control computers information recognition and surveillance c4irs 3 ability to land in location which has previously been selected and recognised and which does not have port facilities 4 ability to manoeuvre on site so as to guarantee rei nforcement and the necessary combat support at convenient time in offensive and defen sive actions 5 capacity to support operations on land 6 ability to fight against drug trafficking piracy nd maritime terrorism the operational requirements will also determine th doctrine training and global needs for the purchasing of equipment or reequipping in the scop of the forces planning process which has not yet been defined and should have as its main object ive in the short term the preparation of military programming law it is necessary to define the areas of effort under which reequipping should occur and this process should necessarily pass through the operational objectives of the force this will allow for the restructuring of the national forces system with new operational skills for the different units as well as enabling them t look at all of the equipment and weaponry needs of the force compare them with what they already h ave and consequently the identification of re equipping needs 58 defence and armed forces budget the defence and armed forces budget have shown si gnificant growth over the last five years however the development indicators of the armed fo rces are presented as less satisfactory due to the inexistence of budget execution and bad mana gement in the development of armed forces if we evaluate the level of the operational stat and the readiness of the armed forces since the creation of the force until the end of 2005 we can say that they had positive results as the armed forced reached approximately 80 of its operational requirements having said this the continuous absence of the legal framework itself and the lack of retaining strategy of the military in the institutions of the armed forces has significantly reduced the quality of the regular military which is incorporated in the armed forces this institutiona l deficiency of structural character has provoked an immediate impact on the development of the fo rce by the quantitative reduction of permanent elements due to constant desertion which current ly totals approximately 42 of total permanent elements of the force among others factors which originate this institut ional deficiency are located in the lack of decisio n making and in the lack of defence budget planning w hich should constantly take into consideration the creation of feasibility mechanisms of operation funds to respond to the immediate needs of the armed forces in the area of operational readiness the wellbeing of the military as factor for moral support and other incentives the factors mentioned above are fundamental for the moulding of the institutional character of the structures which are desired for the strategic deve lopment of the armed forces the state of affairs which are currently being felt in the armed forced constitutes serious concern in the development process of the government the present moment could also be considered as an opportunity to guide the armed forces to restructuring and resi zing process proposed by the ge f2020 in this ffoorrççaa 22002200 140 strategic blueprint to execute the new projects fo r the development of the forces already identified by the ge f2020 with the objective of complying wi th the main missions which have constitutionally been attributed to the easttimor armed forces an increase is expected in the budget for the armed forces which may be requested once the cost evaluation in the planning of gcsaf forces is carried out other funds which the defence sector needs to have in order to carry out missions of public interest should not be laid down in the defence budget but s hould in fact integrate the budget of other ministries to be transferred to the armed forces wh the time is right in other words the priorities for surveying the resources needed as well as thei r employment priorities should not be decided by the entities responsible for security and defence but should in fact be of the authorities who are responsible for the activities in question in conn ection with these entities but without harming the execution of specific military skills it is worth mentioning that nonmilitary capacities should not be included in the defence or armed forces budget ie those which are not military r esponses to threats or devices and similar actions to act in defence of public interest in other word s non military capacities which political power attributes to the armed forces because it is consi dered to be economically profitable to do so using the possibility of carrying out certain useful task s even if for this resources need to be reinforc ed instead of creating structures which are specifica lly aimed at them perhaps maximising the use of the engineering unit of the armed forces in jobs of public interest would be bonus for the prosecution of government objectives with this pos sibility of including the armed forces in activities of public interest the government would have greater importance in investing in the armed forces to later participate directly in the d evelopment of the nation real investment in this engineering unit would give it the capacity to carr out multiple functions and take on various missions for example to carry out the maintenance of land communication lines to remote areas of the national territory military which is highly qualified in the technical area could take this knowledge to the civil society after the compliance of their military duty thus the participation of the armed forces in this and other types of nationa l strategic projects would represent relevant and useful contribution to national development and it would also bring prestige to the image of the armed forces themselves with regards to the joint logistics concept in the armed forces we could select management of interministry planning to use combined funds fo r the same means ie the execution of joint budget that is available for specific purpos and common objectives the creation of legal mechanisms and combined management systems for the budget may be necessary so as to be able to combine interministry efforts to allocate speci funds to defence with the perspective of being used by the armed forces for national development these combined funds could be identified as partnership funds for national development where partnership on ministry and even governmental level could be established intermini stry partnerships could be carried out for activities with engineering civil protection and natural disaster purposes military defence strategies fishing communication etc purposes in addition to these funds funds may also be made available for joint maintenance such as capital for reconstruction or purchasing of resources for t he same purpose for example ffoorrççaa 22002200 141 1 interministry

and recommendations the strategic guidelines for the development of th armed forces of timorleste are based on the definition of the states strategic concepts and th fundamental principles of security and national stability which should systematically converge in the defence of the national interests to achieve th states overall objective peace and prosperity as with other democratic states the state of the r dtl is justified in using the national armed forces as state resource to achieve constitutiona lly authorised missions within the scope of their mandate the forces must make themselves subordinat to the democratically elected political power in terms of war or the defence of national sovereignty and are deployed under the command of the supreme commander of the armed forces leg ally constituted political authority the internal deployment of the armed forces may only ta ke place within the constitutional parameters envisaged in current laws from historic and geographic perspective we have not neglected the past which holds painful record of military conflicts irrespective of the ideological reasons and political and moral condemnation attributable to the strategic wars fou ght in timorleste it is the duty of historical leaders and scholars to objectively clarify the str ategic factors and circumstances surrounding the motivations conditions and reasons that expose the vulnerabilities of timorleste when faced by third parties that use elements of dissension and v iolence to impose their geostrategic political an d economic interests guidelines for future national development must suc cessfully integrate two interdependent components the observance of democratic state an d the establishment of national political and ideological equilibrium in the regional and interna tional context both require relevance with regard to the conceptual dispositions for defending the na tional interests within the ambit of global securit geographically the inclusion of timorleste in the challenge of regional and global geostrategic interest compromises national strategic guidelines bringing with it constant external interference in the development of the armed forces something whic h has happened systematically external interference has been notable drain on the instit utional capital of the armed forces of timorleste falintilfdtl the possible strategic modelling f the armed forces of timorleste may also represent unique vulnerability with regard to the geostrategic interests of third countries politically this represents vacillating and econ omic vulnerability for the future development of th armed forces of timorleste which depend on the serious interest of the state of rdtl in putting into perspective and creating real sustainable nd enduring nation with worthy reasons for existing in the world it is however appropriate to emphasise that the tactical innovations or strategies we adopt in the development of the armed forces matter how respectively exceptional or efficient they are do not always utomatically contribute towards achieving the ffoorrççaa 22002200 143 states objectives it is imperative to know how to deal with national interests and those of our neighbours strategically the armed forces of timorleste re present the decisive guarantee of the security sovereignty and independence of rdtl as entrenched in the constitution national defence is unquestionably fundamental pillar for the constr uction and viability of the nation the analysis of changes in the strategic environmen t of timorleste linked with the definition of the interest of the existence of the state of rdtl constitute the fundamental national policies for defining the framework of the armed forces in the n ational and global development dynamic finally it falls upon the people of timorleste to question and respond to the relevance of timor leste itself within the concept of global developme nt will timorleste have the conditions in the third millennium to be and remain sovereign nati on without interference from all and sundry or simply stated does timorleste pledge as an ec onomically unfeasible country to transform itself geostrategically into platform or satellite stat of third parties and profit from the benefits imposed by third parties andor benefit from revenu and the collection of taxes the advantages and disadvantages are relative and disproportionate and further aggravated by symptoms of political and ideological persecution from the past that ling er concealed in the vision of some timorleste politicians in conceiving the development of timor leste analysing and defining the paths of the future for timorleste is something that the people of country must debate widely and openly among themselves as sovereign nation what is the value of timorleste in the context of globalisation how can timorleste engage in the gl obal economic dynamic in what ways can timorleste participate in and contribute to the velopment of the world in relation to the future of the armed forces of timorleste the state of the rdtl must employ special effort and dedication towards the developme nt of the armed forces through the prioritisation of structuring political decisions i n relation to the legal framework conceptual definitions and the concrete manifestation of techn ical and operational

armed forces to achieve high standard of operational efficiency in the fulfilment of their various duties and responsi bilities both in national and international context this force planning and the
