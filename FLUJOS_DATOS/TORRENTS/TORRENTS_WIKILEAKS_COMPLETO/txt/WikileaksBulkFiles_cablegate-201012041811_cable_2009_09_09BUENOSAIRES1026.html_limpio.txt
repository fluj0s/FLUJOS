cfks former cabinet chief ref buenos aires 0802 classified by cda tom kelly for reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary eight weeks after leaving argentine president cristina fernandez kirchners cfk administration former cabinet chief sergio massa told polcouns that he parted on good terms with cfk and not so good terms with cfks husband and power behind the throne former president nestor kirchner nk massa said that cfk deferred to her husband on all matters and that in practice she only took orders showing inclination to overrule her husbands policy decisions or countermand his orders to government ministers and their staffs he said he expected nk to run for president in 2011 massa conveyed his own intention to run for governor in 2011 and indicated he was already building team to help him run the province end summary back to running tigre 2 c argentine former cabinet chief sergio massa looked tanned and wellrested when he met with polcouns september 4 little over month after returning to tigre the mediumsized city in suburban buenos aires where he was elected mayor in 2007 but took leave of absence to work one year for president cristina fernandez kirchner cfk massa served as cabinet chief from july 24 2008 through july 8 2009 and returned to his mayors office in tigre two weeks later although the media had reported that massa took his family skiing at the southern resort of bariloche massa grinned when polcouns asked him about the slopes and confessed that he had actually taken his family to beach resort in northeastern brazil he was clearly pleased that he had pulled fast one on the media greatly relieved 3 c massa stressed that he did not miss his highly visible casa rosada position one bit the polls he said indicated he had left the kirchner administration with his reputation and popularity intact tensions between massa and former president nestor kirchner were rumored to be high and massa confirmed that to us in private he claimed he parted on good terms with cfk and not so good terms with cfks husband and power behind the throne former president nestor kirchner nk massa said that cfk deferred to her husband on all matters and that in practice she had become nothing more than subaltern who took orders and had ability or inclination to overrule her husbands policy decisions or countermand his orders to government ministers and their staffs he also said that his replacement as cabinet chief anibal fernandez 52 seemed to be making more enemies than allies and that interior minister florencio randazzo 45 who year earlier shared the limelight with massa as one of cfks most visible spokesmen was spent force in the administration kirchner gearing up for 2011 4 c massa described nk as master tactician who enjoyed good fight and was ultimately seized with acquiring and asserting power for its own sake but did not have vision nor the coalitionbuilding skills needed to carry out an agenda massa said he believed nk was intent on running for president in 2011 and that daniel scioli 52 would run for reelection as governor of the province of buenos aires on the kirchner ticket asked about rumors that nk and scioli might switch ie scioli for president and nk for governor massa said that might be fallback plan he said scioli was stuck between rock and hard place expressing some pity for sciolis inability to extricate himself from kirchners grasp particularly as the province is headed toward severe fiscal crunch that will require bailout from the national government massas plans for 2011 5 c massa was emphatic that he would not take the congressional seat he won in the june 28 elections preferring instead to establish strong record as mayor of tigre as launching pad for his own gubernatorial bid in 2011 he spoke at length about the need to build capable team that he could take with him to govern the province he noted that cfks new minister of economy amado boudou seemed to be doomed for disaster because he did not have even small team of trusted advisers to help him develop policy and run that portfolio 6 c in that connection massa said he had hired santiago montoya the wellregarded former head of the provincial revenue service arba who lost his job when he incurred kirchners wrath by refusing to run as candidate on the kirchner slate in the june 28 congressional midterm elections massa also made point of picking up his cell phone and calling emilio monzo the provincial agriculture secretary whom scioli had fired the week before also at kirchners behest massas end of the phone conversation made it clear he and monzo were on good terms and at the end of the conversation massa said he was looking to find place for monzo in his city administration labor problems in tigre 7 c polcouns asked massa about intractable labor problems at food processing plant in tigre owned by kraft massa said three times that he believed the company had been in the right when it dismissed 155 workers for failing to show up to work in july and then taking plant managers hostage in july he implied that the labor leaders at the plant were extortionist and unreasonable he made clear that he did not see useful role for himself in resolving the standoff and he was at loss for predicting how it might end comment 8 c as noted reftel massa 37 is smart charismatic and wellliked with an open inclusive style that did not fit well with the paranoid combative kirchners he is generally proamerican and unlike others in the goa did not resort to any cheap shots against the united states like his predecessor alberto fernandez he emerged relatively unscathed from his service in the kirchner administration he is focused now on positioning himself for the governors race in 2011 in the interim he clearly enjoys his job as mayor and is highly popular in tigre ambitious and young he already has an impressive record of public service five years as head of anses the argentine social security administration year as mayor of tigre and year as cabinet chief most likely he sees himself as longterm presidential contender and we would put him in the same generational league as other promising presidential prospects such as salta governor manuel urtubey 40 and chaco governor jorge capitanich 44 kelly
