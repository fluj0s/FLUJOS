have added victims rights amendment to their state constitutions both house and senate judiciary committees have held hearings on similar proposals to amend the united states constitution in the senate on sjres 3 introduced by senator kyl for himself and senator feinstein and in the house on hjres 64 introduced by representative chabot the senate committee has reported out sjres 3 srept 106254 and the senate debated the measure for two days in april the proposed amendment defines the participation of crime victims in state and federal official proceedings generated by the crimes committed against them it gives them qualified notification attendance articulation and consideration rights victims safety must be considered in bail proceedings victim restitution must be consequence of conviction and victims interests must be weighed when the time tables for official proceedings are set or reset victims must be allowed to speak on questions of bail plea agreements sentencing and pardons they must be informed of and not excluded from crimerelated public proceedings they must be notified of escapes and releases and advised of their rights under the amendment arguments put forward in support of an amendment include 1 the criminal justice system is badly tilted in favor of criminal defendants and against victims interests and more appropriate balance should be restored 2 the shabby treatment afforded victims has chilled their participation in the criminal justice system to the detriment of all 3 society has an obligation to compensate victims 4 existing statutory and state constitutional provisions are wildly disparate in their coverage resulting in uneven treatment and harmful confusion throughout the criminal justice system and 5 existing state and federal law is inadequate and likely to remain inadequate critics argue to the contrary that 1 the criminal justice system is not out of balance misguided interjection of victim participation threatens to render the process inaccurate and unfair 2 if the mischief possible through victims rights amendment is avoided the proposal becomes purely hortatory the constitution is place for commemorative decorations 3 the proposals are inconsistent with the basic notions of federalism 4 the senate proposal limited to violent crimes is too narrow or conversely the house proposal applied to all felonies is too broad and 5 the proposals do not clearly preserve the constitutional rights of the accusedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30525contents introduction 1 text 1 background 3 purpose 4 the

constitution proponents have historically offered several reasons the criminal justice system is badly tilted in favor of criminal defendants and against victims interests and more appropriate balance should be restored the shabby treatment afforded victims has chilled their participation in the criminal justice system to the detriment of all society has an obligation to compensate victims existing statutory and state constitutional provisions are wildly disparate in their coverage resulting in uneven treatment and harmful confusion throughout the criminal justice system and existing state and federal law is inadequate and likely to remain inadequate9 the need for greater balance the balance argument is hardly new close to three quarters of century ago the supreme court observed that the law as we have seen is sedulous in maintaining for defendant charged with crime whatever forms of procedure are of the essence of an opportunity to defend but justice though due to the accused is due to the accuser also the concept of fairness must not be strained till it is narrowed to filament we are to keep the balance true snyder v massachusetts 291 us 97 122 1934 the due process clauses and other defendants rights components of the constitution supplied the foundation for the defendantfocused jurisprudence of the 50s and 60s it has also served as one of the catalysts for the early victims rightshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30525crs5 10 eg house hearing iii prepared statement of rep chabotcurrently the us constitution is completely silent on victims rights while it speaks volumes as

conflict the defendants rights which are already in the us constitution will always prevail our amendment will correct this imbalance 145 congrec s709 daily ed jan 19 1999remarks of sen feinstein

1986movement10 call for greater constitutional protection of victims rights seems predictable feature of the belief that the criminal justice system must involve greater balance between the rights of victim and those of the defendant11 critics might suggest that victims already enjoy equal constitutional rights with the accused the victim who repels an unlawful assault with excessive force may find himself criminally charged in that case he is entitled to exactly the same constitutional rights as his attacker12 they may also point out that many of the constitutional rights afforded the accused benefit the victim as well they are designed to ensure that the guilty are convicted and that the innocent are not the accused benefits when the innocent are not convicted the victim benefits when the guilty are13 the more common response to the balance argument however has been that the balance argument represents fundamental misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of individual constitutional rights14 in the same vein one of the motives critics attribute to victims rights advocates is rejection of basic premise of the american criminal justice system they suggest victims believe the criminal justice process constitutes an unjustifiable waste of time in procedur that should be reduced to identifying and then punishing suspects they consider

82 octaccused defendant and guilty synonymous terms process is too quick punishment sufficiently severe acquittals are an injustice15 the balance argument has special relevancy in the context of an amendment to the united states constitution state victims rights constitutional amendment or state or federal statute may supersede the rights the united states constitution affords the criminally accused federal statute or state constitutional provision can roll back the demand s of due process or any of the other rights granted by the bill of rights an amendment to the united states constitution can federal victims rights amendment if so intended by definition amends any prior inconsistent provision in the constitution16 unless the proposed rights are made subordinate to defendant rights in case of conflict either defendant rights must be subordinate or prosecution in which they are in conflict must be avoided abandoned or adjusted obligations the need for victim participation there seems to be little dispute that shabby treatment of victims makes them less inclined to report crimes to step forward as witnesses or to otherwise participate in the process17 but here and with respect to the third justification of an amendment societys obligation to compensate for its failure to protect its citizenry the issue is not as much the identification of the problem as the selection of solution inadequacy of alternatives the adequacy of alternatives now and in the future lies at the heart of the dispute proponents find present law wanting18 opponents find present

senate hearing ii at 87 testimony of james doyle wisconsin attorney general 22 senate hearing ii at 64 house hearing at 61 the senate report supports this view srepno 106254 at 29 in other words the amendment sets national floor for the protecting of victims rights not any sort of ceiling legislatures including congress are certainly free to give statutory rights to all victims of crime and the amendment will in all likelihood be an occasion for victims statutes to be reexamined and in some cases expandedworkable and fear an amendment would make matters worse19 the specifics of the proposal provide the specifics for much of the debate the more robust the amendment the more civil libertarians and the states are likely to object the more restrained the amendment the more victims rights advocates are likely to question its sufficiency the need for uniformity victims rights are different in every jurisdiction in the united states some find this diversity reason for an amendment to the united states constitution20 there is the implication that the presence of many individual standards contributes to the failure of existing provisions diversity breeds uncertainty that leads to failure to comply and failure to claim critics argue that victims rights amendment would essentially federalize the state criminal justice process denying the people of particular state and their elected officials the right to decide the range of victim rights and services that should be part of their state criminal justice systems21 uniformity obviously would require compliance to single standard imposed by the amendment to the united states constitution some victims advocates however see the amendment as providing constitutional minimum beyond which the states remain free to establish more exacting victims rights22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30525crs8 23 scheme involving an enterprise whose only income generating activity is the solicitation of successive layers of investors

is acquitted or whose conviction is overturned24 and the elderly person defrauded the savings of lifetime the term often contemplates parents and other members of the family of deceased incapacitated

law is based upon the premise that criminal act is transgression against the social order against the commonweal the body politic crime is wrong committed against all of us contemporary practices most state constitutional amendments do not define the classes of crime victims for whom they establish rights27 statutory definitions are diverse and more than few jurisdictions recognize different definitions for different purposes the corporate victim of crime for example may be entitled to restitution but not to notice of the release of an offender28 under some victims rights statutes victims may be limited to the victims of felonies or of specific violent crimes29 in several instances states have modified their definitions of victim to exclude certain classes of victims eg prisoners codefendants and the like30 under federal law only victims of violent crimes or of sexual abuse have the right to make victim impact statement at sentencing frcrimp 32c3 but anyone who incurs direct harm as consequence of federal crime is considered victim for purposes of restitution trial attendance and victim notification rights 18 usc 3663a2 3510 42 usc 10607e2

united states constitution have opted for one of three alternatives 1 crimes of violence31 2 felonies and crimes of violence32 3 crimes of violence and such other crimes as should be legislatively designated33 the senate judiciary committee report accompanying sjres44 in the 105th congress anticipated that congress and the state legislatures would further define the terms victim and crime of violence and observed that those terms might include the victims of potentially violent crimes such as burglary solicitation to commit crime of violence unlawful display of firearm or stalking34

thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30525crs11 36 srepno106254 at 41 this provision is similar to existing language found in section 5 of the 14th amendment to the constitution this provision will be interpreted in similar fashion to allow congress to enforce the rights that is to insure that the rights conveyed by the amendment are in fact respected at the same time consistent with the plain language of the provision the federal government and the states will retain their power to implement the amendment for example the states will subject to the supremacy clause flesh out the contours of the amendment by providing definitions of victim of crime and crimes of violence 37 but see clinton v new york 524 us 417 42829 1998noting that although individual ordinarily refers to natural persons in the context of the statute before it congress intended broader meaning 38 see eg fbi uniform crime reports 1995 at 5 1996 that classifies murder nonnegligent manslaughter forcible rape robbery and aggravated assault as violent crimes 39 eg 28 usc 2901ccrime of violence includes voluntary manslaughter murder rape mayhem kidnaping robbery burglary or housebreaking in the nighttime extortion accompanied by threats of violence assault with dangerous weapon or assault with intent to commit any offense punishable by imprisonment for more than one year arson punishable as felony or an attempt or conspiracy to commit any of the foregoing offenses 40 eg 18 usc 16 crime of violence means an offense that has as an element the use attempted use or threatened use of physical force against the

property of another or b that by its nature involves substantialconstruction the states would be permitted to paint the scope of the amendment as broadly or as narrowly as they chose subject to preemptive federal legislation36 the house resolutions posture is much the same it does not use the phrase as defined by law but the same result is implicit in its failure to provide definition and in its grant of implementing authority to congress its distinctive language and origin in the house however may remove it from the shadow of the senate report moreover its use of the phrase each individual who is victim of crime as opposed to the senates victim of crime may limit the scope of the house resolution to victims who are human beings37 the house resolutions definition of crime seems at once more specific and more sweeping than that of the senate resolution the senate resolution reaches only those who are the victims of crimes of violence the term admits to more than few plausible definitions crime of violence might include only those crimes during which victim sustained physical injury murder manslaughter rape assault and battery38 more expansive definition would encompass crimes which include within their elements the use of physical force or the threat of physical force against the person of another bringing in robbery and under some statutes kidnaping arson burglary extortion conspiracy attempt solicitation and facilitation39 more expansive version yet would embrace crimes which include within their elements the use of physical force or the threat of

of individual discipline rather than criminal prosecution with the constitutional amendment victimsurvivor who files criminal report on military base would have the right to be informed of decisions relating to the crime these rights would greatly shift the balance from secrecy to open information and accountability the senate judiciary committee report explains with respect to similar language

heard in city of west covina v perkins 119 sct 678 681 1999 the court explained the notice requirement in these words primary purpose of the notice required by the due process clause is to ensure that the opportunity for hearing is meaningful see mullane v central hanover bank trust co 339 us 306 1950the right to be heard has little reality or worth unless one is informed that the matter affecting

made clear the due process clause does not demand actual successful notice but it does require reasonable effort to give notice process which is mere gesture is not due process the means employed must

chance of alerting an unwary person that he must act now or forever lose his rights 47 on related question it has long been established that due process allows notice of hearing and its attendant procedures and consequences to be given solely in english to non english speaker if the notice would put reasonable recipient on notice that further inquiry is required nazarova v ins 171 f3d at 483 due process however does include the right of nonenglish speaker to have interpreter present in order to participate in proceeding at which the individual has right to be heard id at 48485reasonable

calculated to permit meaningful exercise of the amendments other rights44 the senate report explains that in rare circumstances notice by publication might be reasonable45 although in most instances due process requirements are more demanding46 under this analysis notice given after proceeding has been conducted would seem unreasonable because the want of timely notice might constitute an effective exclusion from the proceedings or might defeat the right to make victim impact statement47 assuming the amendment contemplates timely notice it is unclear whether it also anticipates the proceedings must await timely notice if need be httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30525crs15 48 nothing in this article shall provide grounds to reopen any proceeding except with respect to conditional release

hatchthis provision in particular has perhaps the greatest potential to collide with the legitimate right of defendants all defendants and convicts have constitutionally protected liberty interest in conditional release once such release is granted permitting victims to move to reopen such proceedings or invalidate such rulings would of course necessitate the rearrest and detention of released defendants and convicts likely implicating their liberty interest to the which the sponsors respond chairman hatch has pointed out that the amendment should not be construed as potentially implicating the liberty interest of criminal defendants by allowing victims to reopen bail or other proceedings after defendant has been released we agree with the chairman that defendants are entitled to due process before bail is revoked the amendment does not give victims any unilateral right to revoke bail for example but rather simply extends to victims the right to consideration for the safety of the victim in determining any conditional release from custody that consideration of course will be give consistently with due process for the defendant today of course due process permits prosecutor to ask court to reconsider bail decision the amendment simply follows that welltrodden path in affording victims similar right srepno 106254 at 46 additional views of sens kyl and feinsteinemphasis in the originalthe issue may be most challenging in the area of bail the amendment proposals grant both right to consideration of the victims safety and right to reasonable notice and attendance under normal circumstances it might not be unusual for an accused to be released on recognizance or bail before authorities could reasonably be expected to provide victims with timely notice it may be that the amendment contemplates postponement of the accuseds initial judicial appearance until after victims can be notified and can be given reasonable period of time to prepare and present their views on the other hand the amendment may anticipate that failure of timely notice in bail context can be adequately rectified without postponement by recourse to the provision in the amendment that permits the bail decision to be revisited at the behest of victim48 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30525crs16 49 in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to speedy and public trial by an

such prerogatives their status is at best that of any other member of the general public and in fact the constitution screens the accuseds right to an impartial jury trial from the over exuberance of the public51 moreover victims are even more likely to be barred from the courtroom during trial than members of the general public ironically the victims status as witness the avenue of most likely access to pretrial proceedings is the very attribute most likely to result in exclusion from the trial sequestration or the practice of separating witnesses and holding outside the courtroom all but

absent danger of unfair prejudice jury confusion of the jury being misled or as constitutionally required58 it has been suggested that the phrase not to be excluded in the amendment was originally used to avoid the claims that the amendment entitled victims to transportation to relevant proceedings or to have proceedings scheduled for their convenience or to free them from imprisonment srepno106254 at 31 in this it would be unlike the defendants right to attend yet like the defendants right to attend the use of the phrase in earlier proposals was thought to permit exclusion of the victim for disruptive behavior excessive displays of emotion and other forms of impropriety for which defendant might be excluded id under existing law the usual rationale for exclusion is to prevent victim witnesses from having their testimony colored by the testimony of other earlier witnesses59 victim exclusion is one of the features of existing law that the amendment seeks to overcome how its command may be implemented is less apparent in single victim cases both policies can be honored simply by having the victim testify first the two policies might also be reconciled by refusing to allow attending victims to testify since the right not to be excluded does not include the right to testify and the right to be heard does not extend to trial testimony the issue might be resolved alternatively on victimdefendant equality grounds the defendant is constitutionally entitled to attend the entire trial even if he is ultimately to be witness the amendment may be seen as an equalizer if so it may not preclude defense counsel from commenting upon victims opportunity to color his or her testimony60 public proceedings one obvious purpose of limiting the rights to public proceedings

taking of human life may today be made punishable by death only the familycounsel are similarly beyond the pale if for other reason than that such activities lack the tribunallike characteristics of proceedings there may be some question as to what standards should be used to determine whether proceedings should be considered public for purposes of the amendment and whether the public or confidential character of proceedings is subject to either judicial or legislative adjustments these questions seem unlikely to arise except for related civil proceedings because the public nature of the criminal proceedings is fairly well defined by existing law public trial is among the rights the sixth amendment promises the criminally accused even where the accused agrees to closed proceedings

court press enterprise ii 478 us 1 8 1986 when asked to close particular proceedings over the objections of the accused the courts using the standards developed in press access cases have demanded

juvenile proceedings in jurisdictions where those proceedings are not public remains to be seen traditionally such proceedings are not public61 although public delinquency proceedings are becoming more common it is similarly unclear whether the amendments notice and attendance rights apply to historically public events that are now ordinarily held privately more precisely does the amendment

crime relatedness understood in such terms would presumably carry victim notice and attendance rights to fairly wide range of civil and quasicivil proceedings eg habeas and civil forfeiture

notice and attendance rights for the victims of defendants past crimes or of charges that have been dropped or dismissed or of charges resulting in acquittal69 right to be heard to be heard if present and to submit statement at all such proceedings to determine conditional release from custody an acceptance of negotiated plea or sentence to consideration for the safety of the victim in determining any conditional release from custody relating to the crime this right to be heard and to submit statement in each of three kinds of proceedings might be construed as the right to communicate right to submit statement and the right to have the communication carry determinative weight the right to be heard the position of the two components and the interjection of the phrase if present seems to make it more plausible to read the clause as creating right to communicate either in person to be heard if present or otherwise to submit statement the amendments later separate listing of victims right to have his safety considered in the course of bail proceedings also argues against any conclusion that alone the right to be heard contemplates right to have the message carry determinative

after an appeal on bail personal recognizance to the custody of third person or under any other conditions including pretrial diversion programs other examples of conditional release include work release and home detention it also includes parole hearings or their functional equivalent both because parole hearings have some discretion in releasing offenders and because releases from prison are typically subject to various conditions such as continued good behavior it would also include release from secure mental facility for criminal defendant or one acquitted on the grounds of insanity

citing the united states attorney manual 922400 71 at both state and federal law the presumption of bail was so strong that even after conviction when the defendant sought bail pending appeal most shared the opinion of justiceuse of the words if present and such proceedings confirms an intent to read the notice qualifications into the right to heard so that the right to be heard only attaches with respect to public proceedings involving conditional release plea bargain and sentencing the right to speak applies at hearings involving sentencing the acceptance of plea bargain or conditional release from custody proceedings to determine conditional release from custody apparently means bail hearings and possibly great deal more bail hearings seem to be covered since bail is contingent at minimum upon the pledge of the accused to appear for subsequent judicial proceedin gs victims may enjoy right to be heard and submit statement at proceedings for pretrial diversion approval or for release from civil commitm ent as well70 bail the proposed amendment gives crime victims the right to be notified of not to be excluded from to be heard and submit statement at and to have their

of the right to be heard in particular is more generous than most although victims rights to have their interests considered to be notified to attend and in some instances to make presentations at bail proceedings appear more frequently in state statutes and court rules than was once the case at one time the victim was not only not considered legitimate participant in the bail hearing but neither the safety nor any other interest of the victim was thought to be relevant consideration bail was guarantee against suspect flight that was all the amount of security required and the

to insure that the defendant pleads to charge sufficiently serious to allow restitution and in sentence bargain the victim wants to advocate an award of restitution the victims second interest is retribution or revenge the victim feels he or she has been violated and that the criminals punishment should be severe therefore in charge bargain the victim would want the defendant to plead guilty

permitting victim impact statements serves several beneficial purposes 1 to protect the victims interest in having the court order the defendant to make restitution100 2 to increase the possibility that the sentence imposed will reflect the damage done and therefore the seriousness of the crime101 3 to balance the pleas for the defendant that have traditionally been heard at that point102 and 4

delay often works to the defendants advantage witnesses may become unavailable their memories may fade evidence may be lost changes in the law may be beneficial or the case may simply receive lower priority with the passage of time128 until recently victims had comparable rights although their advocates contended they had very real interest in prompt disposition some victims sought to put traumatic episode behind them some wanted to see justice done quickly some hoped simply to end the trail of inconveniences and hardship that all too often fell to their lot as witnesses129 few states

those who pled guilty are found guilty or enter plea of contest srepno 106254 at 37 unless they are prosecuted as adults juveniles do not plead guilty are not found guilty nor do they enter nolo pleas they confess to being or are found delinquent or in need of supervision or neglected but they are not convicted the committee also declared that it had previously explained its philosophy in some detail in connection with the mandatory victim restitution act codified at 18 usc 3663a and 3664 and intends that this right operate in similar fashion id emphasis added even though the mandatory victim restitution act applies to juveniles tried and convicted as adults it does not apply to findings of delinquency or otherthe federal statutory victims bill of rights 42 usc 10606 does not include speedy trial provision but congress has encouraged the states to include right to reasonably expeditious trial among the rights they afford victims131 in the absence of further development either in its legislative history or in implementing legislation courts called upon to construe such provision might well find guidance in the supreme courts identification of the factors to be weighed when testing for unacceptable delay under the speedy trial and due process clauses length of delay reasons for the delay defendants assertion of his right and prejudice to the defendant132 restitution to an order of restitution from the convicted offender every jurisdicti on authorizes its courts to order convicted defendants make restitution each jurisdiction however addresses distinctly questions of when if ever restitution is mandatory the extent to which restitution orders are properly the subject to plea agreements whether restitution is available for injuries caused by acts of juvenile delinquency which victims are entitled to restitution what priority if any restitution takes over forfeiture of the defendants assets or his payment of criminal fines and more the amendment appears to make restitution orders mandatory as matter of right the scope of the right is unstated although the amendment applies to juvenile proceedings the use of the term convicted offender might be construed to limit the amendments command to criminal convictions and therefore not reach findings of delinquency133httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30525crs34 dispositions following

then surely constitutional violation occurs when after probable cause is adequately established the government obtains an order barring defendant from frustrating that end by dissipating his assets prior to trialrestitution orders in nominal amount or subject to priorities for criminal fines or forfeiture or other claims against the defendants assets might seem inconsistent with the decision to elevate mandatory victim restitution to constitutional right yet the senate report concluded that the amendment does not confer on victims any rights to specific amount of restitution leaving the court free to order nominal restitution the right conferred on victims is one to an order of restitution with the order in hand questions of enforcement of the order and its priority as against other judgments are left to the applicable federal and state law srepno106254 at 37 the senate report however suspected that the right might include the right to pretrial restraining order to prevent an accused from dissipating assets that might be used to satisfy restitution order id the right might also extend to dissipation in the form of payment of attorneys fees for the accused since the accused has only qualified right to the assistance of counsel of his choice134 victim safety to consideration for the safety of the victim in determining any conditional release from custody relating to the

to establish the dictates under which an individual will be released from custody must reflect upon whether the mandates accompanying release should include demands designed to ensure victim safety

them for themselves it might refer to victims lawyers it might refer to the prosecutor or to state officials appointed to represent victims interests it might refer to victims rights advocates generally or it might refer to all or some combination of these the senate report favors broad reading although it recognized that the task of defining who may be considered lawful representative is legislative and judicial chore srepno 106254 at 39 it also emphasizes the importance of preventing the designation of representatives whose interests may be in conflict with those of the victim139 finally it gives hint of whether indigent victims are entitled to appointment of counsel to serve as the victims representative because the committee believed dispositive language later in the section that precluded claim for damages140 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30525crs37 in the provision also prevents the possibility that the amendment might be construed by the courts as requiring the appointment of counsel at state expense to assist victims cf gideon v wainwright 372 us 335 1963requiring counsel for indigent criminal defendants 141 gideon held that the fourteenth amendments due process clause precludes treatment of the sixth amendment right to the assistance of counsel as white collar privilege available only to men of means from the very beginning our state and national constitutions and laws have laid great emphasis on procedural and substanti ve safeguards designed to assure fair trials before impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before the law this noble ideal cannot be realized if the poor man charged with crime has to face his accusers without lawyer to assist him for the right to be heard would be in many cases of little avail if it did not comprehend the right to be heard by counsel 372 us at 34445 142 alyeska pipeline co v wilderness society 421 us 240 247 1975 bausch lomb inc v utica mutual ins co 355 md 566 590 735 a2d 1081 1094 1999 woollen v

laconst art i 25 nothing in this section shall be the basis for an award of costs or attorney fees for the appointment of counsel for victim or for any cause of action for compensation the observation is significant because without it the courts might easily reach the opposite conclusion without it the evidence seems to bespeak an intent to supply indigents with legal representative at public expense the committees citation to gideon appears designed to point out that without the limitation victims like the accused would be entitled to the assistance of counsel during proceedings related to the crime141 without the observation the due process and equal protection clauses might seem to require the appointm ent of counsel for indigent victims even the presence of the damage claim limitation alone might have been considered insufficient since attorneys fees are not ordinarily considered an element of damages142 moreover if an egalitarian right to representation were embedded in the victims rights amendment it could be enforced by invoking the injunctive or other equitable powers of the courts this would be so even though the prospect of damages with or without attorneys fees had been foreclosed on the other hand only few of the states have seen the necessity to explicitly announce that their comparable victims rights laws do not include the right to appointed counsel143 finality nothing in this article shall provide grounds to stay or continue any trial reopen any procee ding or invalidate any ruling except with respect to conditional release or restitut ion or to provide rights guaranteed by this article in future proceedings without staying or continuing trial section 2 addresses two concerns reflected in various shades in state victims rights provisions one is the worry that defendants will use victims rights tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30525crs38 144 misscode ann 994349 the failure to provide right privilege or notice to victim under this chapter shall

acceptance of plea of guilty or to obtain appellate habeas corpus or other relief from any criminal judgment for violation of the provisions of this section nor be construed as creating cause of action for money damagesobstruct their prosecutions or overturn their convictions144 the second less frequently found in state law is that without defendant intervention litigation over the scope of victims rights will delay or undo criminal proceedings against the defendant145 the amendment proposals address the first concern when they declare that only victims and their lawful representatives have standing to claim rights under the amendment their treatment of the second concern is more complicated once criminal trial has begun its schedule is beyond the amendments control before criminal trial begins and after it has ended the amendment cannot be used to reopen any proceeding or invalidate any ruling with three exceptions bail decisions restitution decisions and matters involving future practices performance and proceedings the clause imposes limitation upon stays or other victimrelated litigation activities before or during proceedings other than trial questions of bail restitution and future proceedings can be revisited to enforce victims rights at any time as long as to do so does not interrupt the defendants trial the senate report offered as examples of permissible victim enforcement intervention 1 the challenge of decision made to release defendant on bail without consideration of the victims safety 2 victim improperly excluded from trial seeking immediate expedited review seeking admission to upcoming days of the trial or 3 the challenge of decision that victim was not entitled to notice of release or escape of prisoner up to the point when the defendant is longer is custody srepno 106254 at 40 nothing in this article shall give rise to or authorize the creation of claim for damages against the united states state political subdivision

srepno105409 at 49 minority views of sen thompsonwhile sjres 44 does not offer victims the opportunity to sue for damages to vindicate their rights it does allow them to seek injunctive or declarative relief and perhaps writs of mandamus there also could be large class actions against state authorities this could lead to disruptive and costly federal court intrusions into state criminal justice systems 149 srepno 105409 at 61 minority views of sens leahy kennedy and kohlthere can be doubt that prosecutors would feel personally constrained by the proposed amendment sjres 44s express prohibition on claims for damages only increases the likelihood that courts would find other ways to vindicate its newlyminted rights just last year the us supreme court confirmed that the federal civil rights laws permit criminal prosecutions in federal court of any state official who willfully and under color of law deprived any person of any rights secured or protected under the federal constitution united states v lanier 520 us 259 1997has helped fuel the drive for federal constitutional amendment but the commentators have only infrequently addressed how federal constitutional right might be most appropriately enforced some have noted that if victims rights amendment were silent on the question its demands would be enforceable against the state officials under section 1983 of the civil rights laws 42 usc 1983 and against federal officials under the bivens doctrine147 presumably the equitable powers of the courts mandamus and injunctive relief claimed in declarative action remain available to enforce rights under the amendment148 it might be considered somewhat curious that the amendment immunizes public officials from civil liability but not from criminal liability for denial of the civil rights established by the amendment149 legislative authority section 3 the congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation the grant of legislative implementing authority may shield against the appearance of the unexpected and undesira ble consequences discovered after ratification of constitutional amendment the difficulty of amending the

in the case of hjres 129 which only applies to federal proceedings 5 the rights established by this article shall apply in all federal proceedings 153 srepno 106254 at 28 the committee anticipates that congress will quickly pass an implementing statute defining victim for federal proceedings moreover nothing removes from the states their plenary authority to enact definitional laws for purposes of their own criminal system since the legislatures define what is criminal conduct it makes equal sense for them to also have the ability to further refine the definition of victimamendment rather than merely enacting statute is to ensure that the rights it grants are not easily denied or diluted one of the perils implicit in opting for extensive legislative powers is the prospect of unfulfilled promises it is certainly possible to draft very generally worded constitutional amendment in anticipation of future legislative refinements and these may be forthcoming but it may also happen that the refinements must be laboriously crafted through the courts because legislative resolution proves either unattainable or less than universally appealing early proposals granted congress and the state legislatures the power to enact implementing legislation within their respective jurisdictions150 over time some of the proposals began to expand the explicit legislative authority of congress151 and then to constrict the explicit legislative authority of the states152 the committee report explains however that the loss of state legislative authority is less sweeping than it might appear it asserts that the power to define the class of victims to whom the amendment would apply is by implication to be shared by congress and the states153 subject to preemptive federal legislation the states would be permitted to paint the scope of the amendment as broadly or ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30525crs41 154 srepno 106254 at 41 this provision is similar to existing language found in section 5 of the 14th amendment to the constitution this provision will be interpreted in similar fashion to allow congress to enforce the rights that is to insure that the rights conveyed by the amendment are in fact respected at the same time consistent with the plain language of the provision the federal government and the states will retain their power to implement the amendment for example the states will subject to the supremacy clause flesh out the contours of the amendment by providing definitions of victim of crime and crimes of violence 155 unlike previous versions of the proposed amendment which permitted states to enforce the amendment in their jurisdictions sjres 44 gives congress exclusive power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation i believe that granting congress sole power to enforce the provisions of the victims rights amendment and thus inter alia to define terms such as victim and violent crime and to enforce the guarantees of reasonable notice of public proceedings and of the rights established by the amendment will be significant and troubling step towards federalization of crime and the nationalization of our criminal justice system it is possible that the victims rights constitutional amendment will lack the flexibility that is the hallmark of our federal system and perhaps in the process invalidate many state victims rights provisions such prospect should give us pause srepno 105409 at 445 additional views of sen hatch senators kyl and feinstein countered with the contention that the bigger danger to federalism is passing amendment states have had difficulty extending rights to victims of crime through state statutes and constitutional amendments precisely because courts are used to considering first and foremost federal constitutional rights by extending federal right to victims throughout the states it will then become easier for state criminal justice systems to protect the rights of victims perhaps for this reason the national governors association whose members include some of the fiercest defenders of federalism endorsed the proposed amendment as long as ago as 1997 srepno 106254 at 46 156 more likely however is that the majoritys interpretation while politically expedient is legally untenable the notion that sjres 3 empowers states to pass implementing legislation is flatly inconsistent with the plain language of the proposed amendment it states the congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation emphasis added identical language in earlier constitutional amendments have been read to vest enforcement authority exclusively in the congress in the case of sjres 3 moreover the text is illuminated by the legislative history earlier drafts of the amendment expressly extended enforcement authority to the states these drafts drew fire from constitutional scholars who expressed doubt that constitutionallyauthorized state laws could be supreme over state constitutions or even over federal laws and concern that for the first time rights secured by the federal constitution would mean different things in different parts of the country the committee then amended the text to its current formulation faced with this history and text courts will surely conclude that sjres 3 deprives states of authority to legislate in the are of victims rights indeed both chairman hatch and the states chief justices have already interpreted the proposed amendment in precisely this way srepno 106254 at 778 minority views of sens leahy kennedy

give similar common sense construction to its provisions the amendment does not impose straightjacket that would prevent the proper handling of unusual situations the exceptions language in the amendment explicitly recognizes that in certain rare circumstances exceptions may need to be created to victims rights 159 srepno 106254 at 41 in mass victim cases there may be need to provide certain limited exceptions to victims rights for instance for crime perpetrated against hundreds of victims it may be impractical or even impossible to give all victims the right be physically present in the courtroom 160 srepno 106254 at 412 in some cases of domestic violence the dynamics of victim offender relationships may require some modification of otherwise typical victims rights provisions and situations may arise involving intergang violence where notifying the member of rival gang of an offenders impending release may spawn retaliatory violence 161 srepno 105409 at 45 additional views of sen hatch the compelling interest test is itself derived from existing constitutional jurisprudence and is the highest level of scrutiny given government act alleged to infringe on constitutional right the compelling interest test and its twin strict scrutiny are sometimes described as strict in theory but fatal in fact i truly question whether it is wise to command through constitutional text the application of such high standard to all future facts and circumstances srepno 106254 at 856 minority views of sens leahy kennedy kohl and feingold sponsors contend the compelling interest standard strikes the appropriate balance srepno 106254 at 467 additional views of sens kyl and feinstein this intriguing sentence has appeared in one form or another in several proposed amendments in the past157 departure from the requirement of earlier versions that exceptions be enacted implies that exceptions may be crafted either legislatively or judicially the use of the term compelling interest on the other hand suggests that the authority to create exceptions may be fairly limited the senate committee report seems to confirm both suggestions158 although the report identifies one unusual159 and two commonplace situations160 under which exceptions might be warranted several committee members found the compelling interest standard too restrictive161 the justice department raised the same objection with respect to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30525crs43 162 house hearings iii prepared statement of assistant attorney general eleanor d achesonwe believe that the authority to create exceptions should exist where necessary to promote significant government interest rather than the compelling interest required by the current resolution 163 there may be concern that the standard changes form depending upon nature of the right at issue or more precisely that the standard in fourth amendment and other law enforcement contexts may be less demanding than would otherwise be the case see eg vernonia school district v acton 515 us 646 661 1995it is mistake however to think that the phrase compelling state interest in the fourth amendment context describes fixed minimum quantum of governmental concern so that one can dispose of case by answering in insolation the question is there compelling state interest here rather the phrase describes an interest that appears important enough to justify the particular search at hand in light of other factors that show the search to be relatively intrusive upon genuine expectation of privacy wilcher v city of wilmington 139

whether the standards amorphous nature makes it unsuitable163 preemptive and amending impact the question of the legislative power to implement the victims rights amendment suggests another question how much if any of existing victims rights and defendants rights law does the amendment amend or preempt under the present state of the law statutory and state constitutional provisions are confined by the bill of rights usconst art vi c2 when their advocates have said nothing in them imperils defendants rights under the united states constitution they are right nothing could but an amendment to

where preexistin g law comes up short and shaves off where its generosity exceeds the standard neither the present proposals nor any of their predecessors have addressed the amendmentpreemption question some although certainly not all of the state constitutions disclaim any attempt to supersede defendants rights the senate committee report offered support for the argument that sjres 44 was not intended to preempt more generous victims rights provisions many states have already extended rights to victims of such offenses and the amendment in way restricts such rights in other words the amendment sets national floor for the protection of victims rights not any sort of ceiling srepno105 409 at 24 the remarks accompanying the introduction of the present proposal might be read to either support or undermine the argument165 questions of the amendments impact on the rights afforded the accused may be even more difficult to discern the principles of construction called into play in the case of conflict between victims rights amendment and rights established elsewhere in the constitution are similar those used to resolve federalstate conflicts httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30525crs45 166 the justice department urged that similar language be added to proposals under consideration during the 106th congress house hearing iii prepared statement of assistant attorney general eleanor d achesonhowever on rare occasions where after serious and searching analysis of the claim it is clear that the vindication of victims rights will indeed violate defendants right to fair trial the attorney general has stated that we must as society ensure that fair trial is not jeopardized to that end we urge that the following language be added nothing in this article shall be construed to deny or diminish the rights of the accused as guaranteed by the constitution 167 srepno 106254 at 273 the crime victims rights amendment creates rights not in opposition to those of defendants but in parallel to them the parallel goal in both instances is to erect protections from abuse by state actors thus just as defendants have sixth amendment right to speedy trial the crime victims rights amendment extends to victims the right to consideration of their interest in trial free from unreasonable delay these rights cannot collide since they are both designed to bring criminal proceedings to close within reasonable time if any conflict were to emerge courts would retain ultimate responsibility for harmonizing the rights at stake in this respect the committee found unpersuasive the contention that the courts will woodenly interpret the lateradopted crime victims rights amendment as superceding provisions in previouslyadopted ones suchintent of the drafters is paramount the

and some other portion of the constitution the most recently adopted provision will prevail sjres 6 was designed to eliminate the unfair treatment that results because the criminal justice system permits the defendants constitutional rights always to trump the protection given to victims yet to do so in manner that will not deny or infringe any constitutional right of any person accused or convicted of crime 143 congrec s56061 daily ed jan 21 1997remarks of sen kyl in instances of unavoidable conflict between victim and defendant rights this seems to mean the prosecution must yield the text of sjres 6 hardly defeats this interpretation with the assurance that the amendment is not to provide grounds for the accused or convicted offender to obtain any form of relief since the rights of the accused come not from the victims rights amendment but from the sixth amendment or some other source within the constitution sjres 44 was left in somewhat different posture in the 105th congress when the committee explicitly rejected change in the amendment that would have stated that nothing in this article shall be construed to deny or diminish the rights of an accused as guaranteed by this constitution srepno 105409 at 38166 sjres 3 followed the same path senator feingold offered the same amendment which the committee declined to accept srepno 106254 at 43 the refusal to accept the amendment might be read to mean that in the case of unavoidable conflict victims rights should prevail over defendants rights the text of the report however appears to repudiate such an interpretation by rejecting the laterintime analysis and by using fairtrialfreepress example in which the defendants rights prevail in the case of unavoidable conflict167httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30525crs46 canon of construction can be useful when two measures address precisely the same subject but rigid rule of constitutional interpretation requires giving unblinking precedence to later enactments on separate subjects instead the committee trusts the courts to harmonize the rights of victims and defendants to ensure that both are appropriately protected the courts have for example long experience in accommodating the rights of the press and the public to attend trial with the rights of defendant to fair trial the same sort of accommodations can be arrived at to dissipate any tension between victims and defendants rights although critics may have questioned whether the courts would always be able to dissipate any tension between victims and defendants rights the fairtrialfreepress area may indicate how infrequently truly unavoidable conflicts are likely to occur for general discussion see twentyeighth annual review of criminal procedure public access 87 georgetown law journal 1641 1999 168 house hearing iii prepared statement of professor douglas beloof to protect these rights of victims does not entail constitutionalizing the rights of private citizens against other citizens for it is not the private citizen accused of crime by state or federal authorities who is the source of the violations that victims rights advocates hope to address with constitutional amendment in this area rather it is the governmental authorities themselves those who pursue or release the accused or convicted criminal with insufficient attention to the concerns of the victim id prepared statement steven j twistwhile some have argued that victims exclusion from trial proceedings is needed to avoid the possibility of tailored testimony this concern can be addresse d in other ways such as having the victim testify first or relying on pretrial statements to police officers or the grand jury rather than on trial testimony of the victim 169 146 congrec s 2977 daily ed april 27 2000remarks of sen feinsteinthis issue goes down on one phrase that one phrase is the addition of language that would say nothing in this constitution amendment would abridge the right of defendant as provided by this constitution that is paraphrase of what it is the department of justice insists on that language we will not get administration support i believe without that language the victims movement believes they would not have sufficient standing in these rights to really assert them in meaningful way unless they were able to be balanced against the rights of the defendant id remarks of sen kylwe are perfectly willing to make it crystal clear in our language that the enumeration of these rights for victims does not abridge any rights guaranteed in the constitution for defendants or those accused of crime we are unwilling to say if there has to be any balancing the defendant always wins that would deny exactly what we are trying to achieve for the victims which is some equal consideration under the constitution for their fairness given all of the things we have rightly done for defendants the remarks accompanying introduction of the present proposals assert the need to prevent victims rights from being trumped by defendants rights yet they give hint whether in case of unavoidable conflict victims rights are to trump those of the accused or whether both are to be honored at the expense of the prosecution some witnesses spoke as if the proposals would expect the government to bear the burden of dissipating conflicts between victims and defendants rights168 perhaps to avoid this implication the justice department as noted above recommended clarifying language to require victims rights to yield to defendants rights in areas of unavoidable conflict this was further than the sponsors of s3 apparently felt they could and was the point at which debate in the senate essentially ended169httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30525crs47 170 srepno 106254 at 42 few courts have held that retroactive application of changes in standards governing restitution violates the constitutions prohibition of ex post facto laws see eg united states v williams 128 f3d 1239 8th cir 1997 the committee agrees with those courts that have taken the contrary view that because restitution is not intended to punish offenders but to compensate victims ex post facto consideratio ns are misplaced see eg united states v newman 144 f3d 531 7th cir 1998 however to avoid slowing down the conclusion
