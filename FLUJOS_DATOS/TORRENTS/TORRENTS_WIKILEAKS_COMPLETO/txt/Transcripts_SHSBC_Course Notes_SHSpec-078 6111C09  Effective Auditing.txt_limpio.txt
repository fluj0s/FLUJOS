6111c09 shspec78 effective auditing there is only one thing that can make an emeter lie and thats bad auditor where an auditor has withholds he wont want to get others withholds off so he wont want to believe the meter auditor diffidence is also based on fear of what they might hear from pcs such as gossip about themselves pcs do appreciate auditor control in session on sec check the pc may not know what it is thats giving read at that point you get helpful ask lot of various things to help him locate it compartment the question to see where the read is coming from etc but if the pc is resisting not even trying to look acting resentful etc dont be softy get as tough as necessary to get the withhold the pc has gone into games condition and you have got to get him out of it you have to be able to judge whats happening to the pc and not expect there is ritual way to handle him the technology and procedures of scientology are to assist you to audit the pc not to hide behind there is substitute for live auditor particularly in sec checking this doesnt mean you should always he sweet dont overwhump the pc creating missed withholds of nothing dont be robot dont ignore the pcs answers creating an enforced withhold dont do something that suddenly shifts the pcs attention like going from interest to enthusiastic interest in jump it takes certain amount of auditor to make an auditing session some auditors can put too much there with distractive comments and so forth if the meter breaks in midsession dont do anything at all about it except carry on with the session until you can declare break then fix the meter and restart never distract the pcs attention out of session fiddling with the meter can cause the ta to climb as much as two divisions dont develop nice calloused death mask in lieu of tr0 process the pc in front of you just get brave the way to get your ruds in as an auditor is to just relax look over the situation even if it takes bit of time find out what is going on by asking what is going on you ask him thats different from ritual do you know that with one single question that is heartfelt and meant by you you can put all the ruds in just like that how do you run sec check on tough pc with lots of withholds when the meter is broken you dont you run some havingness and confront and end session and get new meter but never distract pcs attention from the session you can be as interesting or as interested as you please as long as its relevant to the session and to what the pc is doing what upsets the pc is an irrelevancy to his case its not what you do its how relevant your actions are you must have your attention on the pc the auditor could dance jig as long as it is relevant to the pcs case youll drop some of your shackles and death masks when you learn this differentiate between what you can get away with and what you cant all the pc demands is that the auditor be effective and his attention relevant to the pcs case thats what the auditor violates when he gets in trouble with the pc the whole pattern of arc breaks is that the pc ceases to believe that the auditors attention is relevant to his case per the philadelphia doctorate lectures the highest level of reality is conviction this is above agreement communication above mechanics its belief the pc must stay convinced that the auditor is interested in auditing him and interested in auditing his case and doing it effectively with attention on the pc this conviction takes something to achieve it can be accomplished if you know enough about the mind and have enough reality on its mechanics knowing these things you are never debarred by the mystery of it all the pc looks like something that can be resolved if you know the mechanics of how he operates and if you know all the parts of his mind you understand enough of what he is doing to form arc with the pc now your interest and attention is on the particularities the specifics of his difficulties if you are comfortable with the basics and the mechanics youll be able to handle peoples upsets effectively somebody who understands life can talk about life and other people know he understands life even if they dont know what he is saying oddly enough so if you who could be looking and interested arent doing it with the pc he has been out its upsetting that you dont do what you could be doing people do not forgive auditing or being ineffective so audit the pc and be effective the pc wants your attention cn his case if you start to tell him about your case forget it matter how kindly your motives are just be sure you are effective and that your attention is on his case details on modifiers the arc the pc forms with the auditor is not just from sweetness and kindness its from auditor control interest and effectiveness student auditing can well be slow because the pc can feel the student is auditing in order to learn about it not because of interest in his case if an auditor goes and carelessly sleeps with the pc hell get auditing done thereafter hes longer interested in the pcs case hes interested in the pcs body being complimentary to your pc goes only so far then it becomes interest in the pcs body not in his case so it is longer effective out of session compliments may be fine every skill you have in auditing routines sec checks model session problems intensive has certain form which rather guarantees interest in the pcs case dont let it ride on automatic however or it compounds the felony you get the situation where the ritual is interested in the pcs case but the auditor isnt the pc gets weird unreality about the whole thing the auditor has to be interested in the pcs case and determined to do something effective about it then through the media of emeter and procedure he gives the auditing commands the commands are vital but secondary they do nothing by themselves in sec checking if the auditor does not become visible and real to the pc withholds will read you get reads on the meter in direct ratio to your reality to the pc this is true in assessment too your presence is as poor in the pcs opinion as you have to keep the rudiments in the auditor is as real and has as much presence to the pc as the ruds stay in interest must be present to get reads and restimulate the pc the more presence you have the more you can get out of the pc it can disturb pc to have some overt or partly known thing and to hear from some nonpresent and nonlocated terminal question about it that doesnt restimulate it when its thetan to thetan question theres live interest and communication and you get reads and answers the bank is responsive to your presence you can handle it better than he can if you never order his bank around nothing happens the way to get pc into session is to audit him do something effective beware of mechanical distractions of all kinds pcs who are arc broken about unflat processes are really upset about moving off an effective process to something ineffective if its effective run it through to the end even if its rough the only is not auditing especially when youve started auditing if to be effective you have to throw down the meter ok and thats sometimes what it takes put your attention on the pc and what hes doing the pc will even forgive something like this just sit there and shut up for minute and let think youve presented here with rough one and im not quite sure which way im going on the thing so just be quiet for moment and lemme figure this out shut up now jesus youve got rough case all right this is what im gonna do the pc will accept this because you are going to do something about his case
