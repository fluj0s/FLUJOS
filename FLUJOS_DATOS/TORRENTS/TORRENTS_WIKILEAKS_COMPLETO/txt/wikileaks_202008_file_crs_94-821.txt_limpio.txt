difference david m ackerman legislative attorney american law division summary the supreme court has held governmentsponsored prayer in the public schools to violate the establishment of religion clause of the first amendment in contrast it has held clergyled prayer in legislative assemblies such as the congress and the state legislatures to be constitutionally permitted because both situations involve government sponsorship of prayer these rulings are sometimes said to be contradictory the court however has drawn significant factual and legal distinctions between the two situations nonetheless it remains true that the contrary decisions reflect different approaches to the interpretation of the establishment clause school prayer the supreme court has handed down more than dozen decisions involving religion in the public schools1 but three decisions are crucial for understanding this area of the law in engel v vitale2 in 1962 and abington school district v schempp3 in 1963 the supreme court first held governmentsponsored devotional activities in the public schools to constitute an establishment of religion in violation of the first amendment4 engel involved

is not permitted july 16 1993 report 93 680a 2 370 us 421 1962 3 374 us 203 1963 4 the religion clauses of the first amendment provide that congress shall make law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof these protections of religious liberty have been held to be applicable to state and local governments as well under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment see everson v board of education 330 us 1 1947 and cantwell v connecticut 310 us 296 1941 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 the beginning of each school day prayer that had been composed and recommended for use by the new york state board of regents almighty god we acknowledge our dependence upon thee and we beg thy blessings upon us our parents our teachers and our country in holding the prayer exercise unconstitutional 61 the court stated the constitutional prohibition against laws respecting an establishment of religion must at least mean that in this country it is part of the business of government to compose official prayers for any group of the american people to recite as part of religious program carried on by government government in this country be it state or federal is without power to prescribe by law any particular form of prayer which is to be used as an official prayer in carrying on any program of governmentally sponsored religious activity 370 us at 425 and 430 abington and the companion case of murray v curlett involved government requirements in pennsylvania and baltimore md that each school day begin with readings from the bible and the unison recital of the lords prayer in striking down those requirements as well 81 the court asserted the exercises are religious exercises required by the states in violation of the command of the first amendment that the government maintain strict neutrality neither aiding nor opposing religion 374 us at 203 in both cases the states excused students who objected to taking part in the exercises but the court suggested that the exercises could not be truly voluntary in the context of compulsory school attendance laws and in any event the establishment clause does not depend upon any showing of direct governmental compulsion and is violated by the enactment of laws which establish an official religion whether those laws operate directly to coerce nonobserving individuals or not5 in the third case lee v weisman6 the court by 54 margin held it to be unconstitutional for public secondary school to include an invocation and benediction by clergyman in its commencement ceremony the court explicitly reaffirmed engel and abington and concluded that the prayer exercises in this case are especially improper because the state has in every practical sense compelled attendance and participation in an explicit religious exercise at an event of singular importance to every student 7 students were not required to attend the ceremony to receive their diplomas but the court stated that law reaches past formalism and to say teenage student has real choice not 5 engel v vitale supra at 421 6 112 sct 2649 1992 7 id at 2661 crs3 to attend her high school graduation is formalistic in the extreme8 to persuade or compel student to participate in religious exercise the court said is forbidden by the establishment clause9 the court differentiated its holding in this case from its ruling in marsh v chambers infra concerning legislative prayer as follows the atmosphere at the opening of session of state legislature where adults are free to enter and leave with little comment and for any number of reasons cannot compare with the constraining potential of the one school event most important for the student to attend the influence and force of formal exercise in school graduation are far greater than the prayer exercise we condoned in marsh at high school graduation teachers and principals must and do retain high degree of control over the precise contents of the program the speeches the timing the movements the dress and the decorum of the students in this atmosphere the stateimposed character of an invocation and benediction by clergy selected by the school combine to make the prayer statesanctioned religious exercise in which the student was left with alternative but to submit 112 sct at 265960 legislative prayer the court has addressed the issue of the constitutionality of legislative prayer in only one instance and that involved prayer at the opening of state legislature but the reasoning of the decision gave general approval to prayer at all legislative levels including in the congress at issue in marsh v chambers10 was the constitutionality of the practice of the nebraska legislature of opening each legislative day with prayer by chaplain paid by the state in holding the practice constitutional 63 the court stated that the practice of legislative prayer was deeply embedded in the history and tradition of this country and had become part of the fabric of our society it stressed that legislative prayer had existed from colonial times through the founding of the republic had been practiced in congress for nearly two centuries and was consistent practice in most of the state legislatures but along with this historical data the court emphasized the fact that the first congress in 1789 had authorized the appointment of paid chaplains to offer prayers at each legislative session only three days before it reached agreement on the language of the bill of rights including the religion clauses of the first amendment standing alone historical patterns cannot justify contemporary violations of constitutional guarantees the court said but here historical evidence sheds light on what the draftsmen intended the establishment clause to mean 11 clearly the court 8 id at 2659 9 id at 2661 10 463 us 783 1983 11 id at 790 crs4 concluded the men who wrote the first amendment religion clauses did not view paid legislative chaplains and opening prayers as violation of that amendment 12 it can hardly be thought that in the same week members of the first congress voted to appoint and to pay chaplain for each house and also voted to approve the draft of the first amendment for submission to the states they intended the establishment clause of the amendment to forbid what they had just declared acceptable 463 us at 790 soon after marsh was decided by the court the us court of appeals for the district of columbia acted on related case called murray v buchanan that case challenged the constitutionality of paid chaplains prayers not in state legislature but in the congress itself after the decision in marsh came down the appellate court in an banc decision dismissed murray on the grounds it longer raised substantial constitutional question13 in brief ruling the court stated simply that the supreme courts decision in marsh v chambers is dispositive of appellants challenge to the public funding of congressional chaplains distinctions the distinctions between governmentsponsored prayer in the public schools and governmentsponsored prayer in legislative assemblies thus appear to be twofold first the supreme court has found legislative prayer in effect to be an historically sanctioned exception to the general proscription of the establishment clause in engel and abington the court interpreted the establishment clause broadly the history of religion in europe and the colonies the court said demonstrated both that union of government and religion tends to destroy government and to degrade religion and that governmentally established religions and religious persecutions go hand in hand14 thus it said the meaning of the establishment clause is essentially that government must be strictly neutral toward religion serving neither as its advocate nor as its enemy in lee it used the narrower principle that at minimum the constitution guarantees that government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise15 in the public schools these interpretations of the establishment clause have meant that government cannot sponsor devotional exercises either as daily ritual or as part of such significant event as commencement but legislative prayer is different the court has said because the first congress that wrote the establishment clause hired legislative chaplains to offer daily prayers at the same time thus matter how broadly the establishment clause is interpreted it cannot be read as proscribing legislative prayer second the court has cited factual differences both in the age of participants and in the legal compulsion to attend the prayer exercises as important it has noted that legislative prayer involves adults who are under compulsion to be present for the exercise while prayer in the public schools involves impressionable children who are 12 id at 788 13 720 f2d 689 1983 14 engel v vitale supra at 431 433 15 112 sct at 2659 crs5 subject both to compulsory attendance laws and to substantial social pressure to conform it has suggested in short that governmentsponsored school prayer is more coercive in nature than legislative prayer and thus more violative of the purposes of the establishment clause finally however it should be noted that the differing results the court reached in its school prayer and legislative prayer decisions reflect in part an ongoing debate on the court about how the establishment clause should be interpreted engel abington and to lesser extent lee reflect perspective that believes union of government and religion tends to destroy government and to degrade religion16 and that therefore there must be wall of separation between government and religion marsh in contrast reflects perspective that government can act benignly in support of religion and more particularly that practices which have become part of the fabric of our society should be constitutionally allowed to continue although the decisions themselves are not necessarily inconsistent these differing perspectives continue to frame the debate on the court and in the society at large on the proper relationship between government and religion and the proper interpretation of the religion clauses of the first amendment as long as that debate persists the courts school prayer and legislative prayer decisions seem likely to continue to be lifted up as contradictory 16 engel v vitale supra at 431 for other versions of this document see
