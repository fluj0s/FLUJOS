updated january 5 1999 glenn j mcloughlin coordinator specialist in technology and telecommunications policy science technology and medicine division congressional research service the library of congress abstract this report provides an overarching review of current federal government information technology it policy issues the issues selected for this report are federal government it spending the year 2000 problem encryption policies information infrastructure and national security the government performance results act gpra the clingercohen act medical records and privacy electronic commerce domain names and the federal role in the current and future development of the internet the report provides concise summaries of these issues at the end of each section short list of relevant and more detailed crs reports on the subject is provided this report will be updated periodically federal government information technology policy selected issues summary federal government information technology it is an important part of the federal mission to serve americans federal government it policy can improve how services and information are provided to citizens increase the timeliness and quality of federal agencies responses and save federal tax dollars by improving government efficiency protection and security of individuals privacy as well as making appropriate federal data more transparent and available for its citizens are the ultimate goals of federal agency it policies but there are some questions and concerns regarding federal it policy as well are the programs that support federal policy appropriately funded and administered is enough being done to safeguard and protect citizens from both immediate and longterm threats what is the proper federal role for enhancing all forms of it applications and development federal policymakers grapple with these questions and others as they consider establishing reviewing and sometimes revising the federal governments it policy among the many federal it policy issues now before congressional policymakers the following are likely to continue to receive attention they are the size and scope of federal government it spending the year 2000 computer problem federal encryption policies information infrastructure and national security implementation of both the government performance and results act gpra and the clingercohen act the role of the federal government with regard to medical records and privacy electronic commerce domain names and the federal role in the growth and the future of the internet this report provides brief summary of each issue and lists more detailed crs reports after each section contents overview 1 federal government it spending 2 the year 2000

information technology related issues from privacy and security to commerce and taxation and from the federal role in funding and developing the internet to the private sector role in advancing new technologies and applications since some of these issues are still unreconciled it is likely that the 106th congress will continue to address wide range of it issues many directly connected to federal it policies and programs federal it policy and the programs that support the policy can have wide range of benefits for us citizens federal government it policy can improve how services and information are provided to americans increase the timeliness and quality of federal agencies responses and save federal tax dollars by improving government efficiency those are all reasons why the federal government increasingly relies on it applications and services protection and security of individuals privacy as well as making appropriate federal data more transparent and available for its citizens are the ultimate goals of federal agency it policies many have questions and concerns regarding federal it policy as well they view the rapidly expanding types of it technologies and the many applications of these technologies and ask are the programs that support federal policy appropriate is enough being done to safeguard and protect citizens from both immediate and longterm threats what is the proper federal role for enhancing all forms of it applications and development it is important to remember that just over two decades ago federal government it policy usually meant the acquisition and use of one mainframe computer per federal agency the number of qualified professionals who could use and maintain mainframe databases was relatively small the subsequent mushrooming of new technologies and applications has ranged from the omnipresent use of personal computers in the federal workplace to the explosive growth of the internet often federal policymakers have had to react to these changes as they attempt to fit new it technologies and applications into existing policy frameworks the following summaries of current federal it policy issues provide broad view of how the federal government is addressing many of these changes crs2 federal government it spending1 the federal government has significant presence in the us information technology it industry since traditionally federal government procurement and acquisition is standardized its buying patterns can shape and determine specific technology developments and applications in it as single buyer federal agency it procurement in the 1960s and 1970s helped spur the growth of the us computer and semiconductor industries and provided significant impact on us computer software and networking capabilities and peripheral services even after 1996 law pl104106 decentralized much of the federal government it procurement and acquisition the federal government if considered as single entity is still one of the single largest buyers of it services and technologies in the world until the 1996 law federal it procurement and acquisition for most federal agencies was centrally managed by the general services administration gsa and statistics on federal it procurement and use came from one source since 1997 as authority has become more decentralized at individual agencies there has been less centralized reporting of total federal information technology however some figures are available from the office of management and budget omb on federal it procurement and acquisition omb figures show that it expenditures make up small portion of the overall federal operating budget 6 in fy1996 over the last two fiscal years federal it spending was relatively flat growing 2 from 286 billion in fy1997 to 291 billion in fy1998 hardware budgets totaled 5 billion in fy1998 slightly above fy1997 budgets software budgets declined marginally in the fy1998 budget to 14 billion from just less than 15 billion in fy1997 in contrast us business spent just under 400 billion on it technologies and services in calendar year 1997 88 of all it technologies and services purchased in the united states the most significant change in the fy 1998 budget is an increase in commercial services where the federal government is contracting out more and more of its it systems and services according to november 1997 report by input private sector firm federal market demand for vendorfurnished information systems and services will increase from 226 billion in fy 1997 to 301 billion in fy 2002 at compound annual growth rate of 59 another it industry report by federal sources inc provides the result of an annual survey of large companies doing business in the federal it field the current report forecasts 8 growth in federal it spending in fy1998 and an increase from just less than 30 billion in fy1998 to 40 billion by fy2002 according to general accounting office gao report issued in june 1997 the federal government spent 349 million on internetrelated activities over three year period internet and electronic dialup bulletin boards information reported by federal organizations gaoggd9786 the defense department was 1 prepared by rita tehan information research specialist congressional reference division and glenn j mcloughlin specialist in technology and telecommunications policy science technology and medicine division crs3 responsible for the bulk of the spending but internet spending and usage vary widely across the government of the major agencies veterans affairs spent the least 19 million over three years and the department of defense spent the most 1478 million over the same period of time the state department did not respond to gaos survey during this period nearly onethird of federal employees were hooked up to the internet while 17 million federal workers about 50 percent had email access but online access varied by agency see also brad meyers computer almanac interesting and useful numbers about computers httpwwwcscmueduafscsuserbamwwwnumbershtml the year 2000 computer problem2 many computers in the united states and throughout the world will not be able to store or process dates correctly beyond december 31 1999 unless they are modified the problem is the result of common computer design in which dates are stored using only the last two digits for the year eg 98 for 1998 the two digit year field is very common among older systems designed when memory storage was more expensive but is also used in many systems built recently under the twodigit format for storing the year the year 2000 is indistinguishable from 1900 the year field in computer programs can perform various functions such as calculating age sorting information by date and comparing dates when years beyond 1999 are entered in the twodigit format those functions will often fail to operate properly and in some cases systems will completely shut down although the year 2000 problem is primarily in computer software the problem also exists in some hardware components in which integrated circuits also called embedded chips store or process data without correction computer malfunctions will cause many costly problems in commerce and government although some may still doubt the seriousness of the problem most government officials and business managers are now convinced that tending to it is critically important to continue operations fixing computer systems for the year 2000 will in general be very difficult and costly due to the large number of computers in use their high degree of interdependence and the difficulty in finding all of the date fields in the software all of the year 2000 conversion work including testing for errors and testing interfaces between systems must be completed before january 1 2000 to avoid disruptions in system in addition many report shortage of skilled programmers to perform the year 2000 conversion over 50 gao reports have concluded that many federal agencies are at risk of failing to complete the year 2000 conversions of their mission critical systems by the deadline the gao has identified specific systems that are at greatest risk and has made recommendations to agencies to mitigate failures federal agencies are all working to renovate their systems and presidential council on year 2000 2 prepared by richard m nunno analyst in information technology science technology and medicine division crs4 conversion has been established to oversee activities in federal agencies and coordinate with state local and tribal governments international groups and the private sector on all year 2000 conversion efforts an interagency committee has recommended that fourdigit year field be used for all federal electronic data exchange and has required federal agencies to purchase systems that process all dates correctly the office of management and budget has been submitting quarterly reports to congress on the status of federal agency year 2000 conversion the omb report dated as of august 15 1998 identifies the following agencies as not making satisfactory progress the departments of defense dod education energy health and human services hhs transportation state and the agency for international development critical government services as well as military operations face possible risks to their ability to continue to function properly according to ombs estimates the cost of year 2000 conversion for all federal agencies has continued to increase their most recent estimate being 54 billion state and local governments private sector businesses and foreign organizations also face the year 2000 problem for their computer systems which could have an impact on international trade and the overall economy interconnected systems must also be protected from receiving corrupted data from systems that are not year 2000 compliant several economic sectors considered critical to the nation also face risks of experiencing year 2000 failures these include utilities and the national power grid telecommunications banking and financial services health care services transportation services agriculture and food processing and distribution and small businesses many congressional hearings have been held from 1996 to the present raising the level of awareness of the year 2000 problem at all levels in government agencies and the private sector several appropriations bills enacted in the 104th and 105th congresses have contained year 2000 provisions three fy1998 appropriations acts direct the reprogramming of funds from existing appropriations of federal agencies to perform year 2000 work pl 10561 pl 10565 pl 10578 an fy1998 supplemental appropriations act pl 105174 provides new funding for year 2000 efforts at federal agencies emergency year 2000 funding for federal agency conversion efforts totaling 385 billion was enacted as part of the fy1999 omnibis appropriations act pl 105277 of this funding 11 billion is directed specifically for dod the remaining 25 billion is to be distributed by omb to other federal agencies except for approximately 30 million which is directed to the legislative and judiciary branches omb has already approved allocations of 891 million for nondefense agency use for dod the defense authorization act for fy1999 pl 105261 contains directions for managing its year 2000 conversion efforts all of these emergency federal funds will remain available until september 1 2001 and may be used only for federal year 2000 remediation unless otherwise directed by congress one year 2000 bill that was not part of an appropriations bill was enacted in the th 105 congress that bill the examination parity and year 2000 readiness for financial institutions act pl 105164 extends the authority of the office of thrift crs5 supervision and the national credit union administration to examine the operations of service corporations or other entities that provide computer maintenance and data processing services for thrift savings institutions and credit unions the legislation was intended to give those federal agencies statutory parity with other financial regulatory agencies for the financial institutions they oversee policymakers also have been concerned about making it easier for companies to disclose information on the year 2000 readiness of their products and services the year 2000 information and readiness and disclosure act pl 105271 was enacted to encourage companies to disclose information on the status of the year 2000 renovations and testing of their products and services to protect companies the act prohibits year 2000 readiness disclosures from being used as evidence in state or federal courts it also protects companies from year 2000 statements in liability suits unless the statement is known to be false intended to deceive or made in reckless disregard for truthfulness it also exempts from federal antitrust action information sharing by companies of year 2000 remediation activities the 106th congress will likely hold hearings to monitor federal agency progress of year 2000 remediation congress will likely also seek to assist state and local governments the private sector and global information systems vulnerable to the year 2000 problem policymakers may consider additional legislation that would be intended to remove obstacles for completing year 2000 conversion in each of these sectors see also richard m nunno the year 2000 problem activity in the 105th congress crs issue brief 97036 updated regularly richard m nunno year 2000 problem chronology of legislation crs report 98 377 5 august 1998 encryption policies 3 encryption and decryption are methods of using cryptography to protect the confidentiality of data and communications when encrypted message only can be understood by someone with the key to decrypt it businesses and consumers want strong encryption products to protect their information while the clinton administration wants to ensure the law enforcement communitys ability to monitor undesirable activity in the digital age the administrations policy promotes the use of strong encryption here and abroad as long as it is designed with key recovery features where key recovery agent holds spare key to decrypt the information the administration would require key recovery agents to make the decryption key available to duly authorized federal and state government entities privacy advocates are concerned that law enforcement entities will have too much access to private information 3 prepared by richard m nunno analyst in information technology science technology and medicine division crs6 encrypting messages so they can be understood only by the intended recipient historically was the province of those protecting military secrets the burgeoning use of computers and computer networks including the internet now has focused attention on its value to much broader segment of society government agencies seeking to protect data stored in their databases businesses wanting to guard proprietary data and consumers expecting electronic mail to be as private as first class mail all want access to strong encryption products while encryption is uncommon for telephone users today the advent of digital telephone services particularly personal communication services pcs digital form of cellular telephony is expected to make encrypted voice and data communications over telephones more common the national institute of standards and technology nist in conjunction with industry developed an encryption standard using 56bit key in 1977 called the data encryption standard des it is widely used today in the united states and abroad nist is currently working to establish new stronger standard than des referred to as the advanced encryption standard aes the need for stronger standard was underscored in june 1997 when des was broken the administration uses the export control process to influence whether companies develop key recovery encryption products by making it easy to export products with key recovery and difficult for those products without there are limits on domestic use or import of any type of encryption the clinton administration has tried to influence what is available for domestic use through export controls since most companies will not develop one product for domestic use and separate product for export us computer companies argue that us export restrictions hurt their market share and help foreign companies that are not subject to export restrictions many businesses and consumer groups agree that key recovery is desirable when keys are lost stolen or corrupted however they would like market forcesnot government directivesto drive the development of key recovery encryption products many also object to government having any role in determining who can hold the keys all parties agree that encryption is essential to the growth of electronic commerce and use of the internet but there is little consensus beyond that seven bills on encryption or computer security have been introduced in the 105th congress fundamentally the controversy over encryption concerns what access the government should have to encrypted stored computer data or electronic communications voice and data wired and wireless for law enforcement purposes among the major issues facing congressional policymakers are the following key recovery the clinton administration wants law enforcement access to keys for encrypted data stored by computers transmitted between computers or other types of electronic communications not only does the administration view this as critical for us users but it seeks creation of global key management infrastructure kmi to ensure confidentiality for the growth of global electronic commerce and monitoring undesirable activity by terrorists drug cartels or child pornographers for example some contend that market forces will drive the development of kmi for stored computer data without government involvement others have concerns that the crs7 government will have unfettered entry to private files and communications in september 1998 the administration announced new encryption policy that will allow companies to export 56bit encryption products without demonstrating they have plans for creating or developing key recovery systems export restrictions the clinton administration defending its export control policy points to threats to national security and public safety that would arise if criminals and terrorists used encryption that the us government could not decrypt opponents of the administrations policy counter that the united states cannot prevent access to strong nonkey recovery encryption by criminals and terrorists because it is already available elsewhere in the world they argue that the current policy of restrictions on domestic use or import of encryption means that domestic threats likely would not be affected in july 1998 the administration announced plans to relax export controls for strong encryption software without requiring provisions for key recovery for financial institutions in the 45 countries that currently have laws acceptable to the united states outlawing money laundering the administrations new policy announced in september 1998 expands the export of 56bit encryption to insurance companies health and medical organizations excluding biomedical and pharmaceutical manufacturers and online merchants for client server applications that secure electronic commerce transactions some in industry and congress question whether the administrations policy since many longer consider 56bit encryption strong encryption method domestic use current us policy allows any type of encryption to be used in or imported into the united states administration concerns that attempting to change this policy would be unsuccessful was factor in its choice of using export controls to influence what encryption products are available for domestic use in 1997 some experts detected change in government policy when fbi director freeh informed the senate judiciary committee of the possibility of requiring that key recovery be built into products manufactured in or imported into the united states key recovery could possibly be enabled by the manufacturer not only the user congressional policymakers will likely revisit and pursue this issue with the clinton administration see also richard m nunno encryption technology congressional issues crs issue brief 96039 updated regularly information infrastructure and national security 4 information technology pervades many if not most of the systems used to create and distribute the many public and private services upon which our society 4 prepared by john d moteff specialist in science and technology policy science technology and medicine division crs8 now depends from deploying and operating military units to providing local 911 service these systems or infrastructures are becoming more interdependent by the increased use of telecommunications that link the information technology of one system with those of others national security defined in the broadest sense to include not only military security and defense capability but also economic security and social cohesion increasingly depends on the integrity of the information technology operating and managing those systems and the connections between them the country has typically thought of the integrity of its infrastructure in terms of the physical vulnerability to natural forces eg earthquakes and to manmade threats eg sabotage but the security community also is concerned about the electronic vulnerability of its infrastructure or more specifically the data and the software used by these systems electronic threats too can be natural or manmade of particular interest is the manmade threat posed by hackers who might enter the information infrastructure of particular system and corrupt it in the past hackers may have been inquisitive or mischievous individuals motivated by the challenge of breaking into the information infrastructure of an organization today there is concern that hackers may include groups of individuals working toward more nefarious ends while the public and the private sectors have long been worried about spies hacking into sensitive information the concern now is that hackers may soon represent the vanguard of hostile attack by foreign entities in way that is difficult to detect this issue was raised during four day conference on national information systems security october 58 1998 sponsored by the national institute of standards and the national security agencys national computer security center individually system operators have spent varying amounts of time and resources protecting and policing their information systems the telecommunications industry and the military and emergency preparedness communities have cooperated for years to assure the integrity of the nations civil and military telecommunication systems 90 of the militarys communications travel on the civilian system against both physical and electronic threats but as telecommunications link the information infrastructure of various other systems and as disruption in one system can lead to cascading disruptions in other systems the national security community would like to expand that cooperation to other sectors of the economy in july 1996 the president established through executive order 13010 the presidents commission on critical infrastructure protection pccip among its tasks the commission was to assess the scope and nature of the vulnerabilities of and threats to critical infrastructures b determine what legal and policy issues are raised by efforts to protect critical infrastructures c recommend comprehensive national policy and implementation strategy for protecting critical infrastructures and d propose any statutory or regulatory changes necessary to effect its recommendations the commission examined the following systems information and communication energy including electrical power gas and oil banking and finance physical distribution personal and commercial road rail and air transport and vital human services including water local emergency services and federal services such as weather disease control and social securityconcentrating on the electronic vulnerabilities and threats crs9 in october 1997 the commission released an unclassified report critical foundations protecting americas infrastructures generally while the commission did not find any immediate threat it did report that the critical infrastructures examined were vulnerable to attack with tools now available there were several specific findings they include information sharing is the most immediate need currently there is comprehensive body of knowledge available for effective analysis of overall vulnerability and threats responsibility for protecting and responding is shared among owners and operators and the government the capabilities and response of diverse federal agencies need to be coordinated adequate response must occur in changing environments the federal government should lead by protecting its own systems the legal framework is imperfectly attuned to deal with electronic threats and research and development is presently inadequate to support protection among its recommendations the commission suggested the establishment of national structure for assuring the integrity of critical infrastructures such structure would include set of councils and offices meant to bring together various stakeholders to share information and develop protection strategies and responses the commission also recommended that among the laws that should be reviewed are the defense production act the stafford actfederal response plan the nunn lugardomenici program which focuses federal resource on training and access to equipment for local first responders and criminal statutes the commission estimated that the federal government spends about 250 million year on research and development to protect its infrastructure about 150 million of which goes toward protection of information systems the commission recommended that the investment be doubled in 1998 and increased to 1 billion year for the next 5 years on february 27 1998 the department of justice announced the creation of the national infrastructure protection center nipc its mandate is to detect prevent and respond to cyber and physical attacks on us computer systems the center has links to other government departments such as defense state and treasury as well as to local and international police agencies on may 22 1998 president clinton signed presidential directive 63 it expands the fbis authority to operate the nipc and to facilitate and coordinate the federal governments response to any incident and to investigate threats the center also serves as clearinghouse for information shared among agencies and with the private sector the commerce department has been named the lead agency for overseeing an information and communications center each federal agency will be in charge of protecting its own critical infrastructure particularly its electronic systems and must develop critical infrastructure protection plan see also john d moteff critical infrastructures primer crs report 98675 13 august 1998 crs10 the government performance and results act gpra 5 the government performance and results act gpra or the results act was enacted in 1993 as pl 10362 one of the key purposes of gpra is to improve congressional decision making by providing more objective information on the relative effectiveness and efficiency of federal programs and spending the act essentially mandates strategic planning and performance measurement in the federal government pl 10362 requires federal agencies to develop strategic plans describing their overall goals and objectives annual performance plans containing quantifiable measures of their progress and performance reports describing their success in meeting those standards and measures each agencys strategic plan is required to contain the following elements comprehensive mission statement covering the major functions and operations of the agency general goals and objectives including outcomerelated goals and objectives for the major functions and operations of the agency description of how the goals and objectives are to be achieved including description of the operational processes skills and technology and the human capital information and other resources required to meet those goals and objectives description of how the performance goals included in the agencys annual performance plan are related to the general goals and objectives in the strategic plan an identification of those key factors external to the agency and beyond its control that could significantly affect the achievement of the general goals and objectives and description of the program evaluations used in establishing or revising general goals and objectives with schedule for future program evaluations performance plans are prepared in conjunction with an agencys annual budget submission to congress the performance plan should establish tangible link between the long term strategic goals presented in the strategic plan and an agencys program activities pl 10362 requires agency performance plans to establish performance goals to define the level of performance to be achieved by program activity express such goals in an objective quantifiable and measurable form briefly describe the operational processes skills and technology and the human capital information or other resources required to meet the performance goals establish performance indicators to be used in measuring or assessing the relevant outputs service levels and outcomes of each program activity provide basis for comparing actual program results with the established performance goals and describe the means to be used to verify and validate measured values in cases where performance goals for program activity cannot be expressed in an objective quantifiable and measurable form the agency may with omb approval express performance goals by using descriptive statements or other appropriate alternate forms performance reports will discuss the extent to which performance goals and objectives are met strategic plans were submitted to congress and omb on september 30 1997 and are required to be updated at least once every three years 5 prepared by lennard g kruger specialist in science and technology science technology and medicine division crs11 agency performance plans were submitted in early 1998 in conjunction with fy1999 budget submissions performance reports will be released annually starting in march 2000 each of these plans and reports are to be shared with congress which is expected to use the materials to help guide budgetary decisions while pl 10362 does not directly address federal information technology it can be expected to play key role in determining whether agencies can successfully implement gpra in many cases the ability of agencies to collect and measure program performance data and to verify and validate results will depend on efficient and effective it systems in its review of agency strategic plans managing for results critical issues for improving federal agencies strategic plans gaoggd97180 gao concludes that information gathering is major obstacle to gpra implementation the gao suggests that the questionable capacity of many agencies to gather performance information has hampered and may continue to hamper efforts to identify appropriate goals and confidently assess performance not surprisingly information systems become critical factor in enabling agencies to effectively implement gpra without reliable it systems says gao agencies will not be able to gather and analyze the information they need to measure their performance as required by the results act yet despite the criticality of it systems gao determined that most of the 27 agency strategic plans did not cover strategies for improving the information management needed to achieve their strategic goals the plans provided few details on how agencies plan to upgrade or utilize their it systems in order to better gather and measure performance data in parrticular gao cites opms failure to discuss year 2000 despite the fact that many of its critical information systems are date dependent and exchange information with virtually every federal agency the gao also criticizes dods plan which did not specifically address information security even though dod recognizes that information warfare capability is one of number of areas of particular concern especially as it involves vulnerabilities that could be exploited by potential opponents of the united states finally says gao in order to ensure that federal it systems can adequately support gpra implementation it is important for agencies to follow through with implementation of the chief financial officers act pl 101576 the clinger cohen act pl 104106 and the paperwork reduction act pl 10413 indeed gpra can be viewed as part of the statutory framework put in place during the 1990s to address weaknesses in the management of federal programs including itrelated programs in particular the clingercohen act requires agencies to consider how information systems will help them carry out their missions and the performance they can expect from those investments ultimately the success or failure of federal it initiatives is likely to be viewed not only within the context of the clingercohen act but also within the context of gpra and the extent to which agencies meet their overall strategic goals and performance standards see also genevieve j knezo government performance and results act implementation and issues of possible concern crs report 971028 14 july 1998 crs12 frederick m kaiser and virginia mcmurtry government performance and results act implications for congressional oversight crs report 97382 12 may 1997 the clingercohen act 6 federal information technology procurement and financial management policies are an increasingly important part of the way the federal government conducts its business since the late 1980s reform of federal it procurement and acquisition policies has been part of congressional debate reform was rooted in changing or repealing the 1965 automatic data processing act or as it was more popularly known the brooks act the brooks act was intended to address problems of passive partial or informal types of leadership in the purchasing leasing maintenance operation and utilization of automatic data processing adp by federal agencies federal agencies had reported that they were having difficulty complying with regulations for annual agencywide adp budget reviews the brooks act was intended to centralize and coordinate this process by giving the general services administration gsa operational responsibility for adp management utilization and acquisition over the past three decades however advances in information technology and applications created new environment for federal agencies many viewed the brooks act as causing procurement delays imposing one size fits all standardized technology solutions and mismatching technology solutions with agencies missions policymakers sought to redress these problems and reform the centralized federal acquisition procurement and financial accounting system the clingercohen act or as it was passed the information technology management reform act was incorporated into the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1996 pl 104106 the clingercohen act named after its principal cosponsors was intended to provide the executive branch flexibility to acquire technologies and services incrementally enter into modular rather than more costly longerterm contracts and obtain information technologies and services to fit agency needs the major provisions of the clingercohen act are the following it eliminated gsas central role for setting information technology policy and provided each federal agency with direct responsibility for it procurement and acquisition it mandated that each federal agency establish chief information officer cio to provide administrative and managerial oversight of each agencys it policies it established two types of pilot programs for federal agency it management and procurement 6 prepared by glenn j mcloughlin specialist in technology and telecommunications policy science technology and medicine division crs13 it gave omb broad role in coordinating and facilitating interagency it communication on policies to date many in government and the private sector are encouraged that the acts provisions have provided overall cost reductions for the federal government many contend that the law has greatly improved the efficiency of individual agencies as information technology purchases and applications are more tailored to each agencys need and mission the longterm savings to the federal government could be significant yet wideranging federal information technology reform is still relatively uncharted territory supporters also contend that the laws provisions based on successfully proven private sector initiatives also have decentralized and reduced the bureaucracy inherent in federal information technology management policy and will likely result in improved federal services in the near future supporters also contend that the creation of federal agency cios and the nascent pilot programs will provide federal agencies with the expertise and the procedures for evaluating success and failure several federal agencies have made significant inroads in changing federal information management through their cio offices yet it is unclear whether total dollar figure in savings can be determined under this law some are concerned that because federal agencies may be too focused on serving their own needs and missions standardized information technologies applications and services may be lacking across the government they are not convinced that federal agencies will derive all of the benefits supporters claim they argue that such benefits adopted from the private sector may not necessarily work where the mission is the public good not profit what policies will guide federal information technology managers use when forceful marketplace mechanisms such as profit and loss are not available to purge failure finally some contend that simply providing for cios and pilot programs will not solve or perhaps even address the fundamental issue of developing good and responsive government can the clingercohen act live up to expectations that government reforms will produce better services some experts contend that without talented personnel federal information resources management irm will not fully benefit from the act some even state that the federal government is so far behind the private sector in attracting and keeping irm expertise that amount of reform will reverse this trend according to an expert at the gao federal agencies are not identifying the skills they need and they can not afford to pay for the skills they need yet supporters are optimistic that the clingercohen act may create an environment where bright and skillful people are challenged by the flexibility and responsiveness arising from the law many hope that the act will usher in new age in which the best and the brightest in irm will enter the government and serve the public good see also glenn j mcloughlin information technology management reform act itmra of 1996 crs report 9779 8 january 1997 crs14 medical records and privacy 7 the ability to ensure privacy of health recordsincluding those in federal agency databasesincreasingly is at risk due to several trends these include the growing use of information technologies in health care structural changes in the health care delivery and payment systems and information gathered from genetic testing these factors accentuate the fact that existing legal safeguards to protect patient confidentiality are limited in particular concerns are raised about the increasing number of parties who have routine access to personally identifiable health records in institutions involved in health care treatment payment and oversight the growth in the application of information technologies in all aspects of health care delivery also creates new vulnerabilities for patient confidentiality the passage of the health insurance portability act of 1996 hipaa pl 104 191 has placed deadline pressure on congress to consider medical records privacy legislation hipaa requires the secretary of hhs to make recommendations to congress on ways to protect individually identifiable information and to establish penalties for wrongful disclosure for health care transactions the secretary presented those recommendations on september 11 1997 congress has until august 1999 to enact privacy law or else the act requires hhs to promulgate regulations on privacy protection within the following 6 months the concept of code of fair information practices which was recommended in early studies on privacy and is embedded in the privacy act of 1974 remains fundamental to all proposals today for maintaining confidentiality of personal records fair information practices include among others establishing conditions for disclosure of personally identifiable information providing individuals with access to records held and the right to make corrections and enforcing penalties for noncompliance while consensus exists on the need to implement fair information practices for health records number of unresolved issues remain for example there was much criticism of the hhs recommendations for allowing law enforcement officials to gain access to personally identifiable health records without additional safeguards beyond existing law finding the appropriate balance between access to health records for research purposes and individual privacy rights continues to be the subject of much debate whether state law should be preempted by uniform national law is highly contentious reliance on patient consent as the primary mechanism for protecting privacy versus establishing legal and regulatory mechanisms that provide baseline protections also is key question over dozen bills have been introduced in the 105th congress to provide protection for medical records confidentiality and to ensure that individuals are not discriminated against based on genetic information in addition medical records confidentiality provisions are included in much broader legislation intended to regulate health insurance through managed care plans hr 4250 and s 2330 hr 7 prepared by irene stithcoleman specialist in biomedical policy science technology and medicine division crs15 4250 passed the house on july 24 1998 and has been placed on the calendar in the senate even as policymakers consider this legislation several key issues remain they include the following federal preemption of state laws the question is the desirability of enacting federal medical privacy legislation that preempts either in whole or in part state privacy laws in some areas of law certain states are generally regarded as either having stronger privacy protections for certain types of information or as having acted in an area in the absence of federal law examples include the areas of mental health public health reporting and privileges such as the physicianpatient privilege patient identifiers the provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act direct the secretary of hhs to promulgate standards for identifiers for certain purposes advantages might include administrative simplification potentially reduced costs for institutions and reimbursement systems and facilitating the linkage of valuable health data about patient that might be useful in providing improved care at the same time personal identifiers raise serious privacy concerns perhaps linking federal government medical data with financial data or employment information patient rights to access fundamental element of code of fair information practices is the right of individuals to know about information being maintained about them and the right to amend incorrect records or supplement information there appears to be strong consensus that these principles should be part of any legislation proposed to provide protection of medical records privacy health research efforts to restrict the access of researchers to information in medical records may conflict with the goal of improving patient care for example observational outcome studies rely on existing medical records data many research projects including those at federal research facilities require the use of identifiable records sometimes without the explicit consent of the individual researchers are concerned that legislative proposals seeking to provide strong privacy protections may result in serious limitations on the conduct of health studies that may offer important benefits

congress controversy surfaced over the disposition of the internet domain name system dns internet domain names were created to provide users with simple location name for computers on the internet rather than using the more complex unique internet protocol ip number that designates their specific location as the internet has grown the method for allocating and designating domain names has become increasingly controversial the internet originated with research funding provided by the department of defense advanced research projects agency darpa to establish military network as its use expanded civilian segment evolved with support from the national science foundation nsf and other science agencies while there are formal statutory authorities or international agreements governing the management and operation of the internet and the dns several entities play key roles in the dns the internet assigned numbers authority iana makes technical decisions concerning root servers determines qualifications for applicants to manage country code top level domains tlds assigns unique protocol parameters and manages the ip address space including delegating blocks of addresses to registries around the world to assign to users in their geographic area iana operates out of the university of southern californias information sciences institute and has been funded primarily by the department of defense prior to 1993 the national science foundation nsf was responsible for registration of nonmilitary generic top level domains gtlds such as com org net and edu in 1993 the nsf entered into 5year cooperative agreement with network solutions inc nsi to operate internet domain name registration services in 1995 the agreement was modified to allow nsi to charge registrants 50 fee per year for the first two years of which 70 went to nsi to cover its costs and 30 was deposited in the intellectual infrastructure fund to be reinvested in the internet since the imposition of fees in 1995 criticism arose over nsis sole control over registration of the gtlds in addition there was an increase in trademark disputes arising out of the enormous growth of registrations in the com domain with the cooperative agreement between nsi and nsf due to expire in 1998 the administration through the department of commerce doc began exploring ways to transfer administration of the dns to the private sector in the wake of much discussion among internet stakeholders and after extensive public comment on previous proposal the doc on june 5 1998 issued final statement of policy management of internet names and addresses also known as the white paper the white paper states that the us government is prepared to recognize and enter into agreement with new notforprofit corporation formed by private sector internet stakeholders to administer policy for the internet name and address system in deciding upon an entity with which to enter such an agreement the us government will assess whether the new system ensures stability 8 prepared by lennard g kruger specialist in science and technology science technology and medicine division crs17 competition private and bottomup coordination and fair representation of the internet community as whole in effect the white paper endorsed process whereby the divergent interests of the internet community would come together and decide how internet names and addresses will be managed and administered accordingly internet constituencies from around the world calling themselves the international forum on the white paperor ifwp held series of meetings during the summer of 1998 to discuss how the new corporation newco might be constituted and structured in september of 1998 iana in collaboration with nsi released proposed set of bylaws and articles of incorporation for new entity called the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann the proposal was criticized by some internet stakeholders who claimed that icann does not adequately represent consensus of the entire internet community accordingly other competing proposals for newco were submitted to doc on october 20 1998 the doc tentatively approved the icann proposal pending the satisfactory resolution of several remaining concerns raised by the competing proposals including accountability transparent decisionmaking processes and conflict of interest the doc will begin work on transition agreement with icann on november 6 icann announced that it had submitted revised set of corporate bylaws to doc which are intended to address doc concerns meanwhile nine members of icanns interim board have been chosen four americans three europeans one from japan and one from australia the white paper also signaled docs intention to ramp down the governments cooperative agreement with nsi with the objective of introducing competition into the domain name space while maintaining stability and ensuring an orderly transition on october 6 1998 doc and nsi announced an extension of the cooperative agreement between the federal government and nsi through september 30 2000 during this transition period government obligations will be terminated as dns responsibilities are transferred to the newco specifically nsi has committed to timetable for development of shared registration system that will permit multiple registrars including nsi to provide registration services within the com net and org gtlds by march 31 1999 nsi will establish test bed supporting actual registrations by five registrars who will be accredited by the newco according to the agreement the shared registration system will be deployed by june 1 1999 and fully implemented and available to all accredited registrars by october 1 1999 nsi will also continue to administer the root server system until receiving further instruction from the government during the 105th congress number of dns hearings were held by the house committees on science on commerce and on the judiciary the hearings explored issues such as governance trademark issues how to foster competition in domain name registration services and how the administration will manage and oversee the transition to private sector ownership of the dns most recently the house committees on commerce and on science held hearings on june 10 and october 7 1998 respectively on october 15 the chairman of the house committee on commerce sent letters of inquiry to doc and the white house reflecting concerns that the process which produced the icann proposal was insufficiently open and responsive to the interests of all internet stakeholders crs18 one of the thorniest issues surrounding the dns is the resolution of trademark disputes that arise in designating domain names in the early years of the internet when the primary users were academic institutions and government agencies little concern existed over trademarks and domain names as the internet grew however the fastest growing number of requests for domain names were in the com domain because of the explosion of businesses offering products and services on the internet since domain names have been available from nsi on firstcome firstserve basis some companies discovered that their name had already been registered the situation was aggravated by some people registering domain names in the hope that they might be able to sell them to companies that place high value on them and certain companies registering the names of all their product lines the increase in conflicts over property rights to certain trademarked names has resulted in several lawsuits under the current policy nsi does not determine the legality of registrations but when trademark ownership is demonstrated has placed the use of name on hold until the parties involved resolve the domain name dispute the white paper calls upon the world intellectual property organization wipo to convene an international process including individuals from the private sector and government to develop set of recommendations for trademarkdomain name dispute resolutions wipo is developing recommendations and is scheduled to present them to the newco in march 1999 meanwhile the next generation internet research act of 1998 pl 105305 directs the national academy of sciences to conduct study of the short and longterm effects on trademark rights of adding new generic toplevel domains and related dispute resolution procedures another dns issue relates to the disposition of the intellectual infrastructure fund derived from domain name registration fees collected by nsi the fund grew to 56 million before nsf and nsi discontinued collecting fees for the fund as of april 1 1998 number of suggestions were offered for use of the fund including returning money to registrants setting up nonprofit entity to allocate funds or using it for global administrative projects such as internet registries in developing countries the vahudindependent agencies fy1998 appropriations act pl 10565 directed nsf to credit up to 23 million of the funds to nsfs research and related activities account for next generation internet activities class action suit filed by six internet users against nsf and nsi in october 1997 questioned the legal authority of nsf to allow nsi to charge for registering internet addresses and requested 55 million in refunds the suit also sought to prevent the government from spending the money as directed by congress on april 6 1998 us district judge thomas hogan dismissed the charge that nsf lacked authority to permit nsi to collect fees but let stand another charge challenging the portion of the fee collected for the infrastructure fund however the fy1998 emergency supplemental appropriations act pl 105174 enacted on may 1 1998 contains language ratifying and legalizing the infrastructure fund accordingly judge hogan reversed his decision thereby allowing nsf to spend the 23 million from the fund through fy1999 on the next generation internet program see also jane bortnick griffith and lennard g kruger internet domain names background and policy issues crs report 97868 7 december 1998 crs19 electronic commerce 9 on july 1 1997 the clinton administration released its report framework for global electronic commerce this report provided several policy recommendations for enhancing electronic commerce on the internet and outlined where the us private sector should continue to develop electronic commerce and those areas where federal government policies are appropriate for oversight and regulation of electronic commerce the report provided four overarching principles to guide federal policy and nine specific policy areas where the principles would be applied congress has responded to many of these principles and policy areas including taxation of electronic commerce the clinton administrations interest in global electronic networks was addressed in president clintons first term in 1994 vice president gore gave speech in buenos aires argentina calling for the establishment of global network of networkswhat he described as global information infrastructure gii the gii would be the international counterpart to the administrations national information infrastructure nii the nii was introduced in 1993 as policy platform in which the clinton administration would use public and private sector partnerships to strengthen and expand the nations information networks vice president gore drew upon the nii when proposing the gii expanding national policy to global policy the vice president stated that three major developments could arise from the creation of gii its applications could result in greater democracy worldwide it could act as catalyst for economic growth and more global trade among all nations and it could become an important element for sustainable growth for lesser developed and developing nations the administration repeated these principles at g7 meeting in brussels belgium in february 1995 the topic of this g7 meeting was to address what international policies could result in greater liberalization of global telecommunications policies and connections while the representatives of many nations supported the us gii position others raised concerns about the reciprocity of global commerce without multilateral agreements to ensure compliance by all nations subsequent international telecommunications conferences and agreements brought more discussion on the best way to further open global electronic commerce on february 5 1998 an agreement reached by 70 countries under the auspices of the world trade organization wto went into effect the wto telecommunications services agreement is expected to liberalize trade in basic telecommunications services benefit us telecommunications companies by permitting them greater entry into foreign markets and facilitate economic growth this agreement came almost two years to the day after the telecommunications act of 1996 pl 104104 was signed into law by president clinton significantly deregulating much of the us telecommunications market and opening it to greater competition 9 prepared by glenn j mcloughlin specialist in technology and telecommunications policy science technology and medicine division crs20 still some concerns remain regarding security and privacy taxation and export control policy in global networks many contend that since the internet already is global cooperative network of networks with multitude of users there is little need for government or governments to further regulate or oversee commercial development others however contend that as electronic commerce expands new framework will be needed to help ensure the integrity and safety of transactions on global networks the july 1997 administration report used the gii policy as the foundation for establishing four principles to guide us policy on electronic commerce they are the private sector should lead for electronic commerce to flourish the administration stated that the private sector should lead in the continued innovation services participation and pricing of electronic commerce on the internet governments should avoid undue restrictions on electronic commerce parties should be able to enter into legitimate agreements to buy and sell products and services across the internet with minimal government involvement or interference government involvement if needed should be predictable minimalist and consistent there may be instances where regulation of the private sector may be needed or national interests supersede commerce however the administration contends that government policies should establish predictable and simple legal environment not topdown administrative regulation the internet is uniqueand this quality should be maintained governments should recognize the unique qualities of the internet which includes its decentralized nature and its open access regulatory frameworks that may not fit these qualities should be reviewed and possibly revised rather than constraining electronic commerce possibilities on the internet in turn the clinton administration advocated that these four principles should be applied to nine policy areas taxation payments uniform commercial code intellectual property rights privacy security infrastructure content and standards like the gii and g7 discussion in brussels these principles and policy areas are intended to be global in scope and application the administration cautions against handful of nations making electronic commerce policy decisions without broad consensus from the rest of the world in the 105th congress some of these issues such as privacy and security were already being addressed within the context of the existing debate of us policies for medical records and encryption which also had significant global ramifications in other areas such as standards and intellectual property protection the congress has examined the use of multinational organizations like the world trade organization to both address these issues and to seek reforms crs21 one area however which did not fit cleanly into an existing domestic or international policy issue was the issue of taxation of electronic commerce on the internet during the 105th congress this has become very contentious issue the clinton administrations report recommends that there be new taxation of electronic commerce on the internet by federal state or local governments the administration has contended that economic growth from electronic commerce would offset any losses of federal revenue and that ultimately successful electronic commerce will mean higher corporate profits which are taxed generally the us industry has supported this position however many us state governors have contended that sales tax revenue from electronic commerce could be an important part of states revenue base and have opposed the administrations position the 105th congress considered six bills that would either temporarily or permanently suspend taxation of internet access and electronic commerce one bill the internet tax freedom act hr 4105 was passed by both houses of congress and was included as part of the fy1999 omnibus appropriations act pl 105277 this law creates three year moratorium on the ability of state and local governments to tax electronic commerce during this time an advisory commission on electronic commerce would examine this issue and report within two years back to the congress and the president on its findings of tax policy and electronic commerce it is likely that the 106th congress will monitor this issue and conduct additional oversight hearings in the coming year see also nonna noto internet tax bills in the 105th congress crs report 98509 21 august 1998 nonna noto internet tax freedom act hr 4105 as passed by the house crs report 98597 9 july 1998

single organization owns manages or controls the internet however the internet is not free the major costs of running the network are shared by its primary users universities national laboratories hightech corporations and governments 10 prepared by rita tehan information research specialist congressional reference division and glenn j mcloughlin specialist in technology and telecommunications policy science technology and medicine division crs22 the original network arpanet was created in the late 1960s its purpose was to allow defense contractors universities and department of defense staff working on defense projects to communicate electronically and to share the computing resources of the few powerful but geographically separate computers of the time by 1983 the term the internet came into use to describe the concept of interconnecting networks in 1985 the national science foundation nsf funded several national supercomputer centers with the intention of making these supercomputer centers available to the research community in universities across the country many state and regional universities had already developed local and regional networks the nsf funded network linking the five original supercomputer centers and offered to let any of the regional and university computer centers that could physically reach this network connect to it this was the seed of the internet network as we know it today and the original reason to connect to it was for remote access to supercomputer facilities in november 1987 nsf awarded contract to several private sector firms and the state of michigan to upgrade and operate the nsf network nsfnet backbone the purpose of the nsfnet backbone by this time was to link the growing regional networks set up by various university systems in 1990 arpanet ceased operation because nsfnet and various midlevel networks sponsored by nsf made the internet viable for commercial traffic dod continues to run military network number of universities linked to the nsfnet to gain access to the supercomputers but besides research they found that the network was useful for electronic mail file transfer and news groups the traffic on the network rose fairly dramatically in may 1993 nsf radically altered the architecture of the internet because the government wanted to get out of the backbone business in its place nsf designated series of network access points naps where private commercial backbone operators could interconnect in 1994 nsf announced that four naps would be built in san francisco new york chicago and washington dc on april 30 1995 the nsfnet backbone was essentially shut down and the nap architecture became the internet the internet backbone the first level of connection to the internet now known as veryhighspeed backbone network services vbns is maintained by ibm corp mci communications and merit nonprofit organization owned by 11 public universities in michigan internet access is also provided via internet service providers such as america online mci sprint mindspring att netcom earthlink concentric sprynet and microsoft network in october 1996 president clinton proposed the next generation internet ngi initiative this is plan to build national network that connects universities and federal research organizations at rates 100 to 1000 times faster than todays internet seed money for development of the network will go to dod the department of energy the national aeronautics and space administration and nsf the first goal of the ngi initiative is to research develop and experiment with advanced network technologies that will provide dependability diversity security crs23 and realtime capability for applications the second goal of the ngi initiative is the development of the next generation network testbed this effort will overcome todays speed bumps that slow endtoend usable connectivity the slowing is caused by incompatibilities in performance capabilities federal agencies supporting the ngi are now creating high performance distributed laboratory consisting of 100 sites at universities federal research institutions and other research partners the first goal is to achieve computing speeds in excess of 100 times that of todays internet it will serve as testbed for hardware software protocols security and network management second the federal ngi effort will develop ultrahighspeed switching and transmission technologies and endtoend network connectivity at more than 1 gigabit per second such networks will be highrisk pioneering networks limited to 10 ngi sites at speeds 1000 times faster than todays internet many agencies and research universities are already working on related communications projects including the less ambitious internet2 i2 project the i2 was started in 1996 by 30 universities and piggybacks on network that the nsf uses to connect the countrys federal supercomputer centers the i2 networks top speed currently is about 100 times the speed of the public internet the i2 project is slated to provide highcapacity communications links among the 100 top research universities that run the project many of these universities receive extensive government grants for technology research clinton administration officials contend that it is likely that every major city in the united states will have its own i2 connection or gateway within the next 5 years the internet offers almost limitless possibilities for the free communication of ideas research and information however the internet is not free some of the networks are partially funded by certain government agencies especially the nsf and other science agencies for use by scientists researchers and the education community still the major costs of running the network are shared by its primary users universities national laboratories hightech corporations and governments each institution organization corporation or individual with access to the internet purchases that access the internet also depends on cooperation and it is difficult to guarantee consumer privacy document authenticity or protection from unwanted advertising messages or information the national infrastructure protection center nipc whose mandate is to detect prevent and respond to cyber and physical attacks on us computer systems will have links to other government departments such as defense state and treasury as well as to local and international police agencies see the section information infrastructure and national security one area of concern is how accessible the internet will be to the poor and less educated many people cannot afford computer and modem and in remote areas some users pay longdistance telephone charges to gain access to the internet individuals who do not have access through libraries school or work may miss opportunities to retrieve useful information and to participate in an electronic community many policymakers are
