example the agencys supplement to the far 8 an offeror is business that submits bid or proposal that is an offer in response to solicitation the websites are listed on the federal busi ness opportunities fedbizopps hurricane recovery vendor information page at httpwwwfedbizoppsgovkatrinahtml after an agency has determined its require ments for particular goods or services it issues solicitation which is request to interested companies to submit offers or quotations to the government3 if the agency is using sealed bid procedures the solicitation is called an invitation for bid ifb for negotiated procurements the solicitation is called re quest for proposal rfp4 with some exceptions solicitations that exceed 25000 are posted on the federal business pportunitie s fedbizopps website at httpwwwfedbizoppsgov which is the single pointofentry for federal government contr acting opportunities5 posting solicitations on this website is consistent with and supports the federa l governments policy of fu ll and open competition which means that all responsible sour ces are permitted to compete6 businesses interested in competing for the opportunity to be awarded contract must prepare their proposals according to at minimu m information and instructions provided in the solicitation and the federal acquisition regulation far7 in addition to identifying the procuring agency solicitation describes the services or items to be purchased identifies the evaluation factors that will be used in selecting source stipulates the format nd contents of proposals references applicable contract clauses and provides due date for the submission of offers8 agency officials review and evaluate bids and proposals select one or more contractors to do the work and award the contracts after contractor has beg work agency personnel then administer and monitor the contract other than full and open competition several key characteristics of this process change when an agency conducts procurement under other than full and open competition which is popularly referred to as sole source or bid contracting notably instead of posting solicitation on the fedbizopps website agency personnel provide the solicitation to one or morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22280crs3 9 far 63021 63027 statutory authority for other than full and open competition is found in 41 usc 253c

93 288 42 usc 51215206 directs that preference be given to the extent feasible and practicable to bus inesses and individuals from the affected areas17 conclusion depending on the condition and needs of local cities in the affected area and the pace of recovery the federal govern ments contracting efforts might continue to include sole source contracting in addition to full nd open competition for the foreseeable future monitoring several relevant federal government website s possibly could increase the chance of finding solicitations applicable to particular company or industry
