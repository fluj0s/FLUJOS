transferring aspects of transmission re source planning and re tail rate design away from the states this report will be updated as events warrant background the electric utility industry has been in the process of transformation during the past two decades technology improvements changes in the economics for generating electricity and new federal ws and regulations have changed the nature of electric generation and created wholesale markets for electricity as result competition is occurring on the wholesale level and more than half of the states are moving toward retail competition between 1989 and 2000 wholesal trade of power nearly tripled to represent 40 of the total electricity supply congress continues to face the issue of how much to intervene to ensure that functioni ng markets are operating throughout the united states as result of mandate in the energy policy act of 1992 epact1the federal energy regulatory commission ferc issu ed order 888 and its companion order

unfair discriminatory business practices as result order 2000 attempted to address remaining issues related to nondiscriminatory access to the w holesale transmission system3 the order encourages transmission owners to join regional tran smission organizations rtos that would maintain independent grid oversight and eliminate utilities ability to exert control over transmission lines ferc has approved thr ee rtos the midwest independent system operator miso rto west and pjm inte rconnection llc seve ral other rtos have been conditionally approved by ferc4 however many have asserted that discrimination still exists in wholesale electric markets and that wholesale electric market design is needed to provide level playing field for all market participants accordin g to ferc many recent cases demonstrate that discrimination still occurs in the wholesale electric markets transmission owners favor their own generation inconsistent transmission rules exist that allow utilities to limit some transactions while lowering costs for ot hers different tariffs and rules between areas increase costs for interregional bulk power transfers and vertically integrated utilities can interrupt their competitors transmission transactions to address system reliability while protecting their own affiliates generation and transmission flows5 notice of proposed rulemaking on july 31 2002 ferc issued notice of proposed rulemaking nopr on standard market design s md docket rm01120006 fercs stated goal of establishing smd requirements in conjunction with standa rdized transmission service is to create seamless wholesale power markets that allow sellers to transact easily across transmission grid boundaries currently seam s issues occur when there are different transmission rules and power market rules across public utility or regional transmission organization boundary under the smd bilatera l contracts would form the basis of the power market these contracts would be suppl emented with spot market for energy and ancillary services the proposed rulemaki ng would create new tariff under which each transmission owner would be required to turn over operati on of its transmission system to an unaffiliated independent transmission provider itp the itp which could be anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21407crs3 7 locational marginal pricing determines electri city prices at each

york et v federal energy re gulatory commission that challenged fercs authority under order 888 to regulate transmission for retail sales if u tility unbundles transmission from other retail charges in states that have opened their generation market to competition bundling occurs when customers are charged separately for generation transmission and distribu tion nine states led by new york filed suit arguing that the federal power act gives ferc jurisdiction over wholesale sales and interstate transmission and leaves all retail issues up to the state utility commissions enron argued that ferc clearly s jurisdiction over all transmission and ferc is obligated to prevent transmission owners from discriminating against those wishing to use the transmission lines on march 4 2002 the us s upreme court ruled in favor of ferc and held that ferc has jurisdiction over transmission in cluding unbundled retail transactions the ruling is available at httpa257gakamaitec

marginal pricing7 the nopr comment period originally wa s 75 days november 15 2002 but the comment period was extended to january 10 2003 for the following issues1 market design for the western interconnection 2 transmission planning and pricing including participant funding 3 regi onal state advisory committees and state participation 4 resource adequacy and 5 congestion reve nue rights and transition issues ferc expects to release white paper in apr il 2003 that outlines public input to the nopr the final rule is expected to be published in midsummer 2003 public utility commissioners from 19 states alabama arkansas california colorado georgia idaho kentucky l ouisiana mississippi new mexico new hampshire north carolina south carolin oregon south carolina south dakota tennessee virginia and washington ve voiced opposition to fercs smd proposal most of the commissioners concerns are on the grounds that ferc usurps state authority by transferring aspects of transmission re source planning and re tail rate design away from the states8 other critics have asserted th at the nopr does not take into account regional differences and sees the standard ma rket design proposal as onesizefitsall approach as result these critics predict that the smd would lead to the export of cheap power to regions with higher electricity costs fercs asserti on of jurisdiction over all transmission including service to bundled retail customers is based on the recent supreme court decision in new york v ferc 9 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21407crs4 10 ferc defines market power as the ability to raise prices above the competitive level either through physical withholding or economic withholding 11 ferc proposes that scheduling system contro l and dispatch services reactive supply

for fercs ongoing effort to remedy undue discrimination in the use of the nations inte rstate high voltage transmission system in order to create truly competitive bulk power market supporters argue that the smd would make it easier and cheaper to transfer electricity between regions and prevent incumbent u tilities from preventing access to transmission lines that they own in general the industr has been in favor of fercs smd proposal but some industry groups have voiced cerns about the implementation of smd selected issues power markets and market po wer monitoring and mitigation10 fercs concept of standard market design relie s on bilateral contract s between buyers and sellers to satisfy the bulk of electricity mand in region under the nopr independent transmission providers would be required to operate dayahead and realtime energy markets to handle generation imbalances and ancillary services11 the itp would determine single marketclearing price for energy transmission service and ancillary services at each node for the next day based on bids ancillary services would be bid on an hourly basis while energy prices in the realtime market would be determined at each node for each 5minute period under the federal power act ferc is charge d with establishing just and reasonable rates for electricity costo fservice rate regulation has evolved to depend on market forces to set prices in an efficient ma rket with many buyer s and sellers who cannot individually influence price the value of additional supplies and conservation should be reflected in the price however ferc recognizes that the electricity market has not reached this stage in the nopr ferc notes two significant structural flaws in the current electricity markets the lack of priceres ponsive demand and generation concentration in transmissi onconstrained load pockets in the nopr ferc proposes to create market monitoring unit mmu that would implement measures to approximate an outcome that compe titive marketplace would produce the mmu would report directly to ferc as well as to each governing board of the independent transmission provider ferc proposes three mandatory components of market power mitigation as well as voluntary fourth measure to assure that ma rket power does not result in high prices first in areas where generators are concentr ated and transmission constraints exist the itp will enter into participating generator agreement under such an agreement the generator would be required to provide all its available energy to the grid during

would specify bid cap for the ergy or ancillary services provided under such conditions second the spot market w ould be constrained by safetynet bid cap of 1000 per megawatt hour third the nopr requires resource adequacy requirement see following section fourth during times when market power may be exerted the nopr calls for mechanism to determine whether high prices are the result of generators withholding power resource adequacy while most of the nopr deals with the transmission system it also addresses the issue of relia ble supply of electric ity the nopr addresses the concern that combination of spot ma rket and price cap will not provide enough incentives to invest in additional gene rating capacity ferc proposes that resource adequacy be determined on regional basis and 12 minimum reserve margin be adopted12 historically reserve margins for large utilities have averaged 1820 and utilities have determined their own reserve margin levels13 while 12 reserve margin is considered by some to be too low to maintain reliable electric system the nopr requires that the regional state advisory committee determine the appropriate reserve margin for the region ferc asserts that singleutility forecasting is inadequate and more regional approach needs to be taken any entity that uses the transmission system would be required to satisfy portion of th regional resources adequacy requirement by selfgeneration local di stributed generation or firm bilate ral contracts for power that are backed by specific generating units ferc proposes to enforce the resource adequacy requirement with both penalties and load curtailment transmission resource planning in addition to generation resource planning taking place on regional level ferc propos that transmission resource planning would be regional process regional pl anning is necessary ferc asserts because certain issues such as loop flow cannot be addressed on the local level also certain transmission expansion projects that are needed to maintain reliability may not be financially attractive to private investors the nopr identifies three components of transmission planning first the independent transmission providers woul d establish mechanism for regional transmission planning that would include id entifying all additional transmission needed for both reliability and economic needs s econd the itps would be required to issue requests for proposals when regional pla nning process identif ies that additional resources are needed responses to reque st for proposals could include expansion of the grid addition of generation including di stributed generation or the implementation of demand response if the bidding pro cess is not successful the itp could require transmission owners to expand or upgrade the transmission system although formal studies have been completed the environm ental protection agency epa in its comments to ferc expressed concern that the smds encouragement of demandhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21407crs6 14 comments of the us environmental prot ection agency to ferc docket rm 0112 ferc accession number 200211150345 november 15 2002 15 congestion revenue rights

commentsnoprtranscript120302pdfresponse technologies to deal with cong estion could increase overall emissions by providing economic incentives for operating highemitting backup diesel generators14 the third transmission planning component would require the itp to determine if any proposed projects could be combined to wer costs for projects that would serve an entire region all ratepayers would pay fo r expansion of the transmission system under the nopr ferc would allow partic ipant funding of expansion projects if the itp could determine and assi gn costs to those that bene fit from particular project those in favor of participant funding argue that it is necessary to prevent native load customers from paying for transmission upgra des needed to export power out of the region those opposed to participant fundi ng argue that everyone benefits from transmission upgrades by decreasing congesti on and that it is virtually impossible to assign costs associated with transmission upgrades congestion management congestion on the transmission system would be managed with combination of locational marginal pricing see footnote 7 and congestion revenue rights crrs15 transmission system congestion prevents the cheapest power from reaching all locations on the grid where buyers want power delivered lmp is marketbased method for congestion manage ment and depends on the redispatch of energy to avoid constraints the cost of redispatch is the basis for the congestion charges under lmp lmps effec tiveness depends on co mplex software to manage the markets crrs is system of financial rights to use the transmission system that is expected to protect customers against congestion costs the holder of crrs would be able to receive congestion revenues in dayahead market any congestion costs that holder pays would be offset by its congestion revenue16 ferc also expects crrs to provide incentives to regions to build necessary transmission capacity currently utilities use physical reservation system to gain access to the transmission network during four year transition period ferc proposes flexible system either to allocate crrs to customers with the existing contracts or to auction such rights at the end of the fouryear period all independent transmission providers would be required to auction their crrs rto west has expressed concern that the transition period may not be long enough for certain regions and that the conversion to crrs should be voluntary17 on the other hand groups such as the electric power s upply association epsa and the industrial energy consumer group argued at ferc s december 3 2002 technical conference that auctions are critical to establishing forward market to hedge against volatility
