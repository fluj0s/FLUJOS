united states injunctive relief is the usual remedy that courts authorize to prevent violation of this patent right howeve r as the recent blackberry patent litigation demonstrated the desirability of

the united states supreme court unanimously vacated the appellate courts judgment and remanded the case to the district court according to the opinion di strict courts have equitable discretion to award injunctive relief and such decision is reviewable on appeal only for abuse of that discretion the court explained that the four equitable considerations that traditionally govern the grant of an injunction apply to the same degree in patent cases as in other areas of law despite the unanimity of the ebay court the two concurring opinions reveal an apparent disagreement among the justices one concurrence observes that courts have granted injunctive relief to the patent holder in the vast majority of patent cases and thus courts should respect this hi storical practice the other concurrence suggests that the recent emergence of patent holding companies and the suspect validity of some businessme thod patents are appr opriate considerations for court to bear in mind when applying the

the right to exclude granted to the patentee would ve only fraction of the value it was intended to have and would longer be as great an incentive to engage in the toils of scientific and t echnological research15 each application for patent consists of two primary parts 1 specification which is written description of the inve ntion enabling those skilled in the art to practice the invention and 2 one or more cl aims that define the scope of the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention16 therefore these claims define the scope of the patentee s rights under the patent17 careful scrutiny of the claims is crucial to any infringement lawsuit as patent infringement will not be adjudged unless the alleged infringers actions have been determined to fall within the patent claims every patent infringement cas thus involves twostep analysis18 of each asserted patent claim first an interpretation and construction of the patent claim which is matter of law within the province of the court19 and second whether the claimed invention is being made used offered for sale sold or imported by the alleged infringer which is question of fact20 ebay inc v

district courts opinion on may 27 2003 jury returned verdict finding that ebay had willfully infringed mercexchanges patent and holding ebay liable for 105 million in damages24 the district court reduced the damages to 55 million but upheld the jurys finding of willf ul infringement however the court refused to issue an injunction against the internet auctioneer25 in making this decision to deny injunctive relief to the pa tent holder the district court considered four factors consistent with traditional equitable principles 1 whether the plaintiff will suffer irre parable harm if an injunction does not issue 2 whether the plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law 3 whether the balance of hardships tips in the plaintiffs favor and 4 whether an injunction is in the public interest26 first the court believed that mercexch ange would not be irreparably harmed because of evidence of its willingness to li cense its patents its lack of commercial activity in practicing the patents and its comments to the media that it desired to obtain royalties rather than an injuncti on second the court noted that monetary damages served as an adequate remedy at law in this case third the balance of hardships tipped slightly in ebays favor because in part the plaintiff exists solely to license its patents or sue to enforce its patents and not to develop or commercialize them any harm suffered by the plaintiff by the defendants infringement of the patents can be recovered by way of damages27 the court also noted that since ebay would probably atte mpt to design around the patent claims any injunction would be opening pandora s box of new problems at considerable litigation cost to the parties as well as strain on judicial resources finally the court stated that the public interest factor equally supports both parties the court identified growing concern over the issu ance of businessmet hod patents within the congress and the us patent and tradem ark office that have called into question the validity of such patents although the court acknowledged that this fourth factor usually favors the patentee out of an interest in maintaining the integrity of the patent system this public interest w ould not necessarily be furthere d in this case where the patentee does not prac tice its patents28httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33429crs5 29 under 28 usc 1295 the united states cour t of

affirmed the jurys verdict on the finding of infringement30 however the appellate court ruled that mercexchange was entitled to an injunction to prevent further infringement by ebay finding inadequate the district c ourts reasons for refusing to issue an injunction31 according to the federal circuit court because the right to exclude recognized in patent is but the essence of the concept of property the general rule is that permanent injunction will issue once infringement and validity have been adjudged32 although the appellate c ourt recognized rare exception to that general rule such as when patentees failure to practice the patented invention frustrates an important public need for the invention33 it stated that the district court had failed to offer any persuasive reason to believe this case is sufficiently exceptional to justify the denial of permanent injunction34 the federal circuit court deemed irreleva nt the district courts general concern for the validity of business method patents or the likeli hood of continuing litigation the appellate court also viewed as inappropr iate the district courts several references to mercexchange as an entity that only exis ts to license its patents because such business strategy does not diminish patent rights injunctions are not reserved for patentees who intend to practice their patents as opposed to those who choose to license th statutory right to exclude is equally available to both groups and the right to an adequate remedy to enforce that right should be equally available to both as well35 on november 28 2005

position on whether permanent injunctive relief should or should not issu in this particular case38 the court clarified that the traditional principles of equity that govern issuance of injunctive relief apply with equal force to disputes ar ising under the patent act39 thus dispelling any notion that patent disputes are subject to different standards than those applicable to cases arising under other areas of law district court s decision to grant or deny injunctive relief is reviewable on appeal under an abuse of discretion standard the court stated40 however according to justice clarence thomas the author of the opinion of the court neither of the lower courts had fairly applied the traditional equitable principles in determining wh ether injunctive relief should or should not issue in this case41 the district court had erred by imp roperly suggesting that injunctive relief was categorically unavailable in cases where patent holders only license their patents rather than commercialize the invention themselves some patent holders such as university researchers or selfmade inventors might reasonably prefer to license their patents rather than undertake efforts to secure the financing necessary to bring their works to market themselves such patent holders may be able to satisfy th traditional fourfactor test and we see basis for categorically denying them the opportunity to do so42 on the other hand the appellate cour t was incorrect in pronouncing rule unique to patent cases that strongly favor ed injunctions when infringement has been adjudged the court explained while acknow ledging that the patent act grants the patent holder the right to exclude others from performing the five acts that constitute patent infringement justice thomas observed that the cr eation of right is distinct from the provision of remedies fo r violations of that right43 in elaboration of this point justice anthony kennedy in concu rring opinion wrote the existence of right to exclude does not dictate the re medy for violation of that right44 therefore the federal circuits general ru is unjustifiable justice thomas saidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33429crs7 45 ebay

considerations with ru that almost categorically mandated injunctive relief following determination of infringement45 the court explained that its treatment of injunctive relief for patent cases is consistent with its approach towards injunctions in copyright infringement cases for example the court cited new york times co v tasini copyright case in which the court refused to adopt rule that injunc tions must automatically issue upon finding of copyright infringement46 the concurrences two concurring opinions written by chief justice john roberts jr and justice ant hony kennedy were filed in ebay and reveal an apparent disagreement among the justices chief ju stice roberts concurring opinion joined by justices antonin scalia and ruth bader ginsburg noted that from at least the early 19th century courts have granted injunctive relief upon finding of infringement in the vast majority of patent cases this long tradition of equity practice is not surpri sing given the difficulty of protecting right to exclude through monetary remedies that allow an infringer to use an invention against the patentees wishes difficulty that often implicates the first two factors of the traditional fourfactor test this historical practice as the court holds does not entitle patentee to permanent injunction or justify general rule that such injunctions should issue at the same time there is difference between exercising equitable discretion pursuant to the established fourfactor test and writing on an entirely clean slate47 the implication of this concurrence is that chief justice roberts and the two justices joining him would likely expect injunctive relief to be the usual remedy for patent infringement consistent with the long tradition of equity practice district courts equitable disc retion in granting or denying an injunction in patent cases therefore is not unfettered in th view of these three justices while agreeing with chief justice roberts concurrence that history may be instructive in applying the fourfactor test when the circumstances of patent case are similar to those of earlier cases justi ce kennedys concurring opinion joined by justices john paul stevens david sout er and stephen breyer suggested that historical practice might not necessarily be helpful for courts to follow when dealing with some patent infringement suits in the current business environment trial courts should bear in mind that in many instances the nature of the patent being enforced and the economic function of the patent holder present considerations quite unlike earlier cases48httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33429crs8 49 id 50 ebay 05130 slip op at 2 kennedy j concurring 51 for detailed analysis of many of the reforms proposed by hr 2795 see crs report rl32996 patent reform innovation issues by wendy h schacht and john r thomas 52 for comparison of patent protection in the these two industries see crs report rl33367 patent reform issues in the biomedical and software industries by wendy h schachtconcerning the economic function of the patent holder justice kennedy acknowledged the emergence of patent hol ding companies and their impact on patent litigation today an industry has developed in which fi rms use patents not as basis for producing and selling goods but instead pr imarily for obtaining licensing fees for these firms an injunction and the potentially serious sanctions arising from its violation can be employed as bargai ning tool to charge exorbitant fees to companies that seek to buy licenses to practice the patent when the patented invention is but small component of the product the companies seek to produce and the threat of an injunction is employed simply for undue leverage in negotiations legal damages may well be sufficient to compensate for the infringement and an injunction may not serve the public interest49 in elaborating his point regarding the nature of the patent being enforced justice kennedy stated injunctive relief may have different consequences for the burgeoning number of patents over business methods which were not of much economic and legal significance in earlier times the potential vagueness and suspect validity of some of these patents may affect the calculus under the fourfactor test50 the patent reform act of 2005 hr 2795 35 usc 283 permits court to grant injunctions in accordance with the principles of equity to prevent the viola tion of any right secured by patent on such terms as the court deems reasonable the patent reform act of 2005 hr 2795 currently being considered by the house subcommittee on courts the internet and intellectual property w ould among other matters51 amend this injunction provision to require that court in determining equity consider the fairness of the remedy in light of all the facts and the relevant interests of the parties associated with the invention although such express lang uage is supported by the information technology industry the pharmaceuti cal industry favors the status quo52 pharmaceutical companies consider in junctions to be critical to stopping infringement and encouraging investment in new drug research and development however typically only one or two patents cover drug whereas computer chip or other advanced technology products of ten incorporate hundreds or thousands of patented inventions

legislative consideration of hr 2795 congress may face these divergent opi nions over injunctive relief held by interested parties in diffe rent sectors of the economy in addition because this amendment was originally proposed in part to address concerns with the federal circuits general rule it remains to be seen whether the ebay decision affects the status of this provision of hr 2795 conclusion it is worth keeping in mind that jus tice thomas opinion was the opinion of the court in ebay and was joined by all of its members including justice samuel alito who did not join either of the concurren ces while justice kennedys concurrence raises skepticism over the validity of some businessmethod patents and implies patent holding companies may not be i rreparably harmed in the absence of an injunction this view did not receive the s upport of majority of the courts members and thus lacks the precedential value of the courts opinion s imilarly justice roberts concurrence which appears to favor injunctive relief except in rare instances received the endorsement of only tw other justices therefore despite the unanimity of the ebay court in invalidating the federal circuits general rule the division among the justices as evidenced by the concurrences may contribute to uncertainty among the lower courts regarding whether to apply historical practice or to consider technological legal and business developments that may affect the calculus of equity when determining whether to award injunctive relief in patent infringement cases
