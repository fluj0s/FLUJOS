finance division summary for centuries nations have accumulated gold as symbol of wealth and power gold was once also of practical value as medium of exchange and until recent times provided commodity backing to most paper currency recent decades have seen steady erosion of golds economic significance nevertheless the us government continues to hold sizable stock of gold what is this stock used for although there continues to be some confusion about the role of government agencies and other institutions with relation to the gold stock gold is little used the us mint the principal custodian of the governments gold holdings engages in minor gold transactions associated with producing and selling commemorative coins the federal reserve bank does not own or have market transactions in gold but it does facilitate the monetization of us gold holdings through its gold certificate account the exchange stabilization fund an agency of the treasury department longer undertakes actions that use gold and gold is not used as the basis of the treasurys special drawing rights the gold standard that established gold backing for the dollar ceased for domestic purposes in the 1930s and for international purposes in the 1970s the continued willingness of the us government to hold large underutilized stock of gold is perhaps best understood as hedge against times of severe economic crisis when paper assets could be useless this report will not be updated introduction in early 2002 the us government owned nearly 262 million fine troy ounces of gold1 that is about half the size of the stock held in the early postwar years steady reductions through the 1950s and 1960s brought the gold stock to its current size by the early 1970s there has been little change in the size of us gold holdings since that time the us has the largest public holdings of gold more than double the holdings of germany and the international monetary fund imf who have the second and third largest official gold holdings respectively httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21204crs2 2 this book value price was established in 1973 at its inception this price was meaningless vestige of the bretton woods system of international payments that had been effectively abandoned in 1971 but it remains the accounting convention for valuing us official gold the us gold stock is managed by the us mint bureau of the us treasury department the mints gold holdings are stored at seven locations around the country about 94 of the gold stock or about 245 million ounces is held in three deep storage facilities at fort knox ky west point ny and denver co much smaller amounts totaling about 9000 ounces are held among the mint in philadelphia pa at an offsite warehouse and the us mint headquarters in washington in addition to mint holdings the federal reserve banks new york branch holds about 13 million ounces of gold for the treasury the vast majority of the us gold stock or about 259 million ounces is in the form of bullion and the remainder or about 3 million ounces is in gold coins by law the us gold stock is valued on the governments books at 4222 per ounce for total value of slightly more than 11 billion in early 2002 2 the current free market value of the us gold stock would be about 77 billion at market price of gold of 300 per ounce table 1 us official gold holdings at book value in millions of dollars 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 11048 11047 11047 11046 11048 11046 source us treasury department what is the us gold stock used for the short answer is not very much for clarity however let us examine several government operations including some that are sometimes thought to use gold the us mint if one looks at the data on gold stock holdings of the us mint one will see that the size of the gold stock while generally stable does fluctuate slightly this small movement occurs in component of the us gold stock called the working stock this is gold that is acquired and used to make various commemorative coins mandated by the us congress to honor people places and historical events eg recent issue commemorates the 2002 winter olympic games gold is purchased it is transformed into coins and the coins are sold to the public as these transactions occur the gold stock will fluctuate accordingly fluctuations in the working stock amount to only one or two million dollars each year the us mints gold holdings are audited each year by the department of the treasurys office of inspector generalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21204crs3 the federal reserve the federal reserve system owns gold and conducts official transactions using gold the fed does hold gold for others however as noted above the fed holds small amount of gold for the treasury but it also holds stock of what is called earmarked gold that is held in custody for other official entities such as foreign governments and central banks earmarked gold is all held at the new york branch of the fed and is not counted as part of the official us gold stock it is valued at the us official price of 4222 and currently totals nearly 9 billion the stock of earmarked gold has fallen substantially in recent years possible source of confusion about the feds use of gold is the gold certificate account on the feds balance sheet currently valued at 1104 billion this account comprises certificates that have been issued to the fed by the treasury and each is backed by an amount of the gold held by the treasury for each gold certificate issued the fed in turn credits the treasurys deposit account at the fed by an amount priced at the statutory gold price of 4222 per ounce through this intragovernmental transaction the treasury acquires cash backed by an otherwise idle asset this practice is called monetizing the gold stock and occurs without the government selling or lending any of its gold stock on the open market nor is ownership or control of any of the gold stock transferred from the treasury to the fed the treasury has in effect created an intra governmental mortgage on its gold holding to gain an improved liquidity position currently the us gold stock is fully monetized with the feds gold certificate account equal to the legal value of the official us gold stock or about 11 billion if the treasury acquires more gold then more gold certificates could be issued if gold holdings fall the treasury must redeem an equal value of gold certificates from the fed reducing the treasurys deposit at the central bank if the rule for valuing the gold holdings changes eg an increase in the official 4222 price so could the level of gold certificates because the gold stock does not exhibit much fluctuation in volume or value neither does the feds gold certificate account this is the feds only operational link to the gold stock and it does not involve any market transaction in gold the exchange stabilization fund the exchange stabilization fund esf is an agency of the us treasury created in 1934 to stabilize the exchange value of the dollar on world markets in recent years the esf has also been used to fund foreign economic support programs the resources of the esf include dollar denominated assets eg cash and treasury securities assets denominated in foreign currencies eg euro and yen and special drawing rights sdr it uses these assets to buy and sell in foreign exchange markets with the intent of influencing the dollar and other currencies international exchange value over its history the esf has dealt in gold but has not owned or transacted in gold since 1978 possible source of confusion over the esfs connection to gold is the use of the sdr holdings the sdr is an artificial international reserve asset that was created by the international monetary fund imf in 1969 and allocated to each member to supplement its international reserves the value of the sdr was once based on the price of gold but is now determined in reference to basket of international currencies while the sdr was at one time referred to as paper gold it does not represent any claim on gold held by thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21204crs4 3 an act to define and fix the standard of value to maintain the parity of all forms of money issued or coined by the united states to refund the public debt and for other purposes 301 stat 45 march 1900 also known as the gold standard actimf or any of its members by law the esf is the holder of the us allocation of sdrs in practice the us has little need for the sdr to settle its international payments but it does make use of its sdr assets by transforming them into more liquid and more useable form in maneuver similar to the treasurys use of its gold holdings the esf has relationship with the fed that allows it to monetize its sdr assets in an amount up to the current dollar value of the sdr holdings the esf can issue to the fed an sdr certificate that is claim against the sdr assets the fed in turn transfers to the esf dollar denominated asset eg cash or treasur securities which the esf can spend more readily in its foreign exchange dealings sdr certificates will then appear as an asset on the feds balance sheet but as liability on the esfs balance sheet the esfs use of this arrangement increases and decreases with its need for dollar denominated assets if the need for such assets falls the esf will buy the sdr certificates back from the fed exchanging cash or treasury securities for the sdr certificate in the mid 1990s the esf had fully monetized its sdr holdings generating an sdr certificate account worth about 92 billion in recent years however with few liquidity problems the esf has moved to reduce its sdr certificate obligations steadily buying those certificates back from the fed bringing the account balance down to 22 billion in 2001 the fed in turn has received an inflow of cash and treasury securities and an outflow of sdr certificates these transactions are purely internal to the us government do not affect any private market and do not involve any transactions in gold the gold standard the current us monetary system is based on the use of paper money that is backed only by the full faith and credit of the federal government this so called fiat currency is not valued in or convertible to gold or any other precious commodity this has not always been the case over most of its history the us has been on some type of metallic standard paper money proliferated under these metallic standards but was most often valued and redeemable in some amount of gold or silver by 1879 true gold standard emerged in which the us currency was effectively valued and convertible exclusively in terms of gold the gold standard act of 1900 marked the official adoption of gold standard valuing the currency at 2067 per ounce of gold3 the pure gold standard ended with the great depression in 1933 the federal government faced severe banking crisis with high risk of widespread runs on banks and in turn on the gold stock another economic problem needing resolution at this time was that adherence to the gold standard for international payments precluded pursuing the policy of strong monetary stimulus that the econom needed to help break the grip of economic depression monetary stimulus lowers interest rates and this would tend to accelerate the export of gold as investors look for higher yields abroad in addition the creation of more currency would tend to undermine confidence in the convertibility of dollars into gold together these forces would make it more difficult to maintain the dollarhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21204crs5 4 gold reserve act of 1934 48 stat 337 january 1934 5 an act to provide for amendment of the bretton woods agreement act 90 stat 2660 october 1976 at its legal gold value maintaining the gold standard imparted strong contractionary bias to domestic economic policy what emerged in 1934 was what has been called quasi gold standard the dollar was devalued in its gold content to 35 per ounce this devaluation in the gold value of the dollar gave the fed some room for applying monetary stimulus to the struggling economy however convertibility into gold applied only for official international transactions domestic convertibility was ended and ownership of all gold bullion and coin was vested in the treasury secretary4 this quasi gold standard endured into the 1970s in practice only limited amounts of gold were transferred under this system since countries largely relied on currencies that were readily convertible into foreign exchange to settle payment balances in the post world war ii era of rapidly expanding international trade the currency of choice was most often the dollar however us economic policies over this period led to such substantial accumulation of foreign holdings of dollars that confidence in convertibility to gold at the legal par value was ultimately undermined the us government steadily moved away from redeeming dollars for gold in international transactions attempts to reconstitute this system failed in early 1973 the treasury devalued the dollar to 4222 per ounce but attempt was made to maintain the new parity and the dollar was left to float in its international value as it continues to do today in 1975 citizens were again allowed to own gold in 1976 the government officially removed the definition of the dollar in terms of gold from statute5 conclusion for the last 30 years the public gold stock has not played any important role in the domestic or international monetary affairs of the nation events had steadily pushed the government to the realization that tying the currency to gold had proved to be significant impediment to providing the liquidity growing economy needed and exposed the economy to periodic crises moreover it was becoming clear that maintaining stable monetary conditions ie keeping inflation low did not hinge on linking of the currency to gold gold while not actively used as monetary medium does remain significant reserve asset for the united states particularly if valued at the much higher market price however the us has shown inclination to substantially increase or decrease its gold holdings over the last 30 years in the mid1990s several european governments did sell off some of their gold holdings in an effort as they saw it to make better use of an underutilized asset but this practice largely ended in 1999 when most major central banks agreed to limit gold sales to more than 400 tons per year for the five years ending inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21204crs6 6 an agreement reached in washington dc by the european central bank and the central banks of 14 european countries on september 26 1999 2004 that agreement is also reaffirmation by these nations of an ongoing commitment to holding sizable reserves of gold6 why continue to hold an asset that would not seem to be earning the highest possible financial return one can conjecture that most nations still see gold as the ultimate form of payment and therefore holding significant amounts of gold will continue as lastditch hedge against economic catastrophe in times of severe crisis fiat money could be shunned while gold is always likely to be accepted
