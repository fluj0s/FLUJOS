intercha nge fee is paid by the merchants bank to cardholders bank that issued the card after the cardhol der purchases goods or services with payment credit or debit card merchants and cardholde rs asserts that they must accept excessive and increasing interchange fees set by the card associations such as visa and mastercard and member cardi ssuing banks interchange fees have been rising since the 1990s despite diminishing fraud losses and technological advances in communications that lower the costs of accessing the electronic payment system merchants argue that the card associations have not negotiated these fees with them but instead present the fees as take it or leave it offers economists who have studied the paym ent card markets attribute the higher interchange fees to the nature and structure of the market this is not the traditional market they point out but twosided market where suppliers compete for two types of customers with different demand responses like newspaper that must attract both readers and advertisers in the payment card market banks must attract cardholders and merchants and transfer of revenues is usually necessary to provide cardissuing banks an incentive to issue more cards which provide more payment card users to merchants this is similar to newspapers where the lower the subscription rates the higher the readersh ip and the higher th advertiser revenues for payment card system that needs more cardholders to achieve the optimal benefits to cardholders and merchants more revenue tr ansfers may be needed to offset the cost of issuing more cards to cardholders there could be cases however where the revenue transfers are excessive which would mean that the interchange fees are providing excess profits to issuer banks potential issue relates to possibly imposing legal or regulatory caps on the interchange fees the associations and issuing banks receive as in the case of australia and the united kingdom specifica lly the concern is whether there is mechanism that will be used to make sure that merchants lower their prices to pass the excess revenues back to the cardholders in countries where interchange fees are capped the governments have been relying on merchants to voluntarily lower prices yet there is formal evidence that merchants have lowered their prices because of the lower interchange fee caps this report

payment card interchange fees which we re paid without contention for almost seven decades are now the source of controversy an interchange fee is paid by the merchants bank to cardholders bank t hat issued the card after the cardholder purchases goods or services with paymen t credit or debit card house judiciary chairman john conyers jr has establishe d congressional task force to look into interchange fees because so merchant and consumer groups have complained that these fees are cutting into merchants pr ofits and are costing the cardholders and non cardholders who ultimately pay the fee in the price of the goods or services1 according to chairman conyers in 2005 u s families paid an average of more than 300 for hidden interchange fees in cluding households that do not even use credit cards2 another source estimated that in 2007 retail merchants in the united states will pay banks issuing visa and mastercard payment cards more than 30 billion in collectively set per transaction interchange fees3 at issue are increases in interchange fees set by the credit card associations like visa and mastercard and cardissuing banks or companies like discover and american express to enable merchants to gain access to the associations and issuers electronic payment network interchange fees have been rising since the 1990s despite diminishing fraud losses and technological advances in co mmunications that lowered the costs of accessing the electronic payment system4 merchants argue that the card associations have not negotiated these fees with them but

customers with different elasticities of demand good example is newspaper that mu st attract both readers and advertisers to optimize output in both markets the equilibri um price depends on the price elasticities of demand of customers on both sides the networ k effect and the marginal costs resulting from changing output on each side in this example newspapers usually provide newspapers to readers below their marginal production and distribution costs in order to build sufficient readerships to attract advertisers raising the subscription rates for the newspaper will not only lead to fewer readers but also less advertising revenues because revenues are function of the number of readers the twosided market limits firms ability to retain excess profit monopoly newspa per might be able to increase subscription rates to readers but in doing so it might have to compete away its profits to attract advertising revenues twosided markets differ from ordinary markets in most markets price collusion generally leads to harm to c onsumers by enabling competitors to restrict output and raise prices twosided mark ets cannot be presumed to behave anti competitively based on the assumptions applied to standard markets but they can be anti competitive nonetheless see steve semeraro credit card interchange fees three decades of antitrust uncertainty thomas jefferson school of

this structure they have identified two conditions that combined could lead to hi gh interchange fees the conditions are where the payment card issuers have market power and merchant s have an inelastic demand for accepting payment cards6 some commentators note that if it is determined that interchange fees are excessive as result of issuing banks marketing power those circumstances could lead to the government imposing legal or regulatory caps on interchange fees as was the case in australia and the united kingdom related questions have been raised concerning the mechanism the government might use to induce merchants to lower their prices and pass the excess revenues back to the cardholders7 in these two countries the pass back of the fees through price reduction has been voluntary and there is formal evidence that merchants lowered their prices8 this report focuses on the visa and ma stercard card associations that account for threefourths of the payment card ma rket with visa accounting for 44 and mastercard accounting for 31 of the market in the united states in 20089 the report does not discuss unitary payment card systems such as american express and discover

secti on is an analysis of the problem of the optimum level of payment cards to achieve the highest social welfare benefit for cardholders and merchants the third sec tion discusses the provisions of the credit card fair free act of 2008 hr 5546 and the last section discusses the implications of the analysis the cost structure in payment card transaction there are several components of cost in payment card transaction when consumer makes purchase with paym ent card the merchants account at the merchants bank the acquirer bank is cr edited with the purchase amount less an amount called the merchant discount fee the merchant discount fee consists of flat rate in the amount ranging from fe w cents to dollar or percentage amount of the purchase the total fees usually ra nge from 1 to 3 but could be as high as 15 for merchants who are of high risk because of low transaction volume limited credit history or the nature of their business10 the acquirer bank retains part of the merchant discount fee and th remainder is remitted to th network association the interchange fee is this remittance to the network association the remittance to the card issuer is also called the interchange fee the network association that receives the remittance from the acquiring bank keeps small portion of it for the costs of authorization clearing and settling the tran saction the association remits the rest to the issuer bank to cover the costs of funding the purchase chargebacks returns and fraud risks the network association sets the interc hange rates annually the level of the fees charged by the network is partially based on the interchang rate which is set by the issuing and acquirer banks thus th merchant discount f ee is the interchange rate plus an additional pe rcentage taken by the ac quirer bank however the interchange rate does not vary much on the basis of the cost of the transaction it varies mainly on the merchant s type and the level of bundled reward points attached to particular payment card as mentione d above the merchants discount fee varies by the merchants risk profile and the acquirer bank profit component of the fee overall the interchange rates are lower in stable lowmargin industries like groceries and higher in small volume highrisk businesses like adult internet websites merchant restraints explicit costs in the visa or mastercard association network reflect the associations rules these rules include merchant restraints that are designed to increase card usage at the expense of all other types of payments and to maintain higher interchange rates 1 merchants are forbidden to impose surcharge for the use of payment credit or debit cards surcharge rule even though card transactions cost merchants more than so other payment methods the effect ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34647crs4 to prevent merchants from passing on the cost of the payment card directly to their customers who use the card which would gi ve their customers disincentive to use the card thus the merchants absorb the payment card transaction costs 2 merchants are required to ta ke all credit cards bearing the card association brand honorallcards rule and they are require d to accept these cards at all outlets all outlets rule in addition 3 merchant s are prohibited from offering discounts to particular types of cards nondifferentiation rule th rules prevent merchants from operating at overall minimum cost because the rules force them to accept all all or none rule the associations cards even though different cards have different costs attached to them to summarize the description of the mechanism figure 1 shows an example in which the merchant discount fee is 26 as set by the banks and the card association for this discount the mercha nt may attract cardholder customers and potentially higher sale volume guaranteed payments and reduced administration and accounting costs as well as increase checkout efficiency on the cardholder side the card issuer bank issues paymen t cards to cardholders at its own costs including card production and advertisemen ts in the beginning of card issuance cardholders paid an annual fees for most car ds today issuer banks are profitable enough from the lines of credit attached to th eir cards as well as related fees such as late and overdraft fees that they gene rally longer dema nd annual fees more important issuer banks are in highly competitive markets where the elasticity of demand for payment cards is high enough to force the fees to practically zero in card association network the association serves as an active umbrella organization for four parties 1 the acquiring bank and 2 the merchant on one side and 3 the issuing bank and 4 the cardholder on the other starting at the bottom of figure 1 the cardholder purchases goods or services for 10000 with payment card the accounting information go to the merchants acquirer bank as an account receivable the acquirer bank credits the merchants account 9740 which is the merchant discount that wa s agreed to by accepting the card the acquirer bank takes 05 fee for its servi ces and asks the card association for authorization for the 10000 payment th association sends the acquirer bank payment of 9790 as the association deducts its 01 for authorization clearing and settling fees from the amount it receives fro m the issuer bank the card association then requests authorization from the paym ent cards issuer banks which sends the card association 9800 afte r deducting its 2 interchange fee from the 10000httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34647crs5 source adam j levitin payment wars the merchantbank struggle for control of payment system working paper september 5 2006 p 7 the issuer bank usually extends the 10000 credit to the cardholder if the payment card is credit card and there is balance on the credit card in which case the cardholder enjoys th 10000 float the float is the use of the funds in transition of payment until the payment is act ually collected by the issuer bank the value of the float to the cardholder depends on the market rate of interest and when the purchase is made in the cardholders pa yment cycle on th other nd if the payment card is debit card the i ssuer bank may deduct the 10000 from the cardholders deposit account immediately in either case processing is done electronically in seconds where all five parties are credited and debited the appropriate amounts the optimal payment card system students of the process of setting interchange fees which include regulatory authorities economists and wyers have offered two proposed solutions to rising interchange fees the first would regulate the cost that card system may use to calculate its interchange fees the second would permit rchants to put surcharge on payment card transactions so that interchange fees could be passed on directly to the cardholder using the credit car d each of these solutions has its own problems in terms of maximizing the overall social benefits of payment card system figure 1 visa or mastercard payment card networkhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34647crs6 11 there are partial demand curves and that unless the partial demand curves are identical using costbased regulation to determine the per transaction fee to maximize the payment card systems output woul d only occur by chance 12 david evans richard schmalensee the economics of interchange fees and their regulation an overview t sloan school of management mit sloan working paper 454805 may 2005 n 10 p 114 and steve semeraro credit card interchange fees three decades of antitrust uncertainty thomas jefferson school of law san diego california legal studies research paper series march 6 2007 p 17the problem with cost regulation it is argued that interchange fees based on card issuers cost which is now implemented in seve ral countries such as austra lia could solve the problem of rising interchange fees others argue that interchange fees s hould be abolished set to zero issuers can cover their costs by ra ising interest rates nd annual fees for the card however economists have pointed out that price regulations based on costs have historically been plagued with prac tical problems even in industries in which theory would predict that the optimal price can be based on cost the practical reason for these theories failure to determine the optimal price based on costs is that firm has little incentive to cut cost if its revenues are tied to those costs however in the case of interchange fees economic theory also suggests that costbased regulation would not be expected to produce the optimal interchange fee economists have shown that because of the nature of the credit card market it would be very unlikely that the optimal in terchange fee could be reached by setting it at zero or determining it strictly on costbased measure as we can see from figure 1 the credit card market is twosided services are being sold to cardholders and merchants and each side affects the other11 costs play significantly reduced role in determining the optimal interchange fee or price there are effectively two demand and supply curves to determin the optimal price maximizing output requires issuers and acquirers to set prices in way that will provide proper incentives for cardholders to use and merchants to accept the payment card balancing costs in some fashion would achieve this result only if the elasticity of demand on both sides were equal furthermore setting the fee to zero would maximize output only if on both sides of the twosided market costs and demand were equal because neither is likely to be true one should not expect either cost based or zero interchange fee to be optimal12 this conclusion is supported by the newspaper subscription and dvertising revenues scribed in an earlier footnote in both the newspaper and the payment card cas revenue transfers are necessary to maximize overall social welfare allowing merchants to pass through the interchange fees some analysts would lift the prohibition that keeps merchants from surcharging card transactions they believe that this would be fair because it would place the costs of the interchange fee on the party ge nerating the costs if the merchant was free to charge extra for using particular card cardholders would be paying the interchange fees that card issuers charge to the merchants the card issuer would lose transaction volume if the cardholde rs shift to another card with lowerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34647crs7 13 steve semeraro credit card interchange fees three decades of antitrust uncertainty thomas jefferson school of law san diego california legal studies research

unrestricted only the payment systems aggregate share would matter because the market would longer be twosided market 15 steve semeraro p 20 16 mastercard and visa have converted from associations to publically held companies but merchants challenging the interchange fee have alleged that the banks have retained the same level of control as before the associations went publicinterchange fees or pay by cash as result of the surcharge this would give issuers an incentive not to raise the interchange fee above the optimal levels however surcharge solution has practical as well as theoretical concerns there is empirical evidence that suggests that highvolume rchants are reluctant to impose surcharges because of the administrative costs associat ed with alternative methods of payment such as the cost of handling cash13 most important merchants will not impose surcharges because of fear of losing cu stomers to competitors who do not surcharge theoretically to maximize welfare in twosided market seller needs way to discriminate between the two sides when the rule prohibiting surcharge is eliminated the division of benefits between merchants and cardholders becomes irrelevant only when the surcharge is constrained with the surcharge rule does the payment card system concentrate on its charges on merchants and provide rebates to cardholders to induce card use14 in case where greater volume is needed to optimize the efficiency of the payment card system the surcharge would raise costs to the cardholder equal to at least the bene fits that the issuer can provide to the cardholder from the interchange fee income consequently merc hant surcharging of card transactions would prevent issuers from stimulating card use in the circumstances where greater volume is needed to optimize the efficiency of the payment system15 third solution to the interchange fee issue is the antitrust aspect of the payment card association which is currently tied up in the courts this solution is beyond the scope of this repor t however below the report presents summary of hr 5546 that is related to the an titrust soluti on in that regard the economic assessment of the issue may contribute to the judicial and legislative determination of whether the visa and mastercard ssociations are monopolies and whether the domination of these associations wa rrants granting limited antitrust immunity to providers and merchants to negotiate in terchange fees even though visa and mastercard have dominated the payment card volume since the 1970s some analysts argue that it is difficult to see how banks are able to control the system and collectively harm social welfar the reason is that with in the association individual banks set virtually all their own fees nd compete with each other and although interchange fees are set collectively the associations are open to any bank or federally insured financial institution16 others argue however that larger banks dominate

5546 the credit card fair fee act of 2008 was introduced by the chairman of the house judiciary committee and the committees task force on competition policy and antitrust laws held hearing on this bill on may 15 2008 the house judiciary committee held markup session on july 16 2008 after which the bill was reported as amended to the full house the provisions of the bill would authorize providers in single covered electronic payment system eg visa nd mastercard payment card associations and any merchant to negotiate and agr ee upon rates and terms for accessing their electronic payment network it defines the covered electronic payment system as any system that has been used for at least 20 of the combined dollar value of us credit signaturebased deb it and pinbased debit card payments processed in the applicable year it grants limited antitrust immunity to such providers and merchants as well as to those providers who dete rmine among themselves the proportionate division of paid access fees hr 5546 sets forth procedure to determine rates and terms for access to covered electronic payment system it prohibits any other rates and terms from being imposed upon merchants for accessi ng covered electronic payment system except as specified in voluntarily negotiated access agreement it creates panel of three fulltime electr onic payment system judges appointed by the antitrust division of the department of justice and the federal trade commission bureau of competition to deter mine the schedule of rates and terms for threeyear periods hr 5546 subjects any termination of such judges to judicial review and it authorizes providers and rchants to enter in voluntarily negotiated access agreements and declares that such voluntarily negotiated access agreements shall be given effect between the signator ies in lieu of any determination by the judges17 reaction to hr 5546 the bill is generally supported by merc hant and consumer groups and opposed by payment card companies and the banking community including credit unions merchant support for the legisl ation is reflected in statement by john j motley of the food marketing institute major mile

issuers dominate the mark etplace they can do whatever they want i am completely unconvinced that there is any competition in this marketplace we are fortunate the antitrust task force is shining light on the issue this act would create nonprice control mechanism it is commonsense approach to the problem that will force the two sides to the bargaining table18 the general council of visa argued that the bill would suppress competition and innovation and result in uninte nded and harmful consequen ces for consumers the american bankers association points out that the bill contains provisions that violate fundamental antitrust principles and will ultimately result in less competition and increased costs and reduced benefits for c onsumers despite receiving an exemption for most credit unions the credit ion national association cuna opposes government intervention in setting interchange fees19 the federal trade commission ftc opposed the bill because the commission has long discouraged exemptions from the antitrust laws and the justice departments office of legislative affairs opposes the bill on similar grounds as the ftc20 one important issue raised at the hearing on hr 5546 that remains unresolved is whether merchants would pass on to thei r customers the savings they obtain from lower interchange fees the representative from visa suggested that there is evidence that merchants have lowered thei r profits by passing on the lower cost of interchange fees to their customers21 according to the testimony there is little evidence that customers benefitted from the lower interchange fees including the lower interchange fee case that was settled with walmart 22 in the case in australia where the interchange fees were capped by regulation the royal bank of australia has not offered empirical estimates that savings from lower interchange fees have been passed on to consumers in terms of lower prices23httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34647crs10 24 steve semeraro p 70implications the economic assessment of the twosided market is critical part of analyzing the interchange fee issue merchant complaints are focused on the rise of the merchant discount rate indi cating that the acquirer banks costs do not justify the merchants discount fee that th ey collect from them howeve r it is not clear that the merchants fully account for the costs of th issuing banks that are included in the discount fee there is some evidence that the amount of the merchant discount fee that the acquirer bank keeps is competitivel determined it is estimated to be about 05 of the transaction am ount for mo st payment cards including discover and american express however empirical evidence suggests that merchants acceptance of payment cards has little to do with the acquirer banks fees because raising the acquirer fee did not show reduction in card acceptance24 consequently the focus turns to the cardholder and the issuing banks si of the market on this side there is evidence that payment card pricing has dramatic effect on card usage because of the ease of switching to another card or thod of payment cardholders avoid using card rather than paying more which may justify the card association making larger payments to the issuer banks which lowe rs the costs to the cardholder but provides little perceived benefit to the merchants another implication concerns the market mechanism that would reverse any anticompetitive behavior existing in the paym ent card industry for example if it is determined that the interchange fee is currently the result of anticompetitive behavior on the part of the card associa tions and issuing banks interchange fees should arguably be lowered what mechanis m might be used to make sure that the price of the goods and services is lowere d to reflect the lower interchange fees although experience has shown that intercha nge fees can be lowered by regulatory caps and other government restrictions there has been little discussion of how to pass the excess fees back to the cardholders if the government just lowers the fee with the expectation that merchants will pass th savings back to cardholders it might not occur the governments regulatory cap s would be redistributing revenues from the issuing banks to merchants the result c ould be that the social benefit of the electronic payment card system is lowered because the governments action would lower revenues to the cardissuing banks causing them to issue fewer than the optimal number of cards to cardholders w ith fewer cardholders using the payment system merchants may not see the growth in customers they had in the past
