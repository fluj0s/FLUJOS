security guards and us critical infrastructure protection summary the bush administrations 2003 national strategy for the physical protection of critical infrastructures and key assets indicates that security guards are an important source of protection for criti cal facilities in 2003 approximately one million security guards including airport screeners were employed in the united states of these guards analysis indicates that up to 5 protected what have been defined as critical infrastructure and assets the effectiveness of critical infrastructur guards in countering terrorist attack depends on the number of guards on duty their qualifications pay and training security guard employment may have increased in certain critical infrastructure sectors since september 11 2001 although overall employment of us security guards has declined in the last five ears contract guard salaries averaged 19400 per year in 2003 less than half of the av erage salary for police and well below the average us salary for all occupations there are us federal requirements for training of critical infrastructure guards other than airport screeners and nuclear guards twentytwo states do require basi c training for licensed security guards but few specifically require counterterrorism training state regulations regarding criminal background checks for security guards vary sixteen states have background check regulations the federal governments role in protecting us critical infrastructure has been concern of congress since 911 part of this concern involves the possible imposition of federal secur ity requirements including guard requirements on infrastructure which is largely private the private security officer employment authorization act of 2004 pl 108458 s ec 6402 facilitates employer access to fbi criminal records to conduct backgrou nd checks of security guard employees other legislation proposed in the 108th congress would have required private security guard companies to perform criminal back ground checks would have prohibited the hiring of guards who failed background checks or would have directed the department of home land security dhs to conduct security guard emergency training including training for acts of terrorism the dhs currently does not have counterterrorism training programs sp ecifically for private security guards there appears to be federal or state policy that explicitly addresses critical infrastructure guards as distinctive gr oup if homeland security policy evolves towards special treatment of critical infrast ructure guards responsible agencies may face challenge identifying those guards because of uncertainties in identifying critical assets federal counterterrorism funding for critical infrastructure guards may also present policy challenge since 87 of these guards are in the private sector it is an open question whether priv ate operators of critical infrastructure have hired trained and otherwise s upported security guards to the degree warranted by the social value of the facilities they protect as congress continues its oversight of homeland security funding for private guards may emerge as security consideration where public benefits and private resources may not align this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32670contents introduction 1 i s s u s f c i n g c n g r s s 2 background 3 w h t i s c r i

homeland security dhs issued terrorism alert for critical financial ins titutions in new york washington dc and newark nj press reports indicated that these institutions employed security guards and that surveillance by terrorists incl uded the location arma ment and activity of those guards1 widely deployed among transpor tation hubs power plants and other nationally important facilities such security guards are viewed by many as both vital element of terror deterrence and the fi rst line of response to terrorist attacks the bush administration shares this view in the national strategy for the physical protection of critical infr astructures and key assets the administration identifies security guards as an important source of protection for critical facilities2 the nations dependence on security guards for critical infrastructure protection gives rise to questions as to the status and capability of these guards and federal efforts to help them combat terrorism in 2003 there were approxima tely one million security guards including airport screeners employed in the united st ates compared to 650000 us police officers3 nearly half of these guards were employed directly by the institutions they served the rest approximate ly 53 of all guards worked for contract guard companies providing outsourced guard services this report provides background information concerning

in qualification requirements finally the report discusses policy c onsiderations of potentia l interest to congress issues facing congress the role of the federal government in protecting the nations critical infrastructure has been fundamental cern of congress since 911 part of this concern involves the potential imposition of federal security re quirements including guard requirements on infrastructure which lies largely in the private sector among nuclear power plants for example the fede ral government has required more training and staffing of private guards since 911 airport screeners ve been federalized outright as us homeland security policy evolves direct federa l intervention in the protection of other critical infrastructure including ch emical plants banks and communications networks is becomin g an increasingly important issue critical infrastructure is found in many congressional districts by definition terrorist attack on such infrastructure would affect not only local communities but the nation as whole faced with the widely perceived need for greater critical infrastructure protection some in congre ss are examining the adequacy of current us counterterrorism activities includi ng the role and capabilities of security guards if congress concludes that the effectiveness of security guards could be enhanced congress may consid er additional guardrelated legislation such as hr 4830 of the 108th congress or may exercise its ove rsight authority in other ways to influence security guard capabilities and deployment background what is critical infrastructure what us policy makers consider to be critical infrastructure has been evolving and is often ambiguous twenty years ago infrastructure was defined primarily with respect to the adequacy of the nations public works in the mid 1990s however the growing threat of inte rnational terrorism led policy makers to reconsider the definition of infrastruct ure in the context of homeland security successive federal gove rnment reports laws and execu tive orders have refined and generally expanded the number of infrastru cture sectors and the types of assets considered to be critical for purposes of homeland security currently the usa patriot act of 2001pl 10756 fines critical in frastructure as systems and assets whether physical or virtual so vital to the united states that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have debilitating impact on security national economic security national public health or safety or any combination of those matters

health and healthcare drinking water water treatment energy banking and finance national monuments and icons defense industrial base key industry technology sites large gathering sites the critical infrastructure sectors in the national strategy contain many physical assets but only fraction of these could be viewed as critical according to the dhs definition for example out of 33000 individual assets cataloged in dhss national asset da tabase the agency considers only 1700 or 5 to be nationally critical4 the 33000 assets in the dhs database themselves constitute only subset of all assets in the critical infrastructure sectors5 because federal agencies state agencies and the private sector often have different views of what constitutes criticality compiling consensus list of nationally critical assets has been an ongoing challenge for dhs the implications of this challenge as it relates to security guards is discussed later in this report security guards and criti cal infrastructure protection protecting people and property from accidents and crime is the principal role of security guards they monitor patrol nd inspect property to protect against fire theft vandalism and other illegal activity they may enforce laws on their employers grounds conduct incident inte rviews prepare incident reports and provide legal testimony guards may wo rk at one location or may patrol among multiple locations to conduct security checks security guards typically use radios and telephones to call for assistance from po lice fire or othe r emergency services as required they may be armed as

duties at particular institutions in banks for example guards protect customers money safety deposit boxes and records they may work with bank detectives to prevent theft and apprehend criminal suspects before police arrive by comparison transportation terminal gu ards eg airport screeners protect travelers freight luggage and equipment they may screen passengers for weapons and explosives ensure property is stol while being loaded or unloaded and watch for fires and criminal activity6 security guard police powers although security guards have long supplemented public law enforcement they typically have mo re limited authorities than police and other law officers speci fic powers vary by jurisdiction but they generally correspond to the police authorities of private citizens in most states citizens may make arrests only when crime is committed in their presence suspicion that crime has taken place is not enough and in some states citizens may only make arrests fo r felonies and then must immediately turn the suspect over to police officer even those guards who do see felonies in progress are advised to arrest with caution unlike police officers civilians who accidentally take innocent suspects in to custody are liable for false arrest7 security guards may have other aut horities or may face further limitations to their police power according to state licensing or other regulation where it exists for example the following authorities are listed in californias security guard training manual as an agent of the employer security guard can question an individual on the employers propert and may prevent entry to the property by standing in the individuals way although security guard has the pow er of citizens arrest guard is not obligated by law to make arrests security guard should never t ouch criminal suspect except for self defense or when necessary to use reasonable force in an arrest if security guard believes an arrested person is armed the guard may search for weapons only spect may not be legally searched for weapons unless he is actually arrested security guard cannot legally ca rry firearm or baton without state permit and valid security guard

washington dc march 2002 p 21critical infrastructure protection responsibilities since the terror attacks of 911 protecting against terrorism has been an additional responsibility for many security guards especially for guar ds associated with critical infrastructure security guards are viewed by many as necessary supplement to the counter terrorism activities of public law enforcem ent agencies which have limited resources and broad responsibilities according to congressional testim ony by one guard company executive law enforcement agencies have been called upon to fulfill two fundamentally different and competing missions to deter domestic crime while also being engaged in the fight against potentially new and devastating terrorist attacks orchestrated from abroad unfortunately there are simply neither the public resources nor the personnel to do the job consequently security officers are being asked to fill the gap9 the increased counter terrori sm role for security guards has become apparent in many private and public sector security plans in the refinery industry for example security guidelines during dhs orange alert call for engaging trained and knowledgeable security workforce incr easing patrols inspecting vehicles and other security activities that may rely on security guards10 counter terrorism activities of security guards in other key sectors are discussed later in this report guards deployed at critical infrastructure according to the bureau of labor statistics bls there were appr oximately 1022000 security guards working in the united states in 2003 table 1 for the purposes of policy analysis these guards may be separated into two categor ies of employment and three categories of service contract guards work directly for private guard companies and are deployed under contract to other institutions staff guards are employed directly by institutions as regular line employees both contract and staff guards may work either at private facilities government facilitie s or airports guard forces at airports are mostly airport screeners whose duties and employment characteristics warrant their distinction from other guards the approximate number of contract and staff guards working at all three types of institutions in 2003 is summarized in table 1 the bls reports that over 14 of all security guards work parttime the number of parttime

employment figures for th appropriate industr ies crs estimates that approximately 122000 28 of staff guards excluding airport screeners worked in industries corresponding to the nspp critical infrastructure sectors14 as noted above however critical assets typica lly comprise only fraction of sectors total assets assuming fo r simplicity that guards are found only among assets in dhss national asset da tabase and that guards are uni formly distributed across those assets it may be reasonable to estimate that consistent with dhss critical asset ratio up to 5 of staff guards actually protect critical infrastructure further assuming that contract guard deployment reflects staff guard deployment the total number of security guards protecting criti cal assets could be on the order of 50000 such critical guard force would be comparable in size to the 55000 transportation security administration tsa and contract screeners working at the nations commercial air ports in 2003 note that

jobs since 2001 notwithstanding the nations heightened concerns about terrorism woul d appear to contradict popular perceptions about us guard deployment many anal ysts have assumed that private guard contractors in particular would see an increase in business as infrastructure owners stepped up guarding of thei r facilities under more protective security plans one reason this increase may not have occurred is because private sector reactions to 911 may have been shortlived as one major guard contractor noted in recent investor publication following september 11 2001 there was sharp increase in demand for security particularly in the usa most of this additional demand has proved to be shortterm total market growth in 2003 was around zero percent20 others have suggested that due to the us economic recession which followed 911 many companies were forced to cut discretionary expenses including security guard expenses to maintain profitability although the total number of us guards appears to have declined over the last several years it is not clear to what degree the number of guards at critical sites reflects this trend it is possible that th deployment of critical infrastructure guards increased but that these increases were offset by larger reductions in noncritical infrastructure guards the following examples suggest that there are more critical infrastructure guards at least in several infrastructure sectors airport screener trends the employment trend for airport screeners has differed from that of other guards figure 2 shows total us

several key issu staffing pay background checks and training few dditional policy issues such as counter terrorism support and contract guard cost effectiveness have also received some public attention guard staffing levels the relationship between the size of guard force stationed at critical facility and its effect on facility security is the subject of debate many policy analysts assume that the security of critical sset is proportional to the number of guards protecting it ie more guards means better security for example in 2002 campaign speech one us presidential ca ndidate called for c ongress to require much better physical security for chemical plants including more security guards29 president bushs national strategy likewise calls for recruiting and training more skilled secu rity personnel to protect our critical infrastructures30 significant increases in the number of airport screeners and nuclear plant guards since 911 appear to be based at least in part on similar

clear in guarding quantity does not necessarily ensure quality analysts have suggested several reasons why increasing the number of guards at given facility might not make it more secure or might even make it less secure guards can only meet guardable th reats such as physical intrusion or surveillance by potential terrorists any number of guards could not be expected to prevent attack by commandeered airliner or remote cyberattack on facility safety systems if the nature of terrorist attack is potentially guardable but guards are not trained to recogniz it additional guards may be

hip between guard numbers and security suggests that enhancing critical facility security may not be as simple as posting more guards as practical matter the effectiveness of guards in countering terrorist attack also depends on the specific types of threats the guards may face the training they receive their organization the conditions of their employment and background checks when these

guards guard salaries and qualifications analysis of the available data demonstrates that security guards are relatively low paid workers according to figure 2 contract guard salaries averaged 19400

pay for critical infrastructure guards airports and nuclear plants are nationally critical facilities and are perceived to be at greater risk for terrorist attack than many other facilities consequently airport and nuclear plants are deemed to require guards with bette r qualifications experience and counter terror training than other guards given their presumed experience and skills airline screeners and nuclear plant guards are paid more on average than other contract or staff guards it is possible that an informed assessment of security needs across all critical assets would demonstrate need for more capable guards and associated higher salaries in such case higher guard salaries would impose added security costs on the critical asset owners for purposes of illustration if 50000 critical infrastructure guards had their salaries increased from the average contract guard salary 19400 to the average airport screener salary 28732 total annual guard costs would increase by 466 million imposition of such costs on guard employers especially private guards contractors might be met with resistance however since the provision of guard services is highly costcompetitive business background checks the potential for terrorists to infiltrate critical facilities by hiring on as security guards has long been concern in specifi c critical infrastructure sectors the nrc for example requires exhaustive backgr ound checks of nuclear plant guards under the atomic energy act pl 83703 the federal aviation administration faa began requiring background investigations and criminal history checks for airport screeners in 199839 since 911 heightened concer n about terrorism has prompted some legislators to call for increased fe deral background screening of other security guards to help determine whether or not employees pose threat to the facilities and persons they are supposed to protect40 similarly the bush administrations national strategy states that timeefficient thorough and periodic background screening is an important tool for pr otecting against the insider threat41 congressional interest in federal background checks for security guards stems

criminal backgrounds and terrorism from the standpoint of crime prevention and employee reliability many analysts have argued that screening guards specifically for criminal history is only prudent it might be unwise for example to hire convicted bank robbers to guard banks furthermore qaeda and other terror groups have been known to recruit disgruntle d us citizens such as alleged dirty bomber jose padilla from within the us criminal justice system44 however there is also evidence that sophisticated rror groups deliberately recruit operatives without criminal histories the irish re publican army ira for example viewed new recruits with criminal records as ideal to undertake missions which would be difficult for members known to security authorities45 united states officials cite similar recruiting preferences fo r terror groups like qaeda46 it appears therefore that the direct relationship between criminal history and terrorism is debatable background check limitations both us and international experience suggest that federal criminal background checks may be valuable for weeding out some security guard job applicants with rrorist connections however the fbi cannot readily

reportedly subject to an analysis to determine whether ca ndidates present or may be associated with potential terrorist threats48 even these higher standards however which are comparable to federal security clearance requirements might not be effective against carefully selected terrorist operatives finally if background screening laws apply only to statelicensed contract guards hostile insiders may still find infiltration opportunities as unlicenced staff guards federal criminal background checks may so be limited by incomplete state records the gao recently reported that as of 2001 11 of state criminal records had not been automated and made available nationally the agency further found that automated information on the disposition of felony and other arrests as opposed to convictions is not always widely available49 fbi officials have stated that resource limitations among law enforcement agencies and state identification bureaus limits their ab ility to c onduct thorough and timely background checks for prospective employees50 given the potential relationship between criminal history and terrorist activity federal criminal background checks are viewed by some as potentially important but not insurmountable hurdles to terrorist inf iltration of critical f acilities furthermore as stricter criminal screening is imposed on critical infrastructure guards

security guards in substantially different capacities telecommunications centers for example may require guards primarily for access control whereas sports stadiums may require guards for screenin g

were staff guards and so would not be subject to such oversight many of these staff guards may be subj ect to screening and training by their institutional employers but these requirements would not necessarily be related to any governmentdefined standards as state and federal legislators consider greater training and other licencing requirements for contract guards they may need to address potential disparities between standards for contract and staff guards contract and staff guards may protect the same types of cr itical facilities so it could be argued that they should be subject to the same screening and capability requirements this is the case for example in nuclear power plants where both contract and staff guards are subject to the same nrc regulations contract and tsa

appropriate role of the federal government with respect to security guards especially private guards protecting critical infrastructure while there appears to have been relatively little congressional debate on this subject it may become increasingly important as homeland security strategy volves and the distinctive s ecurity requirements of us critical infrastructure become better understood if homeland security policy does evolve towards special treatment of critical infrastructure guards responsib agencies may face challenge in identifying those guards because of uncertainties in identifyi

cal infrastructure both public and private from threat of terrorism84 even critical government facilities such as national laboratories military ba ses and courthouses often re ly upon private security guards for counterterror protection if the private sector could be relied upon to make socially warranted counter terrorism investments in guards and traini ng federal funding for guards might not be an issue however as some analysts ve suggested there are economic reasons why private companies may not make such investments in homeland security private markets do not automatically produce the best result to be sure private firms have so incentive to avoid the direct financial losses associated with terrorist attack on their facilities or operations in general however that incentive is not compelling nough to encourage the appropriate level of security85 it is an open question whether private opera tors of critical infra structure have hired trained and otherwise supported security guar ds to the degree warranted by the social value of the facilities they protect at this time there does not appear to be sufficient information to make such judgments furthermore the overall balance between public and private funding of homeland secu rity is an expansive topic beyond the scope of this report none theless as congress continue s its oversight of homeland security funding for private guards may em erge as security consideration where public benefits and privat resources may not alignhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32670crs27 appendix 1 california mandatory
