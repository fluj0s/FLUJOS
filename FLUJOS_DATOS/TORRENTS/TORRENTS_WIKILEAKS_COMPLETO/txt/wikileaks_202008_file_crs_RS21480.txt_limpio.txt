government and finance division july 31 2008 abstract the amount of money saved has important economic consequences nationally the amount of saving determines how much can be invested and ultimately the size of the capital stock increasing the size of the capital stock is believed to be one way to raise the productivity of the labor force individually saving is critical to accumulating sufficient wealth to maintain living standards after retirement this report explains how national saving is measured presents recent estimates of saving rates in the united states and for comparison provides those of other major industrial countries order code rs21480 updated july 31 2008 saving rates in the united states calculation and comparison brian w cashell specialist in macroeconomic policy government and finance division summary the amount of money saved has important economic consequences nationally httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21480 the amount of saving determines how much can be invested and ultimately the size of the capital stock increasing the size of the capital stock is believed to be one way to raise the productivity of the labor force individually saving is critical to accumulating sufficient wealth to maintain living standards after retirement this report explains how national saving is measured presents recent estimates of saving rates in the united states and for comparison provides those of other major industrial countries this report will be updated periodically introduction anyone with income and future must decide how much to spend and how much to save individuals may save fraction of their income for precautionary reasons as well as to provide for themselves in retirement businesses retain fraction of their profits in order to finance new investments governments save or dissave as consequence of policy decisions about how much to tax and how much to spend the amount of money saved as nation has important economic consequences if individuals save too little during their working lives to avoid falling living standards in old age that may influence policymakers views about the appropriate level of social security taxes and benefits national saving the sum of individual business and public saving has important consequences for the balance of trade economic growth and future standards of living1 although economic theory gives reason to prefer one saving rate to another it may still be useful to examine trends in saving and to compare us saving rates with those in other countries this report provides brief explanation of how saving is 1 for discussion of public policy and saving see crs report rl32119 can public policy raise the saving rate by brian w cashell crs2 measured and it provides current data on saving rates in the united states and for selected foreign countries measuring saving saving in nutshell is income minus consumption in an economic sense however consumption is not the same as expenditures translating the theoretical notion of saving into statistical measure is challenge the source for us saving data is the national income and product accounts nipa published by the department of commerce bureau of economic analysis bea the nipa constitute the accounting framework which is used to produce estimates of gross domestic product gdp gdp is the total value of goods and services produced and it can be calculated in two different ways one way is to add up the value of all the goods and services produced the product side of the accounts and the other way is to add up all of the income earned in the production of those goods and services the income side of the account httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21480 on the product side gdp is the total value of those goods and services produced for personal consumption c investment i government g as well as for export x on the income side the income earned in the production of those goods and services can be accounted for as consumer spending c taxes t private saving s and spending for imported goods and services m since each of these approaches measure the same variable gdp they can be set equal to each other in this way cigxctsm subtracting consumption c from both sides simplifies the equality igxtsm this can now be rearranged by subtracting government spending g and exports x from both sides which gives i s t g m x this equation illustrates the importance of saving total investment is equal to the sum of private saving s public saving tg and the net inflow of capital from abroad m x2 2 just as there is balance between the income and product sides of the nipa there is balance in international payments if americans buy more goods and services from abroad than they export then at least in this simplified example the net outflow of dollars will be used by foreigners to buy dollardenominated assets which thus helps to finance domestic investment crs3 gross and net saving in the broadest sense saving is income less consumption consumption is typically taken to mean spending on goods and services by households but consumption can also refer to the wear and tear depreciation or capital consumption on the capital stock that occurs in the production of those goods and services thus some saving must be allocated to the replacement of the existing capital stock as it wears out only if saving is more than sufficient to replace the existing capital stock as it wears out can the capital stock grow for this reason saving data distinguish between gross and net saving the difference between the two measures is the estimated deterioration in the existing capital stock in some cases such as computers capital may be completely depreciated in very short period of time whereas in others such as buildings or heavy equipment capital may take long time to wear out saving and economic growth httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21480 economic growth in the long run is determined by three factors the growth rate of the labor force the rate of technological progress and the rate of growth of the capital stock the productivity of the labor force depends on both the level of technology and the size of the capital stock the more capital there is the more productive the labor force can be the size of the capital stock in turn depends on the rate of investment investment must equal saving the amount that can be invested depends on the amount of saving saving more can lead to increased investment resulting in larger stock of capital and higher levels of productivity consuming less now enables more consumption in the future thrift is considered by many to be virtue but economic theory gives reason to prefer one saving rate over another the amount saved is seen simply as reflection of the trade off made between desire to consume now and willingness to consume less than ones current income to provide resources for the future historical saving data table 1 presents historical estimates of us saving rates since 1997 the data in the top third of the chart relate to the contribution of the private sector personal or household saving and business saving to national saving followed by data indicating the saving of the public sector with separate accounting for the federal and state and local government the bottom third of the table shows both total gross and net national saving the

rate is prescribed by economic theory the case for saving more is sometimes argued on the grounds that either less is saved now than in prior years or that the current saving rate is below that of other countries table 2 presents data showing how national saving in the united states compares with that in other major industrial countries these data differ somewhat from those presented in table 1 because the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd uses different set of economic accounting rules and because the oecd data are not revised on the same schedule as the nipa data
