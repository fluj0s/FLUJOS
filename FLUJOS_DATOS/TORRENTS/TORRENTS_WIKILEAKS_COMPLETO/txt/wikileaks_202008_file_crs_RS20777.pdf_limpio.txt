distresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20777 order code rs20777 updated october 22 2008 consumer bankruptcy and household debt mark jickling government and finance division summary the bankruptcy abuse prevention nd consumer protection act of 2005 bapcpa pl 1098 included the most significant amendments to consumer bankruptcy procedures since the 1970s the 110th congress continues to monitor the impact of the new law on debtors and cred itors bankruptcy reform was enacted in response to the high number of consum er bankruptcy filings which in 2005 and 2006 reached five times the level of the early 1980s why did filings increase so dramatically during period that included two of the long est economic expansions in us history because bankruptcy is by definition cond ition of excessive debt many would expect to see corresponding increase in the debt burden of us households over the same period however while house hold debt has indeed grown debt costs as percentage of income have risen only mode rately what aggregate statistics do not show is that the debt burden does not fall equally on all families financial distress is common among lowerincome households in 2004 27 of fa milies in the bottom fifth of the income distribution spent more than 40 of their income to repay debt this report presents statistics on bankruptcy filings household debt and families in financial distress and it will be updated as new sta tistics become available this report presents data on bankr uptcy filings household debt and fa milies in financial distress table 1 shows filings since 1980 business filings peaked in 1987 and have since declined but the number of cons umer filings continued to grow through 2005 in 2005 the number of filings surpassed 2 milli on there was rush to the courthouse before the bankruptcy abuse preventi on and consumer protection act of 2005 bapcpa took effect in october 2005 in 2006 filings dropped sharply suggesting that the new law caused many to accelerate their f ilings and that many petitions that would have been filed in 2006 r later were pushed forwar d by bankruptcy reform whether or how much bapcpa will reduce filings in the long run is still unclear filings have risen steadily from the 2006 lows and in the second quarter of 2008 reached 266667 or over 1 million at an annual rate weakening credit market and macroeconomic conditions in c ould produce further increaseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20777crs2 table 1 bankruptcy filings in the united states 19802008 yeartotal filings numberbusiness filings numbernonbusiness or consumer filings

information on the recent increase in mortgage foreclosures see crs report rl34232 understanding mortgage foreclosure recent events the process and costs by darryl getter1980s the range was similar from 106 to125 although the burden of debt has risen since the 1980s particularly since 2001 the increase has been gradual and would not appear to explain much of the fivefold increase in personal bankruptcy filings over the past two decades interest rates paid by consumers particul arly mortgage rates declined in recent years to the lowest levels since the 1950s nd they remain low the relative stability of the debt burden in the face of falling and historically low interest rates implies that the ratio of debt outstanding to income has been rising this ratio the sum of consumer and mortgage debt shown in the table expre ssed as percentage of disposable personal income is shown in the far right column of table 2 the increases in this figure which since 1990 has risen more than twice as fa st as the debt burden suggest that further increases in bankruptcy filings and perhaps problems for lenders may lie ahead if interest rates should rise suddenly or une xpectedly many homeowners face resets on their adjustablerate mortgages with possible increases in their mortgage payments but the prevalence of fixedrate mortgages may mitigate this effect at the national level1 for the present however historically low intere st rates have permitted households to take on more debt without major increase in the debt burden table 3 percentage of families in financial distress by income level

income levels who devote more than 40 of their incomes to debt service for selected years from 1995 through 2004 two noteworth facts emerge from the data in table 3 first is the high rate of distress among lowerincome families who are the most likely to file for bankruptcy2 second like the debt burden figures shown in table 2 there is sharply rising trend that would explain the dramatic increase in personal bankruptcy filings the percentage of all families in distress in 2004 is little changed from the 1995 level consumer bankruptcies in 2004 on the other hand were up 79 over the 1995 figure the question remains why so many families at or below the national median income take on high levels of debt and end up in bankruptcy court some explanations focus on particularly vulnerable popula tions the sick and uninsured or underinsured the divorced or residents of states without mandatory uninsured motorist coverage supporters of the bankruptcy reform measure finally enact ed in 2005 argued that the bankruptcy code was too debt orfriendly and created an in centive to borrow beyond the ability to repay or in some cases without th intention of repaying opponents of reform claimed that financial distress is often byproduct of th marketing strategies of credit card issuers and other consumer lenders lack of consensus explanation for the rise in consumer bankruptcy filings ensures that the issue will remain controversial the argument that consumer behavior is ffected by the legal regime was given some dramatic support by the rush to file before the new w took effect on october 17 20053 although the number of filings during 2006 was the lowest in decades it remains to be seen whether this decline represents the frontloading of filings that would otherwise have taken place in 2006 into the period before the new laws effective date the steady increase in bankruptcy filings since th initial postbapcpa drop in 2006 raises questions about how much the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act will significantly reduce the number of consumer bankruptcy filings in the long run
