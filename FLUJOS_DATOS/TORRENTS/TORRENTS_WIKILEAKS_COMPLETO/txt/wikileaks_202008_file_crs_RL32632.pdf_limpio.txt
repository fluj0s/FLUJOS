defined in the usa patriot act 18 usc 2331 co mmitted under particular jurisdictional conditions the jurisdictional c onditions include the fact that us jurisdiction exists over the underlying terrorist offense the offense occurs in or affects interstate or foreign commerce the underlying domestic terrorism offe nse is calculated to coerce the us government matter where the offense occurs th offender is us national us permanent resident alien or stateless habitual residence of the us and the international terrorism offense is calculated to coerce the us or foreign government the act of international terrorism is committed within the us by foreign national and calculated to coerce th us or foreign government the act of international terrorism is committed outside the us by foreign national and calculated to coerce the us government with respect to section 2339b the bill identifies specific circumstances under which the us has jurisdiction over the offense the offense occurs in

prohibition improvement act of 2004 hr 10 sec 2051 s 2845 similar provision section 2051 designates subtitle iicd as the weapons of mass destruction prohibition improve ment act of 2004 weapons of mass destruction hr 10 sec 2052 s 2845 similar provision present law condemns the use the threat to use and the attempt or conspiracy to use weapons of mass dest ruction which it defines to in clude biological and atomic weapons as well as destructive devices bombs 18 usc 2332a when the crime is committed overseas by or against an american when the crime is committed within the us and the use affects or would affect interstate or foreign commerce or when the crime is committed against federal property in the us or elsewhere individual parallel pr oscriptions cover biological weapons 18 usc 175 chemical weapons 18 usc 229 nuclear materials 18 usc 831 and to somewhat lesser extent explosives 18 usc 842 844 thus section 175 outlaws the pr oduction acquisition or possession of biological materials for use as weapon or attempting th reatening or conspiring to do so the prohibition applies within the us without the need for further jurisdictional justification and overseas if the offense is committed by or against an american by the same token s ection 229 outlaws production acquisition possession or use of chemical weapons or the attempt conspiracy or threat to do so there is federal jurisdiction over the offense if it is committed within the us or committed by or against an ameri can overseas or committed against federal property located in this country or else where and section 831 outlaws possession or use of nuclear material under circumstances likely to endanger person or property or to threaten attempt or conspire to do so federal jurisdiction exists if the offense is committed within the us the offender or victim is an american the offender is later found or brought to the us the offe nse involves threat directed against the federal government or us territory or the offense invol ves shipment in interstate or foreign commerce although somewhat less comprehensive particularly with regard to attempts nd misconduct committed by americans overseas section 844 outlaws burning or bombing property used in or used in an activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce burning or bombing federal property using the mails or some other medium in interstate or fo reign commerce to threaten to burn or bomb or conspiring to do so host of other federal laws prohibit violence regardless of the form it takes under variety of jurisd ictional circumstances eg 18 usc 1114httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32632crs7 killing federal officers employees or mbers of the armed forces 2332 acts of violence committed against americans overseas section 2052 enlarges the jurisdictional coverage of the generic weapons of mass destruction section 18 usc 2332a so that it more closely approximates the jurisdictional reach of the individual proscriptions covering nuclear material as well as biological and chemical weapons in addition to section 2332as commerce clause foundation section 2052 permits prosecuti on when violation of section 2332 involves the use of the mails or interstate or foreign co mmerce in furtherance of the offense or when the offender travels in interstate or foreign commerce or when the offense is committed against the property of foreign government within this country section 2052 makes 18 usc 2332a app licable to chemical weapons in addition to the other weapons of mass destruction alread included in the section chemical weapons were dropped when th individual provisions of 18 usc 229 were enacted section 2052 so enlarges the classes of restricted individuals who may not possess biological toxins under 18 usc 175b to include members and agents of designated terrorist organiza tions and agents of nations that support terrorism finally section 2052 adds 18 usc 175178 biological weapons and materials 18 usc 229229f chemical weapons and 18 usc 831 nuclear materials to the rico predicate offense list and consequently to the money laundering predicate offense list rico th federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organization provisions outlaws the acquis ition or operation through the patterned commission of any of series of seri ous crimes predicate offenses of an enterprise whose activities ffect interstate or foreign commerce 18 usc 1961 1962 the federal money laundering statutes outlaw financial tr ansactions involving the proceeds of various serious crimes predicate offenses 18 usc 1956 1957 rico predicate offenses are by definiti on money laundering predicate offenses 18 usc 1956c7a the purpose of section 2052 here seems to be one of emphasis since each of the offenses it app ears to add to the rico predicate offense list is already there by virtue of its sta nding as federal crime of terrorism under 18 usc 2332bg5b which rico includes in its predicate offense list by cross reference 18 usc 19611g participation in nuclear and weapons of mass destruction threats to the united states hr 10 sec 2053 s 2845 similar provision anyone who aids or abets the commission of federal crime is treated as principal 18 usc 2 that is is treated as if he committed the offense himself one aids or abets the crime of another for pur poses of section 2 when one in some sort associates himself with the venture that he participates in it as in something that he wishes to bring about and that he seeks by his action to make it succeed central bank of denver v fi rst interstate bank of denver 511 us 164 190 1994httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32632crs8 quoting nye v nissen 336 us 613 619 1949 in much the same way anyone who conspires to commit federal crime is liable for the underlying offense pinkerton v united states 328 us 640 64647 1946 in addition to the separate crime of c onspiracy 18 usc 371 section 57b of the atomic energy act of 1954 42 usc 2077b outlaws engaging in the production of special nucl ear material outside the us moreover it is also federal crime to use or to threat to use or to attempt or conspire to use weapon designed to release radiation or radioactivity at level dangerous to human life when the offense occurs within the us and affects or would affect interstate or foreign commerce when the offense is committed against an american outside the us or when the offense is committed against federal property regardless of where the property is located 18 usc 2332a it is likewise federal crime to possess or use nuclear materi or nuclear byproduct material under circumstances likely to cause serious injury or substantial property damage or to attempt threaten or conspire to do so in the us or overseas when the victim or offender is an american when the offender is subsequently brought or otherwise found in the us or when the offense is directed against th us territory or the us government 18 usc 831 section 2053 amends section 57b of the atomic energy act 42 usc 2077b and creates new 18 usc 832 th amendment to the atomic energy act adds proscription against participation in the development of special nuclear material outside the us to the existing prohibition against production of special nuclear material outside the us presumably one who participated in the development of special nuclear material outside the us would at the same time be either aiding and abetting th production of special nuclear material or conspiring to produce special nuclear material in violation of 42 usc 2077b in its present form on the other hand the proposal takes conspi racy and aiding and abetting liability one step back for under its provisions conspiring to participate or aiding and abetting participant in the development of nuclear material becomes crime the new 18 usc 832 consists of two crimes one concerned with foreign weapons programs and the other with misconduct in this country involving radiological weapons proposed subsection 832a bars participa tion in or providing material support to the weapons of mass destruction progra m of designated foreign terrorist organization or of country desi gnated sponsor of terrorism when the offense is committed either within the us or by one subject to us jurisdiction eg us company or citizen it also outlaws attempts or conspiracies to engage in such misconduct the subsection suppl ements existing proscriptions against providing material support to terrorist organizations generally 18 usc 2339b against producing biological or chemical weapons or po ssessing nuclear materials under dangerous circumstances attempting or conspiring to do so 18 usc 175 229 831 or aiding or abetting such production or possession 18 usc 2 or providing material support to such production or possession 18 usc 2339a proposed subsection 832c outlaws th development or possession of radiological weapon or attemp t or conspiracy to do so it also outlaws the use or threatened use of such weapon agains t anyone within the us an american overseas of federal property regardless of its location radiological weapons arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32632crs9 1 there is also clear indication of the re lationship between this section and section 2405 of the bill that outlaws the production ac quisition possession and use of radiological dispersal devices depending upon how the two are reconciled section 2405 may provide some clarification because it applies to weapons or devices designed or intended to endanger human life through the rel ease of radiation or radioactivity see discussion infranot defined either in proposed section 832 or in the existing united states code it is therefore difficult to determine to what extent if any it is intended to replicate the proscriptions of 18 usc 2332a relating to any weapon that is designed to release radiation or radioactivity at level dangerous to human life or those of 18 usc 831 relating to misconduct asso ciated with nuclear mate rial and nuclear byproduct material1 the new section 832 is designated fe deral crime of terro rism under 18 usc 2332bg5b and as consequence is added to the list of rico

power or an agent of foreign power domestic or in ternational sabotage domestic or international terrorism or clandestine intelligence gathering activities by an intelligence service or network of foreign power or an agent of foreign power to any state local indian tribal or fo reign government official for the purpose of preventing or responding to the threat the rule already permits disclosure to the appropriate federal fficials under such circ umstances any offi cial receiving such information may use it only for his or her official duties subject to any limitations on its unauthorized disclosure and may use it only in manner consistent with guidelines jointly issued by the attorney general and the national intelligence director third it allows disclosure to foreign courts or prosecutors to use in official criminal investigations at their request and with the courts approval in related change it amends the provision frcrimp 6e3eiii which now permits disclosure of evidence of violation of stat or tribal law to the appropriate state or tribal authorities with court approval to allow disclosure of evidence of foreign law violations to the appr opriate foreign

the ma ss transit provider of the system attacked is engaged in or affects interstate or foreign commerce or if the offender traveled in interstate or foreign commerce in furtherance of the offense the two have roughly comparable pena lty structures imprisonment for not more than 20 years for most offenses section 1992 however punishes offenses resulting in death by imprisonment for lif or death and punishes attacks on trains carrying high level radioactive waste by imprisonment for life or for any term of years subject to 30 year mandatory minimum section 1993 on the other hand punishes
