bilateral and multilateral assistance to russia although policymakers always anticipated that multilateral financial assistance through the world bank and imf would compose the bulk of global efforts to assist russi throughout this period the united states has maintained program of bilateral assistance that more directly and immediately reflects us interests and priorities the us bilateral progra m has had three overarchi ng and related aims security stability and humanitarian relief the united states has sought to achieve security both us and russian by pr omoting nuclear and chemical weapons nonproliferation activities it has sought stability russian and world stability by supporting range of programs to create democratic and ec onomically prosperous russia that would as result be c ooperative member of the international community its humanitarian programs lik those elsewhere in the world often transcend specific us strategic and other interests in russia reflecting traditional american values as might be evident from the current state of russias economy society politics and military the numerous and diverse projects that were developed to achieve these aims have had mixed record over time as consequence of failures successes lessons learned fi nancial constraints and program restrictions and conditions the aid program today is substan tially different in size and scope than it was early on how it will change over the next decade is unclear but in determining where the program is to go in the futu re it may be helpful to know where the program has been2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31699crs2 3 the united states also provided loan nd other guarantees to support roughly 6 billion in the face value of us goods and investments to meet trade objectives

billion in humanitarian assistance almost all of it has been food aid delivered under the pl 480 food for peace section 416b nd the food for progress programs carried out by the department of agriculture nd most 79 was provided during the two years of 1993 and 1999 in res ponse to percei ved shortfalls in production in some cases food was given to private voluntary or ganizations for distribution to the needy in other cases commodities were sold nd their proceeds were used to support development objectives such as the c ooperative credit system child vaccination programs and the

meet these objectives have been numerous and diverse the breadth of purpose and sectors they cover many of which overlap make it difficult to categoriz them they might be put into three broad baskets5 economic reform more than half 516 about 15 billion of stability programs appear to have as their prima ry objective the economic restructuring of russia and development of strong privat sector economy among the projects that sought to meet this need were efforts to encourage reform of tax banking fiscal energy housing and privatiza tion policies us funds ve been made available for equity investments in small and medium business and loans to small and micro business technical advice has been provi ded to farmers and bus inesses as well as opportunities to gain experience in us firm s various efforts have been made to promote us trade and investment in russia democratic reform by the narrowest definition only 8 of stability efforts in russia were directly geared toward the development of democratic institutions and practices these would include projects providing advice to staff of political parties and election commissions encouraging the gr owth of civil society through offering advice and funding to nongovernmental dvocacy organizations promoting the rule of law through provision of judicial traini ng programs and expertise on civil code and crime and anticorruption programs democracy programs more broadly defined also include wide range of us exchange programs and small grants to ngos many of which facilita ted economic reform or other objectives but whose effect through exposure to us instituti ons or development of indigenous civil society has been helpful to democratic development quarter of stability programs fit this broader defi nition 733 million social and environmental reform social and environmental reform activities account for bout 18 of stability effort s 522 million programs to improve the social welfare and environmen tal conditions of the russian public were largely intended to bolster the key us objectives of econo mic and democratic reform experts have argued that the ru ssian public would be more likely to support these objectives if they experienced fe wer negative consequences as result of reform efforts unenforced environmental standards by the communist regime and the end of cradletograve social system have fostered dramatic health and environmental crisis in russia health programs supported by us assistance have sought to reform health care delivery and financing systems and they have targeted specific

achievements when the freedom support act wa s introduced in 1992 government officials tried to sell the program as relatively shortterm effort lasting until fy1998 however even then many realized that the transition to democracy and free markets might take generation or mo re depending on the sincerity and rapidity with which political leaders adopted the ba sic framework and laws of new political and economic system at the present time russias transformation remains an unfinished work with analysts ranging fro m doubtful to hopeful in their views of its future course6 views of the us assistance program follow the same trajectory both optimistic and pessimistic perspectives have helped shape the current program and can provide lessons for its future in any case the role of the aid prog ram in russias progression to what it is today and to what some expect it to become is hard to define even in countries such as south korea or costa ri ca where the aid programs were proportionately large and their political and economic development highly successful the connection between the us programs there and specific c onsequences is obscured by the numerous variables that come into play the results of some programs are more easily measured than others such as numbers of children vaccinated which logically means lesser incidence of disease or elimination of missile launchers which directly leads to the conclusion that us security is enhanced the immediate returns on most programs are often straightforward such as numbers of micro loans provided or people trained in business management how the trainees or loan recipients ultimately contributed to the broader objective of creating market economy however is less clear if the program objec tive is concrete the budget sufficient activities narrowly focused on the goal nd the recipient environment cooperative as was more often the case with security and humanitarian programs in russia the results may be more transparent stability programs had few of these features and only the shortterm results appear measurable further us stability assistance was never expected to be the primary determinant of successful russian transition its impact could only be at the margins ch considerations should be kept in mind when judging the impact of us assistance programs in russia httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31699crs6 7

ineffectiveness of implementation and possible malfeasance of i ndividuals employed in projects in some cases the charges have been significant for example the dod inspector general found that 22

international development contractors for allegedly using their positions in usai d privatization project for personal gain criticism from the time it was launched negativ critiques of the aid program have emerged with regularity7 some attacks many hype rbolic may have had ulterior motives for example those linking the aid program to vice president gore as the 2000 election approached or the snipes at aid implementors made by some unsuccessful applicants for funds but there was also criticism from knowledgeable individuals who seemed to be primarily interested in more effective outcomes most criticism understandably appear s founded on the seeming lack of success in aspects of the russian economy and democracy at l east up to the year 2000 in the past two years however as the economy has shown si gns of significant progress criticism of the aid program has largely diminished wh ether this is because the current stability program is relatively small or is credited with the recen t success or whether critics are reconsidering their earlier assessments is unclear the range of criticism can be summarized as follows8 too little too late efforts to assist the democratic and economic transition in russia have often been criticized as ffering too little funding too late early on the george h bush administration was cr iticized for reacting too cautiously to the dramatic changes taking place in the sovi et union in 1991 ctr security initiatives launched in that year came entirely from congress although some small stability related programs were proposed by the administration it was not until the april 1992 announcement of the free dom support act following critical comments from national figures such as former presid ent nixon that concentrated effort was made to offer us aid and organize s upport from international donors to those expecting new marshall plan in response to what appeared then to be short window of opportunity for adoption of revol utionary and painful reforms the ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31699crs7 9 gao report criticized the doe initiatives for proliferation prevention program for providing only one third of its funds to russian institutes for

hand stability aid was mostly us technical advisers and equipment key exceptions being monetary grants to grassroots organizations equ ity investments in private sector firms and grants provided for onlending to small and microbusiness the russian government had little to do with how stability funds were spentcontribution was considered paltry and halfhearted and the bulk of offered international

roughly 15 billion fo llowing this onetime infusion of aid annual levels appr opriated for russia quickly d eclined settling below 200 million throughout the decade critics continued to remark on the disparity between the supposed importance of russia to us intere sts and the level of funding for efforts to effect change there although russi received greater proportion of available funding for the region neighboring nations such as armenia and georgia with significantly smaller populations consistently ranked higher than russia as recipients of aid on per capita basis us assistance to russia

wasted resources in the early ears was the impetus to spend before there was serious prospect of success in certain sectors economic re form legislation was developed with us assi stance while communist dominated parliament was inclined to thwart each measure assist ance was offered to develop farming before land was privatized and fo reign investment was encour aged before rule of law

funding were longer available too american however much the united states claimed to provide to russia the fact is that much of the ffort was selffocused and many of the f unds never left american

policy reform work and dominated the aid program in the early years critics also argued that inadequate funds were provided to the relatively smaller ngos which worked with the russian grassroots and were more responsive to local realities and needs as result us assistance created degree of public resentment critics would argue instead of the anticipated good will to the wrong russians both the george h bush and clinton administrations announced that aid shoul d follow reform however some have observed that partly due to the lack of russia expertise or misguided effort to support the yeltsin government aid was provi ded to individuals or groups that were not reformist in partic ular critics pointed to us support for anatoly chubais program of privatization wh ich they assert exacerbated income divisions and helped foster the socalled oligarches policymakers according to critics blindly provided support to yeltsin despite his inconsistent support for economic reform and democracy rather than to democratic institutions10 when substantial amount of food aid was provided in 1993 many sugge sted that proceeds were channeled through corrupt officials who may have used them illegitimately others argued that congressional directives f unneling funds to specific re gions insured ineffective programs by assisting nonreformers the wrong strategy some critics disagreed with the mix of programs that were funded by the united states they ar gued for example that stability programs emphasized economic reform efforts while leaving democracy programs underfunded stronger democr atic institutions they ggested would have led to more economic reform some critics argued that too much assistance was provided to programs in moscow and not enough to the regions others contended that too much went to the reform of russian government policie s and not enough to grassroots activities and the private sector or that reforms were tooradical economic shock therapy that simply alienated the russian public still others assert that the us objective of free market economy was inherently wrong for russia that government should play more active role there11 some ctr critics argued that funding th destruction of chemical weapons was less important than elimination of nuclear weapons others that more f unds s hould have gone to insuring the security of materials used to produce weapons some questioned the wisdom of fense conversion programs arguing they subsidized the russian defense industry and had eff ect on current production capacity others suggested that funding weapons dismantleme nt while russia continued to modernize its systems simply subsidized defense mode rnization critics of food aid argued that sale of the commodities wered local food

the past ten years it coul d be said that matter the amount of funds available little could be done without strong commitment on the part of the russian government to support the few ru ssian reformers who emerged in positions of power in fact some argue that russias problem was that it did not adopt seriously radical reform while there were american experts on russia who knew more than kremlinology it has been pointed out that few of these had experience in running assistance programs and that one had expertise on the transformation from communism to democratic capitalism everyone had their own formula for how funds could best be spent and many of the criticisms even those written as late as 2000 were based on aspects of the first four years of the program that had since changed achievements in taking aim at individual aspects of th aid program the privatization effort corrupt food aid insufficient support for democratization et c critics often promoted the impression that the whole aid pr ogram was in dispute while there was much in the critiques that rang true there were also many things that could be said to be right with the program positive accomplishments

more sharply during the decade than did the security programs24 perhaps the most striking feature has been shift in emphasis from economic reformto democratic reform for the whol period economic

democracy activities reflects the lack of progress in economic reform until recently past criticism that not enough attention was being paid to democracybuilding and persontop erson contacts and cuts in assistance to the central government of russia which was the recipient of much economic reform aid25 the proportionate increase in social aid from 18 during the whole period to nearly 26 in 2001 is reflection of the in creased response to the health crisis in russia particularly the rise of infectious diseases by 2001 the makeup of the stability program had changed in number of other important ways extrapolating from the experience of usaid which accounted for roughly half of stability program activity very little assistance was still being directed toward helping the central government of russia although the central government was the key target of the large number of policy reform efforts undertaken in the 1993 1995 period in fy1996 the first year for which data is available accounting for 17 of usaids program by 2001 central governmentrelated projects accounted for only 5 usaid support for private sector activities rose correspondingly from 68 of the fy1996 program to more than 82 in fy1999 there is also some evidence based on usaid activities that compared with its early years the assistance program now has more activities in the regions than in moscow and petersburg 80 in the regions in fy2000 more funds directed toward ngos 75 in fy2000 and more russian nationals involved as both implementors and staff considerable effort has gone in recent years to

changes were featured in the clinton administrations partnership for freedom initiative which was introduced in 1997 largely in response to the criticisms noted above and in an ffort to recover

intensive study of thestability aid program an interagency nsc policy coordinating committee assistance working group produced its recommendations in late summer 2001 the groups main conclusion supports concentration of the programs futu re focus on three areas support for entrepreneurs strengthening of civil soci ety and the media and improving the health of the russian people the strategy does not entirely reject but does downplay further assistance to the central governme nt the group also called for efforts to apply the lessons learned implementing the five regional initiatives more widely throughout the country and it supported balance between programs that have longrange structural objectives and programs that can produce real results affecting ordinary russians in the shortterm the assistance working group further recommended an improvement in both coor dination between implementing agencies and integration of disparate prog rams to support shared goal26 the recommendations do not call for dram atic shifts from previous practice which in any event limited and perhaps declining budget might not support nevertheless some small programmatic changes are already apparent in 2002 funds have been cut for an epa environmen tal remediation program and commerce business development effort that do not fit the new strategy focus an educational exchange

russia which can maintain firm control ove r its wmd resources continues to be major foreign policy goal of the united states one strain of concern constant throughout the decade remains whatever the mix of programs is enough being done is sufficient funding being provided in absolute terms to meet stability and security objectives the january 2001 baker cutler report for example called for

of sufficient resources into sharper focus as the government of russia adopts us aids upported economic reforms but is slow to implement them as the putin government s support for democratic institutions of independent media and civil society remains uncertain highlighted by the recent russian termination of osce monitoring in chechnya and russian withdrawal from participation in the peace corps program and as the war on terrorism increases the threat of diversion of russian weapons of mass destruction many argue substantial needs that could be addressed by us assistance32 despite these trends the bush administration is reporte dly planning an fy2004 budget request that will substantially reduce the stability program for russia by as much as third and begin process leading to g
