2006 philip d winters analyst in government finance government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress growth in foreign holdings of federal debt summary the governments persistent deficits have increased the amount of debt the treasury must sell to the public to raise the cash needed to cover the gap between its income and spending over the last 20 years and particularly the last 10 years most of this debt has been sold to foreigners both central banks and others by 2005 foreign holdings had risen to 54 of all privately held federal debt domestic holdings have fallen from 83 of all privately held federal debt in 1985 to 46 in 2005 the most dramatic shift in the relative shares has occurred since 1995 during which total privately held federal debt grew by 580 billion domestic holdings fell by 670 billion and foreign holdings ballooned by 1250 billion as shares of gross domestic product gdp privately held federal debt peaked in 1993 at 455 of gdp having risen from 323 of gdp in 1985 before falling back to 314 of gdp in 2005 foreign holdings have risen from 54 of gdp in 1985 to almost 17 of gdp in 2005 their highest level so far domestic holdings peaked in 1993 360 of gdp and have fallen steadily since to 146 of gdp in 2005 the foreign purchases of federal debt over this 20year period have held down domestic interest rates and prevented the crowding out of private investment that might otherwise have occurred the foreign holdings of federal debt or other us assets means some of our future income will be sent overseas to pay interest or dividends although unlikely rapid diversification out of dollar assets is possible such situation could cause collapse in the dollars value putting the us economy at risk of recession slower divestment of dollar assets would tend to raise us interest rates and slow investment but would probably not trigger recession the special role that the dollar plays in international finance and the strength and stability of the us financial markets including treasury securities make them attractive sources for foreign investment these factors generally encourage the retention of dollar assets by foreigners as result the levels of foreign holdings of federal debt are currently neither threat nor problem for the nation contents growth in federal debt held by foreigners 1 possible

foreign holdings of federal debt the federal budgets return to persistent deficits after fiscal year 2001 increased and continues to increase the amount of federal government debt sold to the public1 the sale of us treasuryissued debt to the public provides the government with the cash it needs to cover the gap between its income and its spending the treasury bulletin published quarterly provides data on the amount of federal debt held by different categories of holders2 the categories of holders include among others depository institutions individuals pension funds insurance companies state and local governments and foreign governments and international institutions for this report the holdings of federal debt by the public are divided into just two categories domestic private holdings and foreign and international holdings hereafter referred to as foreign holdings 3 the rest of this report documents the growth in foreign holdings of federal debt over the last 20 years and the potential consequences of the changes growth in federal debt held by foreigners figure 1 shows federal debt in billions of dollars annually by domestic and foreign holders for the fiscal years 1985 through 20054 the figure shows the steady and then more rapid growth in foreign holdings over the 20year period domestic holdings of federal debt began falling after 1995 but stabilized after 2001 since 2001 the increase in foreign holdings is equal to 98 of the total increase in private holdings of federal debt 1 this report does not discuss federal debt held by the federal reserve system or by the federal government itself the treasury considers this portion of its debt privately held even though some of it is held by state and local governments foreign governments and international institutions 2 this information is found in table ofs2 estimated ownership of us treasury securities in the quarterly treasury bulletin 3 foreign holders include private investors central banks and international institutions these holders have different motivations for holding federal debt as result the management of their holdings may differ as they react to changing economic and political conditions 4 unless otherwise noted all years are fiscal years crs2 figure 1 privately held federal debt the 2001 to 2005 growth in fy1985fy2005 foreign holdings along with 2500 in billions relatively stable domestic domestic holdings pushed foreign holdings 2250 foreign to 54 of total holdings at the end of 2005 if federal reserve 2000 system holdings were included in domestic holdings the foreign

2 shows domestic and foreign holdings as shares of gross domestic product gdp line representing total privately held federal debt the sum of foreign and domestic holdings as percentage of gdp is included in figure 2 as shares of gdp the data present different overall view of privately held federal debt over the last 20 years than is shown in figure 1 total holdings are now slightly below their level in 1985 and well below their peak in 1993 as percentages of gdp foreign holdings grew in dollars and as shares of gdp and by 2004 were larger than domestic holdings foreign holdings reached 150 of gdp in 1997 before falling to 100 of gdp in 2001 since then the constant substantial growth in foreign holdings has raised them to 168 of gdp this level of foreign holdings is likely to be surpassed in the next few years as the government continues to need foreign resources to help finance its large and persistent budget deficits total privately held federal debt will continue growing as long as the government has deficits whether it grows or shrinks as percentage of gdp depends on the relative rates of growth of privately held debt and gdp figure 3 annual change in

figure clearly shows the rise in purchases of federal debt by foreign holders particularly after 1994 while domestic holder purchases became smaller and smaller before turning crs4 negative5 over the four years that the government had surplus 19982001 net private holdings fell domestic holdings fell in three of the four years foreign holdings fell in two of the four years since 2001 domestic holdings of federal debt have barely changed in dollars and remain below their 2000 level foreign holdings increased steadily and rapidly in each year since 2001 as result foreign holders have purchased debt equal to 98 of all privately held federal debt sold by the treasury since 2001 figure 4 change in holdings by fiveyear period fy1985fy2005 figure 4 shows the change in holdings by fiveyear period as well as for the entire 20year period the far right section of the figure the data show domestic holders purchased the majority of the debt in the first two fiveyear periods but reduced their holdings in the second two fiveyear periods over the last two periods foreign holders purchased more than all the net new federal debt issued by the government this was done by purchasing federal debt sold by domestic holders both domestic and foreign holders of privately held federal debt ended the 20 year period with more federal debt in dollars than they held at the beginning of the period foreign holders almost tripled their holdings as share of gdp domestic holders reduced their holdings by almost half as percentage of gdp foreign holders absorbed almost threequarters of the net federal debt issued over that period domestic holders absorbed the rest see the last section of figure 4 table 1 shows foreign and domestic holdings of privately held federal

decline since 1995 over the 20 years privately held debt grew by 189 domestic holdings grew by 61 and foreign holdings grew from small starting amount by 828 foreign holdings comprised 73 of the total increase in private holdings while the increase in domestic holdings made up 27 in the first half of the period between 1985 and 1995 the shares of the increase in privately held debt were reversed with domestic holdings producing 70 of the increase and foreign holdings producing the remaining 30 after 1995 total private holdings grew domestic holdings fell while foreign holdings grew rapidly

consequences of increased foreign holdings of federal debt the increase in foreign holdings of federal debt has held down domestic interest rates preventing the crowding out of investment that might have otherwise occurred as result of large federal deficits without the inflow of funds into the financial markets from foreign investors competition for the available funds in the domestic financial markets by investors and the federal government would raise interest rates the increased government demand for financial resources to finance the deficit in the absence of inflows from overseas reduces the resources available crs6 to the private sector crowding out private investment instead when foreigners finance the deficit exports get crowded out through larger trade deficit there is firm consensus among analysts over the longerterm effect of increased foreign holdings of federal debt and other us assets although unlikely the possibility exists for adverse economic repercussions if foreign holders were to engage in rapid large scale diversification out of dollar assets6 this could cause collapse in the dollars value putting the economy at risk of recession under more orderly divestment of foreign holdings interest rates would still rise and investment would be smaller but recession could be avoided supporting the slower diversification away from dollar assets is the tendency of foreign holders of treasury securities to be very stable in their holdings once purchased foreigners tend to hold onto us treasury securities at this time there seems little prospect that foreign holders of treasury securities will move away from these dollar assets factors supporting the value of the dollar include the rapid growth of wealth and large pools of savings in emerging economies and oil exporting countries these create strong demand for low risk and liquid wealth savings options something the us financial markets provide in abundance including us treasury securities which are particularly important option for foreigners second factor is the large and growing amount of treasury debt held by foreign central banks which are less prone to sudden portfolio adjustments than private sector holders third factor is that the us borrows in dollars our own currency so any exchange rate movements do not change the cost measured in dollars of our interest payments or principal payments to foreigners an examination of the data and the economics of the situation indicates that the levels of foreign holdings of federal debt are currently neither threat nor problem for the united states 6 such action would have negative effects on the value of dollar assets still held rapid diversification away from dollardenominated assets could prove costly to the country
