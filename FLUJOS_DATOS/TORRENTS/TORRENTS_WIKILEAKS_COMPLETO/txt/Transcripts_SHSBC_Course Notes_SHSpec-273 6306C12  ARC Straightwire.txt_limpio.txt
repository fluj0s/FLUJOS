6306c12 shspec273 arc straightwire arc straightwire is the oldest broadnature repetitive process it is possibly the first repetitive process the arc triangle was originated in july 1950 in elizabeth nj it was expanded in september or november of 1950 at the hubbard dianetic research foundation in angeles it was an important tool for understanding the mind it is best described in notes on the lectures see pp 916 the arc triangle is the most fundamental statement of significance although it also embraces mest when prime postulate impinges on mest it becomes involved with arc the mest can be in the physical universe or in the time track affinity is so much itself and so relative that we get into difficulties trying to interpret it in an auditing command affinity embraces everything from the knowtomystery scale it is feeling for or feeling with or lack of those it has connotations of feeling about it is not enough to say emotional response sympathy and empathy come into it it is very broad and new concept if you will substitute the knowtomystery scale for affinity and use the words emotion and misemotion pcs will respond to it the emotions scale being just part of the knowtomystery scale is included in affinity the word affinity is really inadequate to embrace the whole concept because the concept has not been expressed in any language how many words can be used in command to express the concept of affinity lots everything on the knowtomystery scale can be used including the whole tone scale we find the pc chronically situated at one of these levels and that is the level to which he will respond in processing reality could pertain to significance alone as in his reality is poor or to actual chunks of matter reality is normally considered to consist of considerations about something or someone on up to the more solid concepts of matter energy space and time in clearing this word you will have less trouble than in clearing affinity unless the pc is really in thought but if you bad to vary it you would have harder task on your hands you would have to specify which part of mest you meant or which consideration communication is anything that fits under the communication formula it involves cause effect duplication etc in clearing communication you could specify which type or kind you meant you could use various parts of the communication formula in the third c command of arc straightwire clearing commands doesnt just mean can the pc define the word it is matter of substituting words in the command so that the pcs level of reality is met by the command the question we should ask is which word communicates to the pc what we are trying to communicate to him r and c make understanding when combined this was worked out mathematically in the fall of 1950 they actually compute mathematically when the pc cognites he has reached point of arc expressed as new understanding you wont get cognition if you omit one of the legs of the arc triangle if you run only r and c and not you dont get cogs if you wish to raise any one point that is low you can and should work on the other two points that is terribly valuable datum that must be observed in any arc process any point that is overrun or more difficult will give you trouble unless you preserve the balance amongst the three one leg will ever flatten by itself it is the three that you are trying to flatten so flatten all three in flattening process you can run it to 1 three equal comm lags 2 cognition leave the process right there dont ever overrun cog for instance dont put in the last midrud if the pc cognites on the nexttolast the arc processes unflatten easily so if you go past cognition the process will be unflat 3 ta motion runs out for arc processes this is the least reliable and the most desirable you can run by blowdown but you cant depend on ta motion to run out at the same time on each leg the way to flatten one leg is to give equal time to the other legs not to beat the slow one to death the first thing that arc straightwire was found to do was to break neurosis if it is going to have that effect it will work fairly fast the only difficult cases on the 1950 positive process are the ones who ground down to finite number of answers and gave those over and over without ever cogniting the reason for this is that their positive arc moments are quite few and they run out quickly they are pleasure moments and wont flatten you have to run the reverse side of it around 1958 lrh started running lot of reach and withdraw the way 1q was being raised was to run what could you withhold on someone funny phenomenon or you could plunge people into an engram and run it half way that will also raise iq scores as person who needs mass to think gets more mass to think with the upsets you run into on case are not the cases pleasure moments they are times of separation and individuation the most fundamental forms of arc breaks are 1 times when the pc was knocked away from being part of things 2 times when the pc was forced to part of things that he wanted nothing to do with his power of choice to connect or disconnect was overthrown this gives an arc break he was there but didnt want to be there or he wanted to be there but couldnt be there an implant is the biggest kind of arc break you can run recall an arc break on someone and it will run him into implants into times when he was held in place where he didnt want to be and told things that he didnt want to hear fundamental overthrow of his power of choice the arc straightwire processes were revised to saw out pieces of implants in order to help handle the helatrobus implants lrh discovered that the big midruds see hcob 8mar63 use of the big middle rudiments or the 18button prepcheck mush an engram they mess it up spoiling the record the engram frays around the edges it turns into pure energy without giving the pc any memory of what happened in the incident this showed that if you were going to use big mid ruds and big prepchecks on pcs stuck in engrams you werent going to unstick them you need steam shovel not hand shovel thus the negative arc processes were invented negative arc processes do handle implants lrh also discovered that pc is operating on entanglements with the physical universe it is one thing to bail him out of this and another thing to get him to look at his considerations about being entangled its not what happens to person that is important it is his considerations about it that count people especially sociologists get caught up in the idea that the environment determines peoples states of mind this is the philosophy on which foreign aid is based power of choice is senior to this by miles it has to do intimately with r and c enforced r or or c will wreck the triangle but given the same environment and predicament two people can have quite different reactions the goodness or badness of the surroundings doesnt necessarily reflect in the happiness or unhappiness of the inhabitants this messes up social planning because the happiness of the individual involves his preferences and his considerations about his surroundings whether or not he has arc for them the pc has had all these preferences and considerations present with regard to all his circumstances all up and down the track that is an adequate statement of power of choice this raises the question of whether there is such thing as an ideal state or condition in scientology the possibility of such state exists as it has never existed before in the universe an ideal state is state that someone wanted to be in over which he had full power of choice the attainment of happiness for pc is parallel to attaining clear the two factors are 1 the environmental conditions of the pc 2 the pcs r and c with regard to the matter energy space time and postulates of his condition this is channel that has remained fundamentally unknown to this universe these are born out of an interplay between the pcs postulates and the experiences he has netted we are still on an interactive basis between postulates and conditions of experience the persons power of choice is his affinity reality and communication with regard to set of circumstances existences or environments we should give this fact more attention in processing we needed process that could easily be ground out by the hour by any old auditor but which would give fantastic results arc straightwire approaches this ideal as process though it does require some skill and it can be done very wrong arc straightwire does give fantastic results although unfortunately it does not go the whole route because it doesnt actually handle the conditions of existence it only handles pcs attitudes reality and power of communication relative to these conditions but it handles enough to cut away lower levels of case especially levels 4 5 and 6 see p 402405 above for description of the eight levels of cases at level 7 its usefulness is doubtful at level 8 it is useless it brings cases upscale to where they have their own time track to run and are able to run it at that point power of choice is less our concern because the pc believes now that his power of choice is alterable and that he can do something about his conditions now he can handle the real stuff that has aberrated him sooner or later too one has to actually handle the conditions of existence auditors who dont understand arc straightwire can dream up all sorts of wrong ways to do it for instance they skimp on one leg because the pc has trouble with it although cases at level 3 can run the process commands in the order 1 2 3 1 2 3 you will get more ta with the order 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 that is the only way it will run on lower level cases so you might as well run it that way with equal time on each leg until flat or run an equal number of questions on each leg to get over the fact that the pc may have long comm lags on one leg you are after similar amount of run for each you depend on the other two legs to fix up the tougher one letting them get out of balance defeats the process how long you should spend on each leg depends on the pc and how long he takes to flatten something listen for cog to end off on the number of variations that there could be is great always try to get the pc to run the simplest most fundamental version the one that is closest to pure r and c the less you change the command the happier the pc will be since this produces the minimal change of process if you find the pc struggling with wording get it changed early if you are going to change it at all good question for affinity is what attitude has been rejected dont change the question too much settle down for the long run make sure the pc has question he can run another keynote of arc straightwire is that it is always run muzzled the auditors sole concern is understanding and acknowledging what the pc says it is true that sometimes the pc will arc break if you dont talk with him but dont q and or change from an unflat process only talk with the pc to avoid arc breaks and dont violate the auditors code if you run into trouble you can put big mid ruds in on the arc process this wont mush an engram it takes chunks out of parts of the engram chain it picks up parts of the engram chain that belong to other chains anyhow dont try to run arc straightwire as cyclic process cycling to pt on every leg he hasnt been in pt for trillenia you can get him to pt any time by giving him the command move to pt date theoretically he will only get to pt when the process is flat the process is flat when all ruds are in on the process and it produces departure from the pcs clear read on any leg you are not really after this flat point with the process you are only trying to get part of the charge off so that the pc can run engrams remember that can unmoving tone arm early on in the process is meaningless ta has to be run in before it is run out during the course of running this process the ta may well go up and stick on each leg your main concern is is the pc answering the auditing command does he understand it can we keep it balanced so that we can bring him through it you can ask the pc is there any question or command you havent answered the process can be prefixed with any combination of words eg in auditing on your job or in marriage this makes it more powerful than problems intensive especially if it is assessed against the problem areas of the persons life taking an area that reads well the helatrobus implants contain words like remember and think so you avoid these in auditing commands as much as possible rougher cases will be happy to run this there are cases that cannot recall or remember levels 7 and 8 they need reach withdraw and cchs you can use these principles in discussing whether or not they wish to be here whether they like you whether they wish to talk to you using the above prefixes you can run arc straightwire as pt 2wc process
