sweeping amendments to derivatives law since the creation of the commodity futures trading commission cftc in 1974 provisions included major changes in the commodity exchange act cea regarding the regulation of exchangetraded futures contracts overthe counter otc derivatives and security futures contracts based on individual stocks which were previously prohibited the cfmas provisions generally followed the recommendations contained in november 1999 report by the presidents working group on financial markets which consists of the federal reserve the treasury the securities and exchange commission sec and the cftc1 the principal recommendations of the report were as follows to remove uncertainty about the legal and regulatory status of overthecounter otc derivatives bilateral transactions between sophisticated parties that do not involve nonfinancial commodities with finite supplies should be excluded from the commodity exchange act cea that is the cftc should have jurisdiction the otc derivatives markets should be allowed to adopt features of the cftc regulated exchangebased derivatives marketplace such as exchange trading and clearing houses and exchangetraded futures and options that are not sold to small public investors and that are based on financial variables as opposed to physical commodities with finite supplies considered more susceptible to price manipulation may not require regulation under the commodity exchange act the act should therefore be amended to let the cftc exempt financial futures and options from much of current regulation 2 apart from its substance the working groups repo rt was remarkable in that the four agencies which had history of jurisdictional quarrels unanimously agreed on redrawing of the regulatory lines the cfma was shaped significantly by the working groups report although it differed in certain important aspects the major provisions of the cfma are discussed below g14g142g144g138g149g561g5g142g155g157g138g146g151g157g162g561g143g152g155g561g21g160g138g153g156g561g138g151g141g561g17g143g143g556g142g161g140g145g138g151g144g142g561 g6g142g155g146g159g138g157g146g159g142g156g561 longstanding question in derivatives regulation was whether the commodity exchange act applied to contracts that were not traded on futures exchanges plain reading of the pre2000 law suggests that it did in 1974 congress gave the cftc exclusive jurisdiction over all contracts in the character of futures contracts and mandated that such contracts with certain exceptions should only be traded on cftcregulated exchanges 1 overthecounter derivatives markets and the commodity exchange act report of the presidents working group on financial markets

major dealers in this otc market were banks and securities firms and the principal instrument was the swap contract although swaps are clearly in the character of futures contracts they serve the same economic purposes and are often interchangeable the cftc did not move to assert its jurisdiction the ceas exclusivity provisions remained however and were seen as source of legal risk to the swaps market that is if court had ruled that sw aps were in fact illegal offexchange futures contracts trillions of dollars in otc derivative contracts might have been rendered void and unenforceable the cfma specifies that the cea does not apply to contracts between eligible contract participants which include financial institutions regulated financial professionals units of government nonfinancial businesses or individual persons with assets over 10 million and others whom the cftc may approve based on excluded commodities defined as financial products and indicators which are thought to be less susceptible to manipulation than physical commodities with finite supplies derivatives based on agricultural commodities however may be traded only on cftcregulated exchanges because of concerns about price manipulation corners and squeezes in those markets the cfma creates third group of exempt commodities which includes all commodities that are neither financial nor agricultural in todays markets these are primarily metals and energy products but derivatives introduced in the future will fall into the exempt category as well otc derivatives in exempt commodities may be traded by eligible contract participants without cftc regulation except that certain provisions in the cea against fraud and manipulation apply to these markets the cftc continues to have jurisdiction over exchangetraded futures contracts based on either excluded financial or exempt other nonagricu ltural commodities there are active markets in both exchangetraded and otc derivatives based on financial and energy products while the working groups report did not envision retail swaps market in which small investors could participate the creation of such market was considered by congress section 22 of s 2697 as introduced directed the presidents working group to prepare report on the possibility of marketing swaps to individuals hr 4541 as reported by the house banking committee directed bank regulators to draft rules that would permit the establishment of retail swaps market the version of hr 4541 passed by the house did not include such provisions the cfma as enacted directed regulators to study the issue the working group issued report in december 2001 finding that there was commercial interest in buying or selling retail swaps and therefore need for congress to establish regulatory framework g7g161g140g145g138g151g144g142g561g22g155g138g141g146g151g144g561g138g151g141g561g5g149g142g138g155g146g151g144g561g152g143g561g21g160g138g153g156g561

from the cea separate exemption permitted trading of certain otc contracts based on energy products outside the cea under the swaps

trading requirement and other cftc regulations as long as they met several conditions that distinguished them from exchangetraded contracts among the conditions was requirement that swaps must be bilaterally negotiated agreements and not traded on an exchange or exchangelike facility open to multiple buyers and sellers however in the late 1990s there was interest in creating multilateral swaps exchanges and at least one such facility began operations an exchange where bids and offers would be exposed to large number of market participants could bring more liquidity to the swap market and make price information more widely available allowing businesses and others to manage their financial risks more efficiently and economically the cfma permits the use of exchangelike electronic facilities for the trading of otc derivatives based on excluded financial commodities otc electronic trading facilities are also permitted for the exempt commodities energy minerals etc with some cftc oversight g5g149g142g138g155g146g151g144g561g10g152g158g156g142g156g561 the 1993 exemption removed swaps from cea regulation so long as contracts were not guaranteed by centralized clearing house as exchangetraded futures and options are in other words to qualify for the exemption each party to swap had to bear the risk of the opposite partys default clearing house where number of dealers guarantee all contracts and collectively assume the risk of default could increase confidence in the market and reduce the risk that the failure of single large swap dealer would have repercussions throughout the financial system as in the case of swaps exchanges many market participants feel that clearing houses would be beneficial to the market the cfma provides for the establishment of clearing houses for otc derivatives establishes certain regulatory requirements for them and allows their operators to choose whether to be regulated by the cftc the sec or banking regu lator in the two years following enactment of the cfma neither exchanges nor clearing houses have supplanted to any major degree the existing dealer market structure

commodity exchange act provided for uniform onesizefitsall system of regulation of futures trading by and large institutional and professional trades were regulated the same as trades involving small public customers and it made difference whether the underlying commodity was corn natural gas or an interest rate the cfma replaces this uniform system with threetiered system of regulation the cfma authorizes registered futures exchanges to create two new types of markets which would be subject to less regulation or virtually regulation depending on who is allowed to trade thus there are now three types of futures market permitted by law first are the markets designated as contract markets contract markets are subject to generally the same degree of regulation as pre2000 futures exchanges to qualify for contract market status an exchange must follow 17 core principles to maintain fair open and competitive markets

customers are generally confined by the cfma to markets of this type second the exchanges may establish derivatives transaction execution facilities these dtefs could offer only contracts based on commodities whose deliverable supply was nearly inexhaustible where manipulation was highly unlikely or where there was underlying cash market as in certain financial indicators rates or ratios in addition eligible traders would be limited to eligible contract participants and to others who traded through futures commission merchant or broker that belonged to clearing house and had net capital of at least 20 million dtefs must register with the cftc but the gree of regulation would be less stringent and comprehensive than that applicable to contract markets 8 core regulatory principles apply rather than 17 third and finally the cfma provides that market where all contracts are based on excluded commodities and where all traders including brokers customers are eligible contract participants can be an exempt board of trade exempt boards would not have to register with the cftc at all and would be exempt from all provisions of the cea except for antifraud and manipulation rules however if the cftc determines that an exempt board has become significant source of price discovery that is if this derivatives market sets prices in the underlying cash market it can require the board to disclose daily trading data as of early 2003 the exchanges have not moved to create exempt boards of trade or dtefs in other words futures trading continues much as it was before the cfma

over futures and options based on securities and stock indexes between the cftc and the securities and exchange commission sec one provision of shadjohnson is ban on futures contracts based on single stocks hr 4541 as introduced permitted such contracts to be traded on futures exchanges with certain restrictions the cftc was to be the primary regulator but was required to consult with the sec before approving singlestock contracts and the sec was to receive price volume and other market data the sec would have had enforcement authority regarding insider trading price manipulation and other violations of the securities laws that might involve futures on single stocks finally the federal reserve would have authority to set margins for singlestock futures as it does for stock index futures and stocks themselves but could delegate this authority to an intermarket board including the cftc and the sec s 2697 as introduced contained similar provisions regarding the regulation of singlestock futures but would have permitted the trading of singlestock futures on stock exchanges as well as on futures markets s 2697 also specified that any market where singlestock futures were traded would have to maintain realtime audit trail of all transactions in those contracts trading of singlestock futures raised questions of regulatory jurisdiction would they be traded on stock exchanges futures exchanges or both would traders be subject to securities regulation futures regulation or both hr 4541 as reported by the agriculture committee viewed single stock futures as futures contracts to be traded on futures exchanges under cftc oversight the house commerce version of hr 4541 on the other hand treated singlestock futures as securities and gave the sec the primary regulatory role in september 2000 the sec and cftc httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20560g22g145g142g561g5g152g150g150g152g141g146g157g162g561g8g158g157g158g155g142g156g561g15g152g141g142 g155g151g146g163g138g157g146g152g151

regulated the two agencies coined the term security futures for single stock or narrowindex futures contracts the agreement called for them to be traded on both stock and futures exchanges with all traders subject to the core principles of both futures and stock regulation clearing houses that cleared security futures would have to be linked and margin requirements for security futures would have to be at least as high as margins for comparable stock options transaction fees that apply to sales of stock and stock options would not apply to security futures the final cfma incorporated the cftcsec agreement except that securities transaction fees will apply the tax treatment of singlestock fu tures resembles the treatment of stock options which are taxed under normal capital gains rules rather than that of standard futures contracts which receive special treatment the law permitted trading of security futures to begin one year following enactment but the process of writing

reported hr 4541 the principal amendments were 1 to permit us futures brokers to sell certain foreign stock index futures contracts traded on foreign exchanges to us citizens and 2 to require otc derivatives clearing houses to register with some regulatory agency registration was voluntary in the bill as introduced hr 4541 was then sent to the committees on commerce and banking on july 20 2000 the house commerce committee marked up hr 4541 the commerce version gave the sec considerably more authority over singlestock futures than did the bill as introduced including the power to set margin requirements differences between the commerce version and the agriculture committees included 1 the commerce bill allowed singlestock futures to be traded on stock exchanges as well as on cftcregulated futures exchanges 2 commerce would have allowed the sec to enforce the insider trading rules that apply to stocks on futures exchanges where singlestock futures were traded and 3 the commerce version required the national futures association to establish suitability standards for traders of single stock futures on july 27 2000 the house banking committee marked up hr 4541 its version would have 1 permitted the development of retail swaps market outside of cftc regulation provided that the contracts were offered by bank to customers with over 5 million in assets and that
