assistance transition initiatives and international disaster and famine assistance for the most part nongovernmental organizations tend to exclude economic support funds esf from their definition of core development assistance for two reasons first there is the perception that esf is given to strategic allies regardless of need largely due to histor ic levels of esf that have gone to such countries as egypt and israel second sizeable porti on of esf funds has been used for budget support rather than development projects on the ground the characterization that esf does not promote development is diffi cult to make because some esffunded programs have the sa or similar purposes as those funded by da the fy2008 budget request proposes major change by transferring some programs
