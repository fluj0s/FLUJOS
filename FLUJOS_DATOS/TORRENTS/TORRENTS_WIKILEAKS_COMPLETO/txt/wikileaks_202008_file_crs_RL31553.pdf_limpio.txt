nine pork packers who currently own livestock would have had to divest if the ban had been adopted other packers that exceed the 2 threshold do not currently own livestock and would have been unaffected the ban was first proposed during mar kup of the farm bill in the senate agriculture committee where it was not adopt ed in subsequent floor action the ban was adopted as floor amendment nd withstood another am endment to have it removed the ban was one of the more contentious issues during conference with the house farm bill hr 2646 with house conferees generally opposed to it the ban was dropped during conference with managers agreeing the issue warranted further investigation supporters of the ban belie ve it will limit packers ab ility to manipulate the market and would improve farmers prices and access to livestock markets they are concerned about the pace of vertical integration in the livestock industry and believe the ban is way to stop or slow down vertical integra tion opponents of the ban argued that the ban would reverse ma ny of the production efficiency gains made by the livestock industry in recent years through closer packerproducer alliances at the least they contend it would create turmoil in the industry because packers and producers would have to undo many relationships built over time several economists and wyers have written analyses of the proposed ban those studies have added to the discussi on but did not provide conclusive answers about the potential effects of the ban supporting papers argued the ban would provide more control to producers and ra ise livestock prices while opposing papers argued that the ban would fail to raise livestock prices and would increase market uncertainty since the farm bill the proposed packer ban continued to generate legislative interest in the 107th congress hr 5247 s 2021 s 2867 with potential amendments to the agricultural appropriations bill discussed the senate agriculture committee held hearing

numerous smallersized operations toward fewer and larger ones vertical integration refers to the integrating of successive stages of the production and marketing functions under the ownership or control of single management organization for example much of the broiler industry is highly vertically in tegrated in that processing companies own or control the activities from production and hatching of eggs through the growth and feeding of the chickens to slaughter processing and wholesale marketing 2 there is official definition for captive supplies but the term generally refers to animals that are committed to or are owned by packer more than 14 days prior to slaughterlivestock proposed ban on ownership and control by packers background increasing vertical integration in veral key agrofood sectors has prompted widespread concern about the effects on individual producers and the longterm impacts on the us agricultural system th livestock industry and the hog sector particularly has experienced an increasin g trend toward conso lidation and vertical integration in recent years1 this trend follows path set by the poultry industry since the 1950s when the broiler industr grew rapidly and became vertically integrated within the livestock industry processors especially are consolidating and becoming more vertically integrated processors seek to vertically integrate in order to ensure steady supply of consistent quality animals for their plants to attain the necessary control to achieve such supply processors may raise their own livestock or contract with individual producers rather than purchase livestock with varying characteristics off the spot market thus producers who sell on the spot market may face lower demand and lower prices for their livestock producers who face fewer marketing options and less compe tition for their livestock have expressed c oncern about captive supplies2 they believe packers are using captive supplies to manipulate market pr ices that are more favorable to packers and less favorable to producers that is as packers buy fewer animals on the spot market reported prices longer accurately reflect prices paid for majority of livestock many producers feel this reduction in price transparency works to their increasing disadvantage relative to packers contract prices typically are tied to spot market prices thus packer has financ ial incentive to buy or not buy on the spot market not only to reduce spot prices but also because livestock bought on contract are priced indirectly through the spot ma rket some producers have suggested that one remedy to captive supplies and the pe rceived market manipulation is to ban packer ownership and substa ntial control of livestockhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31553crs2 in response to calls from some producer s the senatepasse d farm bill s 1731 hr 2646 as amended february 13 2002 contained provision section 1043 johnson amendment that would have dded new section to the packers and stockyards act ps act 7 usc 181 et seq to ban packers from owning feeding or controlling livestock for more than 14 days prior to slaughter an additional provision section 1072 grassl ey amendment aimed to clarify that the ban on control applies to the extent that the producer is longer materially participating in the pr oduction of livestock coope ratives or entities owned by them would have been exempt from the ban if majority of the ownership interest in the cooperative was held by active cooperative members who own feed or control livestock and provide them to the coopera tive for slaughter the ban also would have exempted producerowned or controlled packers that slaughter less than two percent of national nnual slaughter of each livestock the senate provision required that packers owning or controlling animals on the date of enactment had to be in compliance within 1 18 months in the cas of hog packers or 2 180 days in the case of all other livestock including cattle sheep horses mules and goats the ban did not apply to the poultry industry specific packers affected by or exempt from the ban

senate farm bill s 1628 where it was defeated 912 on december 13 senator johnson offered the measure as floor amendment to the co mmitteereported nate farm bill s 1731 where it was accepted 5146 on december 19 senator craig who had voted in support of the johnson amendment stated he was concerned that the ban would restrict certain types of contracts commonly used and that he would oppose the ban adopted on the floor much of the controversy surrounded the word control which so had interpreted as applying to all animals purchased under contracts subsequently on february 7 2002 senator craig offered an amendmen t to replace the johnson amendment with usda study to be completed within 270 da ys of enactment of the farm bill to determine the impact of ban including effects on producers

location of packing facilities to clarify that control was not intende d to ban all contract s senator grassley offered seconddegree amendment on fe bruary 8 that provided complete substitute for the craig amendment and kept the ban the grassley amendment banned packers from owning feeding or having operational managerial or supervisory control over livestock to such an extent that the producer is

respectively and had mixed positions on this legislationaffecting livestock producers such as agribusiness consolidation and livestock marketing issues supporters of the ban supporters of the ban argued the ban would limit packers ability to manipulate the market and would improve farmers acce ss to livestock markets ban supporters argued packer ownership stifles compe tition because packers who own livestock can use their own animals to depress livestock market upturns in their view banning packer ownership and control would force packers to compete against each other in the open market and raise prices paid to producers supporters cautioned against using strict economic efficiency when evaluating effects of the policy and instead to focus more on market power of companies they expressed concern about the pace of vertical integration and the loss of open markets and feared that the end result will be the loss of independent producers w ith market dominated by few large companies the ban was supported by such groups as the american farm bureau federation afbf the national farmers union nfu the livestock marketing association lma and some state associations of the national cattlemens beef association ncba and the national pork producers council nppc6 opponents of the ban opponents of the ban argued that it would reverse many of the production efficiency gains that had come about through closer packerproducer alliances packers have pushed for consistent pr oducts to add value and meet consumer demands in this view packers contract with producers to ensure supply to meet meat demands from retailers who want fo rward pricing weeks and months before delivery in order to improve their busine ss planning opponents of the ban argued that it would disrupt supply chains by making risk manage ment and production contracts for livestock illegal developing branded market would be hurt in their view because genetics and ma nagement practices affect meat qualities and packers would have control over such factors moreover they contend that the ban particularly may hurt the emerging natural or organic market for livestock because packers would be prohibited from specifying veterinary care eg administering or not certain drugs anima l handling practices etc in contracts opponents of the ban further argued that producers legally could have assured market for their livestock until the last two weeks before slaughter further they believed the ban would hurt the livestock industrys competitiveness domestically and internationally because

their state organizations supported it 8several different types of contracts exist in the livestock industry with differences in packerproducer control forward contracts are one type of contract and may allow producer the most control over the production of livestock forward contracts specify that producer will deliver to packer certain number of animals on certain datebe free to pursue economic efficiencies prohibiting various linkages between producers and packers would result in redu ced coordination efficiency and global competitiveness of the us beef and pork industries they argue opponents also expressed concern about the bans likelihood of forcing ma ssive asset divestitures by companies flooding the market with livesto ck and other assets as packers divested animals feedlots and other production facilities the ban was opposed by the american meat institute ami the national meat association nma and the national organizati ons for ncba and nppc among others7 defining control much disagreement stemmed from the definitionimplication of control in the proposed ban at issue was whether th ban on control woul d ban all types of contracts between packers and producers supporters of the johnson amendment argued the ban would not prohibit forward contracting but would prohibit packers from directing how livestock are raised8 operational control provides the packer the ability to dictate nearly every detail of production and marketing such as the facilities nutritional and veterinary decisions as well as providing the packer 24 hour access to the livestock forward c ontracts do not give managerial and operational control to packers therefor supporters argued forward contracts would continue to be allowed opponents of the johnson amendment argued the ban may prohibit livestock producers from using forward or futures contracts and would prohibit producer packer joint ventures if producers commit th eir livestock to the operation because it might constitute packer owne rship or control opponent s said the ban would create legal questionuncertainty at the least nd this uncertainty would bring in doubt the future of such operations and negatively imp act packer interest in such operations if the ban became law opponents argued ther would be lawsuits alleging that some arrangements give packers too much contro l and that courts interpretation might be different from legislators intent langua ge that proponents offered to clarify their intent regarding contracts in cluded reference to material participation but that did not

contended that the use of the term materially participating was meant to be the same as used in the irs code 1402a whic h refers to payment of selfemployment taxes material participation is concept

211a and the rules governing passive loses irc 469 all utilize the term material participa tion but have diffe rent definitions the most important factors in finding ma terial participation for purposes of the selfemployment tax and the social security act are assumption of economic risk significant financial commitments to the capital requirements of the business and final decision making authority the tax emphasizes regular consultation and substantial participation in final mana gement decisions pattern of onsite inspection and financia l contributions the most rest rictive definition is used for determining passive sses and sets out very specific hourly and yearly requirements that must be met to be found to be materially participatin g the least restrictive is the definition used in the social security act the different uses of this term suggest that it might be prudent for authors of any future proposal of packer ban to incorporate definition of the term or at least specifically refer to what other definition is intended studies several analyses were done on the pack er ban four studies in particular received considerable attention in the press and from

pork packer ownership feeding or control of livestock10 eight agricultural economists from seven universities interpreted the johnson amendment as prohibiting pork nd beef packers from feeding and from making any arrangement with livestock producers to acquire their livestock more than two weeks prior to slaughter including contracting marketing agreements and any promise of delivery these economists concluded that livestock prices wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31553crs8 11 ra mceowen pc cars tensen and ne harl 12 gray k foster and m boehlje purdue agricultural economics report march 2002 13 j connor pc carstensen ra mceowen and ne harlnot increase with the ban because there is almost scientific research concluding that packer ownership or control hurts producers they speculated that the ban would block producer access to new brande d product lines that offer producers larger share of the consumer dollar othe r benefits of contracting in their view include reduced price risk enable produ cers to obtain more favorable terms on financing ensure timely market outlet and reduce costs of price discovery 2 proposed legislative ban on packer ownership of livestock mischaracterized by economists11 responding to the first paper three agricultural economists and lawyers argu ed that the johnson amendment would not ban all agreements between packers and producers so long as the packer did not exercise control over the manner in which livestock are produced in their view packers still would be able specify in contracts the characteristics they want in the livestock they buy forward contracts nd pricing agreements typically do not give the integrator managerial or operational control of the farming operation or control of the productiontomarketing cycle accor ding to their analysis instead such contracts commonly provide the packer with only contractual right to receive delivery of livestock in the future 3 implications of banning packer ownership of livestock12 paper written by three agricultural economis ts at purdue university argued that vertical coordination in the livestock indus tries is driven by changes in consumer demand and producers desire to impr ove the riskreward sharing between themselves and packers the authors cont ended that the ban could increase packers market power since it likely would lead to an increase in contracting and the new market would be one for contracts rather than for live animals with more producers seeking those contracts the potential for packers to extract price discriminating rents from the producers is not likely to decrease according to this assessment the purdue economists predicted that ban is likely to make only marginal changes in the structure of the pork and beef industr ies with few large producers creating tighter coordination linkages with pack ers and few limited geographical production areas being eliminated 4 the ban on packer ownership and feeding of livestock legal and economic implications13 four agricultural economists and lawyers wrote more extensive paper debating the economic and legal implications of the packer prohibition according to their analysis consolidation has led to an imbalance of power between meatpackers and independent producers similar concerns in the late 1800s and early 1900s led to passage of th sherman and clayton antitrust acts and the 1921 ps act the authors argued that congress was in an analogous position during the farm bill debate due to the st ructure and conduct of the contemporary meat industry the authors expressed concern that as indus try structure consolidateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31553crs9 14 sparks companies inc march 18 2002vertically and horizont ally efficiency gains are less likely to be passed on to either farmers or consumers concerns of market power thus rise in importance when packers have guaranteed supplies for which they need not bid they have far less incentive to bid aggressively in the open market according to the authors more significantly packers have an incentive to schedule the processing of packer owned and contracted livestock in order to negatively affect price trends since contract prices are tied to market prices this provides an incentive for packers to manipulate the market to which their contracts are tied packertopacker trades also can be method of collusion according to the paper when packers own and raise livestock they can sell that livestock to other packers thereby influencing the market price as well as communicating that price to each other by limiting packer ownership the authors contend that the ban would have removed the ability of packers to manipulate the market in such manner the authors argued that there was evidence that packer ownership of livestock is either the best or even n ecessary method to achieve efficiency gains contractual arrangements and other kinds of alliances can contribute significantly to the development of efficient and compe titive livestock production in their view contracts that do not strip the producer of material participation still can provide all the benefits of coordina tion and endproduct specifi cation that are commonly identified as desirable elements of current arrangements the authors believed the divestiture periods in the ban would allow an orderly exit from the feeding business because ca ttle require maximum of six months to feed from feeder cattle weight to slaughter weight packers would merely consume their own product during the divestiture peri od while refraining from restocking the same is true for hogs whic h require five to six mont hs from birth to slaughter with regard to competitiveness in the export market the authors argued there is credible evidence linking packer ownership to export successes the dominant economic factors in exports are monetary policy strong or weak dollar subsidies tariffs and the quality of private company marketing staff according to the authors 5 potential impacts of th proposed ban on packer ownership and feeding of livestock14 the sparks study was commissioned by the ncba and the nppc whose national orga nizations opposed the ban according to their report the findings were based on ex tensive reviews of economic studies and reports and on interviews with meat packer s livestock feeders livestock breeders agricultural lenders and others across the industry the study included review of vertical integration and structural change s in the livestock industry and potential impacts of the ban on packers producers lenders domestic demand and exports according to sparks expected impacts of ban across the sector likely would be large would begin immediately upon imp lementing the ban and could severely damage the sectors competitive position in us and overseas markets losses forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31553crs10 hogs across categories and including bot h temporary and continuing costs were estimated to range between 1674 billion losses for cattle across categories could be between 2735 billion the study concluded that primary comp etitive pressures among products are at the consumer level driven by basic change s in society and domes tic and international demands for quality convenience and services as lifestyle s evolve the ban would intervene at the processing and liv estock production levels where product competition is mainly reflected not wher it originates according to sparks it would impose unwarranted costs wher they would benefit one without strengthening demand efficiency technology or competition in this analysis the end results likely would be lower producer pr ices higher costs smaller markets and diminished returns for the foreseeable future according to sparks impacts likely would include highercost less efficient meat packing industry reduced pack erprocessor investment would reduce competitiveness of red meat products in the us market and in export markets highercost less efficient feeding and br eeding industries smaller meat packing industry as lower margins cause lesseffici ent packers to cease operations and reduce industry capacity smaller breeding and f eeding industries increased vulnerability for producers in isolated production areas and continuing advantage for poultry the sparks analysis contended that dur ing the transition period effects of the ban would include divestitures of packerowned livestock and packerowned feeding facilities curtailment of new marketing contracts by packers curtailment of financing by lenders revision of existing marketing contracts corporate restructuring and litigation sparks examination of the top 20 porkpacking companies as of 1994 according to their degree of direct ownership of livestock indicates traditional packers little or direct ownership of produc tion declined in importance from owning most of the sectors capacity to about onethird during the last two hog cycles the medium direct ownership group gr ew until the late 1990s but also has been declining the past two years the top 20 companies in 1994 declined to 12 firms the eight thatdisappeared with one exception did not own livestock they have left the industry or been assimilated by one of the 12 remaining firms in nine of the ten rapidgrowth stat there was significant component of packer ownership of hogs while in the re maining state strong contracting linkage was permitted between producers and packers in the ten states that had sharp declines in hog production none had extensiv packer investment in herds and only two of the ten had even modest degree of packer investment thus it appears that over the past decade swine breeding growth in the us has come only in areas where packer investment is encouraged while breeding herds in states with little or packer investment in pr oduction have declined according to the sparks studyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31553crs11 15for list of witnesses and testimony please visit httpagriculturesenategovhearingshearings_2002july _16__2002july_16__2002htmlsparks reported the growth in poultry as an illustration of the benefits of vertical integration rapid growth in demand for broilers was fueled by the capacity of poultry to compete with beef and pork for consumers dollars major factor was production efficiency and the capacity to offer better and better price values compared with other meats the single most defining characteristic of the us broiler industry is its high degree of ver tical integration processors control the production process either by owning or contracting each stage from breeding stock to marketready products while chicken producers have benef itted extensively from integration themselves they also have benefitted indirectly from the lack of integration in the beef and pork industrie s in the past and according to the sparks analysis livestock ban would turn back progress made by the livestock industries discussion while these studies add to the debate they do not provide conclusive answers about the potential effects of the ban because the authors have variety of backgrounds in itial assumptions and analytical perspectives thus the studies arrive at varying and sometimes contradictory conclusions as to effects of ban this point maybe more than any other serves to illustrate the difficulty of saying with certainty whether livestock producers will be helped or harmed by the ban even if supporters and opponents of ban could agr ee that concentration and market power are harming producers they may be lik ely to disagree on the proper methods to address those issues additionally it is uncertain how packers would react to ban in the hog sector there has been talk that packers may divest of processing facilities and remain as hog producers since they ge nerate more profits as producers than as packers even though the poultry industry would be unaffected directly by the ban some in that industry are concerned about bans future implications for them they are concerned that if ban is pl aced in the livestock industry the poultry industry may receive ban in the future current legislative activity senate agriculture committee the senate agriculture committee held hearing on july 16 2002 to review the proposed packer ban15 supporters urged action on packer ban

aimed to improving economic efficiencies while in their view current changes serve only to increase companies market and economic power supporters cautioned against singleminde d pursuit of economic efficiency and urged preservation of way of life prohibiting packer ownership would reduce concentration and allow access to co mpetitive market place for independent producers in this view

concentration issue and further study on the proposed ban would only delay action and cause dditional losses for producers witnesses opposed to the proposed ban urged caution and suggested federal study to report on potential eff ects of ban they argued that increased coordination and vertical integration have come about as the industr strives to meet consumer demands additionally they contend that c ontracting allows consistent pricing and shared risks between segments ie betw een packers and producers thus banning packer ownership would force the livestock industry to dismantle what is successful system additionally ban opponents argued it would be unfair to single out the livestock industry from forming relationships with raw material suppliers while the poultry industry and the
