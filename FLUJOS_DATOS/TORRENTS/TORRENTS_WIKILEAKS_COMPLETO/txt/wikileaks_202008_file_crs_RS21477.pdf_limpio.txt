compliance estimates for earned income tax credit claimed on 1999 returns february 28 2002 p 18the earned income tax credit eitc1 the eitc is refundable tax credit availabl to eligible workers earning relatively low wages under current law there are two categories of eitc recipients childless adults and families with childre n because the credit is refundable an eitc recipient need not owe taxes to receive the benefits however lowinco individual or family must file tax return to receive the eitc an eitceligible family may also receive portion of the credit in the form of advanced payments2 eligibility for and the size of the eitc is based on income age and the pr esence of qualifying ch ildren several policy and legislative issues are associated with the eitc compliance the use of refund anticipation loans marriage pena lty and poverty re lief family size compliance issue compliance with the eitc provisions has been an issue for the program since 1990 when the internal revenue service irs as part of the taxpayer compliance measurement program tcmp released study on 1985 tax year returns with the eitc the study concluded that there was an overclaim rate of 391 the overclaim rate represents the percentage of claimed eitc that was invalid some of these overclaims were recovered after the study by irs collection efforts later studies by the irs have resulted in lower overclaim rates th 1997 and 1999 tax return studies3 estimated that the unrecove red overclaim rates were 238 to 256 and 270 to 317 respectively these studies pres ented the rates as upper and lowerbound estimates because number of i ndividuals contacted as part of the studies did not respond in the 1999 study 249 of overclaims with the errors known were due to the child claimed not meeting the eitc requirements for qualified child the most common qualifying child error was that the child did not meet the residency test living with the tax filer for at least six months in the case of certain blood relatives or one year for other individuals the second most common error was the child not meeting the relationship to the tax filer test particularly in the case of foster children where the child did not live with the tax filers for the full year or was not cared for as the tax filers own child the definition of child prior to tax ear 2005 for the eitc was different from the definition of or requirements to claim ch ild as dependent for the personal exemption as result single parent living in multigenerational househol d may have been able to claim the child for the eitc while the grandparent or the childs nonresident parent may have been able to claim the child for the personal exemption and child credit and not the eitc to reduce the complexity created by the different definitions of child proposals were made by both the us department of the treasury and the joint committee on taxation to conform the definition of ch ild for purposes of the personal exemptionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21477crs3 4 for information on the new defin ition of child see crs report rs22016 tax benefits for families changes in the definition of child by christine scott 5

for the eitc met the residency requirement had resided with the tax filer for at least half of the tax year the precertification effo rt was converted to study of approximately 25000 returns expect ed to claim the eitc and combined with two other compliance studies related to the eitc 1 study of filing status and 2 an automated underreporter income study the consolidated appropriations act of 2004 pl 108199 required report to congre ss on the qualified child study the pre certification of child for th eitc residency requirement according to the irs5 the three studies uncovered nd prevented payment of more than 275 million in erroneous claims for the eitc with approximately 250 million of the 275 million from the automated underreporter study in the automated underreporter study the irs

nd the tax refund is not issued during the time period specified for the loan the tax filer ma be responsible for additional interest if there is an error on the tax return which reduces or eliminates the tax refund the tax filer may be responsible for repaying part or all of the principal amount of the loan for low income tax f ilers with an eitc irs inquires about the relationship or residenc of qualifying child may result in the tax filers refund being delayed for significant period of time or denied marriage penalty the structure of the eitc may depending on the relative income levels of

receive an eitc of 2853 for total of 5706 if they marry their combined income is 30000 and with two children the eitc is 2060 the eitc marriage penalty for the couple is 3646 the difference between
