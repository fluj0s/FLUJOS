3ga criss cross secondary prehav scale lecture given on 25 october 1962 all right this is lecture two saint hill special briefing course october 25 ad 12 now the experimental materialive given you very factual material so far in this lecture series tonight the experimental material consists of how do we find an entrance to this channel that leads to the rock and the goal now we should recognize that the pc will very often conceive he has seen and blown the rock because he has seen couple of dumbbellyou know these two spheres fly off very often these spheres fly off and he doesnt even observe them because hes inside the mass and theres an impenetrable barrier between himself and the outside of the mass these things very often fly off the outside of the mass and he doesnt see them but he happens to be located in fortuitous position and he sees pair of them blow off well hes already progressing very well down the channel if he sees this phenomenon and theynobody has reported to watching the rock go which i consider is very interesting that report has existed on it and that is why youll find continuously working with lines and telling you that you have to finish off clearing you see because theres more there to blow now you should recognize this channel on your meter looks like whole series of rock slams of high agitation but in actual fact is not series of rock slams thats just your meter manifestation dont you see its whole series of these dumbbells you see with their opposing forces its whole series of these things dont you see and looking at them in proportion as you would go down they are not inverted and getting smaller they are in actual fact getting bigger see theyre not growing as you process the person they simplythe earlier it is on the track the bigger they are you see so you enter it blowing small pairs and wind up blowing big ones see now it requiresit requires pretty good faith in the auditor on the part of the pc in order to list why well actually the pcs ability to confront is pc plus auditor versus the bank i give you the original thesis and when youve got the auditor plus the bank versus the pc hes got too much to confront in present time and he doesnt do any confronting the length of time in listing is directlyinversely proportional to skill of auditing in other words the greater and smoother the auditing skill why the less time theoretically it would take in listing because the pcs ability to confront is rising because he feels safe and able and so forth under the guidance of this auditor therefore you never jump pc you handle the pc very smoothly and very permissively in listing particularly too overwhelming an auditor activity while trying to find items at the beginning of case of course will seal off finding any items now that is said with reservations because when you think of this most of you right here right now have an adequate auditing presence and of the pc in order to achieve this fact im not talking about anything that is totally beyond you but the better your auditing presence and ability to handle the pc the easier it is for the pc to find items dont you see because you see his ability to confront is raised by the fact that somebodys helping him confront now help very easily goes on an inversion it gets covert help which is actually destructive theres real help high on the scale and of course like all things it has its lowerscale mockery you see this in psychoanalysm you do thats lowerscale mockery of help they tell the person all about it theyre helping him out all rightonly they dont see this as anything bad thats just builtin procedure well we know thats quite destructive thats evaluation and so forth so the pc has really got to be helped in other words hes got to be guided into areas where he can confront things and find out what they are hes got to be guided into areas where he can confront things and where he can find out what they are but hes got to be guided into those areasnot shoved beaten pummeled now what area are you guiding him into youre guiding him into this channel toward the rock when youre doing it by rock slam youre just guiding him in that direction and he goes in that direction and the first items you get are not the biggest items of the bank but theyre the items that the pc finds it feasible to confront at this particular time at this stage of his case he can confront those items now you find one item hes finallysays haha what do you know you know part of his cognition which he never speaks is hey you know i can look at this and think about it you know its locked out area its been locked out area to him and he all of sudden finds well hey what do you know i can get into that valence i can look at that valence haha it isnt as dangerous as i thought and thats sort of part of his cognition so he tells you all about it hes very interested in it you know here i am standing in the middle of this powerhouse with million volts flying all around and look atlooklook at i can talk to you and i can think in here haha you know theres bit of triumph involved in this dont you see because always before he has established this item at the level of reality his last intimate acquaintance with this item was dim memory of how awful it was in real life so therefore he doesnt want very much to do with it now he finds that the item can be confronted in the bank just as you get somebodyyou start him in through the beginning of the engramlet put it this way start him in at the beginning of the engram and hehe protests hehheh hehhehheh go through thatoh man go through that opera oh hahaha not uhhuh not and it takes little bit of skill to get him in there and get him going through this thing and he runs through it and the somatics run off and you do smooth job of auditing he eventually winds up haha what do you know that wasnt anything you know got the somatic confronted the thing gee what do you know you get the reaction as youyou probably had this ask somebody to look at something in the bank and they say oh im not so sure about that oh way most pcs you get are that way about their whole ease see so you the auditor are overcoming this first reluctance and that is the highest level of your skillovercoming that first reluctance to look there are all sorts of gradients weve had in the past on this we stress this much harder in the past than we have these days we kind of take it for granted that an auditor will be able to persuade somebody to look but actually there are all kinds of mechanisms whichyou can do this remember look at mewho am i that was your first auditor process look at who am 7 and you get pcs that are having bad time why they eventually come up in their level of confront and they say haha my auditor you know first recognition you know you were aunt grace and uncle bill and you were almost anybody you were policeman and god almightywhat you werent and then they eventually look at you you know and they say my auditor and you thought that was good time to begin the auditing session actually weve undercut this in many ways we dont demand that he confront the auditor by look at who am w we just sort of say well if youll not be too uneasy with i will show you piece of the bank you can confront you see now what can he confront well hell confront what hewhat registers on the meter it doesnt register on the meter he wont confront it now an example of this in your assessments an example of thisand very good exampleis the fact that early in auditing your pc will put items on his list which turn out not to be the item has cognitions or anything on it theyre just part of the list and now we find an item and then we find another itemwere still listing on more items you seeand we get down and maybe with the third item or something like this we find as one of the pcs items something he put on the first list see now this suddenly is his item you know black bear he says haha black bear oh yes i was down in camp one time and i all of suddenso and so and so and so on and yeahoh theyve been terrible to meand so on and thats probably why i have craving for sweets you know i often think of that and i getcatch myself every once in while doing this on tablecloths and that sort of thing yeah its probably right black bear what do youha well black bearwell thats funny why didnt this happen with the first list you know he put it down on the first list didnt he well why didnt we get it on the first list we got something else we probably got teddy bear in other words the more items we find the more the pc can confront see its his state of mind versus the actual mechanics of the bank now many philosophic schools of the past have erred in trying to say that it is 100 percent state of mind and that there is nothing else well where are these guys on the scale of confront see well let tell you that these things are theyre not imaginary they are dont you see one of your biggest arguments you will run into with some dean of psychology or something like this when youre talking about it ishis insistence on the imaginary character what youre handling the fantasy of this or hubbards fantasies about these things or something like that you know theyre totally unreal to him well in the field of well christian science gives you ne plus ultra on this wow all is mind and its nothing and the physical universe is nothing and there is more of that dont you see well look look the thing is see there is something in the bank you see it isnt that the pc gets afraid of biting it so that it bites him if you were to shove him in at it hard itd bite you understand you got the same thing as when you shove somebody into the tigers cage and he keepsif you were of this extraction of thought this just all is mind and there isnt anything else you know there is world there is mind all engrams are really just imaginary ridges you see dont exist these dumbbells ron is talking about are just conceptual things you get that all that kind of thing supposing you had that frame of mind as you had this poor joe outside of tigers cage and you said well now im going to throw you in the cage and he says yougogonnagogonna throw in the cage and you say yes yesits merely illusion tigers are just illusion you know therestheyre really not real and he says well looks awful damn real to and you say well just just calm yourself now calm yourself and just realize that if you have faith you have faith now why you can just go into that cage because you see tigers really dont exist you see the bars here are just an illusion and so forth and im just going to open the doorand the door thats an illusion too and supposing you did lose body body is just an illusion of one kind or another so what are you what are you raising so much fuss about and you finally sell this poor joe you see on the idea that there is tiger there is tiger cage its not dangerous you get the door open you pitch him in theres large snarl and piercing scream thatll teach him to buy your brand of religion you see he got et and somewhere up the track we find it as an engram see it even made real engram now supposing if he had an auditor sitting there supposing this had happened to him hed been persuaded on the notisness of it all and supposing he came up the track and got audited by an auditor said now well now there really isnt anything in the bank and this is just illusory and there isreally isnt anything there that bites you see and you can go into this with perfect bravery and because theres just nothing there you see thats all so on you throw him into this thing over his head with terrible insistence that he do this that or the other thingand it bites dont you see and this disillusions him hes got his second disillusion the truth of the matter is the meter is your best sorting out mechanism of this your meter wont give you something the pc cant confront well the reason it cant give youit wont give you something he cant confront is kind of interesting because if hes not in the vicinity of it it wont read see its kind of an idiotic reason you cant enter buildings unless there are buildings there to enter dont you see well you have fair guarantee that the pc can walk in that door with impunity if it will read nicely on the meter now slam on the meter is the mostest confrontingness that he can do at the moment so the first slam that you get on the pc is at one level of ability to confront the bank then you find second itemthats another new increased ability by having been increased by finding the first one and hell find bit more and the next one up the line hell find bit more he can confront dont you see i mean this new thing that he can confront is bigger and more beefy and more powerful than the first two you see and then the fourth one will be bigger and beefier and more powerful you see you see how it goes and itthis individual is actually increasing and oddly enough hes being met halfway because the bank thats there to confront is decreasing see so it makes very happy combination your pc doesnt have to grow nine feet tall all that fast see its good enough to be sixfoot tall and look at sixfoot bank because then your pc is next time is going to be six foot one and the bank is going to be five feet eleven dont you see you already unsettled this balance and then hes six foot two and the bank is five feet ten you see how youre approaching this so successful discovery of an item that the pc is permitted to cognite on is marvelous your problems intensives are absolutely phenomenal because the pc finds out he can confront this later section of his life with equanimity he discovers that he discovers he doesnt have to handle it with crush and protest and this and that and the other way see the problems intensive is very good gradient on this sort of thing but understand youre not asking him to confront anything very tough when you start clearing him by finding items and then finding his goal youre asking him to confront nice great big bangs see youre asking him to do quite bit so as you start on this procedure you should then fully expect to have some trouble because youre jumping at one fell jumpyoure asking the pc to do something the pc is very doubtful that he can do his confidence is just about well that tone of voice hehheh others can but i dont know iper theoryi can do this perfectly well theres nothing much to ityou just confront these items in the bank and i could confront almost anything i guess but you say who or what would not be part of existence well thats long tall order why does he get this reaction well the pc believes hes being asked to confront more because hes already kind of quasily aware of this spook standing over there see and youre saying well what isnt part of thatwhat isntwhat isnt over there therefore youre not sure see he isnt sure now therefore if any fumble is connected with clearing if theres any real fumble itll slow down the process you might even lose ground that you have to recover in other words it mighta badly audited pc is harder to audit than the pc who wasnt audited when it comes up to finding items and goals dont you see now he might have become convinced that he had less confront than he thought in the first place in other words he slid down in the well now fortuitously well let make this one point that the faster you clear somebody the easier it is so you see one of my efforts forward in all this is not just making it easy so you can do it im making it easier to do by your doing it faster dont you see thats part of it you take couple of years to do this job and youre going to have an awful time if only because of the intervening ptps so theinterestingly enough the faster you find goal the easier it is to find now that has only this proviso on it that your pc has got to be up to confronting some section of the bank where his goal is located now the mind runs with wings of thought through the bank you seei mean thetan you know thoughteasy he can pick thoughts out of this bank but he cant pick masses out of it see you can get the goal long before he can confront any masseslong before this see the goal will read but the goal tends to pull him into areas that make it pretty necessary for him to confront things and so youll find the goal easily and then the goal submerges if the pc is already pretty bankoverwhelmed its quite common to find the goal and then have the goal vanish and itll have to be laboriously prepchecked back into position again now i can assure you at once that the prepchecking of the goal back into view again is waste of time if it wont tiger drill in the best way to get goal to read is by prepcheck but if your prepcheck is hard or arduous and the goal has gone out easily youre frankly wasting time because somehow or another either through little bit of rough piece of auditing or something of the sort youve already heaved this pc into tougher spot than he can easily get out of now the reason why were balancing around lines and trying to get lines that are easy is not to get the pc in deeper than he can confront thats the problem of lines now your suddenly rising tone arm which goes up and sticks on series of listing linesas youre clearing the pc after youve found the goalis as really result of his getting too deep to confront it hes gone little bit further than he would really care to confront now doing it by prehav levellisting by prehav level gives us this monitoring influence how deep ean he confront well it reads on the meter so he can confront that deep i hated to have to come back to prehav scales but they have been come back to because all too often the pc left on his own with an arbitrary series of lines will get in deeper than he can confront and then the case stalls and sticks and takes forever to list and you go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and i finally had to make up my mind that we sacrificed the ease of listing guy off with prehav levels because its taking much longer than if we found some prehav levels to list him on see theres choosing between these two things you take series of arbitrary linessome pcs take so long on these things that it would have been infinitely faster to have found some prehav levels hence this slump back to prehav levels this is how deep can he look in the bank well he can look as deep as this level of doingness actually what youre finally going to run out of the bank is kill everybody for the hell of it see thats what youre going to confront up to something like that maybe it on this goal some kind or another just kill everybody for the hell of it thats going to be his feeling youre eventually going to get that feeling and where do you enter it not to talk to anybody with frown on your face see dont talk to anybody with frown on your face thatits an overt well of course your meter will register talking to people with frown on your face well he doesnt like that and he knows about it so hell run out talking to people with frown on their face and then you get some other lower level of other doingness or action of some kind and youll get down to being able to run that but if it shows up on the meter itll run see if you can get it on the meter itll run thats your crux of the matter arbitrary lines occasionally will throw pc in too deep and an auditor for instance who will take up an engram while listing ought to be shot because the engram probably isnt being confronted by the pc anyhow or wouldnt stick there itd blow see and an auditor suddenly listing and find great big juicy item that the pc just hints at and following the old theory that we must make the auditor confront and this pc has just hinted at tigers i wonder if i blahblah small cats iistriped beasts ii oh ii dont really care to put that item on the list at this time pussycats kittens so forth now the auditor would say well what were you going over there minute ago i was going over ai was justitjust something got very unreal got some sensation of some kind but whatwhat were youwhat were you trying to look at there well i justjustwell its right theres something there i really didnt really want to look at well look at it what is it well iiiim not sure that ii what is it confront it tone arm wheee case jammed he isnt ready for this till day after tomorrow see and hell go whizzing down the line and hell say carnivory tigers big tigers ferocious tigers tigers that want to get away tigers that run like hell tiger skins you get your gradients of approach as he gets deeper in clearing now when we say the entrance linesnot as the playwright would us it but the entrance questionweve got this pc the pcs been prepchecked n goals been found or goal has been found but its gone down with small bubble left on the surface of the sea goal found something happened pc had goal found the goal cant get anything to readthat sort of thing that the same case as just starting case down the channel we have then means of putting the pc closer to the goal masswise and in terms of mental reaction making him more capable of confronting the goal so his thought can fly around in that zone or area of the bank and pick the goal up again and we have both of these problems either picking the goal back up or the other problem of getting him closer to it or pointed in its direction on making him confront it these are the same problem in other words make the pc more capable of confronting the goal and putting him closer to the goal force him to confront and we do those two operations and theyre done by this series of assessment that weve called dynamic assessment by rock slam and were calling 3ga criss cross which is better descriptive terminology since were going to get an opposition terminal that he can confront an then were going to get ter maybe another opposition terminal and the maybe terminal that he can confront and then maybe another terminal an then maybe an opposition terminal that he ean now confrontand were just putting him within reach of where this goal is were just showing him which direction this is and the meter will show us because as long as we can go the track of the slam and follow the slam why were fine we dont care if those first things that he gets as items are highly conceptual you know we dont care if his first itemwe dont care if his fir item was dreaming see we dont care if his first item waswere n talking abouttalking about items see and itshe didnt get an item all we got this as an opposition to what hes doing this is lotthis is quite up the line then we get to an action we dont get an item solid mass we get 0 action see we get breathing see thatd be the action or then we get that an item its on his list so its an item dont think that your item itst reason i dont call them terms and oppterms is because they really dont have mass yet when you go at this gradient this is very very slow gradient but these things will all rock slam just as though they werethey were big massy things you see and then the fellow has got the idea of pen scratches see and finally he gets to the item and youve got him down the lineyouve got an opposition terminal now of tame horse see all these things will slam slam doesnt mean violenceit means whats the pc up to confronting because hesbutwhats he up to confronting with an effort get that thats differentiation see he can stand still at this point and gaze in spite of the snap crackle and pop going on around his ears see the bank is going zzzbingclickprenttowpow ssqqqusssspaawwwblmmpglmppglmpp glnkkglnkk and he ean sort ofyou know its like guy walking uphill against high wind he feels he ean make it but unless you get him pointed uphill against the high wind hell go around and confront things that are too easy to confront dont you see why itd take ten thousand hours of all things he ean confront the gradient would maybe be thousands of items between you see this first point you pick him up and the first item if you were just doing it on somesome queasy idea well what can you confront what would you rather not confront see youre getting him in that direction but you get thousand hours of auditing maybe to get him up to the point of your first item you actually find out for him that he can stand therehe actually gave you the items so he must be within reach of them see he can stand there in high electronic breeze man and he ean say thatthat is soup bone haha see feels brave you know great now you take him from that to the next thing well these happen to be key points on this channel if they slam because realize that hes approaching closer to the basic center of commotion which is caused by the basic terminals originated after he made the postulate see he made this postulate called goal and hes actually approaching the core of the situation and hes walking inwardhe isnt blowing outward and although its sort of uphill has lot of wind around here he sort of gets the idea trees going down every once in while you know house roof just went by hes sort of queasy about all this and all of sudden he sees soup bone and hes made it see because it was soup bone that was causing lot of commotion he can stand there and look at soup bone and know that its the source of tremendous amount of commotion you get the commotion commoting but eventually hes located the source it wasnt an evil witch who cast spells with soup bones see it was just soup bone see its actually devaluated at the moment he grasps it and cognites on it the mystery is gone off of itit doesnt look so tough to him now see he knows now see those are the things that are important so all right it doesnt matter how you enter as long as you enter it on slam slam registering on the meterno electronic windstorms going on little dirty needleprobably theres the soup bone to be gazed at and hes standing way over at the side there and hes examining this little green pebble and he knows the pebble hes heard of the pebble before its good safe thing to look at or it might very well be that its sabertoothed tiger hes only up to looking at the soup bone see and hes got this little bzzzbzzzoccasional dirty needle that goes on and off you know and if you said too strongly and violently all right weve assessed it all on down here now to sabertoothed tiger now why the hell dont you agree that that is your item youve added your force and power to the force and power residual in the sabertoothed tiger and youve got very overwhelmed pc he goes agggg because you let the tiger right in on him see sabertoothed tiger he knows it isnt real thats one of his basic mechanisms hes standing there with wideopen mouth and gleaming teeth and he says oh well its rug what do you want to look at the rug for rrrrr protest to hell with you see that kind of reaction not real later on youll get sabertoothed tiger and hell say yep tiger well tiger yeah yeah tiger big tiger bigger tiger going into tiger cavesrugs tiger rugs putting tiger whiskers in your gun case for luck yeah lots of uses for tigers we used to hitch them up to channels back in poohbah planet tell you all about them see but at this stage of the game on this assessment man hes not up to it so he tells you it isnt real it isnt so you get little tiny zzzz tiny needle see so you either have an item that it wouldnt do him any good if he could confront it like green stone or if he couldif he did see it by your trickery of auditing it would be huge and tough and too much for him and hed shut it right offjust like that you persuade him to see it and off it goes that doesnt mean why your rock slam turns on and off your rock slam turns on and off because hes saying well im not sure well ill get brave now ill looklook thereaha im not sure about that well ill lookuhhhh its awful murkah well we shouldnt get into that you know thats why it is hes suppressing it and hes protesting and hes doing this and that and all of sudden he says soup bone ahahahaha soup bone there it is perfectly comfortable now actually at that point the rock slam that hes confronting must be from something else deeper in the bank although you say soup bone youve turned his attention toward the center of the bank again and he gets the benefit of the rock slam but the soup bone now isnt rock slamming even though soup bone now turns on rock slamfollow closelysoup bone turns on rock slam and youll find that pcs very often get haunted by slamming items you havent found yet this is the bane of the auditor this is when you should take out your insurance that doesnt refuse to pay off in the event of suicide or something because thats mean man you start getting the pc that every time the pc has the slightest withhold has not told you all and you get wide slam youre going to find nothing but item after wrong item after wrong item after wrong item after wrong item theres going to be cognitions to amount to anything or the pc is cogniting and the pc feels all happy about it and is trying to please you you know pc though is getting better and slams and you just apparently find goals forever till you finally knucklehead get smart enough to go back to your last reliable item what was the last reliable item well you have to sort out the items youve found by what wouldnt you give to 299 on each item and find out if they turn on slam and if the item doesnt turn on slam then it wasnt an item even though it slammed when it did in other words you can be fooled by lurking item that the pc has not confronted but is straight in front of his face and itllevery time he picks up the slightest withhold didnt tell you that he actually was uncomfortable with his legs crossed at that moment youre reading fisherman you say fisherman the pc says well my legs arent very comfortable and you get slamslamslamslamslamslamslam and you say boy look at thatlook at that rock slam hohoho thats nice rock slam and you get the next item or two and you think the rock slam is merely persisted and then the pc gets little bit of withhold or like he says i wish i had drink of water and at that moment youre reading manatarms so it goes slamslamslamslamslamslamslamslam then you go back and reassess the list and you cant find any slams on it you tiger drill fisherman you cant find anything you tiger drill manatarms you cant find anything what happened well those are known as false items theyre slamming because the p theyre charged up enough to make rock slam on the part of the pcs actual item show up on them if he gets withhold at the same time theyre read you follow that real item slamstheres very easy rule on thisa real item slams when the rudiments are thoroughly in and real item will alwayscan always be coaxed to slam again within reason in the same session you ean coax the slam back in the same session false item slams only when the rudiments are out if the rudiments are wildly out why the false item will slam some more if the rudiments are then put in it doesnt slam see real slamming item slams only when the rudiments are in theres not ghost of dont knows or failed to reveals in the session or on the item and its for that reason that the exact proper procedure for nulling list is asking the pc the auditing question that youre going to ask him who or what and making your list of his answers and then nulling it down to the last threesometimes you cant cut it that close and its the last four and you suddenly notice that youre down that low and taking your last three or four items and then taking them one at time and thoroughly tiger drilling them tiger drill each onebig tiger seetiger drill them hard man oh yes work those things over coax them man because it may be in with the tiniest little tsk that disappears too as youre tiger drilling and you say oh theres nothing left on this item then you ask just that one more question and all of sudden it ticks again and you ask one more question then you get bright and you say in this session have you protested anything yes im protesting you using all of these rudiments and that sort of thing because they all seem to to be very silly well what are you doing what are you doing well of course each time you start to tiger drill im just hoping they wont be in im postulating they will not now be in you get all these little things sorted out and little minor casualties that you have and you get them all sorted out and all of sudden you look at that item and it goes slamslamslamslamslamslamslamslamlike crazy see and then the pc all of sudden gets failed to reveal it stops slamming you say whats the matter pc says well i was looking at it in your magnifying glass i was watching and i didnt tell you but i was looking at it hehheh the reflection in your magnifying glass it was slamming little bit wasnt it you say all right thank you very much and you say tiger slamslamslamslamno slam what happened well actually what happened mentally with the pc the pc is sort ofthey gotyou know they remind you of putting periscope around the doorjamb to look into the place you know and then they getthey get brave enough seethey get brave enough to eventually stick one eye around the doorjamb and then they get brave enough to open the door little bit wider you eventually got themget them brave enough to walk in the room see and every time they get unbrave they suppress they protest they dont want to look at it again and so forth so real item goes off when the rudiments go out false item is lurking around lets say you bypassed an item you should have found item 3 and you just didnt find item 3 instead of that you went off on wild tear did something very unusual picked one off of the hat got one off of the beginning goals this is mistake i made the other day and wasted about an hour and half of auditingget one off the goals of the session slamslamslamslam my god i looked this over as to reasons one couldnt get clear and all that sort of thing the second i got the rudiments in it all blew up it was the real item slamming the real item was slamming but neither the pc nor i could have told what the real item was at that particular time the real item required the pc to sit quietly so every time the pc sat quietly the real item turned on so if the pc was sitting quietly while giving the goals of the ses you know consciously sitting quietly while giving the goals of the session id get slam got the idea real cute this is your problem this is youryour problem is that if the pc is sitting in real item and youve monkeyed around with it and brought it up to maybeyouve found one and youve found twoyou should have found three but you didnt then three is liable to linger around and trigger every time the pc has withhold from you this should happen to you see the exact procedure then is to ask the pc the proper question list that thing out till the pc says there are more get your mid rudiments in ask the question to see if you get bang on the meter at the question being askedsee if it instant reads the question if it does make the pc list some more get on down to point where you can get the mid ruds in and get reaction on the question itself on the meter when this occurs be very happy that youve got complete list or total rudiments out you can always be certain about these things now having gotten that you go back and null the list with an appropriate question the questions are not all the same questions for all the same lists so lets not say the question at this point null it down to the last three or four items left inthats by eliminationand its instant read very sloppy loose instant read you know it ean happen before it ean even happen afterwardsif it disturbs the needle lf youre trying to do pc on dirty needle you ought to be spanked youve got to clean that needle up that needles got to be nice beautiful smooth flow before you do any list and that puts an awful burden on you because the pc is under very heavy agitation during this whole time the pc just stops talking to you for moment and says well i wont disturb the auditor and you get dirty needle see one of the ways of getting around that is did you want to say anything you know and dont try to keep your mid ruds in you see youri mean just dont keep punishing the pc with mid ruds or something like that be more graceful about the whole thing and here the needle was free and smooth and you say to shoot redcoats to shoot redcoats you know something like this we dont care what you were saying consider committing overts against redcoats is the way you would interpret it right this minute until im going to tell you this other and its very beautiful and you read this and you leave it it read instantly you left it in you left it and then all of sudden youre looking at this needle pattern you know and you cant read through it and what the hell and if you start chanting at the pc every time this occurs if this is the type of pc youre auditing in this session is there anything been invalidated all right in this session is there anything been suppressed in this session has anything been protested in this session so on every time you get dirty needle i tell you on some pcs youre not going to be doing anything but sitting in session and saying in this session on and on and on and on and on see theres smoother way of getting around this did you want to say something you get overyoure sort of hypnotizing the pc into believing he didnt have withhold see you want to say something did you want to say something oh yes yes i thought of redcoats i thoughthaha that couldnt be my item you say good and you go down three later and youve got tiger and you read consider committing overts against tiger it read very nicely you know very fine you mark it in go on to the next one 44 waterbucks you know consider committing overts on waterbuck yeah theyre very often same list wrong side you know the pc mixing up the terminal and oppterm and you sayyou say consider committing ov what the hell was that see co co in this session has anything been suppressed in this session has anything you have been careful of in this session has anything been invalidated in this session in this session nyahnyah of course your pcs going to start protestinggoing to start protesting the mid ruds graceful thing to say is did you want to say something there he didnt want to say anythinghe thought something see if you ask him did you think something why you get slightly different response but if you say something like did you want to say something you get something on this order the pc will say thats true too he didnt want to say anything oh well i thoughti thought that that couldnt be my item thatthatsthats too late on the track thats much too late on the track and i thought there for minute that you looked kind of cross at thats thats what i thought and you say good and your needle cleans up again and you can carry on got the idea but dont you ever try to do any of this with dirtied up needle man you get your auditor presence up so smooth that you can put that needle back in smooth put it in smooth gear manput it in smooth gear and you try to get somebody and the pc says oh thats my heart beating you know tickticktick the needles going sure its their heart beating but what the hell is their heart doing cooked up connected to the emeter takes withholdtakes withhold or protest or an assert or mistake or suggest or an invalidate or suppress to make thator careful ofto make that needle register heartbeat dont forget it pcs dont have needle patterns pcs have outrudiments so his rudiments have been out for the last couple of hundred years well get them in man get them in but learn to get them in smoothly not abusing and bumping the pc around about them all right now lets go just little bit further here thats your right procedure for getting those things in and by the way dont give up on one because it reads faintly because its liable to bloom into the most gorgeous rock slam you ever saw in your life be wary of those that rock slam and then they dont rock slam and you havent done anything and neither has the pc apparently and you cant find any rock slam and then you clean them up and theres rock slam of any kind whatsoever well they were rocks youits missing item theres something missing here and the pc just keying it in and at the moment that item keys in if the pc has withhold at that exact instant it rock slams dont you see thats floating item it longer registers the moment you get the rudiments in so reala reliable item is one which registers with the rudiments in and man that is very severe definition well thats how you do this now your main problem is how do you turn on rock slam in the first place and this is an experimental licking of that problem i have learned through great dealyou know i have been auditing my brain to the bone here lately and i finally found out that withthat oppose and overts are sometimes too strong and sometimes too weak for the pc and so you overshoot the item this item would not commit overts against tigers this item would go back in the brush get under bush and natter plaintively about tigers and thats not directly committing an overt on tiger while actually being an overt on tiger but it wont rock slam or answer up on the word overt itll answer up on natter and so we move into some use for the secondary scales of last year two secondary scales one is scale number 21 the secondary scale of withhold and scale number 16 the secondary scale of overts this is long arduous gruesomely long scale this overt scale and would undoubtedly be able to shorten it down but these scales do exist at this exact instant and youre indebted to these secondary scalesto have these now strangely enough there would be another way of entering this whole thingis just to do prehav assessment on the pc find out where he wound up and then do that secondary scale on the pc there is that method of handling this but look look rock slam is peculiarly withholding and peculiarly committing action its peculiarly withhold and peculiarly an action it is action now i dont think and im speaking experimentally that we have to go to the lengths of doing prehav assessment and then finding its secondary scale and moving into the secondary scale and doing some kind of an assessment or balling it up in some way it is my concept from what i have seen which is not very much of this yet to merely do an overt scale because youre looking for the overt terminaland oddly enough the withhold scale because these terminals are also withhold terminals and the case that wont slam and you could just drive yourself to drink trying to make this case slam is just superwithhold ease you have hell of time making this ease slam man you get down and uhhh well the terminal theyre sitting on terminal number one and itby the way the only one that is available is number one there arent 865 terminals available theres only one that will slam first crack out of the box discouraging isnt it actually not because you can locate that one and maybe that is withholdytype terminal so if your pc consistently and continually doesnt have anything to say and never does anything to anybody you possiblyyou possibly could pick it up with the withhold scale much more easily than you could the overt scale because the withhold is the overt follow that but oddly enough anything that will flash on overts will also flash on withholds now supposing youve got lot of items on the pc and sometimes they turned on and sometimes they didnt turn on and actually you dont know if it was the rudiments in or the rudiments out that was giving you these items and all that sort of thing well just sit down and make yourself short list on each item and see if you turn up slam of what wouldnt you give that item that is proving action you say what wouldnt you give that itemyou get the same slam youll at least get aget some of the slam back but items that wont slam on that particular action arent items theyre false itemsitems that have been made to slam because some other session condition was present see pc had withhold see theyre not actually the item you couldnt get anything off of them it drives you batty trying to get something off of them all right now one of the ways of going about this to find the entrance point of the pc is you just got pc you see and you got meter and you know how to audit and how the devil do you pick up the first rock slam well here is way to do it there are many ways to do this one is to just ask him ask him for somebody he detests and he gives you that and you notice that slams and then you check that one out and then you ask him for well what does that person represent and so forth and he gives you that and that slams and that checks out and then you ask him for what would oppose that because it seems to be very overt terminal and it gets slam and all of sudden you see that it kind of rocket reads too and you say all right well what you havent got much time that day and you simply say whatif you were part of that what goal of yours would be imp were impossible to achieve on the second item or on the third item you just say well what goal would this waterbuck have what goal would the waterbuck have and the pc says to to go on spree rocket read rocket read rocket read rocket read see to go on spree to go on spree to go on spree and on this has anything been suppressed and nothings been suppressed everything is all clean and so forththe rocket read you knowthere it is bang bang bang bang to go on spree thats the pcs goal and thats it and thats an hour and eightyfive minutes from the beginning of the first session see but dont forget that there are lots of pcs like that and you operating with altitude will very often land square on your feet next pc that sits down is going to go ninetynine hours to goal haha with the very best and most arduous itemfinding you ever did in your life whats the matter with this pc pc wont slam because the pc slams on everything because the pc is everything because the pc is the item that does slam thats one type of pc i havent met him yet but i imagine he exists he exists only in theory he slams on everything you mention i havent met him yet youve got to find out what hes slamming on in particular i havent met him but i can imagine he will exist i simply predict somebody will run into him someday now thatd be your totalovert pc and then your pc who isnt saying very much being very quiet isnt answering up eithermostly protesting what you say and youre not going to find anything fast and you after while will just be able to ask the pc few questions in the rudiments and the pc well what have you done the pc says well ah oh uhmmm fifteen minutes later they still havent answered the question well you better ask it on the withhold scale see youll learn to estimate your pcs this way we just do plain assessment by elimination on something like the withhold secondary scale scale 21 on that quiet pc you take what youve got and then you say who or what would whatever it found youd have to put somebody or something after it to make it make sense sometimes who or what would chain somebody or something so you did an assessment of the scale and you came up with the type of withhold is chain and theyll give you the item and itll rock slam all rightor you start over here on the overt scale and you just run downdo an assessment by elimination of the overt scale when you get down to the end youve got one line in youve got one level in just by instant read dont you see trimmings you dont have to say would you or would the item or something like that you get on down to the end and you find out that thieve thieve is it who or what would thieve and the pc says roff and rauff and rrrof and roff and roff and roff and roff and you finally get magpie slams like mad get the idea well we can improve these scales and improve on the line but that is by moving right into the middle of all this now how about the next item how about the next item you could use exactly the same system dont you see the same system thats adaptable to the next item that you find you want to know who or what would withhold from magpie seems to be very quiet on this one or who or what represents magpie is just your standard response but magpie being chattery overt sort itself and so forth would probably be something thats opposed but you dont ask for who or what would commit overts or who or what would oppose magpie youd want to know who or what would overt scale on the magpie and the funny part of it is if youi think if you just do it straight by elimination youll come up with the right answer you dont have to say magpie or anything else then you do list of who or what would wound magpie he almost gives it to you at once small boy slamsthere it is got the idea get this method of sorting it out not depending on the broad term of overt commit overts on or something like this so all the way down the line as you did that resulting list which is made who or what would wound magpie you say would awould cat wound magpie would small boy wound magpie or any other way you want to do it and itll pick up the slam or you just do that one by elimination if its terminals list justalmost the way youyou just did your list of items and you get the last four tiger drill those and then test them would cat wound magpie slamslamslamslamslam would cat wound things slamslamslam this isnt slamming on magpieits slamming on that cat cat slamslamslam catyou know there you are now all of sudden that disappears small boy and the whole read settles on small boy and freezes in but its small boy would wound magpie not commit overts on magpie the more particularized case is the tougher it is to find the entrance point in other words the case is moreis very differentiative in ideas on this and you dont get broad broad class of anything slamming it has to be quite particular we have these two scales in existenceill turn them over by the way to your auditing supervisor we have some more of these scales i will be making up more suitable scale from these old scales and we will see how this thing goes but you get the idea how this is done rather simple assessment by elimination is the way this could be done and youi think you willmy guess is youll be seeing slams you never saw before on pcs and seeing them faster doesnt take any time to dofor instance withhold scale on pc and then who or what would 93 see whatever it was who or what would cache thingscache see and he gives them to you and the item will be on it see youve assessed to find the zone of the item then you assessed to find the item by rock slam and youve got it made from there on got the idea all right well were moving in to easier fasteri want to set you up so that you ean find pcs goal in morning see in morning of auditing if i can get that that is an extreme man thats an extreme but if i ean set you up so that you ean do that i will be very very happy indeed and go take vacation so make some headway will you i need vacation thank you very much good night
