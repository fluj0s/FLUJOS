ocean aquaculture is broadly defined as the rearing of marine organisms in exposed areas beyond significant coas tal influence open ocean aquaculture employs less control over organisms nd the surrounding environment than do inshore and landbased aquacu lture which are often undertaken in enclosures such as ponds when aquaculture operations are located beyond coastal state jurisdiction within the us exclusive economic zone eez generally 3 to 200 nautical miles from shore they are regulated primarily by federal agencies thus far only few aquaculture research facilities have operated in the us eez to date all commercial aquaculture facilities have been sited in nearshore waters under state or territorial jurisdiction development of commercial aquaculture facilities in federal waters is hampered by an unclear regulatory process for th eez and technical uncertainties related to working in offshore areas regulatory uncertainty has been identified by the administration as the

significant coastal influence and may include areas in state waters within 3 miles of the shoreline and beyond the 200nautical mile eez open ocean aquaculture introduction open ocean aquaculture is broadly defined as the rearing of marine organisms in exposed areas beyond significant coas tal influence open ocean aquaculture operations would be located at consid erable distance from shore and subject to relatively harsh environmental conditions resulting from wind and wave action open ocean aquaculture employs less c ontrol over organisms and the surrounding environment than do inshor and landbased aquaculture which are often undertaken in enclosures such as ponds the national offshore aquaculture ac t of 2007 was introduced as hr 2010 in the house on april 24 2007 and in th senate as

ocean policy study april 6 2006many new industries pote ntial environmental and ec onomic impacts and associated controversy have also likely contri buted to slowing potential expansion proponents of open ocean aquaculture positi on it as the beginning of the blue revolution broad advances in culture methods and appli cation with resulting increases in marine aquaculture production they tout open ocean aquaculture as an option for meeting consumer demand fo r marine products providing new employment opportunities decreasing the u s trade deficit in seafood products and developing new economically viable industry it is also asserted by proponents that development of open ocean sites would have the advantages of avoiding inshore user conflicts and reducing environmental impacts opponents raise number of concerns re lated to environmen tal protection and potential impacts on existing commercial fisheries they point to inshore aquaculture where mangrove forests have been replaced by shrimp ponds and to waste from salmon culture that has harmed the seabed environment their environmental concerns include polluti on from unused feed fish wastes and treatments eg antibiotics entanglement of marine wildlife in aquaculture gear introduction of nonnative species and escape of organisms that might affect the genetic makeup of wild species they say that open ocean aquaculture could also have direct and indirect ffects on commercial fisheries such as degradation of wild fish habitat preemption of commercial fishing ground s and market competition between wild and cultured fish products the future of aquaculture in the eez is still an open question complex and unpredictable mix of technological biolog ical and economic elements will likely determine the profitability of open ocean quaculture however the future will also likely depend on the tradeoffs between be nefits associated with aquaculture production and costs of potential nvironmental and social impacts challenges of open ocean aquaculture broad array of questions is associated with the viability and impacts of open ocean aquaculture initiation and expansion these concerns ar further complicated by factors such as evolving production technology uncertain economic costs and benefits and environm ental and social impacts generalizations are also difficult to make because of the

50 miles offshore depending on location open ocean aquaculture facilities moored or floating miles off the coast in highenergy environment experience numerous environmental conditions that differ from nearshore aquaculture operations including exposure to wind and wave action from all directions short and steep wave patterns strong currents seasonal anoxic oxygenlacking conditions and other severe ocean conditions that can prevent operators from being able to access their cages for days to weeks7 systems have been developed to ove rcome these obstacles including cage designs that do not deform under strong cu rrent and wave loads submersible cages and singlepoint moorings cagemounted autonomous feeding systems have been developed that can operate both at the surface and submerged others have developed closed containment systems for open ocean use to address environmentalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32694crs5 8 critics question whether floating unmanned remotecontrol cages could ever be

requirements alternatives on leasing for short time periods include issuing research pe rmits or vesting tenure in federal or state agency initially to streamline the process and llow greater control over eventual ownershipconcerns universities and privatesector research interests are developing automated buoys that can monitor the condition of stoc k and feed fish on regular basis for weeks at time other research groups ar working on automated floating cages that would travel with the currents and be tracked by satellite8 these shiplike structures could float on favorable oceanic currents or be held in the same location with low energy thrusters financing estimating profitability and securing financing is difficult for new open ocean aquaculture companies because of an uncertain regulatory environment the risk associated with operating in exposed open ocean locations the risk of catastrophic events eg severe storms limited operational experience and high capital startup costs proponents of open cean aquaculture development assert that without some form of longterm at least 25 years permitting or leasing of the water surface water column and seabed open cean aquaculture will have significant problems in securing capital from traditi onal funding sources obtaining suitable insurance on the capital investment and stock and protectin g investments from vandalism and other property threats9 such leasing may be problematic unless property rights beyond the rritorial sea are clarified the availability of insurance on stock and equipment is relevant to and can facilitate obtaining fronte nd capital for open ocean aquaculture the insurance sector has more than 30 years of experi ence in managing and insuring risks to conventional aquaculture st ock and equipment for variety of situations and conditions although the insurance industry is unlikely to view pilot projects favorably many say that the earlier the insu rance industry is brought into developing open ocean aquaculture the earlier insurers are likely to be comfortable with the risks that must be insured proponents of open ocean aquaculture suggest that if profits are to be made sufficient investment capital must be ava ilable as soon as property rights permitting and environmental concerns are resolved more pessimistic critics suggest that open ocean aquaculture is unlikely ever to have an adequate economic return on investment and that investment should ra ther be focused on improving nearshore or shorebased aquaculture eventually the level of capital investment in open ocean aquaculture will likely depend on whether its rate of return is competitive with investment alternatives economic potential the economic potential of us aquaculture will likely depend on both

of competing products competing products include similar imported cultured produc ts similar wild species and other agricultural product substitutes ch as chicken pork and beef the level of government support in othe r countries is often greater than that provided in the united states some say that government assistance could promote the initial development of us open ocean aquaculture industry but global market forces would likely determine whether it matures or withers the united states has been for the most part technological innovator and the use of marine resources to farm new species with high market value could give the united states competitive edge on the other hand operating costs and environmental standards in ot her countries are often lowe r in addition to capital costs the location of aquaculture facilitie s further from shore will necessitate higher costs for fuel security andor surveillance landbased aquaculture products are so likely to compete with offshore aquaculture most aquacu lture production in the united states originates in freshwater ponds and raceways such as catfi sh in the southern united states and trout farms in idaho and north carolina

they also state that without domestic financial support aquaculture innovation will likel come from other countries already providing greater investment in technology development social and economic impacts trade related issues in 2006 the united stat imported approximately 54 billion pounds of edible seafood worth 134 billion14 after accounting for exports valued at 42 billion there was trade deficit of pproximately 92 billion in edible seafood products the two larges t components of us seafood imports are shrimp and salmon shrimp acc ounted for 41 billion and salmon acc ounted for 15 billion of total us imports15 in contrast to the increasing level of seafood imports and the growing proportion of im ports produced through aquaculture the value of annual us aquacultu re production of edible fish appears to have leveled off at approximately 672 million in 200516 proponents claim that development of open ocean aquaculture would narrow the us deficit in seafood trade however many economists would counter that the seafood trade deficit is not sufficient r eason to advocate for development of new industry according to economic theory countries gain from free trade when they specialize in products that they are best at producing17 if other countries have an absolute or comparative advantage in aquaculture the united states would likely benefit from specializing in othe r industries others assert that in reality most trade is not strictly free as economic theory might assume it is also often difficult to determine how technological development and future economic cond itions will affect comparative advantages of di fferent nations or regions although shrimp and salmon account for large portion of the seafood trade deficit they appear to be poor candidates for open

aquaculture of these species for example one of the current offshore aquaculture operators foresees future inve stment focusing on new species in tropical and subtropical regions18 if many of the proposed species for ope n ocean aquaculture are carnivores it is likely that the demand for fishmeal produced from lowvalue wild fish will increase if domestic supplies are insufficient imports of fishmeal could increase the us trade deficit however these imports may be beneficial to the overall national economy if the domestic aquaculture industry is economically viable interactions with commercial fisheries some members of congress especially those from coastal areas with strong fishing communities are interested in better understanding the social and eco nomic effects of open ocean aquaculture development if open ocean aquaculture supplied significan t level of production at lower cost it could supplement commerc ial fishery production and provide greater quantities of products at lowe r prices lower prices w ould benefit us consumers who would likely increase consumption however aquaculture pr oducti on could supplant commercial fishery production the lower prices and revenues to fisher men for commercial landings could result in the failure of least efficient businesses loss of commercial fisheryrelated employment and disruption of fishing communities however the degree of displacement would depend on the similarity of products the scale of aquaculture production and the characteristics of ssociated markets for seafood products imports of shrimp and salmon have resulted in lower prices and greater consumption over the last thirty year s domestic shrimp production from the wild fishery has remained relatively constant while imports of aquaculture shrimp have increased in 2006 over 90 of all shrimp consumed in the united states were imported19 prices and associated vessel revenues have also decreased resulting in fewer active commercial fishing

decreased from approximately 800 milli on per year in the late 1980s to approximately 300 million per year for the period from 2000 to 200422 the income of many alaska fishermen also declined as well as permit and boat values from 2000 to 2004 about twothirds of us salm on consumption was farmed and onethird was from capture fisheries targeting wild stocks23 although the gulf of mexico shrimp fi sheries and alaska salmon fisheries have been harmed by lower prices these commercial fisheries were not replaced by aquaculture the precise levels of impacts are difficult to quantify because of differences in product form relations hips among products and the general complexity of these seafood markets in some cases competition could provide incentives to improve the quality of the wild product wild fishery management institutions and marketing greater efficiency in the wild fishery and consumer benefits related to greater supplies and lower prices from aquaculture production would be likely to provide net benefits to the nati onal economy say proponents whether the united states permits or denies open ocean aquaculture development some of the socioeconomic impacts of open ocean aquaculture production eg changes in prices and markets are likely to result from foreign production to improve unders tanding of gains and losses to specific sectors and local and national economies concerned parties suggest that social and economic impact assessments should be part of aqu aculture development plans from the onset potential community effects proponents of open ocean aquaculture assert that socioeconomic benefits will result from the development of this industry for example they view open ocean aquaculture as an additional means to support the domestic seafood industry which in ma ny regions has decreasing levels of employment with appropriate resear ch support open ocean aquaculture might provide opportunities for commercial fisher men who longer pursue harvests in managed capture fisheries advocates of open ocean aquaculture assert that people with commercial fishing skills will be needed to tend offshore aquaculture operations employment also would be required for much more than tending to offshore farms support roles are require d in landbased hatc heries to provide sufficient numbers of fingerlings feed mills are necessary to provide feed for the fish manufacturing is essential to fabricate the cages and other culture materials maintenance logistics and transportation are critical and finally all the fish raised in offshore farms would need to be harvested processed and sold thereby potentially increasing the use of presently underutilized fish processing plants along much of the coast24 in general aquaculture advocates believe that open oceanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32694crs10 24 continued automated offshore facility however they fo recast that such an operation would produce an additional annual regional economic output reaching more than 9 million and provide additional employment for at least 262 pers ons when all shoreside support was included although some suggest that for every dollar of fish landed from fishing there is multiplier of as much as 57 in the shoreside economy with the implication th at this relationship would be roughly equivalent for aquaculture others argue that these extreme multipliers may be suspect since the multiplier for the entire us economy is around 2 meaning that new dollar entering the economy manages to generate an additional dollars worth of goods and services before the demand leaks

work may be able to be done from computer in shoreside ffice with satellitecontrolled robotic system attached to the offshore cages also the hist ory of salmon farming indicates that as the industry becomes more efficient producti on per unit labor increases and employment decreases especially compared to commercial fishing 27 great salmon runaquaculture could help to preserve wo rking waterfronts that have suffered from commercial fishing declines and increasing industry regulation individuals familiar with the experiences of coastal aquaculture however have raised questions about the sustainability of offshore fish farming and its impact on local communities they assert that in many cases shrimp and salmon have been produced at the expense of local communities and the environment25 based on the history of salmon farming so have questioned the claims of aquaculture as jobs creator especially since it seems likely to become highly automated industry critics of aquaculture also argue that the potentially higher cost of tending fish far from shore means these facilities are likely to be automated and local employment benefits may be minimal26 additionally little evidence has been provided for the economic benefits of open ocean aquacu lture beyond the ge neral acknowledgment that marine aquaculture has proven profitable elsewhere especially in inshore areas with relatively little environmental regulation andor enforcement eg chile some commercial fishery advocates counter that unemployment in the seafood industrywild fisheries is also partly the result of the development of aquaculture especially salmon farming for example in alaska many fishermen stopped fishing and salmon processing plants closed resulting in job losses and declining tax bases for communities27 other effects open ocean aquaculture development also has the potential to interfere with maritime transportation and commercial fisheries with

identify the more suitable areas in federal waters for open ocean aquaculture developm ent andor to mediate disputes also safety issues with offshore facilities may need to be addressed environmental impacts proponents of open ocean aquaculture suggest that open ocean finfish aquaculture systems may produce fewer nd less severe envir onmental impacts than those caused by nearshore aquaculture systems this may be in part because dissolved and particulate waste products and excess feed may be assimilated and recycled more efficiently in the open ocean environment however the scope of any effects may vary greatly depending on the culture technique location sizescale and species raised29 the present lack of knowledge owing to limited experience lack of research funding and few studies focu sing specifically on open ocean aquaculture limits understanding of potential nvironmental concerns open ocean aquaculture pens would be open to the surrounding environmen t some critics of open ocean aquaculture cite concerns with the escape of fish water pollution from uneaten feed and waste products including drugs chemi cals and other inputs use of antibiotics and other animal drugs alteration of benthic30 habitat by settling wastes and the spread of waterborne disease from cultured to wild fish31 because of these concerns critics of open ocean aquaculture hope that regulation of this emerging industry will be stringent proponents hold that open ocean waters are normally nutrientdeficient and nutrients released from open ocean quaculture operations may increase wild production in adjacent areas waste settling from large operations could alter benthic habitat however research indicates th at in some areas currents keep water around fish cages well circulated dissipating wa ste products quickly resulting in minimal impact of open ocean aquaculture facilities on water quality critics question whether the experience with experimental facilities is relevant to future commercial operations which will need to operate at larger scale to be profitable possible solution might be to combine finfish opera tions with seaweed or bivalve aquaculture to consume the excess nutrients this approach is being tested by the university of new hampshire at its open ocean aquaculture research project but may be morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32694crs12 32 critics of this approach point out that beca use of the practical limits of seaweed growth rates and filtering rates of bivalves such nutrient recycling system might have to be 50 or more times the size of the finfish operati

enhancing chemicals other animal drugs and antifouling agents used on gear and enclosures will adversely affect open water environments chemicals used in fish foods are regulated by the us food nd drug administrati on and veterinarian oversight might encourage proper application and minimize environmental impact drugs such as antibiotics some of which were developed and pproved for use in contained or controlled environment are of ten introduced to cultured fish in their feed unconsumed feed and fish waste products can pass through the containment system and be consumed by wild organisms the use of some of these products may be declining as efficacious vaccines liminate the need for antibiotics and other drugs proponents of open ocean aquacultu re suggest that because of the more pristine and better oxygenated water conditi ons offshore the use of antibiotics has not been necessary in any of the offshore areas being tested in the united states33 most fish currently proposed for open ocean aquaculture are carnivorous and require feeds containing fish meal and fish oil which are obtained from wild stocks fishmeal and oil are produced from species such as anchovies and menhaden that are not usually used for direct human consum ption these species have low per unit value but large volumes can be caught and reduced dried to fishmeal usually because they occur in large schools ecolog ically forage species serve as prey for many wild carnivorous fish species such as striped bass and for sea birds two or more pounds of wild fish ar usually required to produce one pound of farmed fish environmentalists ques tion whether aquaculture production could exacerbate pressures and cause overfishing of the ocean fish stocks harvested to produce fishmeal34 others also assert it is wasteful to use fish for animal feeds instead of consuming them directly35 yet markets for direct consumption of most species harvested in industrial fisherie s do not exist proponents of aquaculture counter that wild fish stocks can be well managed and co mmercial harvest for fishmeal would occur with or wit hout demand from open ocean aquaculture36 they insist that fish meal is standard ingredient in livestock feed and farmed fish are far more effective at c onverting it to edible protein than their terrestrialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32694crs13 37 cliff goudey

feed to one pound of farmed product is favorable compared to conversion rates for wild species38 use of less desirable commodity to produce more highly valued product is the basis of most livestock and aquaculture operations the prices of fishmeal and fish oil are likely to increase if large quantities are required for open ocean aquaculture in 2006 the price of fishmeal nearly doubled because of lower anchovy catches in peru and the growing demand for fishmeal from china39 concerns with price are likely to encourage researchers and aquaculturalists to improve feeding techniques to reduce wa ste modify feed formulations utilize alternatives such as waste from fishprocessing plants and experiment with herbivorous fish plant protein sources ch as canola algae or soybean meal are being used to partially replace fishmeal w ith significantly positive results emerging especially where soybean m eal is supplemented with cer tain essential amino acids in some operations the feed may contain as little as 30 fishmeal an obstacle to increasing the amount of plant material that can be substituted for fishmeal appears to be the presence of antinutritional f actors in the plantderived materials40 the choice of species and feeds will likely depend on profitability and since many high value candidate fish or she llfish species are carnivorous the demand for fishmeal and fish oil is likely to increase in the foreseeable future another concern involves the spread of fishborne disease from aquaculture to wild populations for example problems w ith the transfer of sea lice from

nonnative fish escape from aquaculture facilities and interbreed with wild fish42 the potential interbreeding problem can be greatly reduced if only sterile fish are farmed fairly simple technology exists to accomplish ch sterilization cr itics speculate that since selectively bred and genetically modified fish may grow faster and larger than native fish they could displace native fish in the short term both through competitive displacement and interbreeding but might not be able to survive in the wild for the long term43 this is especially concern of states eg california maine maryland and washington where genetically modified fish are banned within state waters but could be grown in offshore federal waters related concern is the introduction of exotic speci into nonnative waters such as atlantic salmon in british columbia exotic fish may escape from open ocean facilities that may be particularly vulnerable to storms although recent hurricanes and tropical storms in hawaii puerto rico and the bahamas have caused reported damage or loss of fish in submerged cageculture operations the escape of atlantic salmon has been documented in the pacific northwest and escapees have been recaptured in alaskan commercial fisheries44 escapes are also common in the atlantic where 40 of the atlantic salmon caught in the north atlantic are of farmed origin45 the experience with salmon farming indicates that escaped fish could be problem either through interbreeding with closely related native species genetic interactions or through competitive di splacement of native species although management techniques at ne t pen sites are improving and modified cage designs better prevent escapes closed containment systems may be the only way to fully address this problem some are concerned that offshore and unde rwater facilities may harm or disturb marine mammals and other wildlife to ddress these concerns current cage designs avoid the use of small diamet er or loose lines or loosely hung netting to prevent the entanglement of sea turtles and marine mammals in netpens and associated gear since netpens would be under tension the possibility that turtle flipper or whale

environment using offshore waters is likely to be legally controversial traditionally nearshore waters and their resources under st ate jurisdiction are considered to be held and managed in the public trust open ocean aquaculture may be perceived by some as facto privatiza tion of the ocean which has hi storically been considered common property resource47 precedents in leasing offshore areas for developing oil and gas resources may be relevant to these concer ns however significant questions remain concerning whether an appropriate mechanism exists for any federal agency to provide an open ocean aquaculture permit or lease applicant with the necessary property rights to begin construction and operation siting and site tenure in federal waters are important issu for development and private investment without assurances and protection of ex clusive rights there is little incentive for financial investment the legal and regulatory framework for open ocean aquaculture will in large part determine whether private industr succeeds in establishing commercial operations legal and regulatory challenges may be particularly timeconsuming and costly although some suggest that moving aquaculture away from the coast and out of the view of the majority of coastal resi dents could alleviate some public concerns the complexities of multiagency per mitting are not clearly unders tood

alaska might still own the world salmon market and enjoy major source of employment and ec onomic development rather than having to watch wild alaskan salmon compete with aggressive salmon aquaculture velopment by chile norway and others the alaska case is cited to illustrate that regardless of whether the united states permits or denies open cean aquaculture development some of the potential socioeconomic impacts of ope n ocean aquaculture production on wild fisheries eg changes in prices and markets are likely to result from greater production whether domestic or foreign however environmentalists and commercial fishermen might view the absence of salmon aquaculture in alaska differen tly potential environmental and social problems may have been avoide d by concentrating on traditional wild fisheries wild salmon populations have been maintained at high levels and much of the alaska coastline is pristine although compe tition from aquaculture salmon imports may have hurt alaska salmon fi sheries improvements in marketing nd product quality have kept many market segments competitive the future of aquaculture in the us eez is still an open question setting regulatory framework might be necessary but not necessarily sufficient to spur development of an open ocean aquaculture industry aquaculture in other countries may have advantages related to lower costs and superior sites although it might be argued that highly regulated us industry is unlikely to be compe titive with aquaculture in other countries minimal re gulation does not guarantee that the us aquaculture industry will succeed complex and unpredictable mix of technological biological and economic factors will also determine the future profitability of open ocean aquaculture although government ma play role in funding research and pilot projects largescale production w ill likely depend on private initiatives and innovation environmental effects of aquaculture in coastal and inland areas have been documented especially in other parts of the world and potential environmental concerns related to development of aquacu lture in open ocean areas will need to be addressed one of the main challenges for policy makers is to balance the needs for profitability and flexibility of the aquaculture industry with public concerns related to environmental and social impacts
