saying from our standpoint our chief intelligence officer i think is going to have couple of powerful tools in dealing with the rest of the community first of all that person will be able to speak for all of the intelligence components within dhs and second that person is going to be able to bring to the table something that i dont think we have fully brought to the table which is our own intelligence collection capability30 at that same hearing the secretary also said the dhs chief intelligence officer would be one of the two officials at dhs who would be part of the intelligence community the other presumably coming from the us coast guard asked if dhs would have presence at the nctc he stated i most definitely anticipate and want to have dhs play role in nctc and indicated that for this to happen is really just question of finding the space and hand ling the logistics at the nctc facility31 operations in his july 13 2005 2sr remark s secretary ch ertoff indicated that

its preparedness re sponsibilities calling dhs an all hazards department he noted that this concept included not only fighting the forces of terrorism but also fighting the forces of natural disasters the secretary said he intended to consolidate the departments existing prep aredness efforts including planning training exercising and funding into single directorate led by an under secretary for preparedness under this arrangement he explained fema standing outside the new directorate will be direct report to the secretary but it will now focus on its historic and vital mission of response and recovery the new directorate will support fema with training resources and will c ontinue to rely on femas subject matter expertise and th expertise of our other components in promoting preparedness he said34 the secretary also i ndicated that he intended to ppoint chief medical officer who would be located within the new prep aredness directorate this position he said will be filled by an outstanding physician who will be my principal advisor on medical preparedness and highlevel dhs representative to coordinate with our partners at the department of health and human services the department of agriculture and state governments secretary chertoff had plans as well for another position within the preparedness dir ectorate to centralize the coordination of the efforts to protect technological infrastructure he announced we will create the new position of assistant secretary fo r cyber and telecommunications security within the preparedness directorate35 elaborating in his july 13 2005 reorgani zation notification letter to congress the secretary explained that the administrations original vision for the directorate of emergency preparedness and res ponse epr stressed the need for consolidating preparedness re sponse and recovery into single directorate but he noted dhss preparedness programs are presently spread among three separate components complicating mana gement of these functions consequently he wrote i intend to separate preparedness resour ces from response and recovery and combine them in the iaip directorate which will be renamed the directorate

relationship between it and fema and the future of fema at july 14 hearing of the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs secretary chertoff said the idea here is not to decouple the skills of fema from preparedness it is to allow fema to pursue its core mission as direct report to the secretary and then look to the preparedness directorate to draw on femas skill set and the other skill sets in equal measure in or der to make sure its covering the entire gamut of preparedness from prevention through response and recovery37 few days later at july 25 hearing of the house committee on homeland security the secretary again turned to the new role envisioned for fema what the restructuring proposes to do is to take out of fema couple of elements that were really not related to its core mission that were more generally focused on the issue of preparedness in way that i think was frankly more of distraction to fema than an enhancemen t to fema we want to make sure that fema was as an operational agency capable of focusing on its core mission that it was direct report to the secretary so that it gets the direct attention that it needs and we wanted to make sure the leadership of fema was not torn between its need to focus on the fema role the additional rather more strategic preparedness functions which i think that we are now seeking to unify and put together in coordinated fashion38 he also offered the following statement regarding the intent in creating the new directorate what our preparedness direct orate will do is it will bring to the table all of these very critical functions wh ich are part of preparedness efforts prevention pr otection and response and recovery reiterating he said what i want to do is make sure that when we do

the date secretary chertoff set for implementing his reorganization of the department to better provide timely nd complete responses to congressional reporting require ments and informational inquiries from members of congress and state and local elected officials the secretary planned to merge the offices of legislative affairs and those intergovernmental coor dination resources of the state and local government coordination and preparedness office into new office of legislative and intergovernmental affairs olia headed by an assistant secretary who will report directly to the s

other new arrangements as well as on some other new entities within dhs appearing before the senate committee on homeland security and g overnmental affairs on july 14 he commented on the proposed relocation of th office of the national capital region coordination oncrc to the preparedness directorate with the result that oncrc instead of reporting directly to the secretary would report through the under secretary for preparedness commenting that oncrcs function of preparedness for the capital needs to be very closely linked with preparedness in general the secretary expl ained the relocation saying what this does is it enhancing sic the ability of the national capital to participate in our preparedness planni ng and including the biopreparedness planning using the perspective that he has you know drawn from the unique challenges that you face in this particular city given the fact that its the seat of government so i actually dont view it as diminishing the role of that office but actually as enhancing its ability to touch and influence many of the preparedness functions that we need to use that will be of dire ct significance to protecting the capital of the country44 asked about proposed domestic nu clear detection office dndo the secretary indicated that the new entity would report directly to him thereby giving it stature to attract people that would not just be dhs people but would be senior people from department of ergy and other interested departments he said he had spoken with the secretary of energy about creating dndo and proffered that both of them were very committed to making this work and that the president is personally interested in this as well45 in testimony before the house committee on homeland security on july 25 secretary chertoff commented briefly on plans to relocate the federal protective service fps and the federal air marshal service fams concerning the first of these he said i think part of the consideration of

bureau of immigration and customs enforcement ice recommended in the same heritage special report of december 13 2004 that championed an under secretary for policy for dhs47 the proposal received some attention at january 26 2005 hearing of the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs on the future of dhs but at least one expert witness went on r ecord as opposed to the idea and the acting dhs inspector general who testified at th hearing was asked by the chair to do study on the issue and report back to the committee48 the house committee on homeland security also considered th matter but came to conclusion and instead included provision in the departme nt of homeland security authorization act for fiscal year 2006 hr 1817 requiring the secretary to review and evaluate the current organizational structure of cbp and ice and submit report of findings and recommendations to congress within 30 days after the enactment of the legislation49 at the time the committee reported the authorization bill secretary chertoffs 2sr initiative had been underway for two months in his july 14 testimony before the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs secretary ch ertoff was asked about the cbpice merger proposal taking the matter very serious ly and acknowledging that he actually met with the inspector general to get sense at least of what he was finding on the issue the secretary said i asked myself what are the problems were trying to cure here and is there way to cure them in less drastic approach in brief he concluded that the merger would have the result that the two entities would simply have deputy assistant secretaries instead of assistant secretaries continuing he said what seemed to be important was to ge t them to operationally work together but to do it with the other components as we ll with coast guard for example and with even with infrastructure pr otection and thats where having an operations and planning and policy shop departmentwide i think supplies the answer when we sat down to talk about border security strategy what we needed to do was to build plan that was comprehensive that took us from the beginning of the process through the end and that spanned among other things the role of cbp ice and coast guard putting together tool that allows us to do that httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33042crs14 50

security sayi ng we actually took very close look at this and again acknowledging he was privy to some of the factual findings that the inspector general made when we considered this secretary chertoff offered what our thinking was first of all part of our proposed re structuring involves having common departmentwide policy and planning shop and operations shop which gives us not only the ability to unify operations and policy between cbp and ice but across the department including for example coast guard which often intersects with them as you get into maritime areas and therefore should be part of the same coordination function it seemed to that you are dealing with functionally different issues when you are dealing with cbp which deals princi pally with inspection and with border patrol agents and on the other hand you have your detention and removal folks and your investigators at ice and those are different functions so given the upside of merger and considering the possible downside including the huge cost thats involved any time you do massive reorganization i think it was our judgment that the case had not been made that merger would cure the issues that have to be addre ssed there is question there are issues of coordination and finance that have to be addressed and we are addressing them but i think at this point im confident that what were doing will remedy the existing problems51 in midseptember the washington times disclosed that draft report prepared by the dhs inspector general at the request of senator susan collins chair of the committee on homeland security and governmental affairs recommended that cbp and ice be merged into single entity the proposal contradicts the 2sr realignment plan of secretary chertoff which calls for the two

collins the chair of the panel made the following comment to secretary chertoff as i review your plan you are inte nding to make some truly fundamental changes to the department without reques ting legislative authority to do so your list of legislative changes is very narrow i think youre pushing the boundaries on that and i hope you will work with the committee so that we can draft more comprehensive reauthorization bill i think many of the changes youre proposing really should be done by law and not just administratively so thats an issue well be pursuing with you53 the issue underlying the comment made by senator collins involved secretary chertoffs interpretation of his reorgani zation authority his interpretation was seemingly revealed in the text of footnote in his july 13 2005 reorganization notification letter to congre ss which stated section 872 of the homeland security act of 2002 provides broad reorganization authority and permits the secretary to alter or consolidate existing organizationa l units to establish new organizational units or to allocate or reallocate functions within the department54 senator collins comment suggested that she did not regard the reorganization authority conveyed at section 872 to be broad in scope or at least not as broad as the secretary was asserting moreover the expressed agreem ent with her closing comments by senator joseph lieberman the ranking minority member of the committee appeared to imply that he too did not regard the secretarys reorganiza tion authority to be broad55 section 872 of the homeland security ac t hsa provides that the secretary may allocate or reallocate functions among the officers of the department and may establish consolidate alter or discontinue organizational units within the department but only after the expiration of 60 days after providing notice of such action to the appropriate congressional committees which shall include an explanation of the rationale for the action and subject to certain limitations specified in the section these limitati ons include abolition of any agency entity organizational unit program or function established or required to

original 58 congressional quarterly senate homela nd security and governmental affairs committee holds hearing on review or s ic department of homeland security organization p 38maintained by the homeland security act or by statute56 noting that the term organizational units is not defined in the act crs legal analysis of the section is instructive regarding its scope in applying canons of statutory cons truction to the hsa it appears congress intended an organizational unit to be something smaller than an agency or other statutorily created entity in the limita tion provision of 872b1 for example congress placed the term organizational units after the terms agency and entity but before the terms program and function this placement suggests congress may have intended an organizational unit to be smaller than an agency and entity on the general assumption that things of higher order are named at the beginning of an enumeration and that congress does not intend to be superfluous in 471b of the hsa congress again suggests that an organizational unit may be small administratively created stru cture section 471b authorizes the secretary through the presidents reor ganization plan to reorganize the functions or organizational units within the bureau of citizenship and immigration services because the provision places an organizational unit within the bureau it appears congress intended th term to be something smaller than bureau the definition of the term organizational units in essence affects the secretarys authority to reorganize dhs because 872a only allows the secretary to establish consolidate alter or discontinue organizational units within the department it might be argued that the secretary is only allowed to establish consolidate alter or disconti nue units smaller than an agency entity or bureau an office advisory committee or laboratory for example might arguably qualify as something smalle r than an agency entity or bureau changes to structures other than organizational units would apparently need to be categorized as reallocation of functions among the officers of the department or be conducted pursuant to new legislative action to avoid an unauthorized action nonetheless because the term organizational units is not defined in the hsa or discussed in any re levant legislative history the scope of the term is not completely clear57 increased direct reports secretary chertoff contended that his reorganization of dhs would result in flattening of the department58 however his plan substitutes one hierarchical directorate policy for another bts and transforms another directorate iaip into one for preparedness furthermore his restructuring results in some 27 lines of reporting to the secretarydeputy

cybersecurity and telecommunications the chief medical officer and the chief intelligence officer were unclear and raised important questions60 it also expressed concern bout the preparedness directorate specifically that the structure advocated by the secretary may create harmful competition between infrastructure protec tion cybersecurity and firstresponder needs61 the failure to merge cbp and ice as recommended by the december 2004 heritage special report was regarded to be mistake62 similarly the secretarys failure to seek strengthened investigative powers for the dhs privacy

congress may have less influence regarding the kinds of individuals appointed to fill these positions and the ways in whic h they address their responsibilities in other cases congress has assigned

tegic and internati onal studies commented on the existing need for the government to clarify authorities and national leadership roles for biodefense by establishing and empowering lead executive in this regard he posed the question of what specific role will the cmo play it was his own belief he said that if you consid er the breadth of responsibilities however that his role should be more one of chief health officer than medical officer as he must help guide the department in far more than medical advice to include for example navigating health care systems understanding disease surveillance or advising on waste disposal sanitation and decontamination he then outlined four specific areas where clear leadership is need ed today thus he appeared to indicate that the role of the cmo extended bey ond providing medical advice and should impart leadership 1 in pr oviding sound scientific medi cal and public health advice 2 in developing greater situational awar eness of both biological threats and health care preparedness or vulnerabilities 3 in integrating federal state local and private sector elements in the development and implementation of national strategy to protect against biological events and 4 in establishing and leading outreach efforts to educate citizens on preparing for and protecting their health during catastrophic health emergencies100 later

secretary the position which was established by the homeland security act102 is now referred to by dhs as the chief intelligence officer charles allen wa s appointed to the position on september 18 2005103 inasmuch as this position has been moved to an organizational location directly below the secretary congress mig ht elect to clarify the responsibilities and authority associated with the position u nder the provisions of the act appointments to the position are to be made by the president alone and the incumbent is to assist the under secretary for information analysis and infrastructure protection in discharging the responsibilities of the under secretary under the act however this under secretary longer exists as such and its ccessor position the under secretary for preparedness does not appear to have authority over the assistant secretary for information analysis chief intelligence officer the change in the hierarchical location of this assistant secretary might also lead congress to reassess the process for making appointments to the position to determine whether or not advice and consent should be required in the future of the five newly created assistant secretary positions only one had been identified as an advice and consent position by the end of the session the assistant secretary for grants and training was to be the same individual as

pending the completion of the fy2006 dhs appropriations process and might be forthcoming thereafter105 statutory provisions and administrative ac tions during the evolution of the dhs including those stemming from the 2sr initiative have effectively created three categories of assistant secretaries thos presidentially appointed with advice and consent of the senate thos presidentially appointed w ithout advice and consent and those appointed by the secret ary also without the input of the senate although not without precedent this broad and varied usage of the assistant secretary title is unusual across other depar tments it is not clear whethe r or not assistant secretaries from each of these three categories will be given the same vel of policymaking authority and responsibility as result of the different ppointment processes however the three types of assistant secretaries may have differing stature within the department and within the g overnment at large in addition those who are subject to senate confir mation are likely to undergo greater scrutiny in the selection process and to be more accountable to congress during their tenure as condition of senate confirmation most nominees make commitment to res pond to requests to appear and testify before any dul constituted committee of the senate appointees who are not subject to senate confirmation are under such obligation although they may nonetheless do so of the four other proposed positions two were filled by permanent appointments and one c ontinued to be held by an ac ting official the chief medical
