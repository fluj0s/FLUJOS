the high price of gasoline has been nd continues to be driving factor in consideration of energy policy proposals despite passage of the massive energy policy act of 2005 epact 2005 pl 10958 and the energy independence and security act of 2007 hr 6 pl 110 140 numerous other proposed initiatives came under active consideration in the second session of the 110th congress measures proposed included opening the ou ter continental shelf for oil and gas drilling regulation of speculation in energy markets and policies concerning the strategic petroleum reserve large number of factors combined to put pressure on gasoline prices including increased world demand for crude oil and limited us refinery capacity to supply gasoline the war and continued violence in iraq added uncertainty and threats of supply disruption added pressure particularly to the commodity futures markets concern that speculation added volatility and upward pressure was frequently cited in recent months decline in the value of the dollar compared to other currencies increased the dolla r price of oil on futures markets the gasoline price surge stimulated much legislative activity but until the last year or so there was not the sense of the extreme urgency of previous energy crises in part this may be due to the fact th at there was been physical shortage of gasoline or lines at the pump as there we re after the arab oil embargo in 1973 and the iranian revolution in 1979 at that time there was expectation that prices were destined to grow ever higher and many believed that the worlds supply of oil was running out such views have been less pr evalent during the current runup but the continued and unrelenting increase in crude oil prices to record levels even discounting inflation led many to suggest that changing world market conditions may cause permanent or at least chronic shortages of petroleum production capacity others continued to expect that growth in demand would m oderate and production increase to meet demand as it did fo llowing the shortages of the 1970s the continuing high prices led to furt her search for legislative remedies this report after analyzing factors that have c ontributed to high gasoline prices describes the major legislative initiatives nd discusses the issues involvedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33521contents most recent developments 1 background and analysis

fuel economy cafe standards for automobiles and light trucks and an increase in the requirement for the use of renewable fuels in gasoline the second session of the 110th congress continued active consideration of various energy proposals when the congress br oke for the november elections it had passed legislation affecting oil and gas leasing on the outer continental shelf ocs energy taxes and the strategic petroleum reserve spr but it had also considered legislation regarding price gouging and speculation in energy futures markets and also dealing with oil market manipula tion by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec background and analysis legislative activities the persistence of high gasoline prices led to broad spectrum of proposed new legislation in the first session of the 110th congress despite passage of the major energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 many members continued to explore variety of measures to in crease supply and reduce demand in the short term and to reduce the impact of high pri ces on consumers as well as revisit longerterm policies that were left behind in the proce ss of reaching agreement on pl 10958 one such proposed policy was increasing cafe standards for automobiles and light trucks and the energy independen ce and security act of 2007 hr 6 pl 110140 resolved decadeslong debate by setting new standards and procedures for meeting them pl 110140 also increased the requirement to use renewable fuels in gasoline including advanced biofuels such as cellulosic alcohol starting in 2016 however number of proposals included in one or more versions of energy legislation in 2007 were dropped from the fi nal bill and those issues remained of interest to the congre ss during the second sessionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33521crs2 with gasoline prices soaring new wa ve of legislative proposals appeared in the congress prominent among them were bills to suspend the federal gasoline and diesel transportation tax during the summer driving season by presidential candidates senators mccain and clint on senator domenici introduced bill emphasizing us petroleum production including opening the outer continental shelf ocs and part of the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr for oil and gas leasing and encouraging leasing of oil shale deposits senator reid introduced bill which among other measures w ould impose windfall profits tax on oil companies another tax issue was the effort to extend tax credits for renewable energy production and offset them by increasing taxes on the oil companies numerous bills were also introduced to deal with the possibility that speculation was unreasonably driving up oil prices the house passed several bills identifying and prohibiting price gouging president bu shs policy of continuing fill of the spr was opposed in both houses and bill suspe nding fill became law proposals to sell spr oil in an effort to moderate oil prices were not adopted however the major debate in the second sessi on was the proposal by republicans to open up the ocs for oil and gas leasing this report reviews the major legislative initiatives to deal with the gasoline price issue to put these proposals in pe

international energy agency oil market report april 11 2008 p 1why did prices go so high the runup of gasoline prices that began in spring 2004 see figure 1 climaxed period of almost five years during which gasoline prices demonstrated great deal of regional volatility but less of an increase at the national level in 2004 large number of factors combined to exert pressu re on gasoline prices in all parts of the country some of these factors affected the price of crude oil and others the cost of producing and marketing gasoline crude oil prices past energy crises have demonstrated that oil is traded in world market in which events in remote areas affect the price of crude for almost everyone as result the price of crude oil is set through the interaction of world demand and supply major factors in the r unup of crude oil prices were the sharply increased consumption of imported oil by china see figure 2 and the continuing possibility of supply disruption either from violence or terrorism in the middle east or from natural disasters like hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005 note 2007 is the forecast value source eia china energy profile downloaded on may 19 2007

administration data ba sed on march 2008 data and base price of gasoline of 324 per gallon see gasoline diesel fuel update httpwwweiadoegovsome observers have suggested that speculators who have entered the commodity markets in large numbers looki ng for ways to increase their monetary investments rather than to trade in oil and oil products were causing an unacceptable upward pressure on prices another factor in recent months was been the decline in the value of the dollar compared to other cu rrencies since world prices of oil are quoted in dollars this would have an upward effect on market prices one of the major factors pushing crude pr ices higher is the perception that as demand increases production capacity will not increase with it most of the spare production capacity in the world market is located in opec countries and as figure 3 shows spare capacity in those countri has been lower than average over the past several years source eia shortterm energy outlook figure 10 may 2008 gasoline prices higher prices for crude oil tend to translate directly into higher prices for gasoline at the peak of the market crude oil accounted for about 72 of the cost of gasoline refining distributing and marketing account for about 16 of the cost of gasoline and taxe s account for bout 13 however until recently crude oils share of the cost of gasoline has been more typically in the range of 45 to 55 in may 2007 for example with gasoline at 315 per gallon crude oil contributed 46 of the cost refining distributing and mark eting 41 and taxes 132 with the collapse of crude prices c ontribution of crude costs to the gasoline price declined somewhat this trend is illustrated in figure 4 figure 3 opec surplus crude oil production capacityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33521crs5

limited refining capacity in the united states the range of fuel bl ends required to meet air po llution requirements and the mandated use of ethanol as an additive perhaps most important us demand for gasoline increased as economic growth c ontinued at least through 2007 however consumption of gasoline for the first 311 days of 2008 averaged 901 mbd compared to 929 mbd during the same period in

of energy policy and led to further calls for passage of energy legislation however until the climax of the katrina disaster the urgency of previous energy crises had been lacking throughout the period us gasoline consumption continued to rise in part this may be because although the price of gasoline in nominal rms set record in real terms it did not appear to be reaching the level of the ir anian crisis years of the early 1980s see figure 6 that is until katrina pushed it towa rd the 300pergallon mark further unlike the earlier crises there was physical shortage of gasoline and there

2008 table 94 as figure 7 indicates by the early 1990s the proportion of consumer expenditures on oil and gasoline had declined from the high levels of the 1970s and early 1980s data are not yet available to indicate what effect the price runup starting in 2004 has had on this measure perhaps most important the common view during the earlier crises was that oil prices not only were high but were destined to become ever higher in the coming years because world resources were pr obably beginning to level off and would decline in the future this view is longer widely prevalent largely because world proved reserves have increas ed faster than production nd are currently more than twice the level at the time of the arab oil embargo in 1973 at the beginning of the current crisis th general expectation was that the price increase was temporary phenome non in part this may be due to the fact that there has been physical shortage of gasoline or lines at the pump as there were after the arab oil embargo in 1973 and the iranian revolution in 1979 but the continued and unrelenting increase in crude oil prices to record levels even discounting inflation is leading many to suggest that changing world market conditions may have led to permanent or at least chronic shorta ges of petroleum production capacity the persistent increases in world demand for oil despite higher prices and the inability or unwillingness in many parts of the world particularly in the middle east to develop known existing resources appear to presage continuing tight market in figure 6 nominal and real price of gasoline 19502007 and september 2008httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33521crs8 which production capacity is only slightly greater than demand under those conditions temporary inte rruptions in production caused for example by local political crises or weather are much more likely than normal to force prices upward source eia annual energy review 2006 tables 35 and d1 others continue to expect that grow th in demand will m oderate and production will increase to meet demand as it did following the shortages of the 1970s they argue that the market price of oil appear s to be much higher than production costs and is being sustained by the expecta tion of continued st rong demand in the indefinite future in addition they point to large profits flowing to oil producers and political pressure to invest thos profits in increased production policy options congress has considered numerous energy policy initiatives and enacted many of them with the continuing pressure of rising prices however energy policy has once again become the focus of attenti on both in the congress and on the campaign trail policy options include efforts to ameliorate the effects of high prices in the short term and to attack the longer term problem the latter options come in three major forms to reduce consumption by increased efficiency without having negative effect on the economy to subs titute alternative fuels at cost comparable to the oil figure 7 consumer spending on oil as percentage of gdp 19702004httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33521crs9 they replace and to encourage production of more oil either in this country or abroad the choice of these options depends to certain extent on how the future of the oil market is viewed those who consider it likely that the present tightness of the market is likely to continue as describe d above tend to support alternative fuels and increased efficiency and to denigrate efforts to increase oil production as futile and ineffective compared to the growth in wo rld demand which they expect to continue indefinitely those who view the pres ent tightness of the world market as an aberration that can be relieved with ade quate investment in new production capacity view any move to increase supply anywhere in the world as positive signal that the tightness and volatility of the world oil market can be eased and prices can more closely reflect the cost of production oilrelated legislation reducing consumer impacts and regulating oil markets number of proposals are aimed at easing the impact of high prices on consumers or are aimed at the oil industrys pricemaking policies gas tax moratorium bills introduced by senator mccain s 2890 and senator clinton s 2971 would have suspended federal gasoline and diesel transportation taxes for the summer drivin g season and the proposals were topic in the presidential campaigns of the two candidates senator obama also campaigning for the democratic presid ential nomination criticized both proposals similar bills were introduced in the hous but the issue was never taken up for details see crs report rl34475 transportation fuel taxes impacts of repeal or moratorium by robert pirog and john w fischer price gouging the rapid increase in gasoline prices following the katrina disaster led to allegations of price gouging pl 10958 included provision requiring the federal trade commission ftc to conduct an inves tigation into price gouging in increased gasoline prices the issue reemerged in the 110th congress as gasoline prices surged past 300 per gallon on may 23 2007 the house passed the federal price gouging prevention act hr 1252 the bill woul d have banned the sale of gasoline at unconscionably excessive prices during energy emergencies declared by the president and impose heavy fines and imprisonment for violations the white house complained that the bill could result in gasoline price controls and threatened to veto it but the house vote of 284141 i ndicated enough support to override veto the senate in passing its version of hr 6 the creating longterm energy alternatives for the nation clean ergy act of 2007 on june 21 2007 included pricegouging provision similar to that in hr 1252 however the provision was not included in the final version of hr 6 which became pl 110140 the consumerfirst energy act s 2991 contained provision on price gouging similar to the previously considered measureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33521crs10 speculation in the oil market the possibility that speculation has unreasonably driven up oil prices either because of

forgone revenues continued fill of the spr with royaltyi nkind oil became controversial in the 110th congress critics argued against adding oil to the spr when markets are tight and prices remain high they argued further that the additional oil adds little to us energy security supporters of rik fill argue that the f ill rate is too little to have discernible impact on markets and that cu rrently high refinedproduct prices are sustained by factors other than crude supply which is more than ample at this time legislation was introduced in th second session hr 5146 s 2598 to suspend rik fill the house bill would also have mandated sale of 13 million barrels of spr oil during fy2008 with th proceeds to be spent on number of energy efficiency and altern ative fuel programs both bills
