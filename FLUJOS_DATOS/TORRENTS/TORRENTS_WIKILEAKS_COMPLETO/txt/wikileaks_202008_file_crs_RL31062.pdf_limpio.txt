poorly developed economy were besieged by rebel group the ruf1 the conflict originated in part from the growth of systemic govern ment corruption beginning in the late 1960s by the late 1980s the capacity of the state to govern and to provide basic public goods and services had severely deteriorated resulting in the effective disenfranchisement and impoverishment of large segments of the population in addition history of political thuggery in particular local rebellion following extensive violence surrounding local elections in 1982 set precedent for armed political conflict in sierra leone armed hostilities were also driven by contention over the control of mineral wealth especially diamonds nd state resources the sierra leone war was also perpetuated by armed conflicts in neighboring states and interference in sierra leone by parties to these conflicts particularly by former liberian civil war faction leader charles taylor who in 1997 was elected president of liberia during the conflict the ruf using guerrilla warfare tactics avoided defeat by progovernment forces comprised of the sierra leone army sla ecomog the monitoring group of the economic community of west

forced recruits were hallmarks of such violence other factions ccasionally used similar tactics the military strength of the ruf fighting force now largely demobilized was difficult to determine

liberia to cache arms and assist the forces of liberian president charles taylor to counter burgeoning armed insurgency by opponents of his regime rufliberia ties the origin and operational cap acity of the ruf have been closely tied to the politics of liberia at its inception and throughout the 1990s the ruf was led by foday saybana sankoh fo rmer photographer and cashiered sierra leone army sla corporal who had been imprisoned for participating in coup against the sierra leone government in 1971 sankoh and taylor are both reported to have received military training in libya in the late 1980s sankoh and his associates are said to have assisted ta ylors armed civil war faction the national patriotic front of liberia npfl at the start of its insurgency in early 1991 sankoh and small cadre of sierra leonean dissi dents and economic re fugees who supported him were reportedly supplied by taylor with arms and small force of burkinabe mercenaries and liberian fighters the gr oup then launched incursions into sierra leones border areas taylor is alleged to have supported the ruf for several related reasons to counter threat to the npfl posed by the backing of the sierra leonean government then led by joseph momoh for rival liberian rebel faction called ulimo which was comprised of liberian ethnic krahn and mandingo refugees who had fled npfl attacks it initially operated out of sierra leonean territory to retaliate against the momoh g overnments support for ecomog the monitoring group of the economic community of west african states ecowas regional military force that had intervened to halt the liberian conflict and because the rufs destabilization of eas tern sierra leone allowed the npfl to gain control of commerce in the diamondrich border region taylor is also believed to have held personal grudge against the momoh government which reportedly jailed him in the late 1980s and later refused to allow liberian exiled dissidents associated with taylor to operate out of sierra leone close ties between taylor and the ruf c ontinued after the end of the liberian civil war and taylors 1997 election as pres ident of liberia the ruf acted as source of funds and

misinformati on and half truths in january 2001 mr taylor stated that the liberian government has never denied our knowledge of ruf however we have always rejected and continue to reject any claims that this contact is commercial or economic in nature quite to the contrary our re lationship with ruf and our corresponding security concerns are an expected response to successive sierra leonean governments active support and arming of liberian dissident groups resident in sierra leone who have stated and demonstrated that their objective is to overthrow the liberian government by force of

the rufs political agenda reflects loose set of radicalpopulist ideas and purports to provide means for empowering the disenfranchised in histori cal context of state corruption and violence it was rarely articulated in much detail during most of the 1990s6 its public political statements consisted primarily of condemnations of the government antibritish statements and warnings to the population that they shoul d not support the government its message as illustrated prior to the 1996 elections and during the 1997 and 1999 invasions of freetown was clear voting or otherwise supporting the government could result in severe physical punishment including mutilation or death the rufs unclear political agenda together with persistent ruf attacks on civilians and the groups systematic violation of multiple peace accord s caused many analysts to dismiss the group as essentially criminal element motivat ed primarily by the desire to control diamonds and other resources in early 2000 the group published an internet web site in appa rent anticipation of its planned transformation into political party the ruf party rufp as per the lomé peace accord see below7 the site calls for an

judici ally sanction allege d external supporters of the ruf chief among such persons is charles taylor who many view as responsible for abetting past atrocities attributed to the ruf some also question the limited temporal and personal jurisdiction of the court asserting that these provisions will effectively result in impunity for many rank and file violators of human rights proponents of

comparable to the ictr they note that the size and budget of the proposed court as origina lly proposed has been scaled down dramatically they also observe that sierra leonean jurists will be intimately involved in the c ourts legal process which will employ sierra leonean law where applicable to the prosecution of defendants they also see the court as concrete means of ending impunity for hum an rights violations in sierra leone speeding national reconciliati on and demonstrating intern ational political will and institutional support for the enforcement of the rule of law in sierra
