the 107th109th congresses introduction in recent years the process by which lower federal court judges are nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate has been of increasing interest to congress in order to provide congress with continuing overview of this process this report provides statistics on all of president george w bushs nominations to us courts of appeals and us district courts during the 107th 108th and 109th congresses and any actions taken on these nominations by the senate judiciary committee and the full senate1 us courts of appeals review appeals from federal trial court opinions and are empowered to review and enforce the orders of many administrative agencies cases presented to these courts are generally considered by judges sitting in threemember panels altogether 179 permanent appellate court judgeships are authorized by law courts within the courts of appeals system are often called circuit courts because they are divided into 12 geographic circuits and an additional nationwide circuit having specialized subject matter jurisdiction in this report nominations to us courts of appeals judgeships are referred to as circuit court nominations us district courts are the trial courts of general federal jurisdiction each state has at least one district court while some states have as many as four there are 678 district court judgeships authorized by law including those for the district of columbia the commonwealths of puerto rico and the northern mariana islands and the territories of guam and the us virgin islands2 1 this report is in keeping with earlier crs reports which tracked actions taken on judicial nominations by other recent presidents see crs report 98510 judicial nominations by president clinton during the 103rd106th congresses by denis steven rutkus and crs report 93395 president george h w bushs judicial nominations during the 101st 102nd congresses by denis steven rutkus 2 the 678 total consists of 667 permanently authorized judgeships and 11 temporary judgeships which pursuant to statute temporarily increase the number of judgeships for specified judicial districts with these districts reverting back to the permanently authorized number of judgeships at future time fixed by the statute typically when after specified number of years judgeship in the district is vacated all but four of the 678 judgeships entail lifetime appointments the four exceptions are the one judgeship each in guam and the northern marianas and the two in the virgin islands to which judges are appointed for 10year terms crs2 president bushs nominations to these two court systems are listed in eight appendix tables at the end of this report appendices 14 for circuit court nominations and appendices 58 for district court nominations appendices 1 and 5 list all the persons nominated by president bush during his presidency as of december 9 20063 to the circuit and district courts respectively the other six tables list all of the circuit and district court nominations made by president bush during each congress appendices 2 3 and 4 for circuit court nominations in the 107th 108th and 109th congresses respectively and appendices 6 7 and 8 for district court nominations in the same respective congresses appendices 18 it should be emphasized account for every instance in which district or circuit court nomination was made including renominations of individuals to the same judgeship as discussed below some of president bushs nominees were nominated to circuit or district judgeship more than once within congress or nominated to the judgeship in more than one congress accordingly discussion in this report regarding the number of nominations made by president bush to the circuit or district courts counts not only the initial nomination of person to judgeship but any renominations as well by contrast discussion regarding the actual number of persons nominated or nominees counts individual nominees only once even if they were nominated to the same judgeship more than once within the text of this report are various statistical tables and bar graphs using data derived from appendices 18 table 1 presents for president bushs circuit and district nominees the average and median number of days that elapsed from their first nomination to disposition of their last nomination table 2 breaks down the total number of persons nominated by president bush to circuit and district court judgeships by the number of congresses in which they were nominated table 3 provides statistics comparing president bushs judicial nominations with those of his four immediate predecessors in the white house table 3 shows among other things the total number of persons nominated by president bush as well as by each of the four previous presidents to district and circuit court judgeships and the number and percentage of them who were confirmed figures 1 and 2 show for circuit and district nominations respectively the average number of days that elapsed from nomination date to confirmation during each congress from the 95th to the 109th indicating which presidency coincided in time with each congress figures 3 and 4 show respectively for the circuit and district court nominees of the five most recent presidents the average number of days that elapsed from their first nomination to final disposition of their last nomination the following text provides 1 brief overview of the principal steps in the judicial appointment process 2 more detailed description of the structure and contents of appendices 18 and the methodology used in gathering the tabular data and 3 discussion of selected appointment statistics for circuit and district court nominees and nominations in the 107th 108th and 109th congresses which are derived from or presented in the appendices4 3 december 9 2006 is the date of final adjournment of the 109th congress 4 the statistics include total number of nominees to district and circuit judgeships number of nominees confirmed number of nominations including renominations of nominees continued crs3 this report focuses on judicial nominations made by the president and on senate actions taken on the nominations by the senate judiciary committee and the senate on rare occasions appointments to federal courts also have been made without submitting nomination to the senate when president exercises his constitutional power to make recess appointments specifically article ii section 2 clause 3 of the constitution of the united states empowers the president to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session5 president bush thus far during his presidency has made two recess appointments to circuit courts and none to district courts6 the judicial appointment process under the constitution of the united states the president and the senate share the responsibility for filling vacancies within the federal judiciary7 while it is the president who nominates persons to fill federal judgeships the appointment of each nominee also requires senate confirmation although not mentioned in the constitution the senate committee on the judiciary also plays an important role midway in the process after the president selects but before the senate as whole considers the nominee the process for making lifetime appointments to us district court and circuit courts of appeals judgeships entails the same formal steps as those involved in the 4 continued number receiving committee hearings committee votes and senate or other final action and average time taken to conduct hearings committee votes and senate votes on the nominations careful distinction is made in the text between number of nominations including renominations and number of persons actually nominated 5 see crs report rs21308 recess appointments frequently asked questions by henry b hogue 6 on jan 26 2004 president bush recessappointed charles w pickering sr of mississippi to the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit judge pickerings appointment expired on dec 8 2004 at the end of the second session of the 108th congress and he retired on feb 20 2004 president bush recessappointed william h pryor jr of alabama to the eleventh circuit court of appeals judge pryors recess appointment was to last until the end of the first session of the 109th congress however before that appointment expired judge pryor was renominated by president bush and confirmed by the senate on june 9 2005 for more information on judicial recess appointments see crs report rs22039 federal recess judges by louis fisher crs report rl33009 recess appointments legal overview by tj halstead and henry b hogue the law recess appointments to article iii courts presidential studies quarterly vol 34 sept 2004 pp 656673 7 article ii section 2 clause 2 of the constitution provides that the president shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint judges of the supreme court and all other officers of the united states whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for and which shall be established by law crs4 appointment of justices to the supreme court8 the process officially begins when the president selects someone to fill judicial vacancy submitting nomination in writing to the senate usually on the same day it is received by the senate the nomination is referred to the committee on the judiciary the senate committee having jurisdiction over district and circuit as well as most other federal court nominations the judiciary committee then holds hearing on the nomination the committee subsequently meets to vote on whether to report the nomination to the full senate committee vote to report even vote to report with an unfavorable recommendation sends the nomination forward to be considered by the senate as whole while vote against reporting historically very rare occurrence prevents the nomination from going forward and in effect defeats the nomination in committee the final step in the appointment process occurs when the senate votes to confirm or disapprove the nomination vote to confirm requires simple majority of senators present and voting if the senate votes in the negative on whether to confirm the nomination is defeated and resolution of disapproval is forwarded to the president as with nominations in general judicial nominations sometimes fail to advance through each procedural step in the appointment process after referral to committee nomination might not receive hearing or after receiving hearing might not receive committee vote on whether it should be reported even if favorably reported by committee the nomination might not receive vote by the senate on whether to confirm nomination for instance will not under senate rules receive vote on whether to confirm if some senators oppose taking such vote and supermajority of threefifths of the full membership of the senate fails to vote in favor of motion to close debate on the nomination9 if it fails to receive senate vote the nomination ultimately will be either withdrawn by the president or returned to the president by the secretary of the senate upon senate adjournment or recess of more than 30 days10 8 see crs report

secretary to the president and shall not again be considered unless they shall again be made to the senate by the president crs5 structure and contents of the nominee and nominations tables the tables at the end of this report appendices 18 were generated from crs database of nomination dates and actions created by kevin m scott crs analyst in american national government11 the data for the crs database were collected primarily from the presidential nominations database in the legislative information system of the us congress lis12 and from daily editions of volumes 147152 of the congressional record for the years 20012006 nominee tables as noted previously appendices 1 and 5 list alphabetically the names of all persons nominated by george w bush during his presidency through the end of the 109th congress to the circuit courts and to the district courts these tables show the following for each nominee how often and when the person was nominated to particular judgeship dates of committee hearings and committee action on all nominations whether and when the nominee was confirmed if confirmed the number of days that elapsed between the date of the first nomination and the confirmation the outcome of the persons most recent nomination if the final disposition was not one of confirmation13 if not confirmed the number of days that elapsed between the date of the persons first nomination and the final outcome of the persons most recent nomination the tables at the end also present for all confirmed nominees the average number of days that elapsed between their first nomination and their confirmation and for all unconfirmed nominees the average number of days that elapsed between their first nomination and final disposition of their most recent nomination 11 the database was created in part with the benefit of earlier nominations research conducted for previous versions of this report by mitchel sollenberger former crs analyst in american national government 12 available at httpwwwcongressgovnomissearchhtml the presidential nominations database covering the 97th through the 109th congresses provides for each nomination the name of the nominee nominees state of residence appointive position date of nomination hearing date date of committee vote date of senate action and type of senate vote including roll call vote numbers 13 for each nominee not confirmed as of the close of the 109th congress his or her last nomination was either 1 returned to the president when the senate adjourned for or took recess of more than 30 days or 2 withdrawn by the president columns in appendices 1 and 5 indicate the last nominations of nominees which were returned or withdrawn the dates of such actions and the congress in which the actions occurred crs6 appendices 1 and 5 show all of the persons nominated by president bush to the circuit and district courts these tables however do not provide comprehensive information on committee and full senate actions taken on these individuals nominations such as senate procedural votes and roll call votes on their nominations where senate votes were by roll call detailed information of this sort is provided in appendices 24 for circuit nominations and 68 for district nominations nominations tables the first six years of the presidency of george w bush roughly coincided in time with three congresses the 107th congress 20012002 the 108th 20032004 and the 109th 20052006 six tables list all of the circuit and district court nominations made by president bush during each of the three congresses and any committee or senate actions taken on the nominations appendices 2 3 and 4 provide this information for circuit court nominations in the 107th 108th and 109th congresses respectively and appendices 6 7 and 8 do so for district court nominations in the same respective congresses14 nominations in all six of these tables are listed in chronological order according to the date on which each nomination was received by the senate the tables show how far along each nomination progressed in the appointment process and how many days elapsed in the process the procedural progress of each nomination is shown by separate columns which indicate respectively the date on which any of the following occurred the judiciary committee held hearing on the nomination the judiciary committee voted to report or take other action on the nomination the senate voted for confirmation or some other action occurred in the final action column date by itself indicates that the senate confirmed the nominee by voice vote or by unanimous consent confirmation date with vote tally underneath indicates that senate confirmation was by roll call vote this column also shows the final disposition of nominations failing to receive senate confirmation an entry of returned 112002 for example indicates that the nomination was returned to the president on november 20 2002 upon the final adjournment of the 107th congress15 an entry of withdrawn 031901 as another example indicates that on that date the nomination was withdrawn by the 14 appendix 2 excludes from its listing nine circuit court nominations submitted at the start of the 107th congress by outgoing president william j clinton these nominations were submitted at the very beginning of the 107th congress but in the final weeks of president clintons second term all nine of these nominations were withdrawn by president bush on mar 19 2001 although one of the nine nominees roger l gregory of virginia was renominated by president bush on may 9 2001 and confirmed by the senate on july 20 2001 15 each such return occurs pursuant to senate rule xxxi paragraph 6 which as explained earlier provides for nominations to be returned to the president if the senate adjourns or takes recess for more than 30 days crs7 president16 the dates and roll call votes of other procedural actions affecting nominations such as motions to close debate also have been entered in the final action column the tables also show for each nomination the length of time that passed before committee hearing committee vote or final action took place for each nomination separate columns present the number of days which elapsed between the senates receipt of the nomination and the dates on which it received hearing committee vote or senate vote also at the bottom of each of these three columns the tables show the average number of days which elapsed between the presidents submission of judicial nominations to the senate and the dates on which the nominations received hearings committee votes or senate votes each elapsed time average is shown in two forms as the mean number and as the median number of elapsed days17 although the arithmetic mean is the true average number it has the disadvantage of being skewed by extremely high or low values in distribution of numbers loosely speaking one statistician has noted the median corresponds more closely than the mean to the middle of distribution of group of numbers it is unaffected by extreme values18 16 president may withdraw nomination for any number of reasons the mar 19 2001 withdrawal by president bush of nine nominations submitted earlier by president william j clinton mentioned in table note to appendix 2 was in keeping with the usual practice of incoming presidents to withdraw pending nominations submitted by their predecessors presidents also sometimes withdraw their own nominations president might do so for example if the senate committee to which the nomination has been referred either has voted against reporting the nomination to the senate or has made clear its intention not to act on the nomination if the nomination even if reported is likely to face substantial opposition on the senate floor or if the nominee has requested that the nomination be withdrawn by the end of the 109th congress president bush had withdrawn three of his circuit nominations and three of his district court nominations see in appendix 3 the jan 7 2003 circuit court nomination of miguel estrada which at the nominees request was withdrawn by the president on sept 4 2003 following seven unsuccessful votes in the senate by estrada supporters to close debate on the nomination in appendix 4 the feb 14 2005 circuit court nomination of henry w saad which was withdrawn on mar 27 2006 and the sept 29 2005 circuit court nomination of james h payne which was withdrawn on mar 7 2006 in appendix 7 the jan 7 2003 district nomination of frederick w rohlfing iii which was withdrawn on may 6 2004 and in appendix 8 the feb 14 2005 district nomination of daniel p ryan which was withdrawn on mar 30 2006 and the feb 14 2006 district nomination of jerome holmes which was withdrawn on may 4 2006 17 the mean number is the sum of the number of elapsed days for all of the nominations in question divided by the number of those nominations the median number is either 1 the elapsed number of days for the nomination in the middle of the distribution of all the nominations in question with an equal number of the nominations having longer elapsed times than that nomination and an equal number of nominations having shorter elapsed times or 2 the mean of the elapsed number of days for the two nominations in the middle of the distribution if there is one middle nomination 18 william h greene econometric analysis 5th ed upper saddle river nj prentice hall 2003 p 847 for an introduction to median versus mean and arguments surrounding when each should be used see chapter 3 in alan agresti and barbara finlay statistical methods for the social sciences 3rd ed upper saddle river nj prentice hall 1997 crs8 the time averages presented in appendices 24 and appendices 68 are calculated from timeelapsed data for specific nominations as opposed to overall time an individual might have been in nominee status thus in the case of an individual nominated twice to the same judgeship timeelapsed data are counted separately for each nomination rather than for instance measuring the time between nominees first nomination and any action hearing committee vote or senate vote on the nominees second nomination nomination not receiving committee hearing committee vote or senate vote is excluded from the calculation of average time between the nomination date and this particular procedural step also three nominations in which nominees received hearings were nevertheless excluded from the calculations of average time between nomination and hearing because the hearings in all three instances preceded the nomination dates19 as noted above some individuals were nominated more than once to judgeship within the same congress appendix 2 includes 20 circuit court nominations submitted by president bush during the 107th congress between may 9 and august 2 2001 which the senate returned to the president on august 3 2001 at the start of the senates august 2001 recess pursuant to senate rule xxxi20 appendix 6 includes 20 district court nominations submitted by president bush during the107th congress between june 18 and august 2 2001 which the senate returned at the start of its august 2001 recess when the senate reconvened on september 4 2001 president bush renominated all 40 of the individuals involved21 similarly footnotes to the initial 20 circuit and 20 district court nominations that were returned to the president indicate that the nominees in question were later renominated in the 108th and 109th congresses several additional nominees were renominated at least once in the same congress in the 108th congress three individuals were nominated twice22 19 in appendix 2 see circuit court nomination of sharon prost on sept 4 2001 in anticipation of this nomination the judiciary committee held hearing for ms prost on aug 27 2001 in appendix 5 see district court nominations of reggie b walton and terry l wooten on sept 4 2001 in anticipation of these nominations the judiciary committee held hearing for walton on aug 22 2001 and hearing for wooten on aug 27 2001 20 as noted earlier senate rule xxxi paragraph 6 provides that nominations pending in the senate at the time that the senate adjourns or takes recess of more than 30 days shall be returned to the president usually but not always the senate before starting recess of more than 30 days waives this rule by unanimous consent allowing pending nominations to remain in status quo and continue to be pending in the senate after it reconvenes sometimes however when rule xxxi paragraph 6 is not waived nominations pursuant to the rule are returned to the president and can only be considered again if they are resubmitted by the president 21 footnotes to each of these resubmitted nominations are provided indicating that the nominees had been nominated earlier to the same judgeships 22 in the 108th congress as appendix 3 reveals three persons were nominated more than once to circuit judgeships claude allen of virginia was nominated to the fourth circuit on apr 28 2003 and jan 20 2004 charles w pickering sr of mississippi was nominated to the fifth circuit on jan 7 2003 and feb 6 2004 william h pryor jr of alabama was nominated to the eleventh circuit on apr 9 2003 and mar 12 2004 for both pickering and pryor the second nomination in the 108th congress was to life term to the position to which they had been recessappointed earlier in that same congress crs9 in the 109th congress five individuals were nominated three times following returns as the senate went into recess in august and again in september23 several of president bushs judicial nominees also have been nominated in more than one congress appendix 3 for example shows that the first 14 circuit court nominations in the 108th congress were of individuals previously nominated in the 107th congress likewise appendix 7 shows that the first 15 district court nominations in the 108th congress were of individuals previously nominated in the 107th congress24 more recently in the 109th congress president bushs first 20 judicial nominations were all resubmissions from the 108th congress submitted on february 14 2005 the 20 resubmissions involved 12 circuit nominees and eight district court nominees who had earlier nominations returned to the president at the final adjournment of the 108th congress25 moreover six of the 12 circuit nominees had been nominated in two prior congresses in the 107th as well as in the 108th as had two of the eight district court nominees26 23 see in appendix 4 the feb 14 2005 sept 5 2006 and nov 15 2006 nominations of terrence w boyle of north carolina to the fourth circuit william g myers iii of idaho to the ninth circuit

had been nominated in the 107th congress 25 all of the nominations returned at the end of the 108th congress which were resubmitted in the 109th congress have footnotes in appendices 3 and 7 to indicate that fact 26 see in appendices 2 and 3 the circuit court nominations in the 107th and 108th congresses of terrence w boyle priscilla r owen richard griffin david w mckeague susan b neilson

elapsed time between first nomination and final disposition was 366 days this average or mean was arrived at by summing the number of days between first nomination and confirmation for all 51 nominees in question and then dividing by 51 however the median elapsed time ie the time interval for the nominee in the midpoint of the distribution of the 51 confirmed nominees was significantly less 216 days in other words for 25 of the 51 confirmed circuit nominees the elapsed time between first nomination and confirmation was less than 216 days for one nominee in the midpoint of the distribution the elapsed time was exactly 216 days50 and for 25 others the elapsed time was more than 216 days51 withdrawn or returned nominees as discussed above52 17 other circuit court nominees as of the end of

that president bush upon assuming office withdrew that second nomination only to renominate gregory himself on may 9 2001 however appendix 1 lists the may 9 2001 nomination as not the second or third

of president bushs district nominees has been defeated in committee vote or rejected in senate confirmation vote an examination of appendix 5 reveals that president bushs district court nominees have varied considerably in how quickly they have advanced through the appointment process of the 237 individuals nominated by the president to district judgeships as of the end of the 109th congress 216 were nominated in only one congress with 187 confirmed in their respective congresses 28 returned at the end of the 109th congress and one withdrawn in the same congress as his first 77 this

nominee between first nomination and confirmation was 1365 days almost three years and nine months86 the least amount of elapsed time for district nominee between first nomination and confirmation was 56 days87 the bottom rows of appendix 5 show that for president bushs 206 district court nominees confirmed as of december 9 2006 the average or mean elapsed time between first nomination and

findings concerning president bushs district court nominations during particular congresses and the actions and amounts of time taken on them the 107th congress president bush submitted total of 118 district court nominations to the senate during the 107th congress89 twenty of the 118 nominations however were resubmissions renominations the resubmissions occurred when 20 district nominations which had been returned by the senate to president bush at the beginning of the senates august 2001 recess were resubmitted as new nominations upon the senates reconvening in september 2001 hence 98 individuals were nominated by president bush to district judgeships during the 107th congress of these 98 individuals 83 were confirmed by the senate 45 by roll call votes90 after receiving committee hearings and being reported out of committee favorably the 15 district court nominees who failed to be confirmed saw their nominations returned to the president at the final adjournment of the 107th congress with none having received committee hearings or committee votes all 15 however were renominated by president bush in the 108th congress with 12 of the 15 confirmed in that congress one

was 84 days and the longest time was 701 days the 109th congress president bush submitted total of 66 district court nominations to the senate during the109th congress101 the number of individuals nominated was also 66 as there were district judge renominations during the congress although eight of the nominees had been nominated previously in the 108th congress the nominations of 36 of the 66 including seven of the eight resubmissions from the 108th congress were confirmed eight by roll call102 two were withdrawn103 and 28 were returned at the end of the 109th congress fifty of the 66

congress crs26 for the 30 district court nominations that were not confirmed an average of 140 days elapsed between senate receipt and final senate action the briefest time elapsing was two days and the longest time was 409 days comparison of president bushs circuit court nominations with his district court nominations notable differences can be found between president bushs circuit court nomination statistics and those for his district court nominations perhaps most notable as of the end of the 109th congress 750 of president bushs circuit court nominees 51 of 68 had received senate confirmation compared with 869 206 of 237 of his district court nominees106 for president bushs immediate predecessor in the white house president clinton the confirmation rate for his circuit court nominees 714 was also notably less than for his district court nominees 872 however such differences in confirmation rates for circuit and district nominees were either slight or nonexistent for the three presidents prior to clinton107 also the senate has tended to take much longer to act on president bushs circuit court nominees than on his district court nominees as table 1 below shows the mean number of days elapsing from first nomination to confirmation for circuit nominees 366 days was more than twice as much as the corresponding time interval of 171 days for district nominees also the median number of days from first nomination to confirmation was 216 days for circuit nominees 62 longer than the corresponding time interval of 134 days for district nominees for circuit nominees returned to the president or withdrawn the mean interval of 710 days between date of first nomination and date of disposition of most recent nomination as of the end of the 109th congress was nearly four times the corresponding mean interval of 184 days for district nominees the median number of days for this time interval for circuit nominees was 407 almost three times higher than the corresponding interval of 149 days for district nominees table 1 mean and median number of days elapsed from first nomination to disposition of last nomination for president george w bushs nominees to

president another indicator that president bushs circuit court nominees have tended to spend more time in the confirmation process than have his district court nominees is the number of congresses in which they have been nominated table 2 below shows that roughly 30 of the persons president bush nominated to circuit judgeships through the end of the 109th congress were nominated in two or more congresses108 whereas fewer than 10 of the persons he nominated to district judgeships were nominated in more than one congress109 as these percentages suggest president bushs usual practice when his judicial nominees failed to receive senate confirmation in one congress was to renominate them in the next congress table 2 number of congresses in which persons were nominated by president george w

bushs circuit and district nomination statistics with those of other recent presidents the following paragraphs compare selected nominations statistics for the presidency of george w bush during the 107th109th congresses with corresponding statistics for the four previous presidents the statistics for president bush are derived from the tables presented at the end of this report whereas corresponding statistics for 108 specifically 206 were nominated in two congresses and 88 were nominated in three congresses 109 specifically 80 were nominated in two congresses and 09 were nominated in three congresses crs28 the four previous presidents have been taken from an earlier crs report110 these comparative statistics should be interpreted with caution as they represent the complete presidencies of president george w bushs predecessors but only the first three congresses of the presidency of george w bush final confirmation percentages and time elapsed for the current president could change considerably over the next two years number of nominees number confirmed and percent confirmed table 3 provides for each of the five most recent presidents the following judicial nomination statistics111 the total number of persons nominated to circuit and district court judgeships the number of persons nominated to these judgeships per year the total number of persons who were confirmed the number of persons who were confirmed per year and the percentage of the total number nominated who were confirmed the cells in the table it should be noted account only for the number of individuals who were nominees and do not count resubmitted nominations made when individuals were renominated to the same judgeship during particular presidency circuit court nominees table 3 shows that through the 109th congress the total number of persons nominated by president george w bush to be circuit judges 68 was less than the number nominated by presidents ronald reagan in eight years 94 william j clinton in eight years 91 and more than the number of nominees of jimmy carter in four years 61 and his father george h w bush in four years 53112 the number of persons nominated by president bush per year to be circuit judges 113 was lowest among the five presidents although only slightly 110 see crs report rl31635 judicial nomination statistics us district and circuit courts

corresponding numbers for presidents clinton 114 and reagan 118113 the total number of persons nominated by george w bush who were confirmed 51 was less than the corresponding confirmation numbers for presidents reagan 83 clinton 65 and carter 56 but more than for george h w bush 42 the per year number of confirmed circuit nominees for the current president bush 85 was slightly above the corresponding number for president clinton 81 and less than those for presidents carter 14 george h w bush 105 and reagan 104 over the course of four successive presidencies table 3 reveals the senate confirmation percentage for presidents circuit court nominees declined from 918 for jimmy carter 883 for ronald reagan and 792 for george h w bush to 714 for william j clinton through the 109th congress however the presidency of george w bush had reversed that downward confirmation trend somewhat with 750 confirmation rate for the presidents circuit nominees district court nominees through the end of the 109th congress table 3 shows the total number of president george w bushs district court nominees 237 was the median middle value among those for the five most recent presidents

district and circuit courts 19772003 this table presents by congress from the 95th through the 1st session of the 108th the average number of days elapsing from nomination date to final action for confirmed nominations unconfirmed nominations and confirmed and unconfirmed nominations combined the table shows that from the 100th to the 108th congress the average elapsed time from nomination to final action in congress for circuit as well as district nominations was usually but not always higher for unconfirmed nominations than it was for confirmed nominations crs32 figure 1 shows for the circuit nominations of each of the first four presidents since january 1977 carter reagan george h w bush and clinton consistent pattern namely that the lowest average number of days from nomination to confirmation was recorded in the first congress during the presidency and the highest corresponding average was recorded in the last congress during the presidency among the first four presidents the most dramatic proportional increase within this pattern was the almost fourfold increase in average number of days from nomination to confirmation during the reagan presidency with 34day average in the 97th congress the first congress during that presidency to 119day average in the 100th congress the last congress during that presidency during the years of the first four presidencies the highest average number of days from nomination to confirmation 227 days was recorded in the 106th congress the last congress during the clinton presidency an average more than twice as long as the 103day average in the 103rd congress the first congress during that presidency figure 1 reveals that thus far the presidency of the current white house occupant george w bush has seen reversal of the pattern just described for president bushs circuit court nominations the lowest average number of days elapsing from nomination to confirmation 125 days was recorded not in the first congress during his presidency the 107th but in the 109th congress thus far in the bush presidency the highest average number of days elapsing from nomination to confirmation 210 days was recorded in the first congress during his presidency the 107th congress figure 1 also shows that during every congress from the 102nd to the 109th the average nominationtoconfirmation time interval for circuit court nominations has been more than 100 days well above this 100plus average was the 210day average for george w bushs circuit court nominations during the 107th congress the first congress during his presidency this average however can be seen as roughly at the same level as the corresponding time averages for william j clintons circuit court nominations during the 105th and 106th congresses 212 days and 227 days respectively the average elapsed time of 125 days between nomination and confirmation for george w bushs circuit nominations in the 109th congress can be seen as being in the same approximate range as the corresponding averages for president ronald reagans circuit nominations in the 100th congress 119 days george h w bushs circuit nominations in the 102nd congress 108 days and president clintons circuit nominations in the 103rd and 104th congresses 103 and 124 days respectively district court nominations average number of days from nomination to confirmation figure 2 below like the preceding figure 1 for circuit nominations shows the average number of days that elapsed for district court nominations from nomination date to confirmation during each congress from the 95th congress to the 109th congress each bar in figure 2 indicates the average number of elapsed days from nomination date to confirmation for specified congress and under each bar is the name of the president whose presidency coincided in time with that congress note the averages shown in figure 2 are those only for district court nominations which ultimately were confirmed in particular congress excluded from the calculation of averages were the pendency times in congress for crs33 nominations that ultimately were not confirmed but were withdrawn by the president or returned to the president at some point in the congress figure 2 us district court nominations average number of days from nomination to confirmation 95th congress to 109th congress january 20 1977 december 9 2006 figure 2 shows among other things that from the 95th congress during the first two years of the carter presidency through the 105th congress during the fifth and sixth years of the clinton presidency the average number of elapsed days from nomination to confirmation for district court nominations per congress increased significantly from 40day average in the 95th congress to 165day average in the 105th this overall pattern of increase however was marked by drops in the nominationtoconfirmation time average during the first two years of presidency ie with the average dropping from significantly higher average recorded in the last two years of the previous presidency only to be followed by increases in the average during the subsequent congress or congresses of the successor presidency the average nominationtoconfirmation time intervals for george w bushs district court nominations during the three congresses coinciding with his presidency have all been below the peak average of 165 days recorded for president clintons district nominees in the 105th congress relatively close to that peak however was the 156day average interval recorded for president bushs confirmed district nominees in the 108th congress and the 143day average interval recorded for confirmed district court nominees in the 109th congress comparison of time averages in figure 2 with those in figure 1 also reveals that in nine of the 15 congresses in the 19772006 time frame the average time intervals between nomination and confirmation were less for district than for circuit court nominations116 for instance the nominationtoconfirmation average interval for william j clintons district nominations in the 106th congress was 133 days compared with 227 days for his circuit nominations in the same congress likewise 116 in one of the 15 congresses the 96th the average time interval between nomination and confirmation was the same for circuit and district court nominations 79 days crs34 the average interval for george w bushs district nominations in the 107th congress was 127 days compared with 210 days for his circuit nominations in the same congress this however was not the pattern for the two most recent congresses in the 108th congress the average elapsed time between nomination and confirmation for george w bushs district nominations 156 days was higher than for his circuit nominations 140 days as it was again in the 109th congress for district court nominations 143 days for circuit nominations 110 days it should be emphasized as caveat that figures 1 and 2 in accounting only for nominations confirmed within congress have certain limitations the figures focus on the elapsed times of nominations rather than on nominees and the time which elapsed from their first nomination to confirmation of their most recent nomination focusing only on nominations rather than persons nominated underestimates how long individuals awaited confirmation this is particularly true for courts of appeals nominees whose nominations have been returned at greater rate than district court nominees under president george w bush further failing to account for nominees who never were confirmed may also understate the average time in pendency for judicial nominations to provide clearer comparative snapshot by presidency of the average time pending for all nominees figures 3 and 4 follow over the five most recent presidencies the two figures provide for circuit and district court nominees respectively the average elapsed time from their first nomination to final disposition of their last nomination separating confirmed and unconfirmed nominees crs35 circuit court nominees average number of days from nomination to final action figure 3 below shows by president from jimmy carter to george w bush the average number of days elapsed from date of first nomination to final action for circuit nominees confirmed as well as for those not confirmed117 figure 3 average time to

being almost the same for the circuit nominees of presidents carter and reagan has since risen steadily the average elapsed time between first nomination and confirmation was 69 days for carter circuit nominees and 68 days for reagan nominees subsequently however with each succeeding presidency this time average increased significantly president george h w bushs confirmed nominees to the circuit courts on average waited 104 days to be confirmed 53 longer than president reagans confirmed nominees president clintons confirmed circuit nominees on average waited 249 days 139 longer than george hw bushs nominees and george w bushs circuit court nominees waited on average 366 days to be confirmed 47 longer than president clintons nominees when using the reagan and current bush presidencies as points of reference figure 3 shows george w bushs confirmed circuit court nominees have taken on average more than five times as long as president reagans circuit nominees to be confirmed 366 versus 68 days 117 the numbers shown in figure 3 were calculated from crs nominations database derived in large part from data available in the presidential nominations database in the legislative information system of the us congress lis available at httpwwwcongressgovnomissearchhtml data for the 95th and 96th congresses were collected from the journal of the executive proceedings of the senate crs36 for circuit court nominees not confirmed figure 3 reveals that the average elapsed time between first nomination and final disposition of last nomination has by presidency also risen steadily since the presidency of jimmy carter specifically the average elapsed times for unconfirmed circuit court nominees between first nomination and final disposition of their last nomination was as follows for nominees of president carter 195 days nominees of president reagan 257 days nominees of president george hw bush 319 days nominees of president clinton 439 days and nominees of president george w bush 710 days three and half times longer than the corresponding elapsed time average of 195 days for president carters unconfirmed circuit court nominees the preceding discussion it should be noted compares time averages for circuit nominees of four completed presidencies carter through clinton with those of presidency george w bushs which is still in progress it is of course unclear to what extent the time averages for president bushs circuit nominees for his presidency after two completed terms will be affected by senate consideration of his nominations in the 110th congress district court nominees average number of days from nomination to final action figure 4 below shows by president from jimmy carter to george w bush the average number of days elapsed from date of first nomination to final action for district court nominees confirmed as well as for those not confirmed118 figure 4 demonstrates that the average time to confirmation after being 70 days both for the district court nominees of president carter and of president reagan rose steadily during the next three presidencies president george h w bushs confirmed nominees to the district courts on average waited 107 days to be confirmed 529 longer than reagan and carter district nominees president clintons confirmed district nominees on average waited 133 days to be confirmed 243 longer than george hw bushs nominees and george w bushs district court nominees waited 171 days 286 longer than clinton nominees viewed from the perspective of the entire 19772006 period in question george w bushs district court nominees have taken on average almost two and half times as long as the district nominees of presidents carter and reagan to be confirmed 171 days for bush versus 70 days for carter and reagan nominees the magnitude of this increase however was not as great as the abovediscussed 500 increase in average time taken for george w bushs circuit court nominees to be confirmed 366 days over the average confirmation time taken by president reagans circuit nominees 68 days in other words over the course of the last four presidencies reagan through george w bush there has been steady rise in the average times taken to confirm 118 the numbers shown in figure 4 as for figure 3 above were calculated from crs nominations database derived in large part from data available in the presidential nominations database in the legislative information system of the us congress lis available at httpwwwcongressgovnomissearchhtml data for the 95th and 96th congresses were collected from the journal of the executive proceedings of the senate crs37 district as well as circuit court nominees however circuit nominees have experienced higher rate of increase in their average confirmation time than have district nominees ultimately resulting in an average confirmation time during the presidency of george w bush 366 days more than twice as long as the average confirmation time for district court nominees 171 days for district court nominees not confirmed figure 4 shows there has not been steady increase by presidency in the average elapsed time between first nomination and final disposition of last nomination rather the average elapsed time stayed at about the same level over the course of the carter reagan and george h w bush presidencies increased dramatically by more than 100 with the clinton presidency and then for the first six years of the presidency of george w bush fell back to about the same level as the average elapsed times of the carter reagan and george hw bush presidencies specifically the average elapsed times for unconfirmed district court nominees between first nomination and final disposition of their last nomination was as follows for carter nominees 183 days reagan nominees 165 days nominees of george hw bush 174 days clinton nominees 400 days and nominees of george w bush 184 days figure 4 average time to

nominees of four completed presidencies carter through clinton with those of presidency george w bushs which is still in progress for the current bush presidency the nominations of four individuals in the last month of the 109th congress all of whom were returned by the senate and renominated in the 110th congress had downward effect on the average time in pendency for unconfirmed crs38 nominees 184 days119 it is of course unclear to what extent the time averages for president bushs district nominees for his presidency after two completed terms will be affected by senate consideration of his nominations in the 110th congress 119 the four nominations and districts were of james rogan central california and benjamin h settle western washington on nov 15 2006 frederick j kapala northern illinois on dec 5 2006 and thomas farr eastern north carolina on dec 7 2006 all of these nominations were returned on dec 9 2006 and resubmitted to the 110th congress on jan 9 2007 the lengths of pendency for each nominee in the 109th congress as of dec 9 2006 were 24 24 four and two days respectively see appendix 8 whether these nominees are confirmed or not in the 110th congress the overall time between their first nomination in the 109th congress and final disposition of their last nomination in the 110th congress can be expected to significantly exceed the pendency lengths of 24 24
