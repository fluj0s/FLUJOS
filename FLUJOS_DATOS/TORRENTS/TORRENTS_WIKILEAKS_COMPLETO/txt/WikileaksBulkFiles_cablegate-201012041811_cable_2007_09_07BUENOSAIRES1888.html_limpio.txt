frontrunner be better partner for us ref buenos aires 1883 b buenos aires 1809 c buenos aires 1777 classified by dcm tom kelly for reasons b d 1 c summary wellbriefed confident cristina fernandez kirchner cfk described her policy priorities to the ambassador on september 20 few days before she departs for fiveday program in new york although she defended goa positions on controversial economic issues cfk expressed strong desire to promote foreign investment increase scientific and educational exchange with the united states and tell it like it is with american policymakers the discussions conciliatory content and tone confirms our expectation that cfk will prove more reliable trustworthy and accessible partner of the united states than her husband nestor kirchner end summary 2 c cfk met with the ambassador for 45 minutes at the presidential residence in olivos on september 20 argentinas first lady and presumptive next president was in full command of her brief speaking without notes on broad range of topics at one point noting that she and the ambassador were reviewing topics that would resurface throughout her new york trip she said referring to her travels and speeches this is good preparation but hey im already prepared she was gracious and relaxed throughout not rushing through any part of the conversation and listening as well as talking the meeting was cfks second with the ambassador in contrast president kirchner has never met privately with the ambassador she also went out of her way to ask the ambassador to send greetings to shannon whom she recalled meeting early on in washington just before the assistant secretary was confirmed by the senate paris club willing to deal without preconceptions 3 c after cfk previewed her schedule in new york ref the ambassador noted the great international interest in her policy views he commented that cfks interest in the world and willingness to countenance policy changes especially in the economic realm were wellreceived abroad including in the united states as is her evident openness to dialogue the ambassador also mentioned issues that may well draw questions from journalists businessmen and others during her program including prospects for deal with the paris club the investment climate prospects for inflation and the goas relationship with iran and venezuela 4 c cfk replied in great detail on economic themes but refrained from commenting on iran and venezuela on the paris club pc she stressed argentinas desire to reach an agreement but reiterated the current governments insistence that deal not be conditioned on goa accord with the imf she said that argentinas attitude stemmed not from antiimf bias but from conviction that imf policies as currently constituted are antigrowth and therefore unacceptable that is why in her view the imf had experienced serious loss of prestige in latin american societies if we dont grow she continued we cant pay you cant collect debts from the dead 5 c cfk characterized debt agreements reached by previous argentine governments as illusory made by desperate governments that never intended to repay the current government and the one that she hopes to lead sought to break what she called cycle of lies and restructure argentine debt without inhibiting growth such negotiation she said would need to occur without preconceptions and both sides should come to the table with flexibility and an open mind she claimed that during his campaign swing through argentina ref b french candidate for imf managing director strausskahn had expressed sympathy for argentinas approach and criticism of the imfs track record in argentina she acknowledged however that hes running for office so maybe he was just telling us what we wanted to hear the ambassador said that the united states stands ready to engage constructively to move to paris club solution 6 c the ambassador mentioned the issue of bondholdots as another potential topic that cfk will face in new york noting that the us bondholders are carrying out wellorganized effort to win support for their cause cfk indicated awareness of the lobbying resources holdouts bring to bear and their negative attitude towards the current buenos air 00001888 002 of 003 government she said that she had encountered their publicity campaign during her recent trip to germany and knew they were active in japan too at the same time she offered little hope that the holdouts would get deal anytime soon noting that law circumscribes what the government can offer them she told the ambassador that i know this isnt what you want to hear but said that previous argentine leaders would tell foreign ambassadors what their interlocutors wanted to hear not what they really thought or intended to do she and her husband were different she insisted they told it straight cfk said that she understood that americans valued straight talk and she hoped that this quality would earn her trust and respect in the united states foreign investment bring it on 7 sbu cfk said that the goas main motivation in striking deal with the paris club was to entice foreign export credit agencies to go back on cover in argentina facilitating her plans to bring more foreign investment here she noted that foreign investment in certain sectors was already booming auto companies including mercedesbenz peugeot ford and gm were pumping tens of millions of dollars of new investment into their plants with many adding new assembly lines and exporting much of their output 8 u cfk reserved her greatest enthusiasm for argentinas progress in attracting investment in the information technology sector as means to expand argentinas global economic role she noted proudly that it represented the fastest growing sector in the economy during her husbands presidency she expected great things from the sector in the future we have great soccer players in argentina because our kids play so much soccer she said now they spend all their time on computers so i know that theres an argentine bill gates out there we just have to find him the ambassador agreed that this was an area of great potential he noted the significant us investment in this sector including the fact that ibm is the largest us employer in argentina he also made pitch for quick approval of turner broadcastings purchase of claxion local audiovisual company which will lead to argentine creations being distributed throughout latin america playing defense energy inflation 9 sbu despite her expression of enthusiasm for foreign investment she was defensive about charges that the current government is attacking foreign investors in the argentine energy sector septel she characterized exxons apparent exit from the argentine market as the result of regional drawdown in latin america and argued that the energy sector is problem everywhere right now she said that private companies miscalculated domestic energy demand over the past few years failing to anticipate the governments success in achieving extremely rapid rates of growth now there was little idle capacity in argentinas energy sector the goa she insisted was doing its part presiding over the construction of thousands of kilometers of new pipelines and seeking new sources of supply 10 sbu cfk was also defensive when she responded to concerns that the goa was manipulating economic statistics to keep argentine inflation numbers down she said that there were several biases in the way that the governments statistical institute indec had previously collected price data she claimed that it did not account sufficiently for seasonal variations in price data collected food data in posh food emporiums rather than in the modest groceries where most argentines shop and focused on private school costs while the vast majority of argentines sent their children to public schools she said that argentina had revised its inflation methodology six times since the 1930s the political opposition she said was behind the claims that current methodological changes reflected government plot to understate inflation she also blamed the opposition for the growing warnings about electoral fraud in argentina which she dismissed as bizarre cfk did acknowledge that the goa needs to settle with clarity the methodological issues as well as to resolve the union problems troubling the statistical institute future economic goals 11 c cfk returned to economic growth as the most buenos air 00001888 003 of 003 important objective of the government that she intends to lead she said that if argentina achieves positive growth in 2007 and 2008 it will represent the first time in century that the country has grown for six straight years if its economy continues to grow at rates of five to six percent for another decade she continued argentina would become unbeatable 12 sbu key sector for the countrys future she said was tourism an area in which her country had enormous undeveloped potential with the rise in ecotourism the wealthiest tourists were looking for unspoiled safe venues which argentina had in abundance she noted that argentina experienced travel boom after the asian tsunami as tourists sought safer places in which to experience nature the ambassador interjected that for the tourism sector to achieve its potential argentina needed to address its dysfunctional domestic aviation sector she agreed identifying reform of domestic aviation as one of our great challenges without referring specifically to the strikeprone national airline aerolineas argentinas she identified two specific problems in the sector need for more resources and conflictive labor environment in which handful of combative unions undermined all attempts to turn the sector around other issues exchanges tip 13 sbu the ambassador raised trafficking in persons the need to pass federal law and the importance of expanded educational and cultural exchanges especially among youth he asked for the senators support cfk expressed strong interest in cultural and educational exchanges with the united states including an upcoming buenos aires summit of hemispheric women leaders organized by us ngo vital voices told the ambassador that argentina must not fail to take advantage of your scientific resources theyre the best in the world reassured the ambassador that legislation to criminalize trafficking in persons would pass the argentine congress after the october elections without any great difficulty comment 14 c the discussions conciliatory content and tone confirmed what we have observed in cfks speeches and gestures with increasing frequency argentinas presidential frontrunner seeks rapprochement with the united states cfk seems to understand that pragmatic enmityfree relationship with washington will buy argentina leeway on number of critical financial and geopolitical issues at the same time this forwardleaning attitude is unlikely to presage the next governments repudiation of the current regimes nationalist populist policies cfks defense of goa positions on the imf the investment climate the energy sector and inflation numbers during this private discussion suggests an unwillingness to break with the heterodox policies of her husband but even if the charm offensive is calculated rather than heartfelt there is mistaking the opportunities that await the usg beyond the argentine presidential election cfks conversation with the ambassador confirms our expectation that she will prove more reliable trustworthy and accessible partner of the united states that does not however take away from the challenges we will face in forging solutions to such issues as the paris club or bondholders outstanding debt wayne
