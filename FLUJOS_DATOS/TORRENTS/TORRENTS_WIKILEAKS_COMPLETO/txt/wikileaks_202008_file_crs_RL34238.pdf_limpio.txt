where it was listed as threatened with the exception of experimental populations established in the 1990s the protections for the gray wolf have been diminishing since that date as wolf populations have increased in some areas the use of distinct population segments dpss term created in the 1978 amendments has played role in that reduced protection dpss allow vertebrate species to be divided into distinct groups based on geography and genetic distinctions in 2007 the wolf was removed from the endangered species list for most of its range based on two dpss the northern rocky mountains and

been amended so has gray wolf protection the act provide s the basis for determining which species are threatened and endangered and how those listed species will be protected amendments allow consideration of distin ct groups within vertebrate species for protection the act allows introduction of experimental populations to areas where the species longer exists and provides re gulatory protections for that introduction each of these elements will be discussed in this report generally and more specifically in the context of gray wolf protection for centuries wolf populations have been under attack by humans the effort to reduce or eliminate the species was designed to protect humans from perceived direct threat to humans or to protect livestock or favored game species wolves were eventually eliminated in most states in an effort supported by the science community at the time but coinciding roughly with the forester aldo leopolds essay killing the wolf in sand county

populations taxonomic view like many large mammals such as bears ursus arctos mountain lions felis concolor and whitetailed deer odocoileus virginianus gray wolves canis lupus have complicated even convoluted taxonomic history variations in color size and bone structure have led some mammalogists to name wolves in various areas as different subspecies or popul ations where other credible experts would see only single species with variability here are scientific definitions of few key terms population is group of organisms of the same species that inhabit specific area species is naturally occurring population or group of potentially interbreeding populations that is reproductively isolated ie cannot exchange genetic ma terial from other such populations or groups subspecies is taxonomic category th at subdivides species into morphologically distinct groups of individuals representing step toward the production of new species although they are still fully capable of interbreeding subspecies are usually geographically isolated taxon or the plural taxa is defined as grouping of organisms given formal taxonomic name at any rank species genus family order class division phylum or kingdom8httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34238crs3 9 see discussion citing various authors in l david mech the wolf the ecology and behavior of an endangered species pp 2931 garden city ny

proceed and arctic snow cover diminish w ill the genes for white coats diminish in the arctic wo lves that may be likely since more brightly colored wolves would be at disadvantage in much of the year and over growing area natural selection would then tend to disf avor these animals and their offspring 12 pl 93205 311 87 stat 886 13 pl 95632 16 usc 153216these terms may appear clear however there are simple measures to draw unequivocal distinctions biologists commonly divide their colleagues into lumpers and splitters based on their inclinations in classifying organisms as the names suggest lumpers are those who tend to minimize differences and see one or few species perhaps with some variations while splitters would tend to emphasize those differences dividing speci into many subspecies or populations for wolves which are or were found in temperate and polar areas throughout the northern hemisphere some observers splitters would argue that there are as many as 24 subspecies in north america nd eight in europe and asia9 more recently lumpers have had the upper hand and fws recognizes two species gray and red wolves and divides the gray wolf into six distinct population segments based in part on administrative and procedural criteria10 while confusing to the nonsc ientist this muddled stat of taxonomic affairs is entirely predictable for several reasons first wolves are extremely wideranging both as species and as individuals so interbreeding among them could certainly muddy the picture second the consiste ncy of variations over time is hard to determine since longrange studies of longlived species are rare third evolutionary change does not stop and wolv are an adaptable species as shown by their behavior and by their presence in tremendous variety of ecosystems11 if fws scientists choice of state boundaries to delineate wolf populations is criticized as arbitrary the debate among academic scientists also has an air of informed judgment and there is reason to predict th at either debate will end any time soon species and distinct population segments if the scientific community is somewhat inconsistent in identifying species the law has fared better the definition of species has changed since the early days of the act in 1973 the definition incl uded any subspecies of fish or wildlife or plants and any other group of fish or w ildlife of the same sp ecies or smaller taxa in common spatial arrangement that interbreed when mature12 in 1978 congress amended that definition to include the term distinct population segment dps and was limited to vertebrate dpss only13 the change was controversial the general accounting office gao now the government accountability office recommended limiting the definition of species to higher

16 usc 153216categories than populations and excludi ng all distinct populations including geographically separated populations14 gao proposed the follo wing definition the term species includes any subspeci of fish wildlife or plants15 gao found the 1973 definition to be overly broad we found that interiors fish and wildlife service is listing populations of species in limited geographical areas as endangered or threatened instead of listing the entire species this has occurre d because the service has interpreted the definition of species to include populations regardless of their size location or total numbers using the services interpretation of the term squirrels in specific city park could be listed as endangered even though there is an abundance of squirrels in other parks in the same city and elsewhere such listings had increased the number of poten tial conflicts between endangered and threatened species and federal state and private projects and programs16 congress did not follow the gao recommendation it agreed with fws that the service needed to be able to adopt different management practices for different populations based on their need sena committee report discussing populations said the committee agrees that there may be instances in which fws should provide for different levels of protection for popul ations of the same species although it advised the practice be used sparingly and only when the biological evidence indicates that such action is warranted17 thus congress revised and limited the definition of species in 1978 by eliminating taxonomic categor ies below subspecies from the definition except for vertebrates18 the revised and still current definition is any subspecies of fish or wildlife or plants and any distinct popula tion segment of any species of vertebrate fish or wildlife which interbreeds when mature19 however the phrase distinct population segment had meaning in the scientific community outside of the and was not used in endangered species listings for nearly two decades regulatory history of dist inct population segments dps generally refers to portion of listed species separa ted from the rest of the species by

extinction even though another popula tion outside the united states is more abundant and 2 where conc lusive data have been available only for certain populations of species and not for the species as whole20 in 1996 policy regarding dps was introdu ced by fws hereinafter referred to as the policy21 the policy contains the criteria that must be met for protection of species at the population level first the population segment must be discrete factors considered to determine discrete ness are whether the segment is markedly separated from other populations of the sa taxon as consequence of physical physiological ecological or behavioral factors22 discreteness can also be found if the population is delimited by interna tional governmental boundaries although state boundaries are frequently used to descri be dps they cannot be used under the policy to determine discreteness next the population segment must be found to be significant meaning its demise would be an important loss of genetic diversity23 four factors are listed in the policy for determining species significance 1 persistence of the segment in an ecological setting unusual or unique for the taxon 2 evidence that loss of the dps would result in significant gap in the range of the taxon 3 evidence that the dps represents the only surviving natural occurrence of taxon within its historic range or 4 evidence that the dps diffe rs markedly from other populations of the species in its genetic characteristics genetic evidence is allowed to be considered but is not required the policy indicates that available scientific evidence of the discrete population segments importan ce will be considered in finding significance but does not specify the best available scientific evidence if species is found to be both discrete and significant then its status is reviewed to see whether it is endangered or threatened dps species is reviewed to determine whether it shoul d be listed under exactly the same procedures as any other listing the listing determination is to be based solely on the best scientific and commercial data available24 pros and cons of distin ct population segments agency efficiency and focus were two intended benefits of dpss according to the policy the policy said determining dpss will concentrat efforts toward the conservation of biological resources at risk of extinction25 the policy suggested the practice of using dpss could help endangered sp ecies by focusing on smaller groups this may allow protection and recovery of declining organisms in more timely and less costly manner and on smaller scale than the more costly and extensivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34238crs6 26 61 fed reg at 4725 27 humane society of the united states v kempthorne 070677 plf ddc

wolves in that area to the list of endangered and threatened species38 the southwestern dps was kept as an endangered species this is the only gray wolf dps to have been ignored by litigati on it is also the only gray wolf dps that was not delisted or downlisted at the time of its designation efforts to name the wolves of the alexander archipelago in alaska as threatened or endangered have not succeeded39 in part because the wolves in that region have not been considered as dps as noted above wolf taxonomy is complex but the choices made in distinguishing dpss have significant eff ects in particular if fws agrees with taxonomic lumpers and recognizes only few dpss then the recovery task becomes simpler than it would be if many dpss are recognized some observers would argue that because wolf sightings in northern new york and new england are very rare those animals should represen t portion of dps that extends into canada this would entitle them to their own recovery plan40 in addition whether few lone wolves inhabit the area or simply visit it occasionally reintroduction proponents would further argue that an abunda nce of apparently suitable habitat and high prey populations make the re gion suitable for recovery effortshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34238crs9 41 essentially one dps of the lower 48 states is created from all regions not in three named areas thus

ond an academic debate betw een lumpers and splitters fws considers the wolves if any in that area to be part of the same dps of much larger area41 and if portion of the dps reaches its recovery goals fws arguing that it does not have legal responsibility to recover species throughout its historic range would be relieved of the burden of recovering th species in the remainder of the dpss range thus the decision of whether to mount an effort to recover relatively rare wolves in the remote northeast and certain other areas depends on two questions one lega l and one scientific does require that species be recovered in all or most of the remaining areas of suitable habitat do or did the wolves of the northeast constitute dps and ifnone remain should presumably genetically similar wolves in nearby parts of canada be used to repopulate the area litigation regarding west ern and eastern dpss the rule downlisting two of the three dpss of the wolf in 2003 was challenged in two federal district courts the dispute focused on how dps s range was defined under the the plaintiff environmental groups before the di strict court for the district of oregon argued that fws considered only where the wolves were currently located when determining their viability this allowed fw s to count wolves only in the areas they occupied however fws had found areas out side of the wolves current range that were suitable habitat although wolves were present the plaintiffs argued that this method was contrary to the and prior caselaw because the act requires that species is endangered if it is at risk of extinction in all or significant portion of its range the court agreed that fws had violated the by equating the wolves current range with significant portion of its range 42 the court

added the concept of ex perimental populations to the as way of reintroducing species without severe restrictions on the use of private and public land in the area50 experimental population signations are sometimes referred to as section 10j rules the practice allows introduction of species outside its current range to re store it to its historic range two criteria must be met for an exper imental population to comply with the law first doi must have authorized the release of the population second the population must be wholly separate geographically fro m other animals of that species51 congress required the separation so that the introduced population could be clearly distinguished members of an experiment population are considered to be threatened under the act and thus can have special rules written for them52 in fact congress referred to special rules for experimental popula tions as way to reduce public opposition to the release of certain species us ing the red wolf as an example53 congress suggested in report that the special regulations could allow killing members of the species the committee fully expects that there will be instances where the regulations allow for the incidental take of xperimental populations the committee also expects that where appropriate the re gulations could allow for the directed taking of experimental popul ations for example the release of experimental populations of predators such as red wolv could allow for the taking of these animals if depredations occur or if th release of these populations will continue to be frustrated by public opposition54 unlike dpss experimental populations may not necessarily have the same protections under the section 10 requires fws to determine whether the experimental population is of species that is in imminent danger of extinction that decision is based on whether the loss of the population would appreciably diminish the species prospect for rvival if so the experimental population is deemed essential and is treated as an endangered species currently there are essential experimental populations if it is deemed nonessential the experimental population is treated as species that is proposed for listing as threatened or endangered therehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34238crs12 55 for an account of some of the changes and sense of the excitement in the scientific

blackfooted ferret and the whooping crane experimental populations of gray wolves despite neareradication of the wolf in the lower 48 states some of the wolfs old territories survived though in highly modified form at the end of the 20th century fws planned to reintroduce the wolf to parts of its historic range using the experimental population provisions of the reintroduction was more controversial than that in the greater yellowstone ecosystem where all other large vertebrates were still present and where many scientists agreed that elk populations favorite wolf prey had reached harmful levels when wolves were returned the science community was nearly giddy anticipating the potential effects from firstever return of major predator to nearly intact ecosystem the excitement was intense partly because the yellowstone area was already well studied with longterm data on many species including both compe titors eg coyotes and to some extent grizzlies and potential prey eg elk moose and bison as scientists had expected wolves had profound effect on elk but ther is also evidence of effects that were less predictable on aspens cottonwoods beav ers beetles mice red foxes ravens and voles among others55 however the road to the reintroduction was and still is fraught with litigation and controversy wolves also had been exterminated in the southwest fws recognized separate subspecies the mexican wolf canis lupus baileyi which was probably gone from the united states but found in very low numbers in mexico after cooperative and successful captive breeding

under the rule for minnesota individual wolves that have preyed on domestic animals can be killed by designated government agents fws asserts that this rule avoids even larger numbers of wolves being killed by private citizens who otherwise might take wolf control into their own hands63 in 2003 as part of the rulemaking that was vacated fws issued section 4d rules for two dpss eastern and western

goats bison or moose in the area before the stat and tribes could act they were required to submit the plan for peer review public comment and fws approva l data at the time from many sources cited by

1545 wolves including 105 breeding pairs69 in 2008 fws changed the special rule70 fws determined that the definition of unacceptable impact had to be altered as wolves were not the primary cause in ungulate population decreases accordingly the definition was modified to mean impact to wild ungulate population or he rd where state or tribe has determined that wolves are one of the major cause s of the population or herd not meeting established state or tribal popula tion or herd management goals71 public and peer reviews are still required the plan allows state to kill wolves provided the
