estimates it would produce net reduction of tax reve nue amounting to 87 billion over five years but would be essentially revenueneutral over 10 years increasing revenue by 1 million1 underlying the acts net revenue over 10 years is wide assortment of both revenuelosing and revenueraising measures in broad outline ajcas principal features on the revenuereducing side are enactment of major new tax benefit for domestic rather than foreig n producti on provision of variety of tax cuts for multinational firms and an assortment of relatively narrow business tax cuts spread throughout the tax code on the revenuera ising side the acts major provisions are repeal of the eti export bene fit and enactment of an ssortment of other revenue raising items including provisions designed to restrict corporate tax shelters measures designed to curtail fuel tax ev asion and more stringent rules for certain charitable contributions th act also contains budget neutral buyout provision for tobacco quotas the acts development the discfsceti controversy the act began as legislative response to the controversy between the united states and the eu over the us tax codes eti benefit for exporters controversyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32652crs2 2 for history of the di spute see crs report rl31660 history of the extraterritorial income eti and foreign sales corpora tion fsc export tax benefit controversy by david l brumbaugh that had history spanning three decades2 the dispute began with the enactment in 1971 of etis statutory ancestor the dome stic international sales corporation disc tax benefit for exporting shor tly after its enactment disc encountered difficulties with the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt an agreement among most of the worlds trading nati ons governing permissible trade practices european nations and severa l other countries lodged complaint with gatt arguing that disc violated gatts prohibition agai nst export subsidies in response the united states lodged counterclaim argu ing that the territorial tax systems operated by several european countries france the netherlands and belgium also provided prohibited export subsidies because they did not tax income earned outside the taxing countys borders in 1981 gatt panel generally suppor ted the position of the european countries concluding that disc was ind eed prohibited export subsidy the panel also concluded however that under certain ci rcumstances territorial tax system did not provide prohibited export subsidies that country need not tax income earned outside its own territory thus although th united states did not concede that disc was prohibited in 1984 it enacted revamped export benefit that was designed with an eye to the gatt requirements th new foreign sales corporation fsc provisions attempted to achieve gattlega lity by incorporating elements of territorial tax system firms obtained the benefit by selling their exports through fsc subsidiary corporations that were required to be incorporated abroad the european countries did not accept th gattcompatibility of fsc but the controversy nonetheless fade d into the background for period in 1997 however the eu began proceedings against fsc under the auspices of the world trade organization wto which had replaced gatt as did gatt the wto prohibited export subsidies and the eu argu ed that fsc like disc before it was prohibited subsidy as with gatt wto panel issued ruling against the us tax benefit in october 1999 and while the united states appealed the ruling in february 2000 the wto appellate body reject ed the appeal in general the wto rulings held that fsc violated the wt agreements by providing subsidy contingent on exporting the panels generally rejected the analogy between fsc and territorial taxation the united states responded in november 2000 by enacting the eti provisions which again attemp ted to redesign the export tax benefit in way that would be wtocompatible the eti pr ovisions were enacted by public law 106 519 in contrast to fsc eti did not requi re exports to be sold through foreign subsidiary but instead categorized income that qualified for the export benefit as being extraterritorial the eu however lodged complaint against the new eti provisions maintaining they were an export subsidy like disc and fsc before it in august 2001 wto panel issued report that concluded that eti was not wto compatible and in january 2002 the wto ppellate body rejected us appeal shortly thereafter policymakers in both congress and the bush administrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32652crs3 expressed the view that mere redesign of the export tax benefit was not workable solution looming behind the wto panel ru lings was the possibility of sanctions wto rules permit complaining country to ask for permission to impose retaliatory tariffs and in august 2002 the wto appr oved an eu request for permission to impose up to 4 billion in tariffs on goods imported from the united states the eu indicated however that it would not impose the tariffs so long as the united states made progress towards becoming wto compliant in march 2004 however the eu began phasedin app lication of its tariffs congressional action beginning in 2002 the chief legislative responses to the eti controversy were alike in their proposals to eliminate eti rather than to attempt anot her redesign of the benefit where the various bills differed however was in the additional tax benefits they proposed to offset what policymakers viewed as the likely detrimental effects of etis repeal on segments of the us economy as noted below the relative merits of the different alternative tax benefits were hotly debated further as legislation in both chambers of congre ss progressed its scope tended to expand beyond tight focus on eti and its economic antidotes to include relatively broad range of primarily business provisions dispersed throughout the various sections of the tax code the first major legislative response to the wto rulings against eti came in july 2002 with the introduction of hr 5095 107th congress by chairman thomas of the house ways and means committee the bill proposed outright repeal of the eti provisions rather than their rede sign at the sa time th bill pr oposed number of tax cuts for us firms operatin g abroad reductions aimed at improving the competitiveness of us firms in international markets the foreign tax cuts applied in two broad parts of the us international tax system to the rules limiting the us foreign tax credit and to the deferral tax benefit for overseas investment and its associated limitations under the tax codes subpart f pr ovisions generally the tax cuts provided more generous fore ign tax credit rules and relaxed aspects of subpart fs limitation on deferral in addition to its repeal of the eti benefit the bill contained number of re venueraising items chief among these were new restrictions on tax shelters and limits on earnings stripping and corporate inversions or expatriation earnings stripping is generally the shifting of income by foreign parent firms out of the us tax jurisdiction by means of interest payments by us subsidiaries to their fo reign parents corporate inversions are corporate reorganizations wh ere firm switches the country of its parent holding corporation from the united states to foreign country with low tax rates estimates by the joint committee on taxation jct indicated the bill would result in net reduction in tax revenue of 64 billion over fi ve years and 11 billion over 10 years action was taken on hr 5095 before the end of the 107th congress early in the 108th congress representatives crane and rangel introduced hr 1769 containing an alterna tive approach like hr 5095 the bill proposed repeal of the eti provisions however inst ead of providing tax cuts for overseas investment hr 1769 proposed to replace eti with tax deduction that would apply only to domestic production the bill was c onsiderably narrower in scope than hr 5095 containing provisions other than its repeal of eti and domesticproductionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32652crs4 deduction the bills sponsors stated that it would be revenue neutral raising the same amount of tax revenue that it was expected to lose in july 2003 chairman thomas introduced new eti bill as hr 2896 somewhat modified version of the bill was approved by the ways and means committee on october 28 the new bill incorpor ated many of the elements of hr 5095 from the previous congress but also proposed number of tax benefits that would be restricted to domestic investme nt in broad outline the bill proposed to repeal eti implement tax cuts for overseas investment enact ne w tax benefits for domestic investment and offset part of the revenue cost by mean s of several revenue raisers generally in the areas of earnings stripping expatriation and tax shelters version of hr 2896 differing only sligh tly from that reported by the ways and means committee was estimated by the jc t to reduce revenue by 211 billion over five years and 598 billion over 10 years in october 2003 the senate finan ce committee approved s 1637 an eti bill sponsored by chairman grassley like the ways and means b ill the finance committee measure proposed to repeal eti nd replace it with mix of tax benefits including both items benefitting foreign income and benefits restricted to domestic investment in the international area there was considerable overlap between s 1637 and hr 2896 with s 1637 proposing tax cuts in the area of the foreign tax credit and deferral for domestic inve stment the finance committee bill proposed deduction for domestic production rather th an the rate cut proposed by the ways and means bill although the finance committees deduction w ould have provided benefit of similar size to the ways and means rate reduction after extended debate the full senate approved somewhat modified version of the bill on may 11 2004 the jct estimated the senateapproved bill woul d reduce tax revenue by 146 billion over five years and increase re venue by 28 billion over 10 years the provisions chiefly responsible for the sign ificant revenue differences between the senate bill and hr 2896 were revenue raisers while both bills contained revenue offsets in the broad areas of tax shelte rs and corporate inversions and earnings stripping the senate bills provisions were estimated to produce mo re revenue also the senate bill contained number of revenueraisers not contained in the ways and means bill including new restrictions on tax avoidance through leasing transactions with taxindifferent entities the senate passed its version of an eti bill before the full house acted on hr 2896 and on june 4 chairman thomas intr oduced modified version of the ways and means committee bill as hr 4520 the new bill had the sa general thrust as s 1637 and hr 2896 before it it propos ed to repeal eti while enacting mix of domestic and international benefits while offsetting part of the cost with assorted revenueraisers the bill contained several differences however from the previous ways and means committee bill prominent among these were the addition of provision that would permit individuals to deduct state and local sales taxes rather than corresponding income taxes the bill also contained tobacco buyout provision under which the fede ral pricesupport and produc tion control system for tobacco producers would be ended but pr oducers would be compensated for the systems elimination the full house pproved the bill on june 17 according to jct estimates the bill would reduce reve nues by 324 billion over five years andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32652crs5 357 billion over 10 years the revenue loss estimates include an increase in outlays for tobacco buyouts on july 15 the senate approved versi on of hr 4520 that substituted its own revenue language from s 1637 as passed in may the nate measure also added its own tobacco buyout provision on october 7 the house approved c onference agreement on hr 4520 the senate approved the agreemen t on october 11 the president signed the measure on october 22 the jct estimated that the conference agreement will reduce revenue by 87 billion over five years and would be virtually revenueneutral over 10 years increasing revenue by 1 million brief desc riptions of the acts most important elements are contained in the following s ection in general terms the act achieved estimated revenue neutra lity by incl uding revenueraising items rger in size than the house bill but smaller than the senates and by paring back revenuelosing items from both the house and senate bills in general however it retains the general thrust common to both bills repeal of eti provision of domestic production benefit tax cuts for foreign income and revenue raising items pplying to corporate tax shelters and other corporate areas summary of the acts most important provisions follows the acts provisions as enacted ajca contains wide va riety of corporate and business tax provisions dispersed throughout the tax c ode the acts provisions however fall into the following broad categories phase out and repeal of th eti benefit for exporting phasedin deduction applicable to income from domestic production tax cuts for business investment abroad other business tax cuts including number of tax cuts for agriculture other tax cuts including an option for individuals to deduct state and local sales taxes assorted revenue raisers in areas such as tax shelters corporate inversions and leasing transactions in terms of revenue impact the bill contains 1490 billion in estimated revenue losing items over 10 years and like amount of revenueraising items among the tax cuts the domestic producti on deduction is the largest ite m in terms of its revenue impact accounting for just over half 51 of the estimated revenue loss thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32652crs6 international provisions combined for sligh tly less than third 29 of the bills revenue losses repeal of eti accounts fo r onethird 33 of the revenue raised while other revenue raisers account for twothirds 67 phaseout of the eti export tax benefit as noted at the outset of the report the starting point of the legislation was the controversy between the united states and the eu over the extraterritorial income exclusions tax benefit for exporting unde r prior law the eti benefit allowed firms to exclude between 15 and 30 of their export income from taxes the conference agreement phases out the eti over three years under the act firm will be able to claim 100 of its otherwise applicable eti benefit in 2004 80 of the benefit in 2005 60 of the benefit in 2006 nd none of the benefit in 2007 the provision is estimated to increas revenue by 492 billion over 10 years tax deduction for domestic production ajca phases in new tax deduction that would generally be equal to 9 of domestic but not foreign production when fully phased in for firm paying the maximum corporate tax rate of 35 the phasedin deduction would be similar to reduction in the tax rate to 3185 thus pr oviding tax benef it similar in magnitude of the taxrate cut propos ed in the housepassed b ill but not included in the conference agreement the phasein w ould provide 3 deduction in 2005 and 2006 6 deduction in 2007 2008 and 2009 nd the full 9 deduction thereafter the maximum deduction firm can claim is limited to 50 of wages paid by the firm the deduction applies to what the act defines as qualifie d production activities income which generally includes income from domestic manufacturing mining and agriculture although it does not include income from provision of most services exceptions are construction engineering or architectural servi ces firms would not have to be organized as cor porations to claim the deducti on sole proprietorships and passthrough entities such as s corporations could earn the deduction and pass it through to their owners according to joint tax committee estimates the deduction would reduce tax revenue by 765 billion over 10 years tax cuts for busin ess investment abroad two basic structural components of the us tax system in its international context are the foreign tax credit and the deferral principle under the foreign tax credit us individuals and firms are permitted to credit foreign taxes they pay against us taxes they would otherwise owe on their foreignsource income importantly however foreign tax credits are limited to offsetting us tax on income earned abroad rather than in the united states the deferral principle or simply deferral permits us firms to indefinitely postpone paying us tax on foreign income as long as the foreign income is earned through foreignchartered subsidiaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32652crs7 corporation and the income is reinvested abroad by the foreign subsidiary the income is subject to us tax only when it is ultimately repatriated to the united states parent corporation as dividends or other income defe rral too is limited in this case by the tax codes subpart f provi sions under subpart f us parents of foreign subsidiary corporations are subject to us tax on the subsidiaries income from passive investment as well as certain other types of income whose source is thought to be relatively flexible over the decades the scope of both defe rral and the foreign tax credit has varied to some extent with much of the ebb and flow resulting from legislated changes in the foreign tax credit limitation and related rules and in subpart f ajca generally follows this pattern with the foreign tax credit limitation and to lesser extent with subpart f the acts international provisions w ould reduce revenue by an estimated 462 billion over 10 years provisions related to the foreign tax credit in terms of its revenue impact the single largest international provision in the bill is change in the rules governing the allocation of interest expense for purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation the provision is estimated to reduce revenue by 144 billion over 10 years as noted above the foreign tax credits limitation provide s that foreign tax credits can offset only the portion of taxpayers us tax liability that falls on foreign rather than domesticsource inco foreign taxes that exceed this limit cannot be credited in the year paid suc h foreign taxes are termed excess credits in tax parlance it follows from this stipulation that in calculating its foreign tax credit limitation taxpayer must allocate its gross income as well as its deductible expenses between domestic and foreign sources for taxpayer that has paid foreign taxes at high rate and that has excess foreign tax credits the rules for allocating costs and income can be crucial in the case of interest or other expenses an item of cost that is allocated to foreign rather than domestic income can reduce the proporti on of net income classified as foreign source income which in turn reduces the portion of the us precredit tax liability that applies to foreignsource income and which thus reduces the maximum amount of creditable foreign taxes for firm with excess credits the allocation of cost to foreign rather than domestic sources can t hus increase aftercredit taxes such an allocation offsets any tax savings produced by the deductibility of foreignallocated costs from taxable income in effect firm with excess credits loses the deductibility of costs allocated to foreign sources the tax code and associated irs regu lations contain elaborate rules for allocating income and expenses between foreign and domestic sources prior to ajca firms were required to allocate interest on the basis of the location of their assets for example if onet hird of firms assets were located abroad onethird of its interest expense would generally be allocated to foreign sources importantly however while firms ownership stake in foreign firm was included in the calculation the subsidiarys debtfinanced assets were not further while the parents interest expense c ould be allocated to foreign sources none of subsidiarys expense entered the calculation ajca changes these rules implementing sohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32652crs8 called worldwide allocation regime under it interest is still allocated on the basis of assets however all of subsidiarys assets are included in the calculation as is subsidiarys interest expense the net result is reduction in the share of interest allocated to foreign sources which increases creditable foreign taxes thus reducing firms aftercredit us taxes second foreign tax credit provi sion alters the treatment of domestic losses for purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation in general if firm incurs loss for tax purposes net operating loss or nol the loss can be carried back up to two years and used to reduce taxable income and thus taxes earned in the previous years potentially generating tax refund if nols are not exhausted by carrybacks they can be saved carried forward and ducted in future year nols can be carried forward up to 20 years for purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation however firm that incurs loss with respect to its domestic operations but positive foreign income is in effect required to deduct the loss from foreign income thus eliminating its potential carryforward as an nol and as noted above if firm has excess credits deductible expenses that are allocated to foreign sources generate tax savings accordingly if firm in curred domestic loss for year under prior law the loss produced tax savings in the year it was incurred and at the same time could not be carried forward as an nol the loss thus generated tax savings in the current year or in future years ajca permits taxpayers that incur domestic nol in particular year to recharacterize part of their ussource income earned in future years as foreignsource income thus in effect restoring the taxsaving potential of the loss as though it were an nol the act limits the amount of income that can be recharacterized to 50 of firms ussource income the provision is estimated to reduce revenue by 56 billion over 10 years another major ajca foreign tax cred it provision consolidates the number of separate foreign tax credit limitations or baskets prior to ajca taxpayers were required to calculate separate foreign tax credit limitations for certain types of income the purpose of the separate baskets was to prevent the cross crediting of foreign taxes that is to prevent high fo reign taxes paid on one stream of foreign income from shielding other more lightlytaxed foreign income from residual us taxes that might be due on that income under prior law nine separate limitations applied partial list includes an overall limitation for most active business income income from passive investment income subject to high foreign withholding taxes financial services income and sh ipping income ajca consolidated the number of separate baskets to just two an overall basket and basket for income for passive investment the provision is estimated to reduce revenue by 79 billion over 10 years in manner similar to nols foreign tax credits that exceed the credits limitation in particular year can be carried back and carried forward the carryback period under prior law was two years and th carryforward period five years ajca limits the foreign tax credit carryback period to one year but extends the foreign tax credit carryforward period to 10 years the provisi on is expected to reduce revenue by 69 billion over 10 years the act also eliminates restriction for the foreign tax credit under the alternative minimum tax amt under prior law foreign tax credits were permittedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32652crs9 to offset more than 90 of taxpayers amt liability the provision is expected to reduce revenue by 34 billion over 10 years provisions related to deferral and subpart f in general us residents and uschartered corporations are subject to us tax on their worldwide income that is income from foreign as well as domestic sources foreignchartered corporations however are generally bject to us only on their ussource income the united states does not tax foreign corporations on their foreign income the deferral principle or simply deferral results from this structure us firms can indefinitely postpone us tax on thei r foreignsource income if the income is earned by foreign subsidiary and reinvested abroad us taxes apply only when the income is remitted to the us parent corporation as dividends or other payments while deferral is available for most active business operations overseas the us tax code places number of limitations on its scope the most important of these antideferral regimes is posed by the tax codes subpart f provisions in general subpart f taxes the us parents of foreig n corporations controlled by us firms on certain types of foreign income whether it is repatriated to the us parent corporation or not such foreign firms are termed controlled foreign cor porations or cfcs in taxcode parlance in general inco subject to subpart f includes income from passive investment interest dividends rents royalties and similar income as well as certain other types of income whose s ource is thought to be easily manipulated by taxpayers ajca contains number of pr ovisions that expand the scope of deferral either by contracting the scope of subpart f or by other means in terms of revenue impact ajcas larg est alteration in the deferral structure is temporary oneyear 85 deduction for earnings repatriated to us parent firms from foreign subsidiaries during the oneyear period the oneyear window specified by the act is at firms election either the first tax year after ajcas enactment or the tax year immediately preceding enactment the amount of dividends eligible for the deduction would be limited to repatriations in excess of those during base period specified by the act another provision of ajca provides more generous treatment of partnership interests under subpart f in addition to its current taxation rather than deferral of passive income such as inte rest dividends rents and royalties subpart f includes in its scope income from the sale of both property that generates such income and gain from the sale of partnerships the ac t institutes look thr ough rule to sales of partnership interests under which the resulting income is generally subpart f income only if the underlying partnership ssets are of type that generates subpart f income as noted above along with income fro m passive investment subpart f denies deferral to certain other type s of income whose source is thought to be easily shifted for tax purposes one such type of income is what the tax code terms foreign base company shipping income which is general income fro m the use of an aircraft or vessel in the conduct of fore ign commerce ajca rem oves foreign base company shipping income from subpart fhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32652crs10 the deduction for repatria ted earnings is estimated to reduce revenue by 33 billion the lookthrough treatment for part nership interests is expected to reduce revenue by 10 billion and the provisions for shipping income are estimated to reduce revenue by 10 billion each over 10 years other business tax cuts along with its tax deduction for domestic production and its international tax cuts ajca contains numerous business tax reductions in variety of other areas in general these tend to be relatively narrowly focused these other business tax cuts sum to 81 billion over 10 years according to jct estimates several of the tax cuts apply to capital cost recovery that is the rules that govern how rapidly firms are permitted to deduct amounts that represent the recovery of investment in capital assets rather th an profits earned on the investment among these tax cuts the largest is temporary increase in the expensing tax benefit in general when firms acquire tangible assets such as machines and equipment they are required to deduct the acquisition cost onl gradually as depreciation the tax codes section 179 expensing provisions however permit firms to deduct certain amount of investment in the year the prope rty is placed in service the jobs and growth tax relief r econciliation act of 2003 jgtrra temporarily increased the maximum annual expensing limit to 100000 however the cap was scheduled to revert to its prior level of 25000 after 2005 in addition the amount that can be expensed is reduced by the amount by wh ich firms eligible investment exceeds 400000 again this was temporary level set by jgtrra nd was scheduled to revert to its prior level of 200000 afte r 2005 ajca extends jgtrras higher limitation and phaseout threshold for two years through 2007 the act also extends for two years temporary jgtrra provision for the indexing of the limitation and phaseout threshold the expensing extens ion is expected to reduce revenue by 11 billion over 10 years other cost recovery provisions in ajca include more generous treatment for leasehold improvements restaurant impr ovements and property depreciated under the income forecast method of depreciation such property includes motion pictures and sound recordings the tax code requires improveme nts to leasehold to be depreciated separately from the or iginal improved asset but over the same recovery period as applicable to the improved asset this treatment applies even if the recovery period is longer than the term of the lease for leased buildings ajca provides 15year recovery period for imp rovements to nonresidential structures nonresidential structures must genera lly be depreciated over 39 years the provision is temporary applying to imp rovements made befo re 2006 the act also provides 15year recovery period for improve ments to restaurant property again for improvements prior to 2006 in the case of the incomeforecast method of depreciation ajca expands its scope by permittin g participations and residuals to be included in the basis ie depreciable value of assets depreciated under the incomeforecast method the changes for leasehold improvements are expected to reduce revenue by 15 billion the restaurant provisions by 05 b illion and the income forecast changes by 06 billion each over 10 yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32652crs11 the act includes 10 provisions applying specifically to subchapter s corporations corporations that meet certain requirements relating to being closely held and that are not subject to corporat elevel tax two of the more generally applicable of the changes relate to the number of permissible shareholders under prior law s corporations could have more than 75 ajca increases the limit to 100 in addition the act provides that memb ers of the same family are to be treated as single shareholder for purposes of the limitation another less general provision exempts s corporations that ar banks from the tax codes provision that prohibits individual retirement accounts fro m owning scorporations combined the subchapter s provisions are estimate d to reduce revenue by 12 billion over 10 years aside from its tobacco buyout provisions ajca contains set of tax provisions for the agriculture industry in general the provisions while numerous are relatively narrow partial list includes provisi on preventing farm incomeaveraging from triggering the alternative minimum tax more generous rules for deferring tax in the case of livestock lost in floods droug hts and other weather conditions more generous treatment of the small ethanolproducer tax credit in the case of cooperative and several provi sions applying to timber together the agriculture provisions are expected to reduce revenue by 05 billion other tax cuts the great majority of ajcas provisions are directed at businesses whether c corporations s corporations partnerships and other passthrough entities or sole proprietorships there are however seve ral individual income tax provisions the most prominent provides temporary optional tax deduction for state and local sales taxes rather than income taxes under prior law individuals who itemize their deductions are permitted tax deduction for state and local income taxes and property taxes but not for sales taxes ajca permits taxpayers to elect an itemized deduction for sales taxes in lie u of the deduction for income but not property taxes taxpayers will have the option of basing their deduction on their own receipts or on an amount determined under tables to be issu ed by the irs the tables will be based on state and local levels of sales tax as well as adjusted gross income consumption levels by state and number of family members the provision will be applicable for 2004 and 2005 the provision is estimated to reduce ta x revenue by an estimated 50 billion over the fy2005fy2014 estimating window the reductions

they tend to be narrow but numerous and scattered through different parts of th tax code the chief general areas however from which revenues are raised are repeal of the extraterritorial income tax exclusion for exports described above new restrictions on tax shelters nd other tax avoidance transactions including limits on tax savings from leasing transactions restrictions on tax savings that can be obtained by expatriation on the part of either bus inesses or individuals more stringent rules rela ting to charitable donations provisions aimed at reduc ing fueltax evasion restrictions on leasing transactions3 apart from repeal of eti the largest single revenueraising item in the act is its new restrictions on tax savings firms can obtain by means of leasing transactions with tax indifferent entities such as us local governments or foreign institutions or entities in broad terms such savings can occur for example when taxable firm purchases an asset say subway cars from taxexempt entity say municipality claims the associated depreciation deductions and rents the asset back to the taxexempt entity who actually uses the asset in effect lease can in some cases be used to transfer the depreciation or other tax benefits an asset generates from taxexempt entity who cannot use the benefits to taxable entity who can over the years number of restrictions have been enacted that are designed to limit such transactions transactions that have motive or substance other than their taxreducing function one such rule the socalled pick rule generally provides that the

information see crs report rl32193 antitaxshelter and other revenueraising tax proposals by jane g gravellethe leasing provisions are estimated to increase revenue by 266 billion over 10 years other tax shelter provisions4 ajcas contains limitations aimed at several other specific types of transactions that the act labels tax shelters one such provision places restrictions on transactions that generate builtin losses the particulars of builtin loss transactions vary in general however the key to the transactions is the acquisition by taxable u s firms of other firms or assets whose basis exceeds their market value basis is the amount taxpayer can deduct from its gross proceeds from the sale of an asset in order to determine taxable profit thus if taxpayer sells the asset in such transaction the amount that is deductible exceeds taxable proceeds builtin losses oc cur when taxable us firm acquires an asset and arranges to have basis in the asset that is less than the acquired assets market value in effect the taxable acquiring firm will have purchased tax deduction one type of transaction that pparently lends itself to generating builtin losses is the acquisition of foreign corporations in such cases the losses are said to have been imported into the us tax juri sdiction by the acquiring firm in general ajca attempts to restrict the import of builtin losses by providing that the acquiring firms basis in an imported asset is its fair market value the act also places limitations on builtin losses in the case of certain exchanges of property for stock section 351 transactions other ajca tax shelter provisions address tax shelters in general they are provisions designed to reduce the practice of tax sheltering in general rather than to suppress particular types of transactions one provision applies penalty for taxpayers who fail to provide required information for list of reportable transactions specified in the tax code while prior law contained the list of reportable transactions it provided penalties s econd provision modifies in the case of tax shelters the existing penaltie s relating to the accuracy of taxpayers tax payment apart from the leasing changes the provisions the act explicitly characterizes as applying to tax shelters are timated to raise 67 billion over 10 years corporate inversions or expatri ationand expatriate individuals considerable amount of ttention has been attracted in recent years by the apparently growing number of us firms that undertake taxsaving inversion reorganizations the taxsaving nature of the re organizations results from the broad way in which the united states defines its tax jurisdiction in general us taxes apply to the worldwide income of uschartered corporations foreign as well as domestic but the united states does not ta x the foreignsource income of foreign chartered firms in an inversion us firm whose toptier holding corporation is chartered in the united states reorganizes so that the firms ownership is vested in newlycreated foreign parent corporation chartered in lowtax foreign country or tax haven the firms stoc kholders exchange their ownership in the former us parent for stock in the new foreign pare nt and the reorganization typically does nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32652crs14 involve the shift of substantial activity to the new foreign parents host country thus little changes in substance the firm however is longer subject to us corporatelevel tax on its foreign income ajca defines two types of inversions and subjects each to different tax regime the first type of inversion is ge nerally reorganization where the owners of the former us parent own 80 or more of the new foreign parents stock if this threshold is met the new fore ign parent is subject to us tax as though it were us chartered corporation the tax savings from the inversion are thus nullified the second type of inversion is reorganiza tion where less than 80 but more than 60 of the foreign parent is owned by the form er us parents stockholders in the case of such inversions gain that the invertin g firm is required to recognize on foreign assets transferred to the new foreign parent is not permitted to be offset by tax attributes such as net operating losses and foreign tax credits in some instances an inversion can give rise to capital gains taxes at the individual shareholder level if an i nverting firms officers do not face similar treatment for example because of compensation in the form of stock options and instead have greater stake in the inversions corporatelevel tax savings corporate governance issue may arise here ajca applies an excise tax to stockrelated compensation of an inverting firms officers ajcas provisions add to existing restri ctions on the tax savings individuals can potentially achieve by relinquishing their u s citizenship and moving abroad the tax savings for individuals who expatriate can result as follows as with us chartered corporations individuals who are us citizens are subject to us tax on their worldwide income but foreign citizens do not pay us tax on their foreign income in addition foreig n citizens who do not reside in the united states are exempt from us tax on certain types of ussource income including capital gains and interest income absent special re strictions then an individual could conceivably save us tax by renouncing his citizenship and moving abroad to restrict such strategies however the us tax code provides that us citizen who relinquishes his citizenship in order to avoi d taxes is subject to full us taxes on his ussource income for period of 10 years individuals whose income is above certain threshold are treated as having expatriated to void taxes although individuals in certain limited categories can ask the irs for ruling to the contrary ajca tightens the existing restrictions in several respects including the implementation of an objective test for the presence of taxavoidance motive combined the corporate inversion and individual expatriate provisions are estimated to increase revenue by 13 billion over 10 years charitable contributions ajca has three revenueraising provisions in the area of charitable contributions one applies to contributions of intellectual property such as patents trademarks and certain ty pes of copyrights under prior law donors of such property were in some circumstances permitted to deduct the fair market value of the property ajca generally limits the deduction to the lesser of the taxpayers basis or the prope rtys fair market value in addition however the act permits an additional deduction in years following the contribution that is based on specified percentage of additional inco generated by the contributed asset httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32652crs15 5 testimony of fha administrator mary peters before the house committee on transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on highways transit and

law deductions were generally permitted for the fair market value subject to certain substantiation requirements in the case of vehicles that are sold by recipient charity without any intervening use ajca limits the deduction to the gross sales proceeds the act also imposes new substantiation requirements an additional provision in the area of charitable contributions requires increased reporting for noncash contributions the charitable contribution provisions are estimated to increase revenue by combined 61 billion over 10 years fueltax evasion the act contains numerous pr ovisions designed to curtail evasion of fuel taxes an area that federal highway administration officials have characterized as serious and growing problem5 the most prominent of the acts measures include moving the point of coll ection of aviation fuel tax from its sale to its removal from refinery or terminal institution of registration requirements for pipeline or vessels operators claiming the exemption
