federal government domestic per diem rate the law defined legislative days to include days in session and any day in which the legislature is in recess for four or fewer c onsecutive days also legislative days include when the legislature is not in session but the legislators presence is recorded at state legislative committee meeting the act limited the deduction claimed as an awayfromhome living expense deduction to the amount declared on tax retu rns filed before may 21 1976 this election was permitted for all tax years not yet expired the provision for state legislators travel expenses while away from home was extended for oneyear period tax years pr ior to january 1 1977 by the tax reduction act of 1977 pl 9530 another oneyear ex tension for tax years before january 1 1978 was included in an act titled the agri cultural act of 1949 payments pl 95 258 further extension for threeyear period through january 1 1981 was part of an act known as the fringe benefit regula tions issuance prohibition pl 96167 permanent provision for state legislators travel expenses was made part of the internal revenue code in 1981 incl uded in the economic recovery tax act of 1981 pl 9734 this provision allowed state legislat ors to elect to treat as their tax home the legislative district they represent the law was modified so legislator is deemed to be away from home on each legislative day is not required to attend the legislature for each day counted and is allo wed to include four or fewer cons ecutive days of legislative recess and committee meetings this was accomplishe d by an exception to the overnight test of code 162 for state legislators as such elected state legislator s are deemed to have awayfromhome living expenses equal to the number of legislativ days times the per diem amount under the law th per diem amount is the greater of the federal or state per diem amount for employ ees away from home however the law limits the state per diem amount to more than 110 of the federal per diem rate2 these special rules do not apply to those state legislators living within 50 miles of the state capitol building assessment generally the internal reve nue service looks to the facts and circumstances to determine the tax home of an individual ie time spent amount of income derived degree of business activity and other signifi cant contacts in each location there was considerable uncertainty as we ll as litigation before enactment of the legislative solution which provided that the tax home of state legisl ators is the home district state legislators argue that their public service imposes uni obligations and re quirements for state legislative service for example the state constitution may require the legislator to be domiciled within the legislative district heshe represents thereby preventing permanent move to the state capital where legislative functions occur state legislative sessions mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20330crs3 3 this term implies that persons expect relatively short legislative sessions and the position is not fulltime occupationvary in length from year to year and wit hout special rule to determine the legitimate tax home of state legislators the legislators tax home could change from one year to the next state legislators may not find it possible to rent accommodations on demand for just those times when the legislature is in ssion the job of stat legislator requires frequent travel between the state capital and the legislative district some states have citizen legislators3 and provide low pay if state travel reimbursements are included in legislators income without be nefits from offsetting deductions it forces such legislators to further subsidize the costs of their state service it has also been argued by legislators that costs incurred for campaigning and entertaining of constituents at the state capital would be deductible as cost of doing bus iness for businessman but were unavailable as deduction for state legislators one underlying factor in providing special rule for state legislators is that some state legislatures meet for extended periods of time which may require the establishment of second home or an office near the cap itol or both the maintenance of two places results in legislators incurring duplicate livin g expenses further it has been noted that the costs of maintaining residence or offi ce do not stop when the legislature is out of session it is generally conceded that it is appropria to have statutory rules and that without special rule to determine the legitimate tax home of state legislators the tax home may change from one year to the next year under facts and circumstances test thus it is generally conceded that establishing the tax home of state legislators eliminates uncertainty when filing federa l taxes legislators were also concerned about adverse public opinion for claiming deduction not specifically authorized which could lead to tax audit economists typically apply the principle of horizontal equity that taxpayers with identical incomes in like circumstances shoul d be treated equally when evaluating income tax policy essentially fairness doctrine in that context the provision of special rules for state legislators provides greater advantage to those in the business of representing their districts or counties than persons engage d in other trades or businesses generally taxpayer must either be away from home overnight or for sufficient period that requires sleep or rest to qualify for trav expense deductions current law grants legislators uniquely favorable tax status based upon statut ory formula of legislative days times daily per diem rate thus unlike other business taxpayers the law does not require legislators to be away from home ov ernight nor does it require the legislators presence at the state capital that day allowance of days when the state legislator has returned to his legislative district makes th is the only group of taxpayers able to deduct personal living expenses additionally the availability of statutory formula means that normal substantiation rules do not apply ie safe harbor and legislators unlike other taxpayers are not required to substantiate awayfromhome expenses finally other group of taxpayers may elect their tax homehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20330crs4 4 us congress joint committee on taxation estimates of federal tax expenditures for fiscal years 20052009 committee print 109th cong 1st sess jcs105 was hington gpo 2005 at httpwwwhousegovjcts105pdf visited feb 17 2005the law allows the deduction equal to the greater of the federal or state rate as long as the state per diem does not exceed 110 of the federal per diem this adds complexity since the deduction is for computation for federal tax liability some have argued that the federal per diem should be us ed in determining fede ral tax liability while some have argued that the general services administration has been slow to adjust federal per diem rates the pe r diem amounts may change over the course of year and are generally viewed as fair it appears likely that this provision leads to greater federal revenue losses than if state legislators were required to deduct business expenses in the same manner as other taxpayers some may argue that it is not fair to incur such federal revenue losses for state legislators while federal legislators are provided more limited maximum away from home deduction amount of 3000 however ot hers would note that the particular circumstances of many state legislators would constitute significant hardship if this special tax deduction were eliminated or reduced revenue loss in 1981 the provision was estimated to reduce federal budget receipts by approximately 9 million in 1982 5 million in 1983 6 million in 1984 6 million in 1985 and 7 million in 1986 these estimates we re prepared by the joint committee on taxation revenue losses from this provision remain low pr imarily because of the limited number of state legislators however since per diem rates are adjusted periodically to reflect costofliving increases the yearly revenue costs have probably risen since establishment in general the joint committee on taxation does not estimate provisions which lose less than 50 million per year in their annual committee print estimates of federal tax expenditures the projected reve nue loss did not appear in the most recent issue4
