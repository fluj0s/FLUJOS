have immunity for their legislative acts under article i 6 cl 1 of the constitution which provides in part that for any speech or debate in either house senators and representatives shall not be questioned in any other place even if their actions are within the scope of the speech or debate clause or some other legal immunity members of congress remain accountable to the house of congress in which they serve and to the electorate in cases in which the clause applies the immunity is absolute and cannot be defeated by an allegation of an improper purpose or motivation when applicable the clause affords not only substantive immunity but also complementary evidentiary privilege in other words the clause provides both immunity from liability in civil and criminal proceedings and testimonial privilege recently two separate and previously unresolved issues have arisen with respect to the scope and application of the speech or debate clause the first involves the execution of search warrant on the rayburn house office of representative william j jefferson the search was conducted as part of the fbis investigation of representative jefferson to determine whether he and other persons were involved in criminal activity including bribery and other felonies such an action by the executive branch appears to be unprecedented in us history and raises serious and significant constitutional questions with respect to potential intimidation and diminution of the independence and autonomy of the legislative branch and its integral legislative functions at which the speech or debate clause is directed although representative jefferson lost his initial legal challenge to have the seized documents and materials returned the court of appeals for the district of columbia dc circuit has since held the search to have been violation of the speech or debate clause the court left in place an order instructing the lower court to provide representative jefferson with copies of the materials and chance to make his claims of privilege ex parte and in camera moreover the court of appeals ordered that the department of justice doj continue to refrain from reviewing any of the seized materials until the questions of privilege have been settled by the lower court the second speech or debate clause question on which the courts have recently issued opinions concerns claims of employment discrimination br ought against members offices pursuant to the congressional accountability act of 1995 both the tenth circuit court of appeals and the dc circuit have recently ruled that the speech or debate clause does not automatically prevent such suits from proceeding in addition an appeal to the supreme court has been rejected on the grounds that the court lacked jurisdictional basis to decide the case these decisions however appear to have left unanswered significant questions relating to the use and introduction of evidence that may be related to legislative acts and therefore protected by the speech or debate clause such questions could ultimately frustrate the ability of potential plaintiffs to pursue their claims this report

representatives shall not be questioned in any other place1 commonly referred to as the speech or debate clause this language affords members of congress immunity from certain civil and criminal suits relating to their legislative acts2 in addition the clause also provides testimonial privilege3 that extends not only to oral testimony about privileged matters4 but to the production of privileged documents5 adopted at the constitutional convention without debate or opposition6 the historic rationale and purpose of the speech or debate clause has been clearly understood to protect the independence and integrity of members of the legislature from intimidation by both the executive branch and the judiciarythat is to help ensure that the legislature would be coequal independent branch of government by preventing intimidation of legislators by the executive and accountability before possibly hostile judiciary 7 in explaining the purposes of the speech or debate clause the supreme court has traced the ancestry of the clause to the english bill of rights of 1689 which was the culmination of long struggle for parliamentary supremacy behind these simple phrases lies history of conflict between the commons and the tudor and stuart monarchs during which successive monarchs utilized the criminal and civil law to suppress and intimidate critical legislators since the glorious revolution in britain and throughout united states history the privilege has been recognized as an important protection of the independence and integrity of the legislature 8 1 us const art i 6 cl 1 2

that the clause was not intended simply for the personal or private benefit of members of congress but to protect the integrity of the legislative process by insuring the independence of individual legislators9 the court has also expressly noted the function of the speech or debate clause as serving the interests of separation of powers in the american governmental structure the clause serves the additional function of reinforcing the separation of powers so deliberately established by the founders10 moreover the court has without exception read the speech or debate clause broadly to effectuate its purposes11 the supreme courts interpretations and holdings in cases involving the speech or debate clause indicate absolute protection for members when speaking on the house or senate floor12 introducing and voting on bills and resolutions13 preparing and submitting committee reports14 acting at committee meetings and hearings15 and conducting investigations and issuing subpoenas16 conversely the court has made clear that the speech or debate clause does not protect criminal conduct such as taking bribe which is not part of the legislative process17 in addition it appears that the clause provides protection for what the court has deemed political or representational activities such as direct communications with the public18 speeches outside of congress19 newsletters20 press

these are entirely legitimate activities they are political in nature rather than legislative in the sense that term has been used by the court in prior cases but it has never been seriously contended that these political matters however appropriate have the protection afforded by the speech or debate clause 19 id 20 id 21 hutchinson v proxmire 443 us 111 1979 22 gravel 408 us at 625

reports outside the legislative sphere23 according to the court these types of activities are not covered because they are not an integral part of the deliberative and communicative processes by which members participate in legislative activities24 finally it appears that the clause protects certain contacts by members with the executive branch such as investigations and hearings related to legislative oversight of the executive but does not protect others such as assisting constituents in securing government contracts and making appointments with government agencies 25 the clauses application to other types of contact by members with the exec utive especially informal communications from members to officials of the executive branch even if arguably in the course of the oversight process remains uncertain26

representative jefferson which began in march 2005 to determine whether he and other persons bribed or conspired to bribe public official committed or conspired to commit wire fraud or bribed or conspired to bribe foreign official in violation of sections 201 371 343 1346 and 1349 of title 18 and section 78dd1 of title 15 united states code the investigation involves allegations inter alia that the representative used his position to promote the sale of telecommunications equipment and services by domestic firm to several african nations in return for payment of stocks and cash and whether he planned to bribe highranking officials in nigeria and to use his influence with highranking government officials in other african countries to obtain the necessary approval for the firms ventures in apparent recognition of the unique and constitutionally sensitive action that the doj was preparing to takeit appears that warrant to search congressional office had ever been sought or obtained beforethe supporting affidavit contained special procedures to guide and confine the search process as explained by the doj in its response to the district court opposing the return of the documents to representative jefferson the government has been interested only in obtaining nonlegislative act evidence of criminal activity and has committed to implementing elaborate procedures to avoid any information that could be covered by the speech or debate clause or that would be non responsive as matter of comity and out of an abundance of caution the government proposed and this court approved special procedures designed to accommodate the privilege and other political sensitivities by ensuring that document covered by the speech or debate clause would come into the possession of the prosecution team 29 these procedures as originally described30 provided that with regard to paper records in the offices search team of special agents from the fbi who had role in the investigation non case agents would examine every document in the office and determine which documents were responsive to the list of documents being sought the noncase agents were forbidden from revealing any nonresponsive or politically sensitive information they came across during the search responsive documents were to be transferred to filter team consisting of two doj attorneys who were not part of the prosecuti on team and noncase fbi agent who were to review each seized document to address its re sponsiveness those documents deemed responsive would then be reviewed by the filter team to determine if any responsive document fell within the protection of the speech or debate clause nonprivileged records determined to fall outside of the speech or debate clause protection were to be transferred to the prosecution team which was to have provided counsel to representative jefferson copies within 10 days papers potentially covered by the speech or debate clause were to be catalogued in log and the log provided to counsel for representative jeffers on along with copies of the papers within 20 business days according to the warrant the potentially privileged papers were not to be supplied to the prosecution team until court so ordered with respect to the computer files special fbi forensics team woul d download materials from the office computers and transfer the downloaded files to an fbi facility where search of the data would be conducted using courtapproved search terms contained in schedule c of the affidavit responsive data were to be turned over to the

jeffersons office will be provided to rep jefferson and if rep jefferson chooses he may provide copies to house counsel the filter team will prepare log of the records they deem to be privileged the log will identify any such reco rds by date recipient sender subject matter and the nature of any potential privilege the filter team will provide its log to rep jefferson and if rep jefferson chooses to house counsel to allow him the opportunity to disagree with the filter teams privilege determinations documents that the filter team determines are privileged will be returned to counsel for rep jefferson any disputes that may arise about whether particular remaining records are privileged will then be resolved by the court member of the prosecution team will have access to any seized documents that rep jefferson claims to be privileged until the court has made determination that the record is not privileged this accommodation obviates the concern expressed in rep jeffersons brief that the filter team applying the original procedures set forth in the affidavit might make unilateral determination that document was not privileged and turn it over to the prosecution team without affording rep jefferson the opportunity to assert privilege 31 g9g142g151g142g155g138g149g561g14g142g144g138g149g561g3g155g144g158g150g142g151g157g156g561 initially it appears that potential speech or debate argument exists because although material falling within the protective framework of the speech or debate clause could eventually be ruled inadmissable in court proceeding or any other legal proceeding outside of the institutions of the house or senate themselves based on the speech or debate privilege the act of such wide ranging examination of materials pursuant to search warrantmost likely materials specifically and clearly covered by the privilegeis arguably in itself an action that raises concerns of intimidation and diminution of the independence and autonomy of the legislative branch and its integral legislative functions at which the speech or debate clause is directed moreover as explained in relevant court documents the fbi itself and its own agents were to be responsible for sifting through all the electronic and paper material seized in the members office so that the fbi and not court nor officials of the legislative branch was to make the initial determinations not only of what material is responsive to the warrant but also which material might be privileged under the speech or debate clause therefore it also could be argued that the independence and autonomy of the legislative branch under this process was left initially to the legal and constitutional interpretations of the agents of the fbi as former deputy attorney general in the reagan administration testified before the house judiciary committee search warrants for documentary evidence in legislative offices are irreconcilable with the speech or debate clause the clause is offended the moment the fbi peruses constitutionally protected legislative document even if the document is not seized memory 31 see doj response supra footnote 27 at 1112 internal footnotes and

in thwarting congressional opposition or leaking embarrassing political info rmation documentary searches are further intimidating to congress because the plain view doctrine of the fourth amendment would entitle the fbi to seize any material in the course of reading office files concerning crimes unconnected to the search warrant the knowledge by member that the fbi can make an unannounced raid on his legislative office to read and rummage through every document or email is bound to discourage congress from the muscular check against the executive that the speech or debate clause was calculated to foster 32 it should be noted that the phrase questioned in any other place has not been the subject of much discussion there do not appear to be any cour t decisions or other historical evidence that may guide modern interpreters as to the phrases meaning while to date neither the doj nor representative jefferson has directly raised the issue in this case it would appear possible to argue that because the doj specifically excluded any legislative branch representatives from the office search they constructively converted representative jeffersons office into any other place for speech or debate purposes in addition the removal of documents for offsite filtering by the doj may also constitute questioning in any other place moreover the search of the computer files which according to the dojs own procedures was to be done at an fbi laboratory appears to most certainly qualify as any other place

jefferson joined by the house general counsel filing as amicus curiae on behalf of the house bipartisan leadership council sought to have the search declared unconstitutional and the seized materials returned to his possession in addition to raising many of the arguments discussed above representative jefferson argued inter alia that execution of the search warrant on the premises via documentbydocument search of every paper record in the office and the wholesale copying and removal of the representatives computer hard drive guaranteed that the executive would be in possession of material that relates to the members legislative duties 33 the motion asserted that those actions coupled with the exclusion of representative jeffersons counsel and the general counsel for the house of representa tives from even viewing the search process impermissibly interfered with and violated the absolute privilege afforded by the speech or debate clause34 the doj in its brief responding to representative jeffersons motion for return of property argued that because it was only interested in obtaining nonlegislative materials the use of filter team provided sufficient protection of the privilege under the speech or debate clause35 based on the dojs filing it appears that the doj adopted the position that the clauses language shall not be questioned at any other place merely protects

initial review by the house general counsels office pursuant to house rule viii to determine whether the protection of the clause has been simply matter of comity37 the doj also argued that representative jeffersons position would effectively extend speech or debate immunity to clearly unprivileged materials by making it impossible to execute search warrant in any place containing even one privileged document38 dojs argument seemed to rest on the contention that because the actual prosecution team was never to have had access to any information that would have been subject to the privilege the speech or debate clause had not been violated39 thus the doj appeared to be arguing that the speech or debate clause is nothing more than an evidentiary privilege that can be asserted prior to trial similar to any other available motion to exclude improperly seized evidence as result doj asserted that the procedures employed did not in any way prohibit representative jefferson from asserting his privilege and having his claims adjudicated by court 40 in support of its claim that the speech or debate clause was not violated merely because the doj was to make determinations regarding privileged material the doj referenced other prosecutions of members of congress41 in these instances the doj contended that it reviewed materials obtained in response to subpoenas and determined what could be used and what was privileged and therefore inadmissible and in close or debatable situations consistent with the constitution the information was submitted to court for resolution as to whether the material could be used 42 on july 10 2006 united states district judge thomas hogan issued written opinion rejecting the arguments of representative jefferson and upholding the search and seizure of materials from his rayburn house office as constitutional43 in reaching this conclusion judge hogan first rejected the arguments made by representative jefferson as well as the house general counsels office with respect to the scope of the immunity afforded by the speech or debate clause continued privilege rather than privilege protecting legislators agai nst being questioned about privileged information or having such information used against them point the government does not concede it simply does not constitute discovery for law enforcement agent unconnected with the investigation to make cursory review of privileged information solely for the purpose of determining whether it is privileged 37 id at 14 dojs assertion with respect to the development and use of house rule viii appears to discount the significant historical precedent and evidence that suggests the house of representatives have nearly always taken strong position with respect to the release of information in response to requests and subpoenas by the executive branch namely it appears that the house has consistently defended its right to make the first determination

warrant be limited to period after the elected official has first been permitted to review and remove privileged information it would impermissibly expand the spee ch or debate clauses protection to require advance notice of search of any property frequented by the member not just his congressional office44 next judge hogan focused on the testimonial privil ege aspect of the clause like the doj judge hogan appears to have adopted an arguably narrow construction of the speech or debate clauses protection noting that unlike providing responses to subpoena having property searched pursuant to search warrant is not testimonial act therefore the clauses protection does not apply45 relying exclusively on fifth amendment case law for this analysis judge hogan concludes that just as search warrant does not trigger the fifth amendments testimonial privilege neither does search trigger the speech or debate clauses testimonial privilege 46 turning to the speech or debate clauses purpose in protecting the independence and integrity of the legislative branch47 judge hogan again appears to have adopted an arguably narrow construction of the immunity afforded by the speech or debate clause here again he interprets the speech or debate clause as protecting right analogous to the right against selfincrimination afforded by the fifth amendment for judge hogan the speech or debate clause merely protects members from having to answer questions as to their legislative activities it does not prohibit the disclosure of legislative material 48 because in this case representative jefferson was not questioned about things within the sphere of his legislative activities judge hogan held that the clauses immunity did not apply49 finally judge hogan addressed the filtering procedures approved by the warrant he rejected the argument that members of the legislature be permitted to determine what is privileged and what is not prior to search warrant being executed arguing by analogy to both the privilege provided by the first amendments protections as well as other privileges at common law judge hogan indicated that he was able to find support for the proposition that member of congress must be given advance notice of search with an opportunity to screen out and remove materials the member believes to be privileged indeed the court is aware of case in which such procedure is mandated by any other recognized privilege 50 with respect to this point it appears that judge hogan is attempting to preserve the role of the judiciary in determining the proper scope and application of privileges specifically judge hogan observed that the power to determine the scope of privilege is conferred to neither federal judges51 nor the president of the united states52 and concluded therefore that such power cannot 44 id at 12 stating that this argument would require member of congress to be given advance notice of any search of his property including property outside his

hogan held that review of allegedly privileged material by the court is allowed and appropriate under the constitution53 further judge hogan concluded that because representative jefferson remained

motion for stay pending appeal to the court of appeals judge hogan on july 19 2006 denied this motion relying primarily on his opinion that representative jefferson was not substantially likely to prevail on the merits of his appeal that representative jefferson had suffered irreparable injury and that the damage to the government in delaying its investigation outweighed any potential harm to representative jefferson 54 representative jefferson promptly filed notice of appeal to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit dc circuit seeking stay of both judge hogans order and any doj review of the documents pending the outcome of his appeal the resolution of representative jeffersons appeal appears to have been expedited due to an announcement by the

the doj from reviewing any of the documents or materials seized pending further order of the court60 because the court of appeals order contains analysis and only two case citations it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions about the legal rationale for the order from the text of the order it appears reasonable to conclude that th court of appeals felt that there was too little lower court review of claims of privilege pursuant to the speech or debate clause moreover it appears that the court of appeals felt strongly that those claims whatever they may be should be dealt with prior to any review of the materials by the executive branch and significantly without any opportunity for input or argument from the doj beyond that however it appears that few if any principles regarding the speech or deba immunity can be derived from the court of appeals order consequently it appears that the question of the legality of such search and seizure remains very much an unresolved question the dc circuit heard oral argument on repr esentative jeffersons appeal on may 15 2007 and issued its decision on august 3 2007 61 the court concluded that the compelled disclosure of privileged material to the executive during execution of the search warrant violated the speech or debate clause and that the congressman is entitled to the return of documents that the court determines to be privileged under the clause62 in reaching its conclusion the court relied upon many of the core concepts of speech or debate clause jurisprudence including the speech or debate clauses broad scope and its purpose of protecting the legislative branch from intimidation from the executive 63 specifically the dc circuit affirmed its holding in brown williamson tobacco corporation v williams 64 which made clear that critical component of the speech or debate clause is the prevention of intrusions into the legislative process and that the compelled disclosure of legislative materials is such disruption

process exchanges between member of congress and the members staff or among members of congress on legislative matters may legitimately involve frank or embarrassing statements the possibility of compelled disclosure may therefore chill the exchange of views with respect to legislative activity this chill runs counter to the clauses purpose of protecting against disruption of the legislative process 66 in so holding the court sought to carefully distinguish between the lawfulness of searching congressional office pursuant to search warrantwhich the court holds is clearly permissible and the lawfulness of the manner in which the search was executed in light of the protections afforded to the member pursuant to the speech or debate clause67 thus the court concluded that because the executives procedures for executing the warrant denied the congressman any opportunity to identify and assert the privilege wi th respect to legislative materials before their compelled disclosure to executive agents they violated the speech or debate clause68 the court declined however to expressly delineate acceptable procedures for avoiding violation of the speech or debate clause in future searches of congressional offices noting only that there appears to be reason why the congressmans privilege under the speech or debate clause cannot be asserted at the outset of search in manner that also protects the interests of the executive in law enforcement 69 moreover the court observed that the precise contours of those accommodations are matter best left to negotiations between the political branches70 finally with respect to what remedy representative jefferson is entitled to the court declined to grant what was requested namely return of all of the documents seized from the office during the unconstitutional search rather the court determ ined that with respect to the computer files the courts previous remand order affords the congressman an opportunity to assert the privilege prior to disclosure of privileged materials to the executive71 with respect to the paper documents however the court concluded that while the speech or debate clause prevents the compelled disclosure of privileged documents it does not prohibit inquiry into illegal conduct simply because it has some nexus to legislative functions72 therefore according to the court return of all of the documents would be an inappropriate remedy for violation of the speech or debate clause as result the court concluded that representative jefferson is entitled to return of all legislative documents subject to the speech or debate clause whose protection is absolute while nonprivileged materialswhich may yet be subject to future challenges as the criminal trial proceedsare not required to be returned at this time 73 furthermore the court ordered that the fbi agents who executed the s earch warrant shall continue to be barred from disclosing the contents of any privileged or politically sensitive and nonresponsive items and 66 id at 13 67 id at 14 68 id at 15 69 id at 16 70 id at 17 stating that how that accommodation is to be achieved is best determined by the legislative and

accountability act caa75 which provides for judicial review under various statutes of congressional personnel actions section 413 of the caa however declares that the authorization to bring judicial proceedings under various provisions of the law does not constitute waiver of the speech or debate privilege of any member in light of the statute as well as prior decisions of the appellate courts both the tenth circuit court of appeals76 and the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia dc circuit77 have recently issued decisions that have refused to automatically dismiss employmentrelated civil cases on the grounds that they are violation of the speech or debate immunity prior to the passage of the caa the dc circuit had held that the speech or debate clause immunized members for personnel actions regarding at least some congressional employees in browning v clerk us house of representatives 78 it was alleged that the termination of the first african american official reporter employed by the house was the result of racial animus79 the court in dismissing the claims held that personnel actions by members were protected by the speech or debate clause if the employees duties were directly related to the due functioning of the legislative process80 two years later however the supreme court in forrester v white81 raised doubts as to whether speech or debate clause immunity extended to employment actions in forrester case raising the issue of judicial immunity for personnel actions the supreme court held that state court judge did not have judicial immunity for the firing of probation officer concluding that the immunity did not extend to administrative legislative or executive functions regardless of how important the functions may be to the very functioning of the 74 id at 23 internal quotations and citations omitted in ligh t of the fact that representative jeffersons indictment was filed in the eastern district of virginia which is

court the employment decision in forrester was administrative not judicial therefore there was entitlement to judicial immunity83 subsequently in gross v winter 84 the dc circuit applying forrester held that commonlaw legislative immunity did not immunize dc council member from suit for employmentrelated decisions85 the court in gross however declined to overturn the reasoning in browning preferring instead to distinguish the case on the grounds that it dealt with common law privilege and not the speech or debate clause in 2002 the united states district court for the district of colorado heard the first case involving the speech or debate clause as it related to an employment discrimination allegation brought pursuant to the caa 86 the plaintiff former district office staffer for senator ben nighthorse campbell alleged age discrimination and retaliation for discrimination complaints under the caa the senators office moved to dismiss the claims arguing that the speech or debate clause immunized the office from the claims because the plaintiffs duties of meeting with constituents gathering information for the senator discussing constituent suggestions and then conveying them to the senator constitute actions that directly relate to the due functioning of the legislative process 87 the district court found that the plaintiffs duties were not only to provide senator campbell with information but to take action on behalf of the senator and provide him with recommendations on various legislative issues and agendas88 in addition the court described the plaintiffs job responsibilities as including gathering and conveying to senator campbell himself and to the defendant information critical to the senators legislative agenda89 as result the court dismissed the suit holding that because the plaintiffs duties were directly related to the due functioning of the legislative process the immunity afforded members of congress by the speech or debate clause applied90 the court of appeals for the tenth circuit however reversed the lower courts decision distinguishing between legislative acts that are entitled to speech or debate immunity and non legislative acts which are not91 the court noted that even if legislative act had been involved only the senators actual vote would be entitled to immunity92 the senators office on the other hand could still be liable for personnel decisions as its actions fall outside the scope of the immunity 93 in addition the court found relying on supreme court precedent that the plaintiffs discrimination claim does not require proof of any legislative act by senator 82 id at 22728 83 id at 22930 84 876 f2d 165 dc cir 1989 85 id at 172 stating that the functions judges and legislators exercise in

had argued that the plaintiffs job function constituted legislative act because the information received from constituents or other members of the public could affect his drafting and supporting of legislation and ultimately his committee and floor votes the court disagreed classifying such functions as informal information gathering which is distinct from the type of information gathering performed by legislative committees the gathering of information by committees according to the court is clearly protected by supreme court precedent 95 however extending the protection to other forms of information gathering by individual members would exceed the courts pronouncements of the clauses scope96 moreover the court specifically refused to adopt the dc circuits reasoning in browning v clerk noting that in its opinion browning extended farther than the supreme courts cases involving the speech or debate clause the court however did note that even had it chosen to adopt and follow the browning standard this employees case would be entitled to proceed because the duties performed were not central to the legislative process and therefore not entitled to the speech or debate clauses protection 97 the tenth circuits decision in bastien created conflict between the circuits that led the dc circuit to consolidate two pending cases and hear them banc98 the two cases involve house office that of the honorable eddie bernice johnson as well as senate office that of senator mark dayton99 neither case has been decided on the merits by any court the dc circuit sought to determine whether employment suits brought under the caa were required to be dismissed by the speech or debate clause and whether browning v clerk of us house of representatives should remain the law of the circuit100 with 8 of the 10 members of the dc circuit participating the court decided unanimously that the speech or debate clause does not require the dismissal of suits brought under the caa101 with respect to the continued validity of browning the court also held unanimously that the browning framework is longer consistent with supreme court precedent and should be abandoned102 despite this agreement however the court splintered regarding the question of how much of role the speech or debate clause should play in such cases the unresolved issue involves the proper role that the speech or debate clause may play during the course of employment litigation the fact that plaintiffs may be able to bring prima facie cases against members of congress under the caa does not mean that the speech or debate clause is longer relevant consideration on the one hand as judge randolph writing for plurality of the court notes the judicially created burdenshifting framework under which

plaintiff proves prima facie case of discrimination which the employer rebuts by producing evidence that its conduct was nondiscriminatory and which the plaintiff then seeks to demonstrate is pretextual103may present special problems when combined with the speech or debate clause104 these problems may arise specifically when the nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action was motivated by the employees participation in the legislative process or in activities protected by the speech or debate clause members remain protected from inquiry into legislative acts or the motivation for actual performance of legislative acts 105 moreover the speech or debate clauses testimonial privilege prevents member from being questioned in place other than the house or senate about legislative acts106 these protections afforded by the speech or debate clause may according to judge randolph depending on the facts of the case frustrate or even prevent the pursuit of employment discrimination claims as they would likely prevent plaintiff from presenting evidence to challenge the members assertion that there was legitimate nondiscriminatory basis for the employment decision107 although judge randolph attempts to provide some guidelines for invoking the speech or debate clauses protection108 he refrains from ultimately answering the question noting that decisions about whether the asserted activity is protected by the speech or debate clause will be rendered by district court judges on casebycase basis109 on the other hand judge janice rodgers brown writing for three members of the court takes slightly different approach first judge brown tes that the caa creates legal fiction by making the members employing office liable for any employment discrimination and not the member or his aides personally110 as such judge brown concludes that the employing office as an orgainzational division within congress is not in any way entitled to protection under the speech or debate clause111 furthermore according to judge brown to the extent that the member personally is implicated there remains the speech or debate clauses evidentiary privilege which provides ample protection to the member from disclosure or discussion of decisions that involve legislative acts112 with respect to the potential evidentiary and procedural problems raised by judge randolphs opinion judge brown appears to suggest narrower reading of the speech or debate clause 103 see texas dept of cmty affairs v burdine 450 us 248 25356 1981 see also mcdonnell

as the member or other potentially immune aides are not themselves providing evidence or giving testimony the speech or debate clause is not implicated and therefore plaintiffs can potentially pursue more claims under this interpretation113 however if the suit requires such evidence or testimony then even under judge browns interpretation the district courts will have to address individual assertions of speech or debate immunity on casebycase basis114 writ of certiorari to the us supreme court was sought by senator daytons office in addition senator daytons office filed statement of jurisdiction asserting that the caa affords his office an appeal by right to the us supreme court115 on january 19 2007 the court postponed consideration of the question of jurisdiction and set oral argument for april 24 2007116 the court heard argument specifically on the following questions 1 was the office of senator mark dayton entitled to appeal the judgment of the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit directly to this court and 2 was this case rendered moot by the expiration of the term of office of senator dayton117 the court issued its decision on may 21 2007 unanimously holding that it lacked jurisdiction to reach the merits of the case118 senator dayton had sought review on the basis of section 412 of the congressional accountability act which states that an appeal may be taken directly to the supreme court of the united states from any interlocutory or final judgment decree or order of court upon the constitutionality of any provision of this chapter 119 according to the court this section cannot serve as the basis for jurisdiction because the dc circuits determination that jurisdiction attaches despite claim of speech or debate clause immunity is best read as ruling on the scope of the act not its constitutionality120 moreover the court concluded that this reading of section 413 as limiting appellate review is faithful to our established practice of interpreting statutes to avoid constitutional difficulties 121 and is consistent with the courts jurisprudence holding that statutes authorizing appeals are to be strictly construed122 finally the court concluded that there was basis for exercising its discretionary certiorari jurisdiction 113 id at 32 brown j concurring stating that because the members are not defendants the suits do not burden them with defense costs nor place them at any risk of personal liability and as long as members and their aides are not themselves questioned an inquiry into
