instructors bugbear lecture given on 9 october 1962 this is 9 oct 62 lecture number two n better talk to you about something that youre more interested in just final comment on that i havent given you all the information i have on that but the final question i was asked here was about the technical hope itd be more simple yeah your technical will be more simple but remember theres two hpas on the floor in any one of these co audits listing will probably be meterlessmost of their auditing will be meterless and itll be worked down to point where if guy can get into trouble with this with experts watching the thingwhy hed really be quite guy there are several technical little bugs that have been worked out already you give see check as the person comes in and you have dunce unit the rock slammers and because youll have all kinds of people why youd just better take the rock slammers and youd better relegate them to certain category and certain handling you see that immediately takes the sour apples out of your coaudit and theyd run fairly smoothly now the technical aspects of this are either whipped or whippable and they give qualms at all if thats all i had to worry about itd be long snore the various aspects of clearing this is about clearing this is just lecture on clearing im very interested in this id be very happy to go on talking about it the rest of the evening dont you see but i want to talk to you about some of the aspects of clearing as they are influenced by auditing quality clearing and auditing quality and these two things are extremely closely associated when done by the expert he clears as fast in actuality as he is bright and delivers good quality auditing now thats as fast as he clears he clears then as slowly as he flubs well you want to find out why somebody isnt getting clear fast you know yourits hell of criticism of the auditor when that tone arm goes up to 50 and sticks its already proven that its the right goal and yet theres that tone arm up there at 50 and its not now moving and its not coming down and that is the right goal and youre listing on 114 lines and as far as you can tell its all going off like hot butter and yet there is that tone arm at 50 now that is not criticizing the pc learn right here at the incept that it is criticism which is leveled straight at the bosom of the auditor doing the auditing learn that and you will have learned great deal when i say learn that and you will have learned great deal i know what im talking about because there are some people who wont learn that they will resist learning that for while you see theyll keep looking for what is wrong with the pc theres nothing wrong with pcs theres lot wrong with auditors now some pcs require more cleverness on the part of the auditor than others because theyapparently the individuality of life was all attained by goals now that doesnt mean that people are individuals because of goals it means that they are odd individuals because of goals they were all different people dont you see and then they postulated themselves great cracking big goal and here we went well goal is symptom of individuation and from that point on this guy is going to act differently with different set of overts and therefore each person acts slightly differently in processing but when you realize that you can pick up such goal as never to be detectedwell now thats quite interesting what does that speak of the technology well this thing says it must never be detected and yet we detected it thats quite interesting isnt it that speaks very well for the technology so i can tell you right at the incept that there is goal that is too difficult to be found and therefore individuation that is too difficult for you to crack youve got to do it by the book and youve got to be clever and youve got to be able to audit smoothlyauditing quality many fellow has the idea many girl has the idea that auditing quality is associated with sternness or is associated with immovability or is associated with being able to repeat the auditing command or is associated with the auditor must always be right or some other quality that has nothing whatsoever to do in actual fact with auditing some new individuation has moved into the sphere of auditing and whenever this new individuation is moved into the sphere of auditing you get some new difficulties so to an instructor watching half dozen auditors audit he may think that he needs half dozen different sets of rules to overcome the peculiar difficulties which these students are experiencing and that is not true what he needs as an instructor is tremendous ability to detect variation from the standard rule and man this variation is sometimes so clever and is sometimes so adroit and is sometimes so well hidden that one never does connect with it apparently im give you an example this person is apparently unwilling to have the pc talk apparently this person has to stop the pc from talking if the pc talks the pc must be stopped youd swear their goal was nobody must talk pc says i have pain in the head and the auditor almost holds up stop lights and stop signs and hands out speed tickets and breaks out dog muzzle and so forth you see because the pc has said something the auditors upset so we work on it on straight basis of communication and we tell this auditor that the auditor must let the pc talk and by golly we dont solve it we just dont solve it these sessions this auditor is running continue to produce fantastic arc breaks and yet now the auditor is apparently letting the pc talk to all intents and purposes then we come in one day and we find out the pc has been talking for an hour and half in answer to one auditing command and is getting very arc broke in the process so we didnt spot that one that was wrong this auditor was not trying to stop the pc from talking the arc breaks this auditor got stemmed from the unwillingness of the auditor to face any confusion of any kind in the session and went on giving the auditing command even faster the moment it appeared there was going to be confusion in the session now thats an interesting point isnt it some confusion arose did the auditor acknowledge it or did the pc answer it and this auditors answer is to get away from the confusion and so gives the auditing command five more times even more rapidly to get five commands away from that confusion but of course they can never get away from the confusion now the pc is only interested in doing only one thing stopping the auditor to get back to the confusion to unravel it did he answer the question or didnt he so they have the auditor trying to get on with the session and the pc trying to stop the session and then youd think offhand well theres something wrong with the pc there isnt there must be something wrong with the auditor if the auditor didnt take up something in the session that makes it necessary for the pc to stop the session to get it taken up you see this audience mmhm it looks like the auditors trying to keep the pc from talking see but that really wasnt what was happening at all the auditor wants the pc to talk but on some other subject if you please than confusion one method an auditor uses to take off then is discoverable only in this zone that an auditor can leave the session on the forward track as well as walk out of the room you follow that audience mmhm the pc can be left at timepoint in the session while the auditor is taking off and trying to get to timepoint g without ever paying any further attention to timepoint the auditor is ignoring timepoint and is trying to leave the session by progressing forward to point g as rapidly as possible youll find somebody is having difficulty reading his meter during the rudiments only because rudiments are something this auditor has had enough bad luck with that the auditor wants to get over them fast and the auditor gets over these rudiments fast while the pc gets stuck in rudiment one and the auditor is clear up there to the body of the session but the pc is left in rudiment one now in an effort to avoid giving session you see in an effort to avoid facing the confusion in the sessionlet put it that waythe auditor actually refuses to set up session unwittingly refuses to set up session do you see how this could be the auditor knows he cant get in rudiment onealways had trouble getting it inso he doesnt get it in gets conviction that it cant be put in dont you see and therefore rapidly moves to two before one is in now of course two wont go in because one is out and then moves to three before the pc can stop him to get two in and then goes into the body of the session with the pc madly out of session now the pc somewhere in his skull unwittingly is trying to work out the session and get insession while the auditor is running the session and most of the pcs that give you the most trouble are the pcs who do the least they never explode in your face they never walk out of session theyre not dramaticthey just arent insession auditing isnt biting auditing isnt biting at all because theyre not insession and they apparently are very easy to audit except they never make any forward progress and theit doesnt much matter what the auditor does the auditor can go over and try to get all the rudiments in and so forth and they all kind of go in meter isnt working dont you see they kind of get all the rudiments in and he gets into the body of the session then he starts this and that and doing this and that and asking him some questions and the wonder of it is that anything happens at all but you get about quarter of an inch of gain out of that sessionvery undemonstrative session its just sort of sitting there sawing wood doing nothing you know only get quarter of an inch of gain out of that session and should have had five miles your good pc is produced by an auditor who never gets the pc in session in the first place this pc isnt sufficiently insession to arc break pc is arc broke oh its very funny thing you could start sawing into session of this particular charactersomebodys running the session in this wayand you know sort of getting it all in with lick and promise and its sort of tacit consent that very little auditing will occur and so forth you want long listing you see this is the way to get it everything is sort of shallow nothing is very deep nobody really inquires into anything very hard and well sort of sit here and get it all dusted off one way or the other and when we finally wind up why we will not have had an arc break which is apparently the primary objective of the session well of course they didnt have an arc break by having one the sessions entire length in other words communication understanding see everything is just kind of out on the fringe and nothing is ever really introduced in dont you see this audience mmhm yes youve stood alongside and watched session run im sure whereby the pc is just yeah birds swim yes yes birds swim oh yes birds swim yes yes birds swim yes yes birds swim and so forth and the auditor is saying do birds swim yes do birds swim yes do birds swim yes and everythings going on and they move through to thethey use up every bit of the auditing time thats the one thing that you can say about that session is it used up the entirety of the auditing period all right you get somebody in there who isnt avoiding arc breaks who isnt avoiding upsets who is trying to look good as an auditor whos doing all kinds of additives his slew of additives have been added to what hes supposed to be doing you see you get somebody in on the same pc and the guy says all right now he says now are you willing to talk to about your difficulties the pc says not uhuh all right all right what difficulty arent you willing to talk to about pc says ooh gee i guess just about everything thats wrong i mean and all of sudden starts opening up as pc and suddenly youll find that old tone arm just coming on down just as nice as you please what with standard auditing but what is standard auditing what is the standard from which we are departing well its this cycle its asking the auditing question of the pc who is sitting in that chairsee not some synthetic pcbut of that pc that is sitting in that chair getting response or an answer from that pc which is then understood by the auditor and is acknowledged by the auditor in such way that the pc knows he said it this pc knows he said the answer and did properly answer it now that is the auditing cycle now when anything interferes with that auditing cycle or additives go in you get one of these corny weird offbeat godelpus sessions do you s what runs it adrift now itsthis auditing cycle is terribly simple cycle and terribly simple people such as myself dont seem to have too much trouble with it but more brilliant people figure their way through this thing and arrive at some kind of mutated answer to it that produces noauditing situation and how theyve managed to do this is the subject of his instructors nightmares thats what the instructor is there for hes trying to find what else they are doing and point it out to them in such way that they realize they are not doing what they should be doing it is terribly idiotically simple thing and of course some very bright person could very easily miss it you would be amazed if you engaged in catechismcatholic church hasnt got any monopoly on the english language we might as well take part of itif you engaged in catechism of an auditor who consistently was getting the ta swinging up high on the pc and asked that auditor searching seeking questions regarding what was supposed to happen at these various parts of the auditing cyclewhat pc was supposed to think and what pc was supposed to do at various parts of it and you will find something that is completely astray inevitably youre going to find something that is really goofy im give you one an actual one well so long as the pc refuses to make up his mind to be audited theres nothing you can do about it how do you like that one in other words all auditing is on automatic it depends on the happy accident of pc deciding to be insession and the auditor has nothing to do with getting the pc insession you understand that now why do these things exist im not just being hard on people who have that sort of theory im trying to make it easy for them to audit where do these things come from theyre all bunch of oddball considerations that exceed this terrible simple simplicity and when i say theyre oddball i mean but where do they come from now its all right for you to say well it stems from their goals we know that and nobody need emphasize that piece of technology somebody who has the seventh dynamic thetans as an oppterm or an introverted person as an oppterm or has people interested in themselves as an oppterm or people who talk as an oppterm are going to have hard time with auditing well you can see that and i can see that and oddly enough we can surmount it fairly easily oddly enough we do it makes tremendous change in one of these people when you get that item and it adds up to something that interferes with auditingmakes big change to them big change theres hardly any substitute for it when you find their goal it makes big change when you get the goal listed out thats terrific change see s there are big changes along this line but if i were to tell you that because person had an oppterm of suchandsuch characteristic he then could not audit we have entered upon 0 very dangerous piece of ground we have said that man can rise superior to his aberrations and that is not true man can rise superior to his aberrationsas even some character who has some horrible oppterm that he just discovered has realized that somehow or another he was getting by and he was trying and his oppterm and his goal are right in the teeth of his ever getting anything done about it dont you see and you is yet getting somewhere man does not have to act his aberrations out to the full thats for sure man can rise above them he may not be able to stay above them but couple of hours of session yeah he can rise now when we get down to eases on the subject of auditing then it is not good enough to say that his item and his goal oppose his being good auditor and therefore he cant do it that is not good enough we know that his auditing will enormously improve we know hell probably never become topnotch auditor until weve got these things wrapped up and hes clear but nevertheless he can audit so there is another channel which mightbecause this other one is so heroicit rises up there like the colossus of rhodes you know its completely visible you know its his item its his goal and so forth and its so visible you might never see this other one you say well get him cleared and hell be able to audit fine theres another one even when you get him cleared he might run into and thats the one the instructor works with thats the one youll be working with when youre trying to make coaudit function when youre trying to make some hpa student toe the mark this one hes got hangover from some group or some philosophy or some activitynot necessarily associated with his goal lineas to what is supposed to happen what hes supposed to do to make something happen and whats supposed to happen when he the auditor does it and you will get things out of the pc youll get things out of the pc and then you do something with them and what does this indicate with the pc you know i mean you ask him questions of this sort now youve asked the pc something and hes responded suchandsuch way now what does that mean see this is searching type of question see you actually can get likely as not get the auditor actually laughing at himself over some of the things he expects lets say he was part of society that preached only one philosophyonly one philosophy that there was reason why you couldnt decide to be anything you wanted to be and immediately become it and all men were weak and evil and guilty and stupid simply because they couldnt do this that by the way is rather familiar one on the track well why dont you decide to be clear you know go ahead go ahead decide to be clear all right cant do it huh hah shows what youre made of see its sort of weird way of making nothing out of thetans and so on well this person actually is operating in an auditing session on the basis well if this person just made up their mind to be clear i wouldnt have to go to all this work see they think the other person is terribly weak because the other person just cant suddenly make up their mind to be clear and theyre having to audit the other person dont you see and theyre auditing past this limitation they dont recognize they themselves are doing it but an instructor talking this little point over with them might discover great deal concerning this you see and they say ah well if hed just make up his mind to be clear i mean therei mean i have to go through all these motions you know and ask him these questions and so forth and actually theres particular reason why i should because all hes got to do is make up his mindwhat am i saying all hes got to do isall hes got to is make up hiswell i couldnt do that see hes got terrifically fixed idea of whats supposed to happen so therefore everything he is doing is being done in the realization according to him you seeis being done in the realization that it doesnt have to be done anyhow so it doesnt matter what he does because the other person should simply be able to make up his mind to be clear and then be clear so therefore the other person is guilty of having session you see all right that would be only one of thousands see only be one of thousands why should you ask anybody question give you another one why should you ask anybody question because you see they know the answer to everything and they know what you know beaus they what am i saying see it comes to dead end here the guy all of sudden realizes hes talking pure unadulterated idiocy you know that people go around aware of the fact that everybody can read their minds and so therefore theres sense in anybody asking them questions because everybody should know everything about them anyhow and every question is complete insult do you know that there are people around that every moment of the day is missed withhold on the part of everybody do you know that people are missed withhold you know how you become missed withhold to such person do you know how you manage to become missed withhold to them you said how are you and you should have known you should have known you get the idea and because you didnt know how they are and therefore asked them question how they are why this immediately indicates that they are missed withhold and they go around all arc broke and upset twentyfour hours day you see because theyre missed withhold to everybody because people keep asking how are they have you just been to class what mark did you make doesnt matter what question is asked them they are sort of going on the basis of all the time everybody should know what theyre thinking some kind of an obsessive idea and they never inspect these things so therefore the pc should know what theyre thinking do you see thats very farfetched and far afield imall im saying here im not trying to give you multiplicity of examples its just what is this person doing when he is sitting there running this cycle of auditing who makes the emeter read this is the type of question you would ask an auditor see who makes the emeter read well the auditor does all right how does the auditor make it read by asking question all right now the instructor has to be little slippier all right if the auditor makes it read by asking question what does the needle fall on the auditor says the question and the instructor says thats right and goes happily upon his way and he missed the freight train dont you see its way over there and over the horizon by this time see hes missed it actually this person is actually there and thinks that when he says do fish swim that this action of his voice here makes the needle respond over there although he can observe that the pc has hold of the cans that he himself doesnt have hold of the cans and that there is voice impact in this meter he actually has always gone around believing and the instructor who didnt ask carefully you see would get an apparency of answer that sounded very logical it sounded quite correct yes the thing reacts to the question yeah the needle reacts to the auditors question completely overlooks the fact the auditor in all sessionsand the auditor has overlooked it toois actually sitting there in front of his meter and he asks the question which makes the meter read and all the time sort of thinks its silly that hes clearing these things because he knows the answers to them so therefore says well whats the use of meter and hes never answered this question satisfactorily to himself in other words these are things that the person has never revealed to himself these are things that little searching and lookover of just the auditing cycle with or without meter would suddenly disclose to the auditors own view because they look silly even to him you see they look silly to the auditor this auditor all of sudden says you know i realize that there is point in ever clearing up an arc break because the pcreactivity is hate and the pc hates everybody and youve got to asis all this hate and if you dont asis all this hate then the pc isnt going to get any better so the best way to do is to get the pc into level of hate and get the pc to hate you and then hell be in arc so therefore you should always ask your auditing command in such way as to stir up the latent hate of the pc you start examining thesethe rationale behind this and examine some of the other things that go into just this cycle and repeated cycle of auditing and youre going to get astonished its the auditor who makes the tone arm go up and hang at 50 auditors should be in command of session this is stable datum to this auditor he hasnt got any other stable datum to go along with it see auditor should be in command of this session auditor is in command of session therefore when pc suggest anything or pc say anything then this means auditor longer in command of session so therefore pc must be suppressed you get this audience mmhm now people who thatwho dont even have command or control in their goal see i mean theres some side play or another do you get this you say do fish swim and the pc says you know ive just hadwell ive had whole avalanche of answers to that question do fish swim and the answers could be yeah and ah now now now thats enough thats enough now theres just one just one just onejust one answer now thatll be quite plenty yeah i know but i have little avalanche here dont give any more now thats it thats it i guess i stayed in command of that session see i hes sitting there watching you see and he says i guess i stayed in command of that session you see all right do fish swim now do fish swim two hours later do fish swim hes added the bank mass by suppress see now his cycle of action you see is being just alterised to that degree theres something awry in the cycle ofthe auditing cycle of action theres something missing here or theres too firm an adherence of some kind or another theres too this or its too that theres something wrong with it and basically youll find that there is some misconception on the part of everybody whos having any trouble auditing theres some misconception there someplace of what theyre doing now you say to them all right what happens if the pc makes suggestion to you about the session that you examine the rudiment question again would you do it or not some fellow will say absolutely not absolutely not not under any circumstances and we wonder why this is and then we discover something like whenever theres confusion in the session the auditor doesnt want to confront the confusion and so the best way to get away from the confusion is to put time track between self and the moment of confusion so therefore give eight or nine more auditing commands very rapidly please and that puts time track in between them and the confusion and of course the pc at that particular time cant leave that confused area dont you see pc cant leave it because theres confusion in it and pc doesnt understand it and then we come back and get the brass ring as the merrygoround goes around and we find out that the auditor does not understand the pc lot of the time and fakes understanding of pc does not know whether auditor understood or not see and we find out that the auditor has interpreted that he would look bad if he did not pretend to understandwhen auditor does not understand so theres the source of your confusion and its right part of that auditing cycle auditor asks the question of the pc and the pc hears this question and the pc thinks of the answer to this question and he says it to the auditor and the auditor understands that answer and acknowledges it and the pc now knows that he has answered the auditing command and all is as ised and we go on along the track see and this auditor is running his sessions this way ask the question of the pc pc answers auditor understands half of the answer doesnt quite get the other half of the answer decides that hed better pretend that he understood it acknowledges the pcs answerwhich says that its understood dont you seeand the pc at this time gets funny feeling about itand all of sudden theres little confused area in the session and the auditor asks the auditing question again and the pc says im confused about the last answer and the auditor says well answer this question and the pc says im confused about the last question the auditor says answer this question the pc says im confused about the last question answer this question im confused about the last question all right well listen here now have i missed withhold on you in this session thats another process see all right lets havehave i missed withhold on you missed withhold pc says well im just confused i i dont know quite whether missed withhold missed withhold i know theres withhold here missed someplace yes yes thats right thats right all right well we cant get the withhold so lets run some ow ow ow yeah what have you done what have you withheld what have you done what have you withheld what have you done what have you withheld what pocketapocketa pocketapocketapocketapocketapocketa see if we can get down the track here distance from this because the auditor has committed crime hes lied to the pc he has said thank you and that was lie the auditing question was do fish swim and the pc said well often time but not in hot bean soup and the auditor heardthe pc had said thats all the auditor got out of it see and the auditor says all right thank you well the pc knows very well that he didnt really put across this statement which was well fish dont swim very well in hot bean soup and the pc somehow or another knows the auditor never got that and the pc doesnt know if he answered the question or not and it hangs right there to some tiny little degree the auditing cycle hung up right there and then the auditor not wanting to take up the auditing cycle can fly off down the track and do something else but not take up what was really wrong you see that so simple study of the auditing cycleor what is understood by the auditing cycle or what the auditor is trying to accomplish in session or what the auditor thinks he should do in sessionjust simple takeup of this sort of thing produces sometimes the most revelatory results you say well now how does pc you know the instructor has to be clever on these things how does pc get over an arc break hey come onhow does pc get over an arc break auditor says well he uhhad missed withhold and so forth and uh you pick up the missed uhwithhold and uhwell i dont know how pc gets over an arc break and you say well why dont you figure out how pc could get over an arc break whats an arc break how does pc get over it this auditor might have been telling you pcs can never get over arc breaks but the pc auditor had not defined either the arwhat is an arc break or how you got pc over an arc break and on the examination of this situation was actually condemning the pc on the point of arc breaks because nice people never get angry see nice people never get angry so if nice people never get angry of course this is the answer this is the idiots answer see therefore if the pc doesnt get over an arc break then the pc is not nice person now where the hell does that wind up session may i ask you that wheres the session supposed to wind up well of course that doesnt solve it at all but the person in articulating this has always thought that was sort of solution to the session see that sort of solved the whole thing it absolved them and they mistook the absolution for the solution they made themselves not guilty of putting the pc into an arc break by adjudicating that the pc who had an arc break was not nice person i know it sounds completely idiotic but this has been sitting there as substitute for not getting pcs out of arc breaks so therefore they have never studied the thing any further further study has ever been given by this auditor on that subject there wasnt another moments study ever given to it why because he had solution all right now lets get back to the achilles heel of all training psychiatrist has eighteen thousand electric shocks behind him and youre going to teach him scientology you think hell make it the mans been in university or spinbin or something for twelve years you know its good thing we dont recruit from people with the standard requirement that they be in crazyhouse for half dozen years you know like the psychiatrists do i just thought of that one i think thats delicious now hes been trained for dozen years and hes all diplomaed up and the state supports him and the hospital supports him and everything supports him but resultshe hasnt time for those and now you come along and youre going to try to teach him to be scientologist well thats very interesting because the one thing that stands in your roadtheres one thing he doesnt know he doesnt know that he doesnt know see thats the one thing he doesnt know now what makes it so apparent that he knows impacts of overts i refer you to what i was saying about zen buddhism you know some people run car into brick wall sometime and come up with the idea that they know something you know an impact is always substituted for knowingness they know well when youve committed tremendous fantastic number of overts against anything you conceive that you know something about it but its an inverted knowingness you see its the total cycle of individuation individuated out individuated out out out out out knew absolutely nothing and then came back on the reverse curve and came back into the center of impact so now one knows one knows only of course you ask this psychiatrist what does he knowwell actually he cant tell you anything that he knows if you were to sit there and harp at him as to what he knew i dont know i think it might be an interesting thing for scientologist to do someday go call on psychiatrist and ask him what he knew youre liable to get some of the most braincracking responses because youre going to deindividuate him out of an obsessed interiorization into whatever hes doing insanity hed be liable to start gibbering you know that hes liable to go mad you know maybe ive found button here on how to drive psychiatrist nuts what do you know now youd follow this cycle you see youd try to teach him something to know but of course that room has already been rented it has occupants so you cant because he already knows so of course theres way to teach him anything that you know but at what level does he actually know he knows at the level of impact that is he knows at the level of obsessive interiorization this is how he quote knows unquote you got to reverse that cycle see the one thing he doesnt know is that he doesnt know and youresometimes can be completely fooled just flabbergasted in instruction in trying to teach somebody something you can absolutely be flabbergasted stonied i think is the better word you say to somebody all right now this building is fiftyfive feet long fiftyseven feet long and they say all right good i know and its twentytwoandahalf feet wide yes i know you know youd fly in their face and say well how do you know you never measured it the fellow will never tell you its on the basis of well i just looked and im good at estimating distances you wont get that type of response out of that type of person see he will just say yes i know well if youre getting that type of response out of somebody become little bit puckish and little bit adventurous about the thing and start skirting out just little bit further to things that are more and more impossible that he knows theyre liable to do some of the weirdest reactions this way well you know everybody in this block hates you you know yes i know becauseno wait minute wait minute what are you talking about you say well i knew if i knocked long enough on that door somebody would open it hello you get the unorthodox method of approach here youd be fascinated about this cycle of the individuation and the person tries harder and harder not to be part of it and finally becomes what hes trying not to be all because of the overt and the withhold and how that compares to knowingness and youve got this individual then that youre trying to teach something to and he already knows and doesnt know that he doesnt know now you try to attack this in many ways you say well theres great need for knowledge of the mind in your profession you know psychiatrist is liable to say why youre going to get the mostthe most weird erratic responses along this particular line im just trying to give you notion about it and if you can keep up asking questionsthis is sort of coffeeshopping on an unorthodox nonrepetitive command basis you seeyou keep asking questions punching around one way or the otherall of sudden the guy will realize that hes looking at complete idiocy and you can spring him out of something like that were not now talking about bad auditors or scientologists or something like that im talking about this on much wider front somebody who is absolutely fixated on the idea that he knows but boy he sure doesnt know what he knows you come along to somebody who is running an auditing session and you say to him well why are you asking the questions of the pc well youre going to get randomity the answer is going to be this and the answer is going to be that the answer may be sensible and the answer may not be sensible but the end product of all this will be that the person either now knows he doesnt know or knows that he knows and new piece of certainty is added to his auditing as long as you leave all of these things uninspected by the auditor as long as he thinks why he is doing it is something or otherit isnt matter of criticizing him or showing he is wrong now dont get the idea that that is what one is advocating youre not really trying to disprove what he is saying call him liar or something like that youre merely trying to get him to inspect something and what you do to furnish the inspection is the simplest possible cyclethe auditing cycle in the simplest form just ask him to inspect this all right now why do you ask the questions good good now why do you think the pc answers in the first place all right why does the pc keep on answering these of course are imponderables man these are braincrackers these actually are considerable questions you know all right whybut youre asking why do you think see and all right now why do you think the pc requires an acknowledgment from you and feels lost if he doesnt get it and make him go over this cycle and ask it two or three times hell jog out all of his memorized reasons and he all of sudden will take look at well why the hell why does he ask an auditing question and why does it make any sense anyway to the pc and you may do this to the auditor you may cause him to like the centipede you know you ask centipede how he walks you know its fatal action you know maybe this auditor cant audit for day or two but the truth of the matter is youve made him inspect the action youve made him inspect the action and in inspectingwell hes asking question now what does the pc do in an arc break what actually happens now dont call him out just accept whatever he says dont you see well exactly why does pc now get very searching you see why does pc recover from an arc break oh buy any stock answer youve got see but come back and ask him again maybe the guy finally says why does he recover from an arc break because he doesnt want to be mad at anymore and he sort of looks up and he says what do you mean he doesnt want to be mad at what did i say you know he doesnt want to be mad at anymore well he didnt want to be mad at inwell yes he did by george you know i think all pcs really are just sitting there waiting for chance to be mad at the guys auditing will improve im giving you an idea about thethe fellow is inspecting what he is doing this is very crude rendition im giving you but fellowget the fellow to inspect what hes doing and try to find out where those deviations are coming in from the ordinary auditing cycle because when hes got some cockeyed reason for it theres going to be some cockeyed action following it its the reason why he will never let the pc give the extra end items toward the end of session toward the end of session the pc is never permitted to give the additional items well why you could stand there and pound your brains out and guess and guess and guess the thing to do is to askthing to do is to ask ask the fellow why he does that only you dont even know what hes doing wrong if you just ask him to inspect the cycle of action ask him what hes puzzled about in auditing what puzzles you in an actual session ohhwee and right away hes halfway to answering the question he starts telling you what puzzles him in session well its what hes having trouble with in session and it usually isnt anything that hes being taught its something that he has added into the situation which doesnt exist there in the first place this is all off the cuff but it comes on the basis of all additives occur in the presence of misunderstandingor in the absence of understanding to state it the other way when you get an additive you didnt have understandinguntil youve got all additives and understanding you want to see somebody doing something idiotic that he thinks is the exact right way to go about it then obviously there was understanding of how to do it in the first place dont you see but you dont look at it perhaps on this other very very narrow viewvery tiny view you say the understanding is the reason for additives and the misunderstanding is the reason for the additives because it may look to you that the person understands what hes doing and yet you have these odd additives well when you see an additive youre looking at misunderstanding and this is picked up on meters as disagreements with well disagreement simply registers as nocomprehensionof and educating by disagreement is fascinating activity you simply get the fellow to pass over the thing while hes holding metera pair of electrodes and everytime it ticks you ask him what have you disagreed with you wouldnt ask him by the way what didnt you understand now im showing you theres synonymous action here see you wouldnt ask him this what did you misunderstand there or what didnt you understand this wouldnt bring anything out you ask them for the symptom of the misunderstanding its the disagreement theyll wrap with disagreement well underlying that disagreement theres misunderstand oh i am sure some fellow has felt awfully silly he has gone out and he has jousted windmills and hes torn things down and hes busted up the millstones and hes just fixing the thing you know just fantastic you know and then he finds the fellow standing there was not ghost but miller see his whole destruction was based upon his misunderstanding of who was standing outside the mill that is the subject of comedy that is also the abundant subject of tragedy in life but in knowledge itself which is the woof and warp that you deal ofwith and so forth disagreement occurs after the misunderstanding and the way to set some auditor back to battery of course is get him to inspect the cycle of auditing and find out whats doing but much surer method you are using in your classes all the time right now and that is simply that you are consistentlyyoure putting people on the meter you ask him to read bulletin while on the meter you clarify the thing or ask them whatgive twelve things out of that bulletin that you can agree with and you of course will inevitably have drop into the hamper the twelve things in the bulletin they disagree with you see those can be clarified you can trace it back to them because person cannot do what he does not understand he can give certain limitations to his understanding and do some small sphere of it like girl running computer does not have to build computer but let point out to you that she is not building computers she is running computers therefore she understands the running of the computer and therefore she can understand the computer if somebody were to ever come along and tell her why she was running the computer and enlarge her understanding of it she would be goodbetter computer operator any day of the week you can always increase work output you can always increase comfort and you can always make people more relaxed by letting them find out what theyre doing and why theyre doing it this is inevitable because youve increased the understanding but people cannot do what they do not understand those are two facts that i dont think any philosopher has ever joined up before they are facts that stand very squarely in the road of good auditing listing will go badly sessions go badly model session falls apart and so forth there is some misunderstanding on the function of the auditor or the cycle of auditing action it does not depend on the person being evil and therefore hes bad auditor because hes basically an evil person see that is not the explanation there is misunderstanding of what he is doing or trying to do and sometimes as in your part on the subject of psychiatryi longer make this mistakeyou cant dig psychiatry or understand psychiatry thats truth thats truth you cant understand them the reason you cant understand them is you really dont realize that they havent any goals or arent doing anything that you would think they should be doing so therefore theyre incomprehensible to you theyre perfectly comprehensible to themselvesperfectly comprehensible they are not trying to cure anybody they are not trying to make anybody well they are not trying to make anybody sane they dont have anything in common with any of those things they longer care for them or understand them or want to have anything to do with them youre trying to understand them on your own framework you see youd like to make people well and youd like to make them feel better and that sort of thing and of course psychiatry is not understandable upon these basics its just not an understandable subject then because the basics by which its being understood are incomprehensible now on fantastically minor scale some auditor isnt doing good job because he just totally misunderstands what he should be doing as the auditor well he doesnt have to have very esoteric understanding of it he doesnt have to be very informed as to what he is doing but his misunderstanding will be so wild as to sometimes just make you feel like youve been snatched baldheaded youll say what not really see im trying to straighten out this persons mind im trying to straighten out this persons thinkingness and therefore the things they think ive got to correct now the only way you can straighten anything out is to correct it isnt it and the only way to correct anything is to change it isnt it so therefore in order to change the pc youve got to correct the pc so therefore you have to tell the pc something different every time the pc says something of course youre going to find far more idiotic responses to this in some kind of coaudit than youll ever find in any group of studying auditors and there it will become so ridiculous as to be fantastic but you can bet your bottom dollar that if you do not understand what is going on in session that you wont be able to handle that session and at the bottom of all error is misunderstanding thats not said on think basis some fellows car you knowthis is an old problem of ours is why does somebodys car go enmest why does this guys car fall apart and why does that birds car stay together and why does one cook turn out good pie and another cook who has twice the intelligence always turn out lousy pie see what are these vast differences well on the subject addressed the person doing it has adequate understanding to the task see this fellows car that isnt going enmest the best way of expressing it or good translatable way of expressing it is just to say well he understands cars see this fellow who makes the good pie well he just understands pie thats all youd find out that would follow through and be true now this fellow who makes bad pie you ask him about pie and by golly youre going to find out he doesnt understand pie you put him on meter and ask himnow this is the meter question that compares with thisyou put him on the meter and you ask him what he disagrees with about pie and you can run it down pull it as prepcheck chain and after that youve severed his individuation channel see i mean hes ceased to bego this cycle of individuation on the subject of pie all of sudden he can understand pie and he can make one there is the whole subject of recovered abilities theres how you recover any ability which you once had you just restore your understanding of it how do you restore your understanding of it well its unfortunately very negative thing you delete your disagreements with it and if you can take your disagreements out with it your understanding of it will restore then you can study it you can look it over and familiarize yourself with it and you can do it well in this lecture ive taken up some of the bugbears of an instructor there are many ways you could go about the subject of instruction but i think if you go too long and try to instruct too long without taking to heart the principles which ive just given you i think you will come cropper in large percentage of cases and theyre the ones thatll break your heart person cant auditthey dont understand what theyre supposed to be doing why dont they understand what theyre supposed to be doing because they disagree with certain things that they are doing if you wanted to follow it back down on an instructionauditing back check basis pick up the disagreements they could then familiarize themselves with what they are doing and then they could audit doesnt matter what their goal isyoud still get by it okay all right thank you and good night
