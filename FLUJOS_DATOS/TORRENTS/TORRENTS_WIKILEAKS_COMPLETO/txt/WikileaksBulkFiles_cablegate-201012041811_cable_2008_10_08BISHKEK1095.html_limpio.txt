d 1 c summary on october 28 the ambassador participated in twohour brunch to brief hrh the duke of york ahead of his meetings with the kyrgyz prime minister and other highlevel officials she was the only nonsubject of the united kingdom or the commonwealth invited to participate by the british ambassador to the kyrgyz republic other participants included major british investors in kyrgyzstan and the canadian operator of xxxxxxxxxxxx the discussion covered the investment climate for western firms in the kyrgyz republic the problem of corruption the revival of the great game russian and chinese influence in the country and the princes personal views on promoting british economic interests astonishingly candid the discussion at times verged on the rude from the british side end summary 2 c british ambassador to the kyrgyz republic paul brummell invited the ambassador to participate in briefing his royal highness prince andrew the duke of york ahead of his october 28 meetings with kyrgyz prime minister igor chudinov and other highlevel officials the prince was in kyrgyzstan to promote british economic interests originally scheduled to last an hour over brunch the briefing ended up lasting two hours thanks to the superengaged princes pointed questions the ambassador was the only participant who was not british subject or linked to the commonwealth the absence of her french and german colleagues was notable they were apparently not invited despite being fellow members of the european union others included major british investors in kyrgyzstan and the canadian operator of the kumtor mine you have to take the rough with the smooth 3 c the discussion was kicked off by the president of the canadianrun kumtor mine who described at length his companys travails of trying to negotiate revised mining concession that provides greater stake in kumtors parent company to the kyrgyz government in exchange for simplified tax regime and an expanded concession he was followed by the representative of the british owner of kyrgyzneftigas who explained his companys role in kyrgyz oil exploration and production as well as doing his share of complaining of being harassed and hounded by kyrgyz tax authorities one example he gave was that kyrgyz shareholder was now suing the company saying that his human rights were being violated by the terms of his shareholders agreement 4 c the prince reacted with unmitigated patriotic fervor to his credit he diligently tried to understand the kyrgyz point view however when participants explained that some kyrgyz feel that they were unfairly led in the 1990s to sign unfavorable contracts with westerners he evinced sympathy contract is contract he insisted you have to take the rough with the smooth all of this sounds exactly like france 5 c after having halfheartedly danced around the topic for bit only mentioning personal interests in pointed fashion the business representatives then plunged into describing what they see as the appallingly high state of corruption in the kyrgyz economy while claiming that all of them never participated in it and never gave out bribes one representative of middlesized company stated that it is sometimes an awful temptation in an astonishing display of candor in public hotel where the brunch was taking place all of the businessmen then chorused that nothing gets done in kyrgyzstan if president bakiyevs maxim does not get his cut prince andrew took up the topic with gusto saying that he keeps hearing maxims name over and over again whenever he discusses doing business in this country emboldened one businessman said that doing business here is like doing business in the yukon in the nineteenth century ie only those willing to participate in local corrupt practices are able to make any money his colleagues all heartily agreed with one pointing out that nothing ever changes here before all you heard was akayevs sons name now its bakiyevs sons name at this point the duke of york laughed uproariously saying that all of this sounds exactly like france 6 c the prince then turned to the ambassador for an american take on the situation the ambassador described american business interests in the country which range from large investments such as the hyatt hotel and the katel telecommunications company to smaller investments in range of sectors she stated that part of the problem with business conditions in kyrgyzstan was the rapid turnover in government positions some reacted to their short tenures in corrupt manner wanting to steal while they can until they were turned out of office while noting the need for greater transparency in doing business she recounted that she had hosted the american chamber of commerces members day last week attended by the foreign minister and the deputy minister of trade and commerce which had been widely attended and resounding success see reftel she then described the beneficial impact on the kyrgyz economy of the coalition air base at manas airport you have to cure yourself of anorexia 7 c with mock groan the duke of york then exclaimed my god what am i supposed to tell these people more seriously he invited his guests to suggest ways kyrgyzstans economic prospects and attractiveness could be improved everyone agreed that in his talks with the prime minister and others he should emphasize the rule of law and longterm stability 8 c agreeing with the ambassadors point about rapid government turnover they urged him to impress upon his hosts the importance of predictability and the sanctity of contracts in order to attract more western investment at the same time they pointed out that none of this was necessary to attract russian kazakh or chinese investments it appeared to them that the kyrgyz were satisfied with their level and on the verge of not bothering with making the necessary improvements to attract western investments returning to what is obviously favorite theme prince andrew cracked they wont need to make any changes to attract the french either again turning thoughtful the prince mused that outsiders could do little to change the culture of corruption here they themselves have to have change of heart just like you have to cure yourself of anorexia one else can do it for you playing the great game by extension the americans too 9 c addressing the ambassador directly prince andrew then turned to regional politics he stated baldly that the united kingdom western europe and by extension you americans too were now back in the thick of playing the great game more animated than ever he stated cockily and this time we aim to win without contradicting him the ambassador gently reminded him that the united states does not see its presence in the region as continuation of the great game we support kyrgyzstans independence and sovereignty but also welcome good relations between it and all of its neighbors including russia 10 c the prince pounced at the sound of that name he told the ambassador that he was frequent visitor to central asia and the caucasus and had noticed marked increase in russian pressure and concomitant anxiety among the locals postaugust events in georgia he stated the following story related to him recently by azerbaijans president aliyev aliyev had received letter from president medvedev telling him that if azerbaijan supported the designation of the bolshevik artificial famine in ukraine as genocide at the united nations then you can forget about seeing nagornokarabakh ever again prince andrew added that every single other regional president had told him of receiving similar directive letters from medvedev except for bakiyev he asked the ambassador if bakiyev had received something similar as well the ambassador answered that she was not aware of any such letter 11 c the duke then stated that he was very worried about russias resurgence in the region as an example he cited the recent central asian energy and watersharing deal septel which he claimed to know had been engineered by russia who finally pounded her fist on the table and everyone fell into line note interestingly the turkish ambassador to the kyrgyz republic recently described her analysis of the deal to the ambassador in strikingly similar language end note 12 c showing that he is an equalopportunity great game player hrh then turned to the topic of china he recounted that when he had recently asked the president of tajikistan what he thought of growing chinese influence in central asia the president had responded with language i wont use in front of ladies his interlocutors told the prince that while russians are generally viewed sympathetically throughout the region the chinese are not he nodded terming chinese economic and possibly other expansion in the region probably inevitable but menace rude language british 13 c the brunch had already lasted almost twice its allotted time but the prince looked like he was just getting started having exhausted the topic of kyrgyzstan he turned to the general issue of promoting british economic interests abroad he railed at british anticorruption investigators who had had the idiocy of almost scuttling the alyamama deal with saudi arabia note the duke was referencing an investigation subsequently closed into alleged kickbacks senior saudi royal had received in exchange for the multiyear lucrative bae systems contract to provide equipment and training to saudi security forces end note his mothers subjects seated around the table roared their approval he then went on to these expletive journalists especially from the national guardian who poke their noses everywhere and presumably make it harder for british businessmen to do business the crowd practically clapped he then capped this off with zinger castigating our stupid sic british and american governments which plan at best for ten years whereas people in this part of the world plan for centuries there were calls of hear hear in the private brunch hall unfortunately for the assembled british subjects their cherished prince was now late to the prime ministers he regretfully tore himself away from them and they from him on the way out one of them confided to the ambassador what wonderful representative for the british people we could not be prouder of our royal family comment 14 c comment prince andrew reached out to the ambassador with cordiality and respect evidently valuing her insights however he reacted with almost neuralgic patriotism whenever any comparison between the united states and united kingdom came up for example one british businessman noted that despite the overwhelming might of the american economy compared to ours the amount of american and british investment in kyrgyzstan was similar snapped the duke surprise there the americans dont understand geography never have in the uk we have the best geography teachers in the world end comment gfoeller
