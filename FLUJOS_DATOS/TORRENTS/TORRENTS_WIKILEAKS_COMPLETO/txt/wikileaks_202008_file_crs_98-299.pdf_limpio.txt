administration says it gives russian missile technology and nuclear reactor transfers high priority bu t many in the 106 congress are likely to cite the missile test as evidence of lack fth progress

russian government denies its ow n involvement and says it is upholding its commitments under the missile technology control regime mtcr russian assistance appears to have significantl accelerated irans missile program which reportedly is developing mediumrang ballistic missiles that could threaten us forces and allies throughout the region including israel this threat is compounded by irans reported pursuit of nuclear biological and chemical weapons russias 1995 decision t construct large nuclear power station in iran and to provide related nuclear fac ilities and services has also drawn sharp criticism from the administration and the congress which fear that these projects might benefit n iranian nuclear weapons program moscow is going ahead with these project s despite the threat of

administration charge that the russia n governme nt is directly or indirectly involved in assisting iran to develop medium range ballist ic missiles at the same time russia is building nuclear power station in iran and has agreed to furnish iran with wide range of other nuclear services the issue is whether or not russian entities shoul d be sanctioned for transferring missile technology to iran as would have been required by hr 2709 whether such sanctions would be detrimental to us efforts to dissuade russians from transferring missile technology to iran as president clinton contended in his veto of hr 2709 and whether administration actions aimed at curbing russian missile technolog transfers are effective the 106 congress may revisit this issueth congress has expressed strong opposition

vice president gore and premier yevgenny primakov inmanila july 28 1998 and presidents clinton and yeltsin in moscow september 12 1998 although there are recent signs of change in ira n and in us policy toward iran there has been strong consensus in congress and the executive branch shared b many foreign governments that iran is still leading sponsor of state terrorism and potential threat to us and w estern interests hence the united states has sought to keep military and weapons of mass destruction technology from iran russia s military political and economic cooperation with iran may undermine this polic and is major source of tension in usrussian relations the clinton administrati on has made repeated highlevel representations to the russian government to persuade it to end missile technology and nuclear reacto r transfers to iran with mixed success the administration considers cooperation with postcommunist russia sometimes expressed in terms of partnership an d assistance in russias transiti on toward democracy and market economy to be very important us goals despite the fact that usrussian relations have soured lately not only over iranian issues but also because of russian opposition to us polic toward iraq serbia and nato enlargement thus th us objectives of containing iran and cooperating with russia appear to be in conflict critics of th administration are likely to point to irans july 22 1998 test of an 800mile rang missile apparently constructed with russian assistance as evidence that th administrations approach is not succeedinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98299crs3 the clinton administration takes the general position that while it strongl opposes some of russias dealings with iran congressionally mandated unilatera l sanctions will not change russian polic and furthermore usrussian relations are too important to be put at risk over disagreements on iran sanctions have rarel been imposed against postsoviet russia

the middle east us intelligence reportedly confirmed the israel i conclusions the government of isra raised the alarm in strong terms to the united states and russia because it would be threatened by these new missiles th transfers became central issue of usrussian relations and have been discusse d at numerous highlevel bilateral meetings the russian transfers apparently were in violation of the mtcr guidelines and the usrussian agreement to ban new arms sales to iran under certain circumstances such transfers would trigger statutor us economic sanctions but as months passed and more details of the transfer s appeared in the press many members of congress questioned russias denials an d lack of effective us or russian action to stop the flow of missile technology to iran for the past few yea rs some members of congress have been frustrated by the administrations decisions not to impose sanctions against russian and chines firms that exported sensitive missile or nuclear technology the administration has often been able to avoid implementing the missile sanctions provisions of the arm s export control act aeca pl 90629 the export administration act of 197 9 eaa pl 9672 the iraniraq arms nonproliferation act of 1992 iiana the foreign assistance act of 1961 faa pl 87195 and the annual foreig n operations appropriations ac t because of exclusions waivers definitions that allow for broad interpretation and the lack of certain binding requirements in the laws these sanctions had been legislated largely during previous administrations to pu t teeth into u s nonproliferation policy and the multilateral nonproliferation regimes but some members concluded they were not s ufficiently rigorous and introduced bills to tighten the requirements for sanctions numerous bills were introduced t ohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98299crs4 encourage or force the administration to take stronger measures against russia and iran see the summary of legislati on in the 105 congress at the end of this reportth rep gilman introduced the iran missile proliferation sanctions act of 199 7 hr 2709 which would have required the president to identify to congress every foreign person with respect to whom there is credible information indicating that that person has transferred missi technology to iran and to impose economic sanctions against that pe rson unless the president can rebut the information or justify waiver on grounds of national security congressional action on this issue focused largel on hr 2709 this bill would have closed two loopholes of the aeca sec 73a and b and eaa sec 11bb1 and 2 the first of these l oopholes ties statutory sanctions to presidential determina tion which the president is not required to make the second makes sanctions inapplicable against most exporters in country suc h as russia that is an adherent to the mtcr the proposed bill would also appl sanctions to all persons who have exported missile technology to iran unlike th iiana which ties statutory sanctions to presidential determination that transfer s are of destabilizing numbers and types of advanced conventional weapons an d that does not explicitly include ballistic missiles in the laws definition of advance d conventional weapons the bill might also block foreign assistance to an proliferating entity whereas sections 498a 620g and 620h of the faa and title ii of the annual foreign operations appropriations acts have not been successful i n blocking such assistance the bill does however include authority for presidential waiver on national security grounds president clinton vetoed hr 2709 on june 23 1998 saying if enacted i t would damage the us national interest making it harder to achieve goals it i s intended to serve he further wrote that the battle against proliferation is mos t effective as cooperative enterprise implying that unilateral economic sanctions are less effective he also said that the standard of evidence in hr 2709 fo r establishin g that person or entity had wrongly transferred missile technology i s unworkably low and that the sanctio ns are also disproportionate he argued that the imposition of unilateral american sanctions would make it more difficult to win russian government cooperation on the important missile proliferation issue an d perhaps on other issues such as arms control law enforcement counternarcotic s and combating transnational crime there appears to be support in various departments of government and in th congress for the view that sanctions have contributed to us nonproliferatio n policies in some other situations there is also view that the government an d congress have at least in some cas used sanctions inconsistently and ineffectively other members intr oduced legislation to authorize additional funds for ballistic missile defenses and other measures to counter the emerging threat posed by iran and other countries details of the russian transfers during the iraniraq war 19801988

following the 1979 revolution the islamic government canceled the project but few years late r changed its mind and asked kwu to finish the plants however the west german government prohibited kwu

program questions were raise d about the economic role nuclear power could play in nation with vast oil and ga s resources in the 1970s however there was wides pread belief that world oil supplies were limited and prices would continue to rise as they had during the 1973 arab oil embargo at the same time nuclear power was viewed as technology already cost competitive with oil and gas and sure to become more so as it matured and as fossil fuel prices increased in such situation oil and gas deposits were looked on b many as resources that would increase in value in the future worth preserving b substituting cheap nuclear power since the 1970s however the world energy picture has changed radically world proved oil reserves instead of declining have increased by about 50 ove r what they were in 1973 and real prices have declined below what they were before the oil crisis ir ans petroleum resources are thus declining in value and exports are limited by worl d demand rather than supply while this trend has been taking place nuclear power has turned out to be more costly tha n anticipated nuclear plants may make economic sense for countries without domestic energy resources like japan france south korea and taiwan where they can contribute to energy security and save the cost of importing fuels f or power generation but it is difficult to argue that oilrich

yeltsin made significan t concession by agreeing not to provide iran with gas centrifuge equipment which would have enabled iran to produce highly enriched weapons grade uranium these centrifuges had been included in the january 1995 russianirania n agreement moscow also pledged to tighten its mo nitoring of irans nuclear program and to bring all spent nuclear fuel back to russia neverthe less
