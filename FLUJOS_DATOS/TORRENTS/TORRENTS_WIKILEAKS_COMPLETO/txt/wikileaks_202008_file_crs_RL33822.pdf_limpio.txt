selfdetermination act of 2000 srs pl 106393 provided temporary optional program of payments to counties whose regular forest service and bureau of land management receiptsharing payments had declined significantly the decline from historic payments annual fluctuations in payments and the linkage of payments to receiptgenerating activities have led to many proposals to change the system tax equivalency is the most common alternative suggested but the clinton administration proposed program using historical payments and this vision was used in pl 106393 srs expired at the end of fy2006 congressional debates over reauthorization have considered the basis and level of compensation historical tax equivalency etc the source of funds receipts new tax or revenue source etc the authorized and required uses of the payments interaction with other compensation programs notably payments in lieu of taxes and the duration of any changes temporary or permanent in addition budget rules have imposed procedural barrier to reauthorizing the law to be considered on the floor legislation with mandatory spending in excess of the baseline must be offset by additional receipts or declines in other mandatory spending funding for oneyear extension through fy2007 of payments under srs was included in the us troop readiness veterans care katrina recovery and iraq accountability appropriations act 2007 pl 11028 the emergency supplemental appropriations act for fy2007 specifically title v chapter 4 5401 provided for fy2007 payments of 100 million from receipts and 425 million of appropriations to the maximum extent practicable in the same manner as were made in 2006 several proposals to extend modify and phase out the srs payment system have been considered in the 110 th congress one approach has been fouryear extension with declining payment levels and modified formula to shift funding toward areas with low historic receipts but substantial federal lands an amendment to effect such an extension passed the senate in early 2007 in the emergency supplemental appropriations act but was deleted in the conference agreement similar bill hr 3058 was introduced on july 17 2007 with house natural resources committee hearings on july 26 and markup session on september 26 however the bill failed to pass under suspension of the rule s another version was considered in the fy2009 continuing resolution hr 2638 but was not enacted the senate then included fouryear extension with declining payments and modified formula in the emergency economic stabilization act hr 1424

program g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 since 1908 the fs has paid 25 of its gross receipts to the states for use on roads and schools in the counties where the national forests are located 16 usc 500 receipts come from sales leases rentals or other fees for using national forest lands or resources 1 this mandatory spending program was enacted to compensate local governments for the taxexempt status of the national forests but the compensation rate 10 in 1906 and 1907 25 since was not discussed in the 19061908 debates the program is called fs payments to states because each state allocates the funds to road and school programs although the fs determines the amount to be spent in each county based on the acreage of each national forest in each county the states cannot retain the funds they must be passed through to local governmental entities not necessarily counties for the authorized road and school programs at their peak in fy1989 fs payments totaled 361 million fs receipts have declined substantially since fy1989 largely because of declines in timber sales the fs has four other compensation programs the largest is payments to counties for national grasslands 7 usc 1012 this program pays 25 of net rather than gross receipts from grazing and other uses of the national grasslands directly to the counties where the grasslands are located for use on roads and schools in the counties the payments have been rising slowly to peak of 62 million in fy2002 the other three programs are quite small both in acreage affected and amount of money going to the local governments totaling about 2 million annually congress has also enacted numerous programs to share receipts from blm lands for various types of resource use and from various classes of land one program accounts for the majority of blm receiptsharing counties in western oregon containing the revested oc lands oregon and california railroad grant lands returned to fe deral ownership for failure to fulfill the terms of the grant receive 50 of the receipts from these lands these mandatory payments go directly to the counties for any local governmental purposes the payments peaked at 205 million in fy1990 but have similarly declined because of declining timber sales since the late 1980s concerns about and proposals to alter fs receiptsharing payments also typically include the oc payments because both are substantial payments derived largely from timber receipts 1for more on these and other mandatory countycompensation programs for federal lands see rl30335 federal land

each county but are restricted in counties with very low populations pilt payments are reduced to minimum payment per acre by other payment programsincluding fs payments to states and blms oc

oc receiptsharing payments the primary focus has been on the decline in fs and oc receipts due to the decline in timber sales particularly in oregon national forest receipts subject to sharing declined from their peak of 153 billion in fy1989 to 266 million in fy2003a drop of 83 from the fy1989 level in some areas the decline has been even greater for example payments to the eastern oregon counties containing the ochoco national forest fell from 10 million in fy1991 to 309000 in fy1998a decline of 97 from the fy1991 level another concern has been annual fluctuations in the payments even in areas with modest declines or increases the payments have varied widely from year to year from fy1985 to fy2000 the payments from each national forest have risen or fallen an average of nearly 30 annuallythat is on average countys payment in any year is likely to be nearly 30 higher or lower than its payment the preceding year such wide annual fluctuations impose serious budgeting difficulties on the counties third longerterm concern is referred to as linkage some observers have noted that because the counties receive portion of receipts they are rewarded for advocating receiptgenerating activities principally timber sales and for opposing management that might reduce or constrain such activities eg protecting commercial or sport fish harvests or designating wilderness areas counties have thus often been allied with the timber industry and opposed to environmental groups in debates over fs management and budget decisions this source of funds was deemed appropriate when the fs program was created albeit prior to creation of federal income taxes some interests support retaining the linkage between county compensation and agency receipts local support for receiptgenerating activities is seen as appropriate because such activities usually also provide local employment and income especially in rural areas where unemployment is often high others assert that ending the linkage is important so that local government officials can be independent in supporting management decisions that benefit their locality rather than being paid to support particular decisions 2 see

over the years to alter the compensation system most have focused on some form of tax equivalency compensating the states and counties at roughly the same level as if the lands were privately owned and managed many acknowledge the validity of this approach for fairly and consistently compensating state and county governments however most also note the difficulty in developing tax equivalency compensation system because counties and states use wide variety of mechanisms to tax individuals and corporationspro perty taxes sales taxes income taxes excise taxes severance taxes and more thus developing single federal compensation system for the taxexempt status of federal lands may be very difficult if not impossible in his 1984 budget request president reagan proposed replacing the receiptsharing programs with tax equivalency system with guaranteed minimum payment the counties argued that the proposal was clearly intended to reduce payments noting that the budget request projected savings of 405 million 12 under the proposal the change was not enacted the fy1986 fs budget request included proposal to change the payments to 25 of net receipts after deducting administrative costs which would have reduced the payments by 2074 million to 13 of the required payments legislation to effect this change was not offered in 1993 president clinton proposed 10year payment program to offset the decline in fs and oc timber sales and thus payments resulting from efforts to protect spotted owls and other values in the pacific northwest congress enacted this program in 13982 of the 1993 omnibus budget reconciliation act pl 10366 these s potted owl payments began in 1994 at 85 of the fy1986fy1990 average payments declining by 3 percentage points annually to 58 in 2003 but with payments after fy1999 at the higher of this formula or the standard payment in his fy1999 budget request president clinton announced that he would propose legislation to stabilize the payments by extending the spotted owl payments formula to all national forests the proposal would have directed annual payments from any funds in the treasury not otherwise appropriated at the higher of the fy1997 payment or b 76 of the fy1986 fy1990 average payment this approach would have increased payments in areas with large payment declines while decreasing payments in other areas eliminated annual fluctuations in payments and delinked the payments from receipts member introduced the administrations proposed bill the fy2000 and fy2001 fs budget requests contained similar programs but legislative proposals were offered the national association of counties naco proposed an alternative in 1999 the naco proposal would have provided the counties with the higher of the standard payment or b replacement payment determined by the three highest consecutive annual payments for fy1986 fy1995 indexed for inflation naco also proposed longterm solution to allow for the appropriate sustainable and environmentally sensitive removal of timber from the national forests by establishing local advisory councils the naco approach would have maintained or increased the payments and might have reduced the annual fluctuations but would likely have retained the linkage between receipts and payments in at least some areas

the fs payments the last of which made the payments permanent clearly indicate that the intent was to substitute receiptsharing for local property taxation but rationale was discussed for the level chosen 10 in 1906 and 1907 25 since similarly the rationale was not clearly explained or discussed for the reagan tax equivalency proposal for the spotted owl payments declining percent of the historical average or for the legislation debated and enacted by the 106 th congress generally the average of the three highest payments during specified historical period the only clear conclusion is that the proposals were generally to reduce by reagan or increase more recently the payments the geographic basis is also potential problem for fs payments fs 25 payments are made to the states but are calculated for each county with land in each national forest using the average of selected historical payments from each nation forest or to each county or each state could result in different levels of payments in states with multiple national forests 5 this is not an issue for oc lands because the oc payments are made directly to the counties g21g152g158g155g140g142g561g152g143g561g8g158g151g141g156g561 as noted above the fs 25 payments are permanently appropriated from agency receipts and were established prior to federal income taxes and substantial federal oil and gas royalties most of the proposals for change also would establ ish mandatory payments but generally did not specify funding source pl 106393 directed the payments first from receipts then from the general treasury critics are concerned that this retained the linkage between agency receipts eg from timber sales and county payments albeit less directly than for the 25 payments the source of funds may relate to the offset under paygo rules as discussed below

only be spent on roads and schools in the counties where the national forests are located state law dictates which road and school programs are financed with the payments and the state laws differ widely generally ranging from 30 to 100 for school programs with few states providing substantial local discretion on the split6 the oc payments are available for any local governmental purpose pl 106393 modified these provisions by requirin g for counties with at least 100000 in annual payments that 1520 of the payments be used for other purposes certain local governmental costs in title iii federal land projects recommended by local advisory committees and approved by the secretary under title ii or federal land projects as determined by the secretary under 402 use of the funds for federal land projects has been touted as reinvesting agency 5 the complexity of this situation is shown using arizona as an example in crs report rl30480 forest service revenuesharing payments

programs have been enacted to provide counties with federal funding to compensate for the taxexempt status of certain federal lands pilt is the broadest general payment program and authorized pilt payments are reduced by certain other payment programs including fs 25 payments oc payments and payments under pl 106393 during the debate over pl 106393 congress debated whether to replace the fs 25 and the oc payment programs temporarily or permanently or to allow counties to opt for the current system instead of the enacted alternative system congress also considered whether to exempt the alternative payments from the pilt offset which would have provided greater total payments to the counties in the end pl 106393 provided an optional temporary program with payments included as offsets to pilt nonetheless these possibilities could again be discussed perhaps the question of pilt offsets might lead to broader discussion of the appropriate total compensation to state and local governments for the taxexempt status of all federal lands g6g158g155g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g561 the fs 25 and the oc payments are permanently

have made permanent changes others would have changed the system temporarily often with an advisory group to examine the old system and the temporary changes and to make recommendations the forest counties payments committee recommended permanent change based on pl 106393 with some adjustments the essential questions for congress are 1 how often should congress review the payment systems to assess whether they still function as intended and 2 what options are available eg sunset provision to induce future congresses to undertake such review

reauthorization the fs would have sold approximately 300000 acres of national forest land this would have required legislation as the fs currently has only very narrow authority to sell any lands the administration offered draft legislation to authorize these land sales but bill to authorize that level of national forest land sales was introduced in the 109 th congress in fy2007 the administration again proposed selling national forest lands to fund phaseout of payments under the secure rural schools and community selfdetermination act with half of the land sale revenues for other programs

revenuesharing payments from fy1986fy1999 for each eligible county9 step 2 calculate the proportion of these payments in each county ie divide each countys threehighest step 1 by the total of threehighest in all eligible counties with separate calculations for nfs lands and oc lands step 3 calculate the proportion of eligible nfs and oc lands in each county ie divide each countys federal acreage by the total federal acreage in all eligible counties with separate calculations for nfs lands and oc lands step 4 average these two proportions ie add the payment proportion step 2 and the acreage proportion step 3 and divide by 2 with separate calculations for nfs lands and oc lands this is the base share for counties with nfs lands and the 50 base share for counties with oc lands step 5 calculate each countys income adjustment by dividing the per capita personal income in each county by the median per capita personal income in all eligible counties step 6 adjust each countys base share step 4 by its relative income ie divide each countys base share or 50 base share by its income adjustment step 5 step 7 calculate each countys adjusted share or 50 adjusted share as the countys proportion of its base share adjusted by its relative income step 6 from the total adjusted shares in all eligible counties ie divide each countys result from step 6 by the total for all eligible counties nfs and oc together in essence the act differs from the original srs by basing half the payments on historic revenues and half on proportion of federal land with an adjustment based on relative county income in addition the act sets full payment amount allocated among all counties that choose to participate in the program eligible counties thus the fewer counties that choose to participate ie the more that opt for the original payment programs the more each participating county gets g22g155g138g151g156g146g157g146g152g151g561g18g138g162g150g142g151g157g156g561 in lieu of the

25 of average gross receipts over the past seven years essentially sevenyear rolling average of receipts this will reduce the annual fluctuation in payments providing more stability in the annual pa yments this will retard increases in payments when and where national forest receipts are rising but will slow the decline when and where receipts are falling this change will immediately affect
