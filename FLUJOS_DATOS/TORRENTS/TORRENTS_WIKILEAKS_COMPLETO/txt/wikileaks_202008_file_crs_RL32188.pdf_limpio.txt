the implementation of sevis nonetheless schools have reported technical diffi culties operating sevis and reported discrepancies between information received from different bureaus in dhs regarding sevis operations and requirements additi onally some have noted delays in student visa processing prior to the implement ation of sevis it was difficult to know when foreign students overstayed their visas through sevis dhs should be able to identify students who have violated the term s of their visas however some question whether dhs has the staff to locate all stude nt visa violators and whether it is beneficial use of dhs resour ces to do so others are concerned that clerical errors will lead to unwarranted enforcement actions this report will be updated as

student visa th operating budget for sevis comes from the fee collection14 admissions and tracking process foreign students who wish to study in the united states must first apply to sevis certified school once the student is admitted the school enters the students name and identifying information into the sevis system15 the foreign student may then apply for student visa with the united states embassy or consulate in their home country16 the consular officer then enters the visa information into sevis confirming that the student is in the sevis database the consular officer also checks the prospective student against ot her databases to ascertain whether the student is eligible for visa ie the pros pective student is not security risk does not have criminal record or any other issue which would render the prospective student inadmissible to the united st ates under the immigration and nationality act17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32188crs5 17 continued admissions by ruth ellen wasem

has shown up for class and the course of study being pursued the school has an ongoing responsibility to report any change in the students status ie expulsion suspension change in major graduation in sevis schools are also required to provide information on people who have derivative status such as students spouse or child on students visa issues management of sevis congress has held several hearings on sevis18 although hearings have been held afte r the full implementation of sevis many of the issues raised during the hearings seem to remain there are reportedly issues with sevis that stem from the abolition of ins and the division of many of its functions into three components in dhs the bureau of citizenship and immigration services uscis the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement ice and the bureau of customs and border protection cbp sevis was developed by the ins immigration services division which is now part of uscis but responsibility for sevis was placed in ice reportedly as of november 1 2003 all sevis responsibilitie s have been transferred to ice specifically ice is responsible for main taining the sevis da tabase sevis policy and certifying schools nonetheless sc hools have reported di screpancies between information received from uscis and ice regarding sevis operations and requirements the lack of consistent in formation and guidance has reportedly led to some frustration but the cons istency of information may improve now that all sevis functions are concentrated in one bur eau others have noted problems with inexperienced staff in the new dhs and the difficulty of people at the district levels who are under uscis and with whom the sc hools have the most contact in getting information from ice19httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32188crs6

enforc ement and david ward president american council on education testimony before the house subcommittee on immigration border security and claims nonimmigrant student tracking implementation and proposed modifications hearing apr 2 2003 24 conversation with victor johnson nonetheless there have been few storie s in the press of foreign students having problems entering the united states as result of the implementation of sevis20 possibly one reason is that to aid in the transition to sevis dhs established asevis response team to work with insp ectors schools and students to resolve issues and problems related to stude nt admissions to the united states 21 in fact some have praised dhs responsivene ss to issues raised by the schools22 technical support in addition johnny n williams interim director immigration interior enforcement at ice testified that since sevis is new system that was developed and deployed under an aggressive schedule that he could not guarantee that there would not be technical problems with the system but that the department would work quick ly to address the problems23 indeed as predicted schools have reported technical difficulties operating sevis and noted that to circumvent some of the technical problems they need to create incorrect records24 other concerns have been expressed about the fact that sevis system information is kept by record number and not names some students have more than one record and this can make it difficult to update th database and possibly cause issues when and if sevis becomes part of us vi sit dhs automated entryexit system reporting burdens additionally some contend that sevis has placed an added burden on schools as they are now re sponsible for noting in the sevis system changes of those accompanying the students such as spouses and children they are required to report on people who are not enrolled in their institutions schools are required to note in sevis wh student has entered the country but has not shown up for classes thus schools are supposed to be notified when student enters at port of entry poe but reportedly this does not always happenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32188crs7

suggested having the department of state dos collect the fee at the same time that th fee for the visa application is collected others contend that this would cause an ex tra burden on dos and would be an added cost for those whose visa applications were not approved 28 federal register vol 69 126 july 1 2004 p 39816 29 for examples see jaime swanson in the dark foreign students may have to wait

applied if they do not report student who failed to attend classes and who the school was unaware had entered the country25 followup on overstays furthermore prior to the implementation of sevis it was difficult to know when foreig n students overstayed their visas because the visas lack fixed termination date and schools althoug h required to report students who stopped attending were not required to syst ematically report data on the progress of each foreign student through sevis dhs should be able to identify students who have violat ed the terms of their visas26 however some have questioned whether dhs has the staff to locat all student visa violators and whether it is beneficial use of dhs resources to do so there are also concerns that sevis errors will lead to unwarranted enforcem ent action taken against innocent students fee collection concerns have been raised about the methods available for students to pay the sevis fee specifically that it may be difficult for some foreign students to pay the fee in either of the prescribed manners electronically with credit card or by mail with check or money order drawn on us bank and payable in us dollars dhs addressed this issue in the regulation contending that the fee payment rules will not be much of burden on students as most have already made similar types of payments to pply to schools and to take standardized tests that are sometimes required for admission dhs also noted that many foreign banks are able to issue checks or money orders drawn on u s banks in addition dhs said that it will accept payment from third party and will explore other payment possibilities in the future including conducting pilot program with dos to collect the fee at consular offices27 furthermore some are concerned that the fee is excessive and will discourage students from studying in the united states others note that immigration services are supported by fees not by ppropriations and that the foreign students not the taxpayers should be responsible fo r funding sevis dhs contends that it studied the fee issue and will reexamine th fee every two years to determine if the fee amount is appropriate28 delays in visa issuances lastly one issue tangentially related to sevis which has been receiving interest is repor ts of delays in issuing student visas29 nonetheless the delays appear to be the result of increased screening by doshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32188crs8 30 notice on current visa processing situation available at httpwwwtravelstategov specialnoticehtml 31 us government accountability office

situation which stated responding to the attacks of septem ber 11 2001visa applications are now subject to greater degree of scrutiny than in the past for many applicants personal appearance interview is required as standard part of visa processing additionally applicants affected by thes procedures are informed of the need for additional screening at the time they submit their applications and are being advised to expect delays the time needed for adjudication of individual cases will continue to be difficult to predict30 for example the government account ability office gao released study examining the length of time for scien ce student or scholar from foreign country to get visa31 gao found that dos is unable to easily identify the amount of time that it takes to process visas for science students or scholars and that the time it takes to adjudicate visa depends largely on wh ether the applicant has to undergo visa mantis check visa mantis is type of specialized clearance procedure known as the security advisory opinion sao used to sc reen visa applicants for employment or study that would give the foreign national access to controlled tec hnologies eg those that could be used to upgrade military capabilities32 gao examined random sample of visa mantis cases for science students or scholars sent from us consular posts between april and j une 2003 and found it took an average of 67 days for the security check to be processed in september 2003 gao visited posts in china india and russia and found many visas man tis cases that had been pending 60 days or more dos responded to the gao study and noted that backlog did occur in the summer of 2002 when dos mandated response33 to all sao requests including visa mantis checks that requirement combined with the sudden increase in requests for saos following the attack s of september 11 2001 overburdened the system dos contends new processes have solved many of the problems encountered during the startup period34httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32188crs9 35 personal interviews are generally required for foreign nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas interviews however may be waived in certain cases prior to the

limited the ability of consular officers to waive th personal appearance for nonimmigrant visa applicants35 have increased the wait time for an interview and may extend the visa processing time of students seeking to come to the united states other factors including the biometric visa program and st affing levels have also been cited as affecting visa processing times36 nonetheless dos has instructed all visa adjudicating posts to make special arrangements to facilitate visa interviews for students and researchers nd some posts reserve appoin tment slots for students or assign specific days to student processing
