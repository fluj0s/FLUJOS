community education and training providers eg community colleges and economic developm ent agencies two other dol training initiatives proposed during the bush ad ministration personal reemployment accounts and career advan cement accounts focus instead on workers they are addressed in ot her crs reports3 this report examines the presidents demanddriven initiatives for several reasons first the hgjti and cbjtg initiatives mark perhaps the first commitment of labor partment funds to development of an adequate supply of workers possessi ng indemand skills in sectors of the economy primarily select ed by dol similarly wired marks perhaps the first dol commitme nt of funds to assist regions in transforming their communities in order to compete globallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33811crs2 4 for example in the conference report hrept 109337 on the fy2005 labor health and human services hhs and education ppropriations bill the conferees directed dol to submit quarterly report on the hgjti with listing of all awards made during the quarter and for each award the grantee the am ount of the award the funding source of the award whether the award was made competitively or noncompetitively and if non competitively the justification the purpose of the award the number of workers to be trained and other expected outcomes 5 testimony of dol secretary elaine l chao in us congress house

2006second since may 2002 nearly 732 million has been awarded in grants for these three initiatives however limited information has been available on their exact nature and on the precise use of the funds such information is difficult to ascertain for number of reasons including the relatively brief existence of the initiatives the use of noncompetitive grants in awarding approximately 258 million in hgjti grants and the vagueness of some available information third the 109th congress expressed interest in the operation of the hgjti4 fourth the 14 hgjti sectors deemed important by dol

the administration began the hgjti in py2001 as pilot to prepare workers for jobs being created in high growth industries6 this initiative is administered by the business relations group brg di vision in etas office of workforce investment the brg 1 identifies highg rowth highdemand sectors 2 convenes one or more executive forums for each sector to offer leaders in business and industry opportunities to share their current and futu re labor needs with the public workforce system eg the system authorized under wia and 3 convenes solutions forum with representatives of industry the public workforce system educators and economic development officials to collectively verify the workforce challenges identified during executive forums and to devise solutions examples of the kinds of workforce challenges or problems identified through the forums include mismatch between the skills imparted to high school and college students and the skill requirements of employers new labor force entrants uninterested in seeking employment in the targeted sectors perhaps because they have negative image of particular sect ors or because these individuals may be unaware of the wide range of careers targeted sectors offer and the seeming dearth of new workers with uptodate skills wh ich requires industrie s undergoing rapid technological change to devote more of their resources to upgrading the skills of incumbent workers and also to take othe r measures aimed at retaining experienced staff to address these problems the brg refers proposed solutions outside the departments domain to other agencies id entifies solutions for which dol already has committed program funds nd awards grants to partnerships to undertake demonstration projects that reflect the remaining priority solutions7 two statutes provide the authority under which hgjti grants have been awarded the first is the workforce inve stment act wia p l 105220 title i the nations primary employment and job training legislation8 specifically awards have been made under the general author ity of section 171 demonstration pilot multiservice research and multistate projects the wia funds come from annual appropriations the second statute is th american competitiveness and workforce improvement act acwia of 1998 p l 105277 title iv 9 specifically section 428 of p l 108447 the fy2005 appropria tions act amended section 414c of acwia to authorize dol to make awards to partnerships of public and privatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33811crs7 10 while the hgjti is not specifically mentioned in either wia or acwia these statutes have provided the authority for funding the initiative in the dol budget justification fy2007 dol states on p tes113 that the acwia section 414c grants are consistent with and support the high growth job training initiative much of the information regarding the hgjti grants is found in administration documents such as solicitation for grant announcements fact sheets descriptions posted on dols website press releases and speeches rather than in legislation 11 program year begins on july 1 and ends on june 30 for example py2006 began july 1 2006 and will end june 30 2007 information in this report includes awards made as of dec 31 2006 12 information on the awards is taken from the dol database of the hgjti investment center at httpwwwdoletago vbrghgjtigrantees crs reviewed information from three dol online sources the hgjti investment center the hgjti publication library and press releases in some cases informa tion on the awards eg amount of an award name of grantee the number of awards made in given sector varied by source crs determined that the most authoritative source is the hgjti investment center information from which is supplemented by press releases as needed 13 the funding authority is generally specified when awards are made on competitive basis as discussed later in this report most of the hgjti grants were made noncompetitively 14 dol budget justification fy2007 p tes113 15 these fees are accounted for on fiscaly ear not programyear basis fy2005 began oct 1 2004 and ended sept 30 2005 the second quarter of

approximately 60 million could have been awarded with h1b fees as wellentities for job training for employment in highgrowth sectors10 funds for awards come from fees paid by employers who file petitions for h1b visas to bring into the country nonimmigrants to work in pr ofessional specia lity occupations between py2001 and py200611 150 awards totaling 2869 llion were made12 table 3 shows the distribution of grants across program years as shown in the table funding peaks in py2004 the same year in which funding from h1b fees was likely used to supplement wia monstration monies while the authority under which individual grants were made is not always clear13 dol in its fy2007 budget justification states that dol in itially used significant amount of wia discretionary resources to support the hgjti14 dol has also indicated that h1b fees it received beginning with the second quarter of fy200515 have been used to fund hgjti grants unde r acwia authority in section 414c16 based on this information and by crossreferencing each award date with the appropriate program and fiscal year crs estimates that wia wa s the funding source for all awards made in pys 20012003 see table 3 that wia continued to be the major source of funds in py2004 with perhaps appr oximately 28 or 254 million of the grants awarded in that year funded with h1b fees and th at the h1b fees possibly funded all of the awards in py2005 nd py200617 it is unclear under which of the two authorities funds were awarded when the year of the award is not specified for fy2006 dol estimated that 125 million would be available to fund hgjti grants and the wired initiative discussed later in this report h1b fees are permanently authorized and consequently could represent steady source of funding for hgjti

and biotechnol ogy grants was 10 million with an expected period of performance of up to 24 months the median award for the advanced manufacturing grants was 15 million with an expected period of performance of up to 36 months the difference in the median award amounts for the two sets of grants could be due to the difference in th eir duration grant expected to be used over 36 months may be higher than one exp ected to be used over 24 months nearly half of the noncompetitive grants 59 of 127 were awarde d amounts of 19 million or more greater than the largest am ount awarded for any competitive grant however because the actual period of pe rformance is not known for any of these grants conclusion can be made as to whether the noncompetitive grants are larger or smaller on permonth basis than any of the competitive grants the use of noncompetitive awards pr ovides particular challenges for congressional oversight and for anyone seeking to obtain specific information on many of the details of the grants in ddition to the expected period of performance another area generally addre ssed in an sga is cost sharing ie whether as requirement of receiving grant an pplicant must provide other funds whether received from federal or nonfederal source the sga for the competitive health care and biotechnology grants required match equivalent of at least 50 of

districts state community college systems or individual onestop career centers in partnership with their local workforce investment boards32 all of these entities except for individual community colleges or technical colleges had to specify one or more community colleges where all capacitybuilding and training activities would occur under the grant the sgas required all community college applicants to develop and implement combination of capacitybuilding and training activities in general training activities were to be provided by community or technical college and occur within the context of continuum of education and training that supports longterm career growth such as an articulated career ladder these activities were also to result in college credit or other

shown in table 6 fit the highgrowth criteria although dol gives leeway to applicants for cbjtgs to identify sectors at the local and regional level that differ from those the department has chosen for the hgjti the applicants still must base sector determinations on at least one of the highgrowth criteria listed above46 the 14 sectors that dol selected for th hgjti are mixture of industries and
