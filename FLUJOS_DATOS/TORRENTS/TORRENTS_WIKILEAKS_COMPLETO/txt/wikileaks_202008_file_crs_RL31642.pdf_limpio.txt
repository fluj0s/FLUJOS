level the telephone consumer protection act wh ich is enforced by the federal communications commission fcc and the telemarketing consumer fraud and abuse prevention act which is enforced by the federal trade commission ftc telephone consumer protection act of 1991 the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 directed the fede ral communications commission to initiate rulemaking proceeding concerning th need to protect residential telephone subscribers privacy rights to avoid r eceiving telephone solicitations to which they object1 the commission was to develop regu lations to implement the methods and procedures that the commission determines are most effective and efficient to accomplish the purposes of the act under the act the fcc could have blished single na tional database to compile list of telephone num bers of residential subscr ibers who object to receiving telephone solicitations nd to make that compiled list nd parts thereof available for purchase2 however the fcc initially chose to require businesses and persons engaged in the telephone solic itation industry to maintain individual donotcall lists rather than establishing single national list under recent revisions to the rules promulgated under pursuant to the telephone consumer protection act the fcc promulgated regulations to establish na tion wide donotcall registry consistent with regulations recently promulga ted by the federal trade commission the fccs initial rules re quired persons who initiate any telephone solicitation to residential telephone number to institu procedures for maintaining list of persons who do not wish to receive telephone solicitations made by or on behalf of that person or entity3 the rules also established minimum standards for maintenance of such lists including the establishment of written policy which is to be available on demand the training of personnel engaged in telephone solicitation the recording of donotcall requests and disclosure of the

telemarketing acts or practices6 the ftc was instructed to include in the rules requirement th at telemarketers may not undertake pattern of unsolicited telephone ca lls which the reasonable consumer would consider coercive or abusive of such consumers right to privacy7 in response to this directive the ft c promulgated the lemarketing sales rule8 under the original telemarketing sales rule it was an abusive telemarketing act or practice for seller to cause telemarketer to in itiate an outbound telephone call to person when that person previously has stated that he or she does not wish to receive an outbound telephone call made by or on behalf of the seller whose goods or services or being offered9 amendments recently promulgated by the federal trade commission include this original pr ohibition and also make it an abusive telemarketing act or prac tice to initiate any outbound lephone call to person who has placed his or her name andor lephone number on the donotcall registry maintained by the commission10 jurisdictional distinctions two sets of regulations are necessary to fully implement the donotcall registry due to jurisdictional distinctions between the federal trade commission and the fede ral communications commission the federal trade commission by statute doe s not have jurisdic tion over financial institutions or common carriers such as telephone companies11 this jurisdictional limitation means that the ftcs telemarketing rules cannot be enforced against these types of institutions the federal co mmunications commission however under the tcpa has much broader juri sdiction over telephone solicitations in general under the act telephone solic itations are defined to include any telephone call or message for the purpose of encouraging the purchase or rental of or inve stment in property goods or services which is transmitted to any person thus allowing the fcc to enforce its regulations against entities w ho make telephone solic itation calls but

included on the donotcall registry for example telemarketers will be allowed to place calls to persons from whom they have obtained the express agreement in writing of such person to place calls to that person and to persons with whom they have an established business relationship21 other exempt calls include calls in which the sale of goods or servi ces is not completed and many calls that are initiated by the consumer22 telemarketers calling to solicit charitable contributions will not be required to comply with provisions related to the national registry but they will be required to k eep companyspecific lists and honor consumer requests with regard to such lists23 in addition to the exceptions noted above the rule also includes safe harbor from liability whereby sellers or telemarketers will not be held liable for violations that result from error if they have complied with certain requirements set forth in the rule they may take advantage of the safe harbor by establishing procedures training personnel in those procedures and maintaining list of persons who have asked not to be called24 consumers will not be required to pay to have their numbers placed on the registry and consumers number will remain on the registry for five years or until the consumer asks to have his or he r number removed or changes phone numbers telemarketers will be required to

infra ftc authority to implement registry on september 23 2003 the united states district court for the western district of oklahoma held that the federal trade commission did not have the authority to promulgate national do notcall registry36 the court found that while c ongress had expressly granted the federal communications commission the aut hority to create donotcall registry37 such authority was not granted to the federal trade commission the ftc has the authority pursuant to the telemarketing and consumer fraud and abuse prevention act tcfap to prohibit deceptive and other abusive telemarketing acts or practices38 but according to the court this authority did not include the creation of the donotcall registry the court determined that congress ex press grant of authority to the fcc to promulgate donotcall registry together with the complete silence on the subject in the tcfap makes plain that congress has not given the ftc the authority that it seeks to exercise here39 the court rejected the ftcs argument that post promulgation appropriations gislation granted it the authority to establish the do notcall registry noting that such legisl ation did not unequivocally grant the ftc the authority under the tcfap to promulga donotcall registry but rather merely recognizes that the ftc has done so40httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31642crs7 40 continued 7 which

district of colorado remain first amendment concerns on september 25 2003 the united states district court for the distri ct of colorado issued an opi nion finding that the donot call registry as implemented by the ftc violated the first amendment to the united states constitution41 the court found that the ftc by exempting charitable solicitors from the amended rules donotca ll registry has imposed contentbased limitation on what the consumer may ban from his home42 the court took issue with the distinction made between calls made on behalf of ch aritable organizations and commercial calls nothing that pursuant to the ftcs rules calls from charitable organizations would still ring through to the consumer while commercial calls will not43 the court determined that the mechanism purportedly created by the ftc to effectuate consumer choice instead influences consumer choice thereby entangling the government in deciding wh at speech consumers should hear44 based upon the determination that the do notcall registry placed significant burden on commercial speech the court went on to apply the supreme courtshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31642crs8 45 see central hudson gas

california cal bus continuedcentral hudson test to determine whether the registry was constitutionally invalid45 in applying the central hudson test the court found that t he interest in preventing abusive telemarketing practices was sufficiently substantial to justify restriction on commercial speech46 however the court found that the donotcall registry did not materially advance this interest as required under central hudson because the registry creates burden on one type of speech based solely on its content without logical coherent reason supportin g the disparate treatment of different categories of speech47 on february 17 2004 the united states c ourt of appeals for the tenth circuit reversed the lower courts d ecision and held that the do notcall registry is valid commercial speech regulation because it directly advances the governments important interests in safeguarding pe rsonal privacy and reducing the danger of telemarketing abuse wit hout burdening an excessive amount of speech48 unlike the district court the court of appeals di d not find that the distinction between commercial telemarketing calls and those on behalf of charities made the list constitutionally invalid in fact the court used the limited applicability of the list as justification for upholding the regulations the court found that in applying the regulations only to commercial telemarketing calls the commission had narrowly tailored its restrictions on speech to address the governments stated interests in protecting privacy and protecting c onsumers from fraudulent and
