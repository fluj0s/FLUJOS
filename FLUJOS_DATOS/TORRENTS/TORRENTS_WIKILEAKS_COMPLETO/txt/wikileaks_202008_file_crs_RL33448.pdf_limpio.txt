likely explains the dollars recent strength most importantly the fast pace of us economic growth tax law changes increases in shortterm interest rate s by the fed and large pool of oil export earnings looking for safe resting place the dollar weakened slightly in late 2005 but during the first four months of 2006 it has not shown any real trend up or down the major currencies index has been flat and the broad index has appreciated slightly forecasting the path of the exchange rate for the rest of the year is highly problematic as the weight of economic fundamentals on the dollar can be easily count ered in the shortrun by sudden shifts in investor sentiment that are imperfectly understood cons ideration of the probable forces that have the potential to influence rate of return on dollar assets and the need to diversify out of dollar assets to minimize the risk of capital losses gives some overall sense of how the relative probabilities for appreciation versus depreciation stack up whether the dollar rises or falls in 2006 there will still be reasons for concern about the underlying health of and impendi ng risks to the united states and global economies from the unhealthy combination of deficient domestic saving in the united states and deficient domestic spe nding in the rest of the world the persistence of these large imbalances in to 2006 is very likely only postponing an inevitable day of reckoning the delay ma kes the job of adjustment not only more difficult but perhaps more risky for economic policy the task is how to assure an orderly correction of these imbalances that leaves all the i nvolved economies on sounder macroeconomic footings the most favorable economic outcome will result from coordinated policy actions to raise saving in the united st ates boost domestic demand in the euro area and japan and raise rates of domestic investment in the emerging economies of asia and the oil exporting economieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33448contents

httpwwwbepresscomwhy the dollar rose in 2005 and the prospect for 2006 insights into the state of international asset markets and the global economy introduction the dollar exchange rate rose substan tially in 2005 halting threeyear decline and moving counter to the expectations of many observers steady depreciation of the dollar from early 2002 through 2004 had brought the dollars value on real tradeweighted basis down about 30 against major currencies and about 15 against broader group of currencies1 it can be argued that such depreciation was the inevitable consequence of americas large trade deficit and the associated accumulation of foreign indebtedness but it was also necessary aspect of the process of correcting those huge imbalances and as some see it of mitigating the looming risk of economic crisis that they carry with them the growing concern at that time was not that the dollar would stop falling but that it might begin to fall too fast to allow for an orderly correction of those imbalances and given the pivotal role of the dollar and the us market in the global economy sharp fall of the dollar carries the risk of causing global recession2 in 2005 however the dollar changed course and slowly but steadily appreciated in value up 7 in the major currencies i ndex and about 23 in the broad index the appreciation was much more sizable ag ainst individual currencies up about 14 against the yen and 11 against the euro but it appreciated little or not at all againsthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33448crs2 3 the current account balance responds slowly to lower dollar it takes time for the volume of us exports to rise and the volume of u s imports to fall in response to the change in relative prices caused by the appreciation becaus depreciating exchange rates effect on the price of imports is more immediate the actual value of imports will rise for while therefore there will be tendency for the trade deficit to get bigger before it gets smaller after currency depreciation the currencies of china and several other asian economies that maintain their currencies at fixed rate to the dollar this appreciation occurred even as the us trade deficit and foreign debt climbed to record levels the path of the dollar is symptomatic of underlying economic forces that shape and propel us international transactions of singular importance in this regard is the waxing and waning of the worlds appetite for dollar denominated assets and the associated flow of funds on international cap ital markets closer look at the several forces that influence that appetite is revealing of not only the ups and downs of the dollar but also the forces behind the rge current account imbal ances in the world economy deficits in the united states and surpluses in other ma jor economies large asset market imbalances in the world ec onomy large stock of liabilities in the united states and large stock of dollar assets in the investment portfolios of foreigners and the prospects for an or derly or disorderly correction of those imbalances possible reasons for the dollars appreciation in 2005 the dollars exchange rate is not fixed by us policy rather like most other major currencies it moves flexibly w ith the forces of demand and supply in international foreign exchange markets these forces are ultimately derived from the purchase and sale of dollar denominated goods or assets goods ar of course things like wheat oil pharmaceuticals or aircraft while assets are things like stocks bonds and real property an increase in foreign demand for dollar denominated goods or assets also increases the demand in foreig n exchange markets for the dollars needed to buy those goods or assets and that tends to bid up the dollars foreign currency price conversely decreas in demand for dollar denomin ated goods or assets tends to push the dollars foreign currency price down for example the fall of the dollar over the 20022004 period was in part the result of weakening of the demand for dollar denominated assets by foreigners 3 the supply of dollars on foreign exchange markets is determined by the magnitude of the flow of dollars that americans are exchanging for foreign currency needed to purchase foreign goods and ssets for example in the same 20022004 period substantial increases in demand fo r both foreign goods and assets by us buyers also contributed to the weakening of the dollar at that time this also shows that the pressures on the dollar in the foreign exchange markets can arise from the investment decisions of both foreign and dom estic investors it is also true that economic policy while aimed at other economic goals can affect the demand andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33448crs3 4 triennial central bank sur vey foreign

strong dollar causes and consequences by craig k elwellsupply of us and foreign goods and asse ts and thereby indirectly affect the exchange rate asset markets including the markets for foreign exchange handle transactions at far greater volume and at much fa ster speed than the markets for goods and services in 2004 just the daily trading on the worlds foreign exchange markets was estimated to be in excess of 19 trillion w ith 90 of that trade in us dollars4 moreover this buying and selling of dollars and other assets is largely matter of near instantaneous electronic transfer with need for physical handling or transport therefore asset market events tend to play the dominant role in determining the path of the exchange rates of the dollar and other major currencies with assets in the mix it is possible to reconcile rising dollar with rising trade deficit because the upward push of the demand for dollar assets on the demand for dollars is greater than the downward push of the trade deficit on the supply of dollars in the foreign exchange market5 the strength of net capital inflows the difference between inflows and outflows from the rest of the world is fairly consistent predictor of the general path of the dollar for example during the period from 1996 to 2002 net capital inflows grew from about 150 billion to 570 billion and the dollar rose for the period from 2002 to 2004 net capital inflows flattened out and the do llar depreciated in 2005 net capital inflows grew strongly again reaching over 800 billi on and the dollar appreciated the direction and strength of internati onal asset market flows are subject to significant degree of uncertainty nevert heless several fact ors in 2005 could have contributed to change in domestic nd foreign investors calculation of the acceptable balance between rate of return and risk from holding dollar assets triggering an increased capital inflow and in conjunction bid up of the exchange value of the dollar the net effect emerges as the resolution of upward impulses that happened and potential downward impulses that did not happen strong economic growth the us economy has grown faster th an most other industrial economies particularly those in the euro area and japan for the 10 years ending in 2004 annual growth rate of real gdp in the us ec onomy averaged 33 this compares to an average rate of 23 in the euro area and 12 in japan for the 20032005 sub period the us economys growth advantag was maintained but there were some compositional changes as economic recovery in japan narrowed its gap with the united states while economic weakness in the euro area economies increased the us advantage over them in 2005 the year the dollar began to appreciate real gdphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33448crs4 6 data on economic growth rates taken from the oecd economic outlook 78 jan 2006 7 imf world economic outlook global imbalances in saving and investment perspective sept 2005 pp 100104growth in the united states was 36 comp ared to 14 and 24 in the euro area and japan respectively6 generally faster gr owing economy will genera more investment opportunities that offer higher rates of re turn than will slower growing economies as will be discussed higher rates of return can be the consequence of vigorous activity in the private marketplace but also the result of the configuration of government policy further rate of return advantages can be arrayed in various ways between longterm and shortte rm assets as well as between high risk and low risk assets the most ready measure of rate of return advantage is the relative levels of interest rates in 2005 there was signifi cant widening of the spread between short term interest rates in the united states relative to shortterm rates in the euro area economies and the japanese ec onomy from an average of 16 in 2004 us short term interest rates increased to around 35 while in the euro area economies short term rates moved up slightly from 21 in 2004 to 22 in 2005 in japan there was change with shortterm rates staying at 00 the spread on longterm interest rates in the united states relative to those in the euro area and japan also widened this was due exclusively to fall of long term rates in both the euro area and japan in 2005 in the us longterm rates averaging 43 were unchanged from 2004 but longterm rates in the euro area economie s fell from 41 to 34 and in japan from 15 to 14 thus while the attractivene ss of both longterm and shortterm us assets improved in 2005 the change was mo re significant for shortterm assets the rate of return advantage in the us economy is likely greater than the spread between market interest rates w ould suggest however study by the imf of rates of return to capital in the larg industrial economies and the developing economies for the decade 19942003 found the rate of return in the united states was about 86 as compared with g7 averag of about 24 and an emerging market average of about minus 477 given that the us ec onomys rate of growth has accelerated since 2003 and acceler ated faster than other advanced economies this large advantage likely still exists but it is not possible to say that there was sufficient variation in this rate of return advantage to explain weakening of foreign demand for dollar assets in the 20022004 period followed by strengthening of that demand in 2005 data on private nongovernment foreign purchases of us assets in 2005 show substantial increase over 2004 calculated on net basis outflows minus inflows private capital inflows in 2005 were n early 570 billion up from about 186 billion in 2004 major portion of the increase in private investment inflows was

asset flows taken from the us partment of commerce bureau of economic analysis us international transactions in 2005 mar 2006 10 crs report rl32652 the 2004 corporate tax and fsceti bill the american jobs creation act of 2004 by david l brumbaugh billion swing in inflows for direct investment 8 in 2004 this category had 145 billion net outflow more outbound direct i nvestment than inbound pattern that had been intensifying since 2002 in cont rast in 2005 net direct investment had an inflow more inbound than outbound of 108 billion representing change of more than 250 billion this shift in direct investment flows is outwardly consistent with the notion that faster relative growth attracts capital but as discussed in the next section special factor may explain large part of 2005s di rect investment shift other categories of capital inflows comprising what is usually called portfolio investment unaffected by tax law changes and more shortterm in nature also increased substantially to net inflow of 494 billion up from 374 billi on in 2004 this acceleration of portfolio investment may certainly have been pulled into the united states by the lure of higher rates of return but as discussed in latter secti ons of the report there were also forces that likely pushed foreign investors funds towards dollar assets regardless of the growth performan ce and level of rate of return9 tax incentives large share of the 250 billion shift in direct investment inflows discussed above was likely caused by us companies moving reinvested earnings to the united states from abroad to take advantage of the significant tax incentives provided by the american jobs creation act of 200410 this explanation gains credence when we observe that nearly all of the net change in direct investment flows was caused by reduction of us investors direct investment outflows from 252 billion in 2004 down to only 21 billion in 2005 foreign direct invest inflows to the united states increased only 27 billion in 2005 if it was only matter of superior growth performance prompting the shift of net dir ect investment flows the change would likely be more evenly split between domestic and foreign investor this tax incentive was only available in 2005 so its effect on international inve stment flows will be limited to that year also because this ch ange is likely to be largely matter of shifting accounting entries for most multinational corporations it would not have much of an effect on the dollars exchange rate further tightening of monetary policy the federal reserve continued to raise shortterm interest rates in 2005 by may 2006 there had been 16 straight rate increases over 19 months causing the federal funds rate to rise from 10 to 475 as discusse d earlier the average levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33448crs6 11 the federal reserve board testimony of chairman ben s bernanke before the committee on financial services us house of representatives feb 15 2006 12 us department of commerce bureau of economic analysis survey of current business april 2006of us shortterm interest rates in creased from 16 in 2004 to 35 in 2005 and this was also an increase relative to foreign shortterm interest rates the federal reserves intention is to use monetary policy to slowly tighten the reins on aggregate spending through higher borrowing costs nd thereby forestall an acceleration of the rate of inflation as the economic expansion proceeds11 however higher interest rates will other things equal also tend to increase the attractiveness of dollar assets to foreign investors and bid up the dollars exchange rate this will have its strongest effect on the foreign purchases of shortte rm investments par ticularly of highly liquid us treasury secur ities in 2005 foreign purchases of treasury securities increased to record 196 billion up from 107 billion in 2004 decreased personal and public saving the personal saving rate in the united states has been very low in recent years fluctuating narrowly between 13 and 18 of gdp from 1999 to 2004 the decline of the personal savi ng rate since 1999 has been an important reason for the united states having to attract large inflows of foreign capital ie foreign saving to help fund domestic inves tment and therefore sour ce of upward pressure on the dollar exchange rate in 2005 however th personal saving rate fell even lower descending to negative rates through most of 2005 particul arly sharp reduction in personal saving occurred in the third qua rter with the saving rate falling to 13 of gdp12 that represented decrement to national saving of nearly 120 billion from the second to third quarter of 2005 negative saving rate means that households were digging into past saving to pay for their current expenditures also in the second half of 2005 the g overnment saving rate or more accurately the government dissaving rate ie nega tive saving rate caused by federal budget deficits deteriorated at quarterly rate from 04 to 08 of gdp that translates to decrement to national savi ng of about 60 billion in the second half of 2005 other things equal substantial reduc tion in theses two sources of national saving would decrease the pool of saving available to the economy for financing domestic investment put upw ard pressure on domestic interest rates raise the attractiveness of dollar assets and exert upw ard pressure on the exchange rate other things were not equal however for at the same time that there was an intensification of personal and government dissaving there was an offsetting increase in business saving business saving is composed of undistributed business profits so despite two significant negative impulses the overall national saving rate did not decline in 2005 at 135 of gdp the overa ll rate of nationa l saving was slightly above the 134 rate recorded in 2004 and 2003 for comparison the overall national savinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33448crs7 13 crs

1995 rose to high of 18 in 1999 and has steadily fallen since then13 therefore despite some signifi cant negative impulses it could not be concluded that fall of the na tional saving itself contributed to the rise of the dollar in 2005 what can not be determined is if the fall in the pe rsonal and government saving rates might have chan ged investor expectations bout the future path interest rates and the dollar itself causing some speculative capital inflows and upward pressure on the dollar what is known however is that the rate of gross national investment increased to 197 of gdp from 19 in 2004 meaning that with the savi ng rate essentially unchanged from 2004 bridging the bigger gap between the domestic saving available to fund investment and the level of inve stment undertaken required the inflow of foreign capital to increase to 63 of gdp in 2005 from 56 of gdp in 2004 greater capital inflow puts greater upward pressure on the dollar exchange rate this is really just another way of looking at the process discussed in the earlier section on economic growth reform of japanese postal saving system since october 1 2005 it has been possible fo r japanese savers to buy shares of mutual funds at their post office the posta l saving system is th principal financial institution for most japanese households and it has accumulate d about 3 trillion in assets making it the world s largest bank prior to last years reform japanese households were limited to accumulatin g relatively lowyielding japanese government bonds14 with more lucrative alternatives now available large diversification of perhaps as much as 1 trillion out of the current holdings of largely lowyielding japanese government bonds is expected even with significant homebias it is unlikely that japanese sset markets can offer enoug h sufficiently profitable investment options to absorb anything cl ose to the amount of funds likely to flow from this diversification therefore big share of these funds is expected to flow toward higher yielding foreign assets initial sales are reported to have favored foreign bond funds any such portfolio dive rsification of foreign investors out of nondollar assets can be seen as force tending to push foreign capital towards the large wellfunctioning dollar asset markets purchases of dollar assets are likely substan tial component of the ongoing diversification of japanese households asset portfolio for two reasons first as already discussed above dolla r assets have historically offered steady highrisk adjusted return that makes them more attractive than assets denominated in other easily convertable currencies such as th pound yen or euro second the large sizehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33448crs8 15 john makin japan moves toward

market allows it to easily accommodate large investment inflows as well as offer ready market for any future sale of those investments the precise magnitude of effect on the dollar exchange rate in 2005 of investment inflows from japanese postal saving funds is not known and the time period during which this flow of japanese funds could have occurred in 2005 was only three months nevertheless it seems likely that this was the source of some upward pressure on the dollar in late 200515 rising petroleum export earning because the international oil market does business largely in dollars rising prices translate into rising demand fo r dollars this boost in demand was large the imf estimates that the currentaccount surpluses of oil exporters may have increased nearly 440 billion in 2005 an outfl ow of finds more than four times the size of that in 200216 these funds are not being spent immediately on goods and services but saved therefore they are be ing placed in some type of asset most likely one denominated in readily conver tible currency that also offers good return low risk and easy access17 this is another instance of foreign portfolio diversification out of nondollar assets that tends to push foreign capital towards the large well functioning dollar asset markets as discussed in the previous secti on only the large pound yen euro and dollar asset markets can easily accommodate trans actions on this scale and at the same time offer the investor the high degree of liquidity if these oil exporters chose to swap their dollar earnings for other hard cu rrencies it would have exerted substantial downward pressure on the dollar but th superior performance of the american economy means that the dollar market is also offering the investor higher return and lower risk than in the other hard currencie s because these purchases are often made through third parties the fl ow of earnings into dollar assets is difficult to measure but most experts believe the bulk of theses flows are into dollar assets this is consistent with the increase of private fo reign purchases of us treasury securities and nontreasury securities asse ts in 2005 cited above give n that high energy prices are most likely going to continue for some upward pressure on the dollar exchange rate can be expected to continue as well foreign central banks slow ccumulation of dollar assets telling aspect of international tran sactions for dollar assets in 2002 2003 and 2004 was unusually rge and accelerating purchases of dollar assets primarily of liquid us treasury securities by fore ign central banks foreign central bank official holdings of us securities increased by about 673 billion over that three year period the total accumulation of offi cial holdings in this period across the major hard currency assets yen dollar euro pound was 16 trillion for thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33448crs9 18 see crs report rl33274 financing the us trade deficit by james k jackson 19 any increase in the central banks holdings of assets increases the money supply which in some circumstances might cause an accelera tion of inflation to nullify this potential inflationary effect of asset purchases centr banks sometimes carry out equal sized but offsetting transactions in domestic assets th at leave the central banks total asset holding unchanged this is called sterilized foreign exchange intervention the capacity for successful sterilization is limited by the stock of domestic assets and the tendency in less developed financial systems for reserv inflows to leak into the economyunited states the scale of the foreign cen tral bank accumulation of dollar reserves concurrent with greatly reduced private fore ign purchases of us assets led to the unusual condition of official purchases ex ceeding private purchases by more than 200 billion on net basis such substantia l official purchases certainly countered the forces pushing the dollar exchange ra down in this period not stopping that process but doubtless slowing it18 for many observe rs in 2005 th unpr ecedented scale of the build up over the previous three years of official holdings by foreign central banks was unlikely to continue for much longer several factors suggested sizeable and imminent selloff of dollar assets by foreign central banks one the prospect of further dollar depreciation would mean large loss of earnings on these holdings two central banks would move to forestall the rising risk of inflation associated with such massive accumulations of official holdings19 three in response to mounting political pressure many thought china w ould let its currency appreciate relative to the dollar therefore there was concern that sizable movement out of dollars by central banks coming on top of the ongoing weakening of demand by private buyers could trigger dollar collapse that could send recessionary ripples across the world economy during 2005 however foreign central banks did not undertake large scale sell off of dollar assets japans central bank af ter several years of large scale purchases stopped accumulating dollar reserves in 2005 but it did not selloff its existing holdings other asian central banks particularly chinas continued to amass dollar reserves in 2005 however the pace of accumulation on net basis by all sources slowed the increase in 2005 totaled 235 billion as compared with 399 billion gain in 2004 this brought the total worldw ide official holdings of dollar assets to about 900 billion one would conclude the n that earlier upward pressure on the dollar from these central bank activities ab ated in 2005 but there was not the overt downward pressure from mass central ba nk selloff that many had anticipated as discussed in later section siza ble share of the accumulation of dollar assets by foreign central banks since 2002 has been the resu lt of some countries trying to stabilize or fix the value of their currency relative to falling dollar this introduces degree of interdependence between the dollars path and the rate of accumulation of dollar reserves for with the dollar rising for other reasons in 2005 fewer reserves needed to be accumulated to achieve the currency stabilization goal some diversification of foreign official holdings did occur but it is interesting to observe that significant portion of it was across classes of dollar assets ratherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33448crs10 20 federal reserve board h41 statistical release various issues wwwfederalreservegov 21 international monetary fund revised imf annual report

ponsored enterprises gses and agency bonds out of recorded increase of fore ign official holdings in 2005 of about 184 billion 38 billion was of treasury secur ities and 146 billion was of gses and federal agency bonds this is in sharp contrast to 2004 when foreign central banks purchased 205 billion in treasury secur ities and 66 billion in federal agency bonds20 presumably the higher yield on fede ral agency bonds offsets some of the risk of holding dollar assets reasons for having larg official holdings official holdings are used for two purposes one to afford country fficient international liquidity to finance shortrun trade deficits and weather periodic currency crises and two to stabilize countrys exchange rate the liquidity f unction is usually only important to emerging economies that do not have readily convertible currency or ready access to international capital markets on favorable terms the asian financial crisis of the late 1990s showed emerging economies that normous liquidity balances are necessary to weather currency crisis and since then they have accumulated enormous official holdings of foreign exchange reserves21 the currency stabilization function has been particularly important motive for the accumulation of foreign exchange re serves during the 20022004 period by the central banks of japan china taiwan korea and india the central banks of japan and china undertook particul arly enormous accumulations of foreign exchange reserves in this period373 billion and 323 billion respectively the individual accumulations of taiwan korea and indi were far smaller nonetheless their collective reserve growth was more th an 200 billion for comparison in 2004 the far larger us economys offi cial reserves increased less than 3 billion bringing its total stock official reserves to only 190 billion22 there are data to gauge what portion of these total reserve accumulations of the central banks are of dollar assets ho wever since in each instance the focus was primarily to fix or control their currencys value relative to the dollar so as to maintain competitive price of their exports in the american market very large share of these official holdings was likely of dollar assets most often us treasury securities worldwide official holding s of dollar assets increased 415 billion between 2002 and

currencies index has been flat and the broad index has appreciated slightly forecasting the path of the exchange rate for the rest of the year is highly problematic as the weight of economic fundamentals on the dollar can be easily countered in the shortrun by sudden shifts in investor sentiment that are imperfectly understood what will be done here is to lay out the probable disposition of forces that will have the potential to influence the two key investor motives for holding dollar assets the incentive to earn high rate of return and the need to diversify to minimize the risk of capital losses from holding too many assets in any particular currency considering this array of potential forces will at least give some overall sense of how the relative probabilities for appreciation versus depreciation stack up in 2006 the prospect of high riskadjus ted return will likel continue to make dollar assets attractive to foreign investors economic growth in the united states accelerated to 53 in the first quarter of 2006 and is generally projected to outpace of other major economies this year faster growth usually translates into higher corporate earnings and higher investment re turns that attract foreign capital inflows and tends to push up the dollar exchange rate telling evidence in this regard is that longterm interest rates have risen in late 2005 and early 2006 the yield on inflation adjusted 10year treasury securities has rise n nearly half percentage point during the sixmonth period ending in march 2006 one important uncertainty about rela tive economic performance of other hard currency economies is whether japan after long period of feeble growth will continue the improvement in economic performance evident in 2005 japans growth is still likely to fall well short of that in the united states but the ability to have strung together two years of reasonable growth and the common forecast of healthy growth in 2006 may persuade some japa nese investors th at japans economic performance will continue to be good and pe rsuade japanese inve stors to move into domestic assets rather than into dollar assets also the euro area economies are expected to pick up the pace of growth in 2006 which is an imp rovement relative to lackluster performance in 2005 and w ill likely still lag well behind the pace of growth in the united states the onetime tax incentives that put upw ard pressure on the dollar in 2005 will be absent in 2006 however probable tinuation of us monetary and fiscal policies that combine large federal budget deficits with steady tightening of monetary policy would tend to push up u s interest rates and add to the attractiveness of dolla r assets in 2006 in late apr il however comments by the fed chairman ben bernake suggested that the feds policy of monetary tightening might be ending the importance of mone tary policy for the nearterm behavior of the dollar was made clear by some investors quickly selling dollar assets and causing fall of the dollar in some markets appare ntly in response to the mere suggestion of policy change httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33448crs12 outsized portfolio diversification from some sources toward dollar assets in 2006 seems probable first it is likely in 2006 that goodly share of portfolio diversification out of yen assets held by the japanese postal saving system will be toward dollar assets this is apt to occur on greater scale in 2006 than in 2005 second the prospect of furt her increases in petroleum prices will likely lead to further large portfolio diversification towards dollar assets by oil exporting nations as discussed above both the great size and efficiency of us asset markets as well as advantages in rate of return will tend to draw in these funds yet the incentive for private investors in general to diversify out of dollar assets seems also very big many experts argue that the us current account deficit is too large to be sustainable and that the dollars exchange rate would have to fall by at least 30 to shrink the trade deficit from its current level of 7 of gdp to sustainable level near 3 of gdp dolla r depreciation of that magnitude would easily swamp the interest rate differences that currently favor dollar assets meaning that holders of those assets would see the potential earnings from those investments quickly wither away while the attractiveness of assets denominated in appreciating currencies increase this prospect would seem to be compelling reason for profit sensitive investors to move out of dollar assets and into euro or yen assets this is all the more compelling if growth in th economies seems to be closing the gap with that in the united states the invest or sensitivity to this prospect is evidenced by the shortterm weakening of the dollar that often follows release of official statistics showing the us trade deficit continuing to grow whether the central banks of countries actively using foreign exchange reserves to fix or stabilize their currencies relative to the dollar will continue to amass dollar reserves probably hinges on the direction of the several market fo rces just discussed and on whether china remains committed to maintaining its fixed parity with the dollar it may be that china sees the fixed parity as critical anchor that contributes to the economic stability needed to attract longterm foreign investment and sustain the rapid pace of economic growth needed to continue the still formidable task of absorbing chinas huge labor force into the industrial sector if it does it will accumulate dollar assets as necessary to counter downward pressure on the dollar relative to the yuan on the other hand if the dollar is subject to upward pressure maintaining the fixed parity would call for the sale of dollar assets other asian economies trying to maintain the dollar competitiveness of their exports relative to chinas in the us market will likely buy or sell dollar assets in step with china what is difficult to assess is the extent to which liquidity needs distinct from that of currency stabilizati on will influence the holding of dollar reserves by the central bank of china while chinas current reserves are large it is also true that china is under considerable international political pressu re to open up its financial markets and make the yuan flexible conve rtible currency huge stock of foreign exchange reserves holdings may be seen as necessary to make the passage through this potentially very stormy transition it also seems unlikely that the bank of japan the worlds largest foreign holder of dollar assets would undertake any large selling off of those assets at this time japans tenuous current economic expansion is very likely tied to the growth of net exports and therefore it seems unlikely th at japans central bank would dump dollarhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33448crs13 assets causing the yen to appreciate and thereby eroding competitiveness of japanese products in the us market in world awash in dollar assets many offering only modest rateofreturn advantage over alternatives in other hard currencies and with the looming prospect that at some point large deprecation of the dollar will be necessary to correct the united states huge current account imbalance prudent foreign i nvestors might try to get ahead of impending earnings and capital losses on their dollar investments that large dollar depreciation would cause and di versify out of dollar assets that this has not occurred so far may speak to sign ificant degree of investor myopia and the risk of an all too abrupt clearing of vision down the road conclusion whether the dollar rises or falls in 2006 there will still be reasons for concern about the underlying health of and impendi ng risks to the us and global economies the perils of current account and asset market imbalances rising dollar in 2006 would certainly speak to the seeming limitless capacity of the us economy to attract still larger inflow of foreign inve stment ie foreign saving despite an already large stock of indebtedness to foreigners that attractiveness however is relative contingent not only on us economic performance but also that in the rest of the world maintaining these imbalances at the cu rrent scale or larger can occur only through what many economists see as continuation of the unhealthy combination of deficient domestic saving in the united states and deficient domestic spending in much of the rest of the world the pers istence of these large imbalances into 2006 is very likely only postponing the inevitabl day of reckoning this delay arguably makes the job of adjustment not only more difficult but more risky at some point it seems inevitable that international asset markets will force some correction of these international imbalances capital inflows to the united states will abate and the dollar will depreciate this adjustment will most likely be orderly and without crisis the us experience with adjustment from current account and financial market imbalances in the 19861990 period shows that the process can be orderly however while occurring without crisis such correction happening without policy changes in the ited states and abroad will not likely be on the best terms for deficit and surplus economies alike falling dollar in 2006 that is propelled by an ebbing of foreign capital inflows to the united states would act to reduce the nations large trade deficit as depreciating currency works to boost us exports sales and dampen the purchase of imports but if this is occurring in an economy that has done nothing to boost its low saving rate then interest rates will tend to rise forcing reduction in domestic investment spending to rate consistent with the smaller flow of saving available to the economy less investment would ultima tely lead to slower economic growthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33448crs14 23 for discussion of the effects of adjusting to smaller capital inflow and smaller trade deficit see crs report rl33186 is the us current account deficit sustainable by marc labonteconversely if the diminished outflow of saving from foreign economies occurs without commensurate increase in domestic demand in those economies then the accompanying slowdown in their net ex ports would dampen nearterm economic growth presumably falling interest rates and appreciating exchange rate would provide an offsetting stimulus to their domestic consumption and investment but because the adjustment speeds of netexports and domestic spending may differ there is risk of economic contraction in th shortrun given that these economies use increased net exports to the united states as major engine for economic growth this shortrun economic s hock could be substantial23 problem with asset markets although asset market trade offers opportunities to raise overall economic efficiency and imp rove the economic welfare of borrower and lender alike trade in assets is prone to occasional mistakes the resolution of which can lead to crisis nd collapse the negative repercussions of such collapse could extend beyond the asset market to the wider economy the essential weakness of sset markets is that assets are claim on stream of earnings over time and the future is always uncertain this can mean that relatively small changes in i nvestors beliefs about that future could have large effects on the value of the asset this tends to make these markets much more volatile than goods markets where value is far less contingent on the uncertainties of the future add to this the ofte n observed tendency for herdlike behavior among investors particularly those fo cused on the shortrun and the volatility in asset markets can grow larger then add in leveraged purchases the inherent weakness of modern fractionalreserve banki ng exchange rate risk and the usual problems of distance ie di fferent language law and business practices and the potential for volatility and crisis becomes even larger in the current context disorderly adjustment to the worlds current account imbalances could be precipitated by large decline in market preferences for dollar assets that pushes the dollar down sharply in the united states this would cause spiking of longterm interest rates and rapidly falling asset prices that would combine to slow spending by households and busin ess the weaker dollar does provide stimulus to us export sales but in the pe ssimistic scenario this is not large enough or soon enough to prevent recession in the surplus countries most of whom rely heavily on export sales to propel their economies sharp appreciation of their currencies would induce recession there as well in contrast to the orderly adjustment in the 19861990 period four factors make similar achievement more difficult now one oil prices were falling sharply in the late 1980s but now oil prices are rising sh arply this would add to the inflation impact of falling exchange rate and hamp er the federal reserves ability to counter the interest rate spike two in th 19861990 episode other economies central banks particularly japans were willing to buy large volume of dollar assets providing stabilizing counter force to th falling dollar and the rising yen givenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33448crs15 the already huge stocks of dollar assets being held abroad this action seems improbable today three in the 19861990 period europe the strongest market for us exports was booming today economic growth in europe is weak four the size of the imbalance is twice as large now disorderly adjustment and crisis are not the most probable outcome but it is risk that likely grows with the scale of the international imbalances there is settled opinion about how to be st manage asset markets but it seems likely that removing any large scale imbalances in asset markets would also limit the potential for economic harm nd therefore would be reasonable policy goal policy implications as this report hopefully makes clear the dollars exchange rate is not an appropriate direct target for us economic policy because it is only symptom of more fundamental economic fo rces particularly those th at influence the demand for and supply of assets in the international market place currently an examination of those forces highlights the large and potentially destabilizing imbalance in the global economy in the united states persistent large trade deficits and the accumulation of foreign debt and in the rest of the wo rld large trade surpluses weak domestic demand and the accumulation of dollar denominated assets most economists would argue that this is condition that carries more than negligible risk of generating financial instability and global recession program for an orderly correction of global imbalances for economic policy the task is how to assure an orderly correction of these imbalances that leaves all the involved economies on sounder macroeconomic footing recent imf study of current global economic imbalances reached conclusions that are generally consistent with mainstream economic thinking on this topic that study suggested coordinated inte rnational policy response the essential elements of which are as follows for the united states to raise its national saving rate how to increase the personal saving rate remains problematic so higher national saving would likely requi re an increase in public saving through shift of the federal budget from deficit to surplus for japan and europe to generate faster economic growth propelled primarily by domes tic demand rather then net exports for asia excluding japan nd china and the oilexporting economies recovery of spending on domestic investment is called for many would add to this agenda the need for china to allow its currency to appreciate and for that economy to channe l more of its large saving pool into domestic investment at present it can be argued china by accumulating short term reserves to maintain an underval ued exchange rate is running neo mercantilist policy that allows it to run large trade surplus to generate demand for its products and also have large net infl ow of longterm capital to help propel itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33448crs16 economic development for an economy of chinas size this not likely to be sustainable process from the viewpoint of its trading partners if it needs the inflow of long term capital it should allow the real transfer of those resources by running trade deficit or be prepared to use more of its own saving to support domestic investment rather than transfer that saving to the rest or the world from the standpoint of mainstream ec onomics this program would in the end provide better chance of establishing more healthy macroeconomic foundation for the united states and the global economies at once minimizing the prospect for global economic crisis and pr omoting sustainable and vigorous longterm growth
