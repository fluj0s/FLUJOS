employ an alien who is not authorized to be so employed today ices worksite enforcement program is focused primarily on cases that involve critical infrastructure facilities and cases involving employers who commit egregious violations of criminal statutes and engage in worker exploitation employers who violate ina prohibitions on the unlaw ful employment of aliens may be subject to civil monetary penalties andor criminal penalties criminal investigations may result in defendants being charged with crimes beyond unlawful employment and being subject to the relevant penalties for those violations various measures are available to examine the performance of ices worksite enforcement program they include final orders for civil monetary penalties administrative fines administrative arrests criminal arrests criminal indictments and convictions and criminal fines and forfeitures in recent years ice has generally focused less on administrative fines and more on administrative and criminal arrests criminal prosecutions and criminal fines and forfeitures the data presented here show increases in these latter measures in recent years at the same time however when considered in terms of the estimated size of the unauthorized workforce or the potential number of employers employing these wo rkers in violation of the law ices worksite enforcement program can seem quite small

while this oneyear change is not statistically significant and thus conclusions can be drawn about whether the unauthorized alien population is in fact shrinking many do believe that the unauthorized alien population has started decreasing for example report by the center for immigration studies cis states based on an analysis of data through may 2008 that the illegal immigrant population may have declined by over one million in the last year4 if such decline has in fact occurred contributing factors may include enforcement activity as well as the current economic downturn regardless of whether or not the unauthorized alien population is decreasing this population remains sizeable it is widely believed that most unauthorized aliens enter and remain in the united states in order to work while the most recent dhs and pew hisp anic center estimates did not include estimates of the unauthorized alien workforce the center has provided such worker estimates in the past according to the center

worksite enforcement has been the job of us immigration and customs enforcement ice of the department of homeland security dhs since march 20039 worksite enforcement is one component of ices responsibility to enforce federal immigration laws within the united states known as interior enforcement employers violating the ina 274a prohibitions on unlawful employment may be subject to civil andor criminal penalties the federal governments approach to immigrationrelated worksite enforcement has changed over the years in 1999 for example the immigration and naturalization service ins unveiled new interior enforcement strategy which as explained by an ins official at the time gave priority in the area of worksite enforcement to two types of cases 1 criminal employer cases in which there was pattern or practice of knowingly employing unauthorized workers and 2 cases of employers who abused their workers and who violated multiple laws 10 in the aftermath of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks interior enforcement priorities again shifted resources were redirected from traditional program areas including worksite enforcement to national securityrelated investigations and the primary focus of worksite enforcement became removal of unauthorized workers from critical infrastructure facilities such as airports and military bases 11 homeland security remains paramount concern of ices worksite enforcement program today as described by ice the worksite enforcement units mission encompasses enforcement activities intended to mitigate the risk of terrorist attacks posed by unauthorized workers employed in secure areas of our nations critical infrastructure in order to fulfill this mission ice special agents apply risk assessment principles to their critical infrastructure and worksite enforcement cases in order to maximize the impact of our limited resources against the most significant threats and violators 12 according to ice its worksite enforcemen t program also targets employers who commit egregious violations of criminal statutes and engage in worker exploitation 8 for information and related legislation on everify see crs report rl34204

delving into questions of work authorization as reported in 2007 paper by georgetown universitys institute for the study of international migration isim labor investigators express concern that their increased involvement in employer sanctions might impede their ability to gain the trust of illegal aliens who may be the victims of labor violations and potential witnesses against employers 27 memorandum of understanding between dol and dhs that has been in effect since 199828 describes the respective enforcement roles and responsibilities of each agency under the 1998 mou whd investigators are to inspect empl oyer compliance with i9 requirements in conjunction with labor standards enforcement only in directed investigations that is investigations not based on complaints according to the mou this limitation is intended and will be implemented so as to avoid discouraging complaints from unauthorized workers who may be victims of labor standards violations by their employer during these compliance inspections whd investigators are not to make inquiries about workers immigration status and are not to issue warning notices or notices of intent to fine all suspected serious violations uncovered by whd during these investigations are to be promptly referred to dhs while dols direct role in immigrationrelated worksite enforcement is quite limited some maintain that the agency helps reduce unauthorized employment indirectly through its enforcement of labor laws this argument is premised on the belief that many employers who employ unauthorized aliens also violate labor laws the

labor according to the paper such employers may pay salaries in cash failing to pay their share of social security taxes and they may seek unauthorized workers because they are less likely to complain about ill treatment29 thus with respect to unauthorized employment enforcement of minimum wage overtime and other statutory requirements may serve as means of reducing the economic incentives to hire unauthorized workers and thus result in decreased demand for these workers in new york times article about worker centers that assist immigrants mark krikorian of cis explained this argument as follows the worker centers help people stiffed out of their wages that can serve purpose because it raises the price of hiring illegal aliens and the more it costs to hire illegal aliens the more employers might turn to legal workers 30 others such as former whd administrator maria echaveste however point out the limitations of using labor law enforcement to address unauthorized employment they argue that many employers who hire unauthorized immigrants do not violate wage and hour laws according to echaveste i know firsthand that many employers who comply with other labor standards still hire the undocumented many businesses pay the minimu m wage and have barely tolerable working conditions because there are sufficient undocumented workers willing to accept those terms if we care about lowincome workers in this c ountry we need to create pressure to improve their economic condition by reducing the supply of unauthorized workers31 to the extent that some employers of unauthorized aliens violate labor standards whds compliance activities in lowwage industries may be particularly relevant to efforts to reduce unauthorized employment in fy2007 whd devoted most 40 of its enforcement resources to investigations in the nine lowwage industries in table 6 there is significant overlap between these industries and those listed in table 1 as having high concentrations of unauthorized workers for example both tables include restaurantsfood services agriculture hotels and motelsaccommodations and garmentapparel manufacturing this overlap suggests that whds enforcement activities may affect employers of unauthorized workers in fy2007 as indicated in table 6 whd collected 527 million in back wages for flsa overtime and minimum wage violations for 86560 workers top
