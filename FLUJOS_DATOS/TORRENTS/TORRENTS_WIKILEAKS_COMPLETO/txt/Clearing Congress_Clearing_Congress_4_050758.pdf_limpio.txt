the clearing congress lectures shoreham hotel washington dc prerequisites to auditing lecture given on 5 july l958 what did they do where are you at with the upper indocs let ask this question today has anybody arrived yet at the congress laughing very good very good well todays lectures are dry uninteresting extremely old hardly anything in them that you wantto know so pay attention laugh today weve by the way heard from some more countries you know this is country weve very often slighted little bit you know because its so close next door but thats canada and weve heard from our old friend johan templehoff up in toronto i know this will be the best congress until the next one good listening you know scientology is occupies the most space on this earth than practically anything were certainly occupying more space than several other things we are in countries that havent even heard of christianity thats pretty good were also were also to be found i heard recently inside the iron curtain some fellows telling that this situation and iwanted to know which side was inside garbled laugh well i promised you here in these early lectures that we were going to review this subject called scientology take look at it and find out what are the essential parts that we had to have in order to clear people and im going to sail into it right now and talk about just that its very good thing to summat importances one of the first things you must know in the development of anything is that importance the evaluation of datum in comparison with other data is more important than an ocean of data i hear every once in while somebody saying that some student he studied it he just got all swamped with data and so on well ill tell you whats wrong with that student he couldnt evaluate importances be ontime at nine oclock at the academy very important datum always run process so long as it produces change and longer obviously of equal importance arent they actually the first one is slightly more important because nibs said it laughing the whole trick of developing an adequate and workable and practical science of life was connected with this evaluation of importances i might let you in on little secret one of the things one of the operating principles many of the operating principles by the way are in dianetics evolution of science and weve never seen them since but they are still standing there as operating principles behind the organization of this particular subject but i took such blocks of knowledge such wide blocks of knowledge as religion let us say yogaand examined it to find out whether or not it ever done anybody any good and determinedclearing course lectures 5758 4 prerequisites to auditing2 whether or not it had or hadnt as i viewed it and then set the whole block of knowledge aside and further examination was given to it in this way i could weed out all the pieces of knowledge that hadnt gotten man anywhere and then this left very few this left very few it left such things as mathematics and the physical sciences as apparently something had done something for him but not too much so this established proper pattern of thinkingness in order to go about the development of the science now i assure you if yoga had worked everything out very beautifully and if we had very nice result we would have used mystic pattern of thinkingness but it hadnt apparently worked now that is what is meant by evaluation of importance what were the important bodies of data into which one could look i found out before id been on the road very long that even mathematics and the natural sciences werent legitimate areas of examination i found out there were some much more legitimate areas life laugh it never occurred to anybody to look there before everybody had been studying this subject of livingness you see on great many vias and it never occurred to them to look at the guy and it never occurred to them that mind was visible and it is it might not be to the practitioner but its certainly visible to the person he can see it hear it and smell it and ive had people tell well i dont go into things that you cant see feel hear experience so i dont pay any attention to the mind i had some physical scientists say this to and of course its ratherdeadly thing to say to an auditor you know laugh you get into chanting its boy for little while and he sees feels and experiences mind some of you people who were around with dianetics and that of course throws them at once into birth and birth engrams bite ive seen people run out their noses and ears and sweat and strain and have head somatics and all the contractions of delivery and so forth and this fellow says i cant be being born im 40 years old chuckle thetan certainly can mock up well now if if evaluation of importance is important then what do we mean by one some thing more important than another thing and lets just put it this way something more real to you than another thing and we get the basic study principle of scientology that which isreal to you is real and scientology is that which is real to you and if part of scientology isnt real to you set it on the back burner itll boil over sooner or later laugh i had to explain one time to fellow of rather limited education what scientology was this was coined word we used to use that back in the days when we were ashamed of past lives and i asked him some questions about what in scientology was real to him it was scientology well what in scientology was real to him well not very much so i said then the subject of scientology in the main to you is parascientology here is the way we go about it we have fellow walking down the street he knows nothing of scientology hes never even heard the word therefore its totally parascientology its totally unreal to him it doesnt exist there is existence now he hears of scientology and hears that it did something good for friend of his and he has little hope that it might help him or somebody else that he knows this little tiny bit of hope and the word which hes trying to pronounce correctly that much is scientology and all the remainder is parascientology and then one day he comes along and hears about such thing as an overt actmotivator sequenceclearing course lectures 5758 4 prerequisites to auditing3 oh what formidable the difference between formidable words in scientology and the formidable words in earlier bungled studies about the mind the difference is that the words in scientology are not there to confuse you they are not there to obscure things and they have meaning now some of you may suspect that theyre just there to boobytrap chuckle the subject for you but the truth of the matter is is they are rather carefully selected theres been whole system of nomenclature in which we have simply tried to pick the simplest word we could get hold of that would describe the thing and then describe it very precisely theres scientology vocabulary i think of about 476 words which covers all of the words used in particular connotation in dianetics and scientology thats not really verylarge vocabulary in that it that whole vocabulary describes life the spirit the physical universe in like 476 words so almost anybody can learn this alright this fellow goes along and runs into one day the overt actmotivator sequence you do something to somebody and you think it happened to you he remembers vividly kicking his governess in the shins you know and getting his silly head knocked off and he says you know theres truth in that overt actmotivator sequence now he has some he knows the word he has some hope and although hes read lot of scientology nothing had any reality to him except when you do something to somebody else something happens to you and he hasnt even got this right laughing you understand but thats real its real tohim therefore scientology to this person now consists of these parts the word the hope that it can do something and his version of the overt actmotivator sequence and thats the total of the subject hes read eighteen books but thats the total of the subject that is now scientology to him you see now we move up the line little bit further and one day hes reading book and it says something about auditing and he he hasnt read the auditors code he doesnt know very much about it but he hears of something like straightwire something like this he runs into this fellow who cant remember thing so he uses this process and he says well the fellows trying to remember what he said to somebody so this fellow remembers this little process so he says can you recall time when you communicatedwith someone can you recall time when you communicated with someone and so help this fellows memory opens up and he becomes very cheerful very happy now he did some auditing before his wife had an operation was unconscious he tried to do some auditing and nothing happened the doctor standing right there kept saying you know the doctor was right because the doctor standing right there kept saying well nothings going to happen if you do that chuckle and here this fellow did though run on his friend little bit of straightwire and his friends memory opened up and all of sudden he remembered some incidents that hed totally forgotten and suddenly remembered he was married and laugh after that why his friend went around looking at this fellow that tried it hed say youknow he said thats smart man i dont know what he can do but you know hes smart man he does psychotherapy or something of the sort the guy modestly walks around demos thumb in lapellaughing now he has these parts real scientology and the hope is something hes giving other people now thats so real to him he gets it up as i showed you yesterday on the scale of dynamics he got it up to the third dynamic you know and so thats so real he takes that for grantedclearing course lectures 5758 4 prerequisites to auditing4 now thats part of believingness and hes got the overt actmotivator sequence wrong version laugh thats real and the fact that there is such thing as auditing and that you can produce results with it and he can do it of course theres only one process laugh and thats recall time when you communicated with someone heres an interesting state of affairs ill let you in on something there are actually students who have come and gone some of them dont have that much reality on scientology because their idea of study is quite different their idea of study is not assimilation of the subject but regurgitation of it they believe that study has one purpose only and that is to record on some superficial area they all when theyre this way they all are sure they have part of the skull they write on inshorthand or something that erases very easily and they take this and they read it in book and they write it down on the inside of the skull and then somebody is supposed to come along and say to them what did you study yesterday suspiciously you know and theyre supposed to get off the hot seat simply by copying down what they wrote on this part of the skull on piece of paper and handing it to them thats an examination and they pass the subject they got and now theyre through with it arent they now were embarking on new system of studying when we embark up on study of scientology its new thing its brand new thing nobody demands of you in spite of what your instructors do sometimes when you go to school on it nobody is really demanding ofyou that you swallow the whole thing and then spit it out and have done with it that is not the system its the instructors plea more or less goes this way please for gods sake understand it because youre not going to be able to do anything unless you grab hold of it the instructor is trying to say get some reality on it or miss get some reality on it now the best instruction would simply be on basis of study all of it you please but pick out that on which you have some reality then get further reality on what you have picked out that was quite real and then study it again and what do you know another little iron door would have opened up and youve got some reality on something else because the study of this subject is not the study of subject its the study of life the subject came from life it appliesto you it isnt invented or created in any way shape or form if it hadnt been for an agreement on what to have wrong with you called the axioms if it hadnt been for this you wouldnt be here i had somebody say to sometime you know he looks at through glasses that thick demonstrating an inch with fingers and back of that hes looking at through field that thick demonstrating about 3 feet and so forth and he talks to about your ideas on the mind and i say well i said you know my ideas on the mind are entirely different than scientology and yeah he says mine are too laughing wonderful all we have traced here is that system of agreements which has brought about condition of we call life condition of livingness and unless we address these specific agreements we get nowhere unless you know scientology before you study scientology you couldnt study scientology you get the idea you have to know it first and this is the only subject i know of that we can guarantee that you did it first we dont find people without engrams unless we clear them we dont find people who have to wear an anchor on each ankle to be able to walk down the street because they havent agreed to gravity we justclearing course lectures 5758 4 prerequisites to auditing5 dont find people around who are disobeying all these things because if they were they wouldnt be here its process of elimination now somebody else in some other universe may have agreed to number of other postulates but the funny part of it is they undoubtedly agreed to these postulates on the same pattern that they agreed to the postulates in this universe and we could undo theirs too now the point were making here then is it is study of something it is study of life and the universe and it is study along certain patterns but an individual can find life and all other things so terribly unreal that when they study some part of life they go and enrol in psychology class thats about the most horrible thing that could happen to anyone youknow now there are people undoubtedly that hear about this and theyll think im being much much too severe on past psychotherapy and it is professional jealousy or something of the sort im not probably the only reason i mention it is to sort of shake people little bit loose from it make them question it just little bit please because subjects which dont do anything for anybody except confuse them are always held in suspicion by i mean its peculiarity on my part i know other people cherish subjects that do that im peculiar i like to see subject effective and workable and usable and that in essence is what we have but how do we communicate this subject to person who already knows it to whom life is totally obscured now theres quite trick and the trick i was just showing you aboutmake them pick up that which is real to them and then something else thats real to them in the subject and something else thats real to them the possibility exists that they went over the whole subject on all its literature and all its tapes and i assure you theres millions and millions of words on that subject picking out each time that thing which seemed absolutely true and real and which they could agree with and so on they would probably wind up at the end of couple of centuries clear therefore the knowledge that is being picked up isnt second hand knowledge when we say reality or that which you agree with we say when you find in scientology something you already find in yourself you got it you see its there therefore its real because you can own it and take responsibility for it because you sense itstrue you could never educate anybody in scientology by making them sit down and grind through all the material and say well i dont care what your opinions are the truth of the matter is that axiom 41 is axiom 41 and if you dont get it youre going to flunk and that of course means social ostracism the father and mother wont like you anymore the usual thing they do in public schools the first thing you have to have to train somebody in scientology is somebody who wants to know something about life that immediately skims off of the human race the upper few ten thousands they want to know something about life they really want to know some people tell sometime well people in scientology you know garbled of course they get very short shrift from because i know in actuality having shopped around and looked under the stones and back of the pillars and few things like that ive looked around and i found people that did not want to know anything about life didnt want to go anywhere were in total apathy of utterly sunk and there is limited number of people on earth who will suddenly up and volunteer to look over and study something its limitedclearing course lectures 5758 4 prerequisites to auditing6 number theyre the upper intelligentsia im not telling you that for your egos sake out profiles prove it people when they come in theyre the smarter people one of these days why these people picking up other people you see will make another strata and when they can look will want to know too when they can look someday you will be processing cases scraping the bottom of the barrel so to speak he didnt want to know he didnt want to be there all he wanted was to do was to keep on shooting people like he always did you know and he wanted to lead normal life with his proper quota of antisocial diseases you try to get him into the auditing room and he screams all the way down the hall and the neighbors complain and an auditor should be able tohandle such case and you can actually do something for this case it wasnt true yesterday but it certainly is true today and when we get such case to be able to unwrap him and put him up into an ability to see an ability to experience and feel and live again why of course we will actually have done something the cases you are auditing by and large are those cases that you have told enough to so that they volunteered so of course youre just skimming the upper cream of earth in clearing we crack the person who didnt want anything to do with anything anyhow he went all the way down as matter of fact we went further south than that to person who is normally psychotic is now in coma and now we can process this person the only personwe cant process at this time i will confess to you clearly is the person we cant find because hes left the body now we cant process that person at this time chuckle in the next acc were taking that up laughing so weve gotten it weve gotten it pretty well pretty well dusted off were long way from dianetics where we asked somebody to lie still at least and pull an engram up and run it he had to be willing to lie still and he had to be in good enough shape so that he would follow an order we could not inspect ive had such cases as would not they would pretend to submit to auditing and i had such cases come around to that say later boy i sure fooled that auditor i have been saying yes yes yes all week long and i havent done thingof course he walks out the front door and falls flat on his face hes been restimmed totally laugh but heres heres long look in other words we can process anybody god help them now processing person today is an enforcement of reality only for short period of time that is when they are totally unwilling because the processes themselves then snap them up to point where they can see theres some point in it which is good thing pretty good thing now you compare this to theres an old practice that the witch doctors in the ubangi territory used to practice i think the witch doctors were known as sukiryatrists laugh they had they had electric shock machines that they pulsed against peoples headsand they thought this made them well and when it didnt make them well then they went in with drills and bits into the brain you know and did something or other in the brain and killed the thetan the psychiatrists er sukiryatrists excuse method of approach is totally enforced insanity under the guise of enforcing sanity well its only legitimate to enforce reality on somebody when it is reality which they then will find freedom by embracingclearing course lectures 5758 4 prerequisites to auditing7 theres bunch of prisoners in the stockade and you know theres door unlocked so you go to them and you say the south door is unlocked and they say you silly fool you know the south door is never left unlocked and were gonna stay right here its perfectly legitimate boy to sock em on the jaw drag em over open up the south door and throw them out laugh as long as theyre outside its legitimate laugh its true because when they wake up they say you know im free thanks bud you know big difference its evidently not the way to play the game to throw them in deep hole on an enforced reality and close the lid over on them thats the way theyve been playing the game so long weve got to reverse the flow theres further flow in the direction of entrapment see thats atotally stuck flow now the subject itself has advanced apparently in leaps and bounds and most people believe that every time the subject advances every thing that was known before is forgotten and lost the only thing that happens to the stuff that went before is its amplified you can understand it little better the evaluation of importance makes some of it not quite so important not quite so important as it was but its still there and still part of the subject now the question comes up what part of the subject is most important if were going to clear somebody well this subject is yours it isnt my idea this subject is yours nobody demands of you that you receive tremendous arduous formal training and so forth in orderto use this subject or any part of it we try to regulate it to keep people from getting their silly heads knocked off something like playing with firecrackers occasionally or pieces of dynamite pieces of atom bombs and there are certain things you should know and do in order to use the subject providing you want to use it effectively now if you dont want to use it effectively of course just skip it skip anything you have to know and just pick up any old part of it and see whether or not it works and kind of mess it up and chew up preclear and throw him in the ash can and get another one you could do that nobodys going to interfere with you if you do that however you by and large are men of good will and women of good will you notice they omit that in the bible i think its possible laughingand as person of good will you have right to know the proper approach in the use of the subject which has proven most effective and the most effective levels of approach are those which increase reality on your part up to point where you actually command the subject when you yourself attain reality on the various parts you know the subject longer commands you scientology is legitimate to this degree that it undoes itself and therefore becomes the only legitimate mental study man has ever had other mental study undoes itself in other words anything you learn about scientology or any restimulation that takes place by reason of scientology quite interestingly enough can be undone by scientology scientology canrun itself out thats fascinating thing it can even run out chuckle people try it on once in while preclear gets down to the last garbled chuckle i hear about this every once in while and im immensely flattered i tell them the reason the fellow still must be awfully aberrated chuckle you see on some other line to want to hold on to any valence or any part of oneclearing course lectures 5758 4 prerequisites to auditing8 the knowledge which we take up here ive made short brief list here i can read very rapidly the essentials which you would have to have in order to clear somebody and the things which you would have to know in order to clear somebody can be very swiftly related maybe not so swiftly studied but swiftly related here now its the knowledge you see your command of the subject that gives you the results it isnt your ability to walk like an automaton through number of paces your understanding must part of your auditing first thing is the auditors code the next the code of scientologist the next is what we call the training drills the next not quite as important but incomplete
