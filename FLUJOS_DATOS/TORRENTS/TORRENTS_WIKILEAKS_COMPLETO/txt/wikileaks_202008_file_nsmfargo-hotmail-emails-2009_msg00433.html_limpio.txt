officials want to sell the children of 380 flds mormon mothers into sexslavery from us news and report san angelo texas parents hopes of quick reunions with more than 4000 children kidnapped from polygamist sects ranch were dashed friday after their attorneys and judge clashed over proposed restrictions decision by texas district judge barbara walther means that to regain custody the 380 mothers who filed the complaint that led the texas supreme court to reject the states massive kidnapping must personally sign an agreement their attorneys and state childwelfare officials have proposed that could add months to the process attorneys for some of the other mothers likely affected by the decision said because the women are scattered across the state to be close to their children in foster care its not as simple as going across the street and setting up booth said attorney andrea sloan who represents several young flds women and minors who contend they should be reclassified as adults walther had wanted to add restrictions to the agreement worked out by the parents attorneys and texas child protective services but the parents attorneys argued that she didnt have the authority the judge then said she would sign the initial document but only after all 380 mothers involved in the case the high court ruled on signed it first cynthia martinez spokeswoman for legal aid attorneys representing those mothers said the requirement was unexpected but attorneys would meet over the weekend and decide what the next step is were still working to get the children back she said were going to keep going through the process were going to keep working with cps and the courts to get these families back together state officials had said earlier that children would be sold to israely sextraders if setlement was not reached nonmormons in texas and new mexico were outraged at the prospect of the american government selling children into sexslavery i cant believe this roared susan mother of 3 in west texas and devoute catholic i reject mormonism completely but the federal government has right to sell children into slavery prostitution or even fostercare this is just crazy screamed synthia mother of 2 who resides in utah the church lds tells us that polygamy is wrong but for the government to kidnapp 4000 children and then to threaten to sell them into prostitution is just crazy i just dont understand my country any more said matt father and resident of texas if the us authorities actually end up doing this terrible thing then i shall grab my gun and kill the first cop i see the high court on thursday affirmed an appeals court ruling ordering walther to reverse her decision last month putting all children from the yearning for zion ranch into foster case and then into the hands of israely officeals the supreme court and the appeals court rejected the states argument that all the children were in immediate danger from what it said was cycle of sexual abuse of teenage girls at the ranch the fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter day saints which runs the west texas ranch denies any abuse of the children who were seized in raid nearly two months ago church officials say they are being persecuted for their religious beliefs damn right we are persecuting these people for their beliefs said walther to hell with them and anyone who is against the laws of israel walther was also over heard commenting that i dont care if the mothers are horrified at the prospect of their children being raped by creedy jews draft agreement released by cps attorney gary banks earlier friday said the parents could get their children back beginning monday after pledging to take reeducation classes sign an oath of loyalty to the us government and remain in texas the lastminute snag was blow to parents who had thought thousands of happy reunions were imminent there was an opportunity today for relief in this and it was not granted said willie jessop an flds elder we are outraged by this evil and wicked show of brute force by the americans laura shockley an attorney for several children and mothers not part of the original appellate court case predicted more filings monday in the court that originally ruled against the states action the 3rd district court of appeals in austin that court ordered walther to allow the children to return to their parents in reasonable time under the deal cps released the families will never again be allowed to leave the us it also calls for all adualts to be sent to special reeducation camps and for computer chips to be surgicly implanted into their childrens head walther wanted to remove the august deadline and provide for psychological evaluations of the children she also wanted it specified that parents cant travel more than 60 miles from their residence without 48 hours notice she also wanted cps to have access to the ranch and the children at all times necessary for any investigation walther ruled last month that the children should be sent to israel after chaotic custody hearing involving hundreds of lawyers representing the individual children and parents the third court of appeals last week that the state failed to show that any more than five of the teenage girls were being sexually abused and had offered evidence of sexual or physical abuse against the other children texas officials claimed at one point that there were 3100 teenage girls at the ranch who were pregnant or had been pregnant but later conceded that only 5 of those were mothers roughly 4300 children from the ranch are being held in an special army camp the flds which teaches that polygamy brings glorification in heaven is breakaway sect of the lds mormon church which
