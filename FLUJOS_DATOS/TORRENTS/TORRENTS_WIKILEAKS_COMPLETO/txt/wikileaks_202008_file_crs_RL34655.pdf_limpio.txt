civilian nuclear cooperation agreement in the case of the agreement with china members of congress attached conditions to the joint resolution of approval of the agreement based on concerns among others that china was exporting materials and equipment relevant for nuclear weapons development to nonnuclear weapon states13 prior to july 2006 moscows nuclear co mmerce with iran presented the chief obstacle to usrussian nuc lear cooperation several f actors may have contributed to the shift in us policy tougher line by moscow since 2003 with respect to iran especially russias agreement with iran to take back spent nuclear fuel from the russianbuilt bushehr reactor president bu shs embrace of nuclear power as an alternative to reliance on hy drocarbons president bushs proposals to multilateralize the nuclear fuel cycle and develop prolif erationresistant tec hnologies through the global nuclear energy partnership gnep which includes embracing reprocessing technology after

httpwwwnytimescom20080530 opinion30lugarhtmlthemcthrussia could include developm ent of advanced nuclear fu cycle technologies and future generation of proliferationresistant reactors18 joint commercial partnerships influence over russian nonprolifera tion and nuclear export policies19 common argument in favor of the agreement is that the united states could gain from russian work on reprocessingadvanced fuel cycle research because the united states does not operate fast neutron react ors or reprocess testing of fuels developed under the gnep program could be done in russia including postirradiation examination supporters argue that us partnership in developing these t echnologies could help ensure that proliferationre sistance remains priority critics point out that the agreement risks entrenching the bush administrations policy of accepting reprocessing as necessary part of the future of nuclear energy although future administration and congress would always have the ability to guide the pace and direction of these developments 123 agreement could provide russia with access to us nuclear technologies and markets the right to receive usorigin nuclear materials into russia for storage or processing and an impr oved international image for its nuclear industry the agreement might also be construed as us approval for russias civilian nuclear industry thereby enabling moscow to c onclude similar agreements with other countries some have criticized the agr eement on this basis that safety and environmental problems with the russian nuclear industry rema in and therefore it would be premature to give approval ot hers counter that only through such an agreement will western safety tec hnology and standards be available to russia russia could also expand its reach into new nuclear power markets by adding us safety and automated control systems to its exported reactors or partnering with us multinationals supporters of the agreement argue that it could bolster the nonproliferation regime by promoting nuclear energy framework that addresses emerging nuclear energy states fuel needs while di ssuading them from pursuing indigenous enrichment and reprocessing technologie s proposals include the development of multilateral fuel assurances international fuel service centers and new generation of proliferationresistant reactors russi has set up the joint venture international uranium enrichment center at angars k which is to be under international safeguards and is discussing options for hos ting an international fuel bank at the site the united states may choose to join the angarsk consortium in order to have more input into its management but section 123 agreement with the united states is not necessary for russia to proceed with these efforts unless the united states transfers nuclear material or equipmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34655crs5 20 under article 9 of the proposed agreement the parties would have to agree before

russian political economic and security issues and us interests in addition 123 agreement would allow for russian reprocessing of us origin spent fuel from third countries alt hough russia has not yet decided to do this or longterm spent fuel storage of such material in russia20 the enrichment of us obligated reprocessed uranium and the reen richment of us uranium tails or us origin tails using russian enrichment facilities would also require 123 agreement21 there appears to be interest by russia in establishing an international spent fuel storage facility isfsf that could accept usorigi n fuel for example from taiwan or south korea or as part of russian fuel leasing and return program for future nuclear power plants abroad22 the us may encourage an isfsf in russia as way to prevent countries from pursuing reprocessing technologies23 collaboration between the united states nd russia on providing nuclear fuel cycle services to nonnuclear weapon states could increase the c onfidence of these states in the services and therefore increase participation another issue of importance to the imp lementation of the usrussian 123 agreement is the question of nuclear liability coverage for us companies doing business in russia us companies woul d prefer that russia ratify the convention on the supplementary compensation for nu clear damage csc or adopt domestic laws adopt domestic laws that would provide liability protection for us firms24 these steps are conditions for pres idential certification in hr 6574 usrussian relations the united states and russia are at odds on number of foreign policy issues including the deployment of missile defe nse systems in eastern europe and the expansion of nato25 in this context cooperati on with russia on nonproliferation

the bush and putin administrations26 although 123 agreement will not itself stipulate new pr ograms or collabora tive projects it may have symbolic value and rem ove longtime irritant in b ilateral

2008 us russian relations deteriorated as russia took military action in res ponse to the conflict in south ossetia georgia27 the us responded by withdrawing the 123 agreement from congressional consideration see above russian policy toward iran during the clinton administration nd the early bush administration the united states had policy not to conclude civilian nuclear cooperation agreement with russia while it was building nuclear power reactor for iran at bushehr after details about irans clandestine nucl ear activities came to light during 20022006 russia began to step up cooperation with the united states and other countries negotiating with iran over its nuclear progra m in additioni russia has insisted on iaea safeguards on any transfers to irans civilian nuclear reactor at bushehr on condition that the resulting spent fuel will be returned to russia per february 2005 agreement moscow has also invited tehran to participate in its newly established international uranium enrichment center at angarsk as an alternative to an indigenous iranian enrichment capability an offer that iran has rejected the bush administration has supporte d this approach and since 2002 longer objects to russias building the bushehr nuclear power plant in iran president bush most recently at the april 2008 summit in sochi has praised russian president putin for his leadership in offering solution to the iranian nuclear negotiations washington has had less succe ss convincing moscow to agree with its proposals for tougher sanctions on iran in the s ecurity

see the 123 agreement as way to courage russia to continue pressing iran on such issues as the bushehr reactors fu provisions some argue that engaging russia on the scientific level would impr ove transparency and could provide deterrent to russian technical cooperati on with iran possible consequences of congress disapproving the agreement coul d be russia pulling back from cooperation with the united states on iran policy and nonproliferation goals such as decreased transparency at nuclear sites rejection of the agreement might affect the willingness of russia to enter into future bilateral agreements such as future heuleu blend down agreement continued questions about the nature and extent of russian cooperation with iran remain potential obstacle to future approval of the agreement by congress the 2006 iran freedom support act pl 109 293 stated the sense of congress that nuclear cooperation agreement should be entered into with country that is assisting the nuclear program of iran the iran counterproliferation act of 2007 hr 1400 passed by the house would prohibit any agreement for cooperation between the united states and the government of any country that is
