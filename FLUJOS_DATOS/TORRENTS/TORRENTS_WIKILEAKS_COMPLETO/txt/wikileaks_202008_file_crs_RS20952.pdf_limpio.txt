retail distribution of natural gas or manufactured gas the act defines holding company as any company which directly owns controls or holds with power to vote 10 per centum or more of the outstanding voting securities of publicutility company or of company which is holding company by virtue of this clause or clause b of this paragraph unless the commission as hereinafter provided by order declares such company not to be holding company and b any person which the commission determines after notice and opportunity for hearing directly or indirectly to exercise either alone or pursuant to an arrangement or understanding with one or more other persons such controlling influence over the management or policies of any publicutility or holding company as to make it necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers that such person be subject to the obligations duties and liabilities imposed in this chapter upon holding companies2 passage of puhca was premised upon such findings as appear in section 1b of the act these findings include concerns of inadequate information provided to investors to appraise the financial position or earning power of the company issuance of securities without approval of the states having jurisdictio n over the subsidiary public utility companies issuance of securities based upon false information and the overcapitalization of operating subsidiaries3 because the securities act of 19334 and the securities exchange act of 19345 were enacted to apply generally to the securities markets congress believed that puhca was necessary to address the special problems in the area of public utilities thus puhca was enacted to meet the problems and eliminate the evils connected with publicutility holding companies which are engaged in interstate commerce or in activities which directly affect or burden interstate commerce6 according to one commentator the fundamental purpose of the act was to free utility operating companies from the absentee control of holding companies thus allowing them to be more effectively regulated by the states7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20952crs3 8 15 usc 79d 9 15 usc 79ca apparently receiving puhca exemption is not unusual for example in late 1993 enron applied to the sec for type of exemption enron requested on december 28 1993 that the sec concur in its opinion that enron power marketing inc would not be an electric utility company as defined in 15 usc section 79ba3 by virtue of entering into described contracts and described transacti ons because enron argued the activities did not constitute the ownership or operation of facilities used for the generation transmission or distribution of electric energy for sale on january 5 1994 the sec issued noaction letter based on the facts and representations in your letter of december 28 1993 we would not recommend any enforcement action to the commission under the public utility holding company act of 1935 including section 2a3 against enron power marketing inc in the event that enron power enters into contracts for the purchase and resale of electric power and for transmission capacity in connection with power marketing transactions as described in your letter 1194 sec noact lexis 42 10 15 usc 79eb 11 15 usc 79kmajor provisions of puhca under puhca all holding companies which have subsidiaries that are engaged in the electric utility business or in the retail distribution of natural or manufactured gas must register with the securities and exchange commission if they engage in interstate commerce8 several kinds of holding companies are exempt under the act from the registration and regulation requirements these exemptions include 1 holding company which derives material part of its income is predominantly intrastate and carries on its business substantially in the state in which it and all of its subsidiaries are organized 2 holding company which is predomina ntly public utility company and whose operations do not extend beyond the state in which it is organized and states contiguous to it 3 holding company which is only incidentally holding company 4 the holding company is only temporarily holding company because of acquiring securities for liquidation or distribution and 5 the holding company does not derive material part of its income from subsidiary whose principal business is that of public utility company9 holding companies required to register with the securities and exchange commission must disclose information concerning the companys operations and description of its management structure among the items required by the registration statement are the charter or articles of incorporation bylaws rights of the different classes of securities underwriting arrangements under which the securities have been offered directors and officers material contracts balance sheets and profit and loss statements10 however puhca goes beyond the disclosuretype requirements of the securities act of 1933 and the securities exchange act of 1934 the act also places substantive requirements upon the operations of covered holding company holding companies not exempt from puhca coverage have two other requirementsgeographical integration and corporate simplification11httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20952crs4 12 15 usc 79kb1 13 15 usc 79kb2 14 15 usc 79ia1 15 15 usc 79ia2the geographical integration requirement provides that holding company is limited to single integrated electric or gas utility system and other businesses which are reasonably incidental or economically necessary or appropriate to the operations of the integrated public utility system the sec will permit registered holding company to continue to control one or more additional public utility systems if it finds that each of the addition systems cannot be operated as an independent system without the loss of substantial economies the additional systems are located in one state in adjoining states or in contiguous foreign country and the continued combination of the systems is not so large as to impair the advantages of localized management efficient operation or the effectiveness of regulation12 corporate simplification under puhca requires the elimination of corporate structures or companies which unduly or unnecessarily complicate the structure of holding company system or which unfairly or inequitably distribute voting power among security holders of holding company system further the sec is required to take whatever action necessary to ensure that holding company ceases to be holding company concerning each of its subsidiary companies which itself has subsidiary company which is holding company13 puhca was not intended to eliminate all holding companies and indeed certainly has not done so those remaining public utility holding companies however must adhere to certain constraints for example registered holding companies must obtain sec approval before it or its subsidiaries acquire any securities utility assets or any other interest in any business14 sec approval is also usually required before any person owning 5 percent or more of the voting securities of public utility or holding company acquires 5 percent or more of any other public utility15 possible puhca reform for number of years there has been discussion to reform puhca because of the belief of critics that it has accomplished its goal and that with changes in the utility industry and with other federal and state statutes the act is longer warranted others maintain that puhca still serves necessary purpose and that to repeal or significantly amend it could lead to abuses in the utility industry which the act currently prevents several bills have been introduced in the 107th congress to repeal or amend puhca these bills include hr 1101 hr 2814 hr 3406 s 206 s 388 s 389 and s 1766
