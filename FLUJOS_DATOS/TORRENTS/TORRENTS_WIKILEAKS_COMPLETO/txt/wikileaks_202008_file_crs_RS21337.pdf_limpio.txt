received through the crs weborder code rs21337 october 16 2002 discriminatory pricing and the robinson patman act brief overview including some exceptions janice rubin legislative attorney american law division summary the robinsonpatman act hereinafter rp 15 usc 13 13a 13b 21a makes it unlawful with certain exceptions to knowingly sell goods in commerce for use or sale within the united states at di ffering prices to contemporaneous buyers of those goods enacted during the depression at the behest of small grocers who feared the buying power of large and growing chain grocers it is the exception to the notion that the antitrust laws protect competition not competitors in that it generally prohibits precisely the kind of price differentiation which would normally be thought to result from vigorous competition allegations of rp violations may be defended by asserting and proving either that the differing prices reflect only the cost of the sellers manufacture or delivery the cost justification defense or that the seller is attempting either 1 to meet the competition of another seller or 2 enable his buyer to meet the competition of competitor of the buyer meeting competition defense in addition there is also broad exception to the prohibition against price discrimination when one of the sales is made to any of certain tities listed in the nonprof it institutions act 15 usc 13c and the goods are purchased for the institutions own use nonprofits may not however take advantage of th eir privileged robinsonpatman status to purchase commodities at favorable prices in order to compete commercially with entities not so entitled further lower courts have found that health ma intenance organizations hmos qualify as organizati ons entitled to take advantag of the nonprofit institutions act on the theory that they perform services that traditionally have been considered as charitable although the supreme court s not had occasion to rule on the status of hmos the in commerce language of robinsonpa tman has been held to mean that the interstate commerce requirement is satisfied only when at least one of the two or more sales is made in the stream of commerce ie across state lines this report will be updated as warranted the robinsonpatman act 15 usc 13 13a 13b 21a was enacted in 1936 with the specific purpose of creating and maintaining market

great deal of litigation conc erning the definition of like grade and quality with the conclusion that at the least the phrase does not necessarily dictate that brandname and privatelabel goods are not comparable in ftc v borden co 383 us 637 1966 for example the court indicated that the proper test for determining whether commodities are of like grade and quality is physical comparison of the goods as opposed to consumer or marketplace acceptance of them 383 us at 63941 see also morning pioneer inc v bismarck tribune co 493 f2d 383 8th cir 1974 cert denied 419 us 836 1974 4 fimex corp v

the immediate impetus for that depressionera legislation was the concern for smaller grocery store operators who complained that their businesses were suffering as the direct result of the activities of the chain grocery stores generally and the great atlantic pacific tea company ap particularly in pertinent part the statute states that it shall be unlawful for any person enga ged in commerce in the course of such commerce either directly or i ndirectly to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality where either or any of the purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce where such commodities are sold for use consumption or sale within the united states and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create monopoly in any line of commerce or to injure destroy or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination or with the customers of either of them1 very simply the act prohibits sellers in interstate commerce2 from charging different purchasers different prices for goods of like grade and quality3 the act applies only to the sale of goods ie it does not apply to the sa of services and only where each sale is of goods purchased for resale within the united states ie it does not prohibit price differentials between goods sold for re sale within the united states and those sold for export4 defenses among the affirmative defenses permitted to refute the robinsonpatman illegality of differential pricing is the socalled meeting competition defense which has at least two levels defendant may assert and must prove that the lower price charged to favored buyer was selected in order to permit the seller to meet that of competing seller primary line competition or he may assert and must prove that the challenged price was necessary in order to enable his buyer to meet the competition of one of the buyershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21337crs3 5 the supreme court has rejected the assertion th at an exchange of price information carried out allegedly in order to comply with the rp manda that price breaks generally may be granted to favored buyers only as necessary to meet the competition of another seller could not be considered as pricefixing violation of the sherman act 15 usc 1 prohibits agreements in restraint of trade which phrase has been cons istently interpreted to encompass pricefixing ie agreements or conspiracies having an effect on price or output goodfaith belief rather than absolute certainty that price concession is being offered to meet an equally low price offered by competitor is sufficient to satisfy the meeting competition defense while casual reliance on uncorroborated reports of buyers or sa representatives without further investigation may not be sufficient to make the requisite s howing of good faith nothing in the language of the statute indicates that direct discussions of price between competitors is required united states v united states gy psum company 438 us 422 453 1978 emphasis added 6 the supreme court has held that although it is permissible to meet compe tition it is robinsonpatman violation to knowingly lower pri ces sufficiently to beat those of competitor conversely the court held that if seller is not guilty of robinsonpatman violation because eg his lower price is costjustified or he actually believed that he was doing more than meeting competition the buyer receiving the lower but not unlawful price is not guilty of violating 15 usc 13f which prohibits the k nowing inducement or discrimination in price which is prohibited in 15 usc 13 great atlantic paci fic tea co v ftc 440 us 69 1979 the socalled lying buyer case 7 15 usc 13a provided that nothing herein contained shall prevent differentials which make only due allowances for differences in the cost of manufacture sale or delivery resulting from the differing methods or quantities in whic h such commodities are to such purchasers sold or delivered see eg texaco v hasbrouck 496 us 543 1990 the hasbrouck court cites several commentators who rather unanimously note that the exactitude of the proof required by the costjustification defense the ne ed to show that the price reductions did not exceed the sellers actual cost savings is genera lly not possible in actual market situations proxy for that defense however may be the f unctional discount supplier need not satisfy the rigorous requirements of the cost justifica tion defense in order to prove that particular functional discount discount for services rendered by eg wholesaler did not cause any substantial lessening of competition between w holesalers customers and the suppliers direct customers but one would countenance functional discount completely untethered to either the suppliers savings or the wholesale rs costs at 561 562 fn 18 and surrounding text previously the court having ruled that the phrase like grade and qualityrefers to physical versus perceived identity noted obliquely that adver tising expenses incurred to convince consumers of the superior nature of branded product might actually be counted in the cost justification calculation bordens extra expe nses in connection with its own milk are more relevant to the cost justification issue than to the question we have before us ftc v borden co supra note 3 at 644 n 5competitors secondary line competition5 seller may not however knowingly beat the prices of competitor6 robinsonpatman defendant may also successfully defend his challenged pricing activity if he can s how that his price differentials were cost justified ie that the price differential made only due allowance for the costs incurred in producing or delivering the goods7 in addition the 1938 nonprofit institutions act 15 usc 13c which expressly permitted price breaks on pur chases of their supplies for their own use by schools colleges universities public lib raries churches hospitals and charitable institutions not operated for profit emphasis added created broad exemption from the general

courts the nonprofit exemption two supreme court opinions announced in the mid1970s and early 1980s provided significant interpre tations of the scope of the nonprofit exemption from the robinsonpatman prohibition both involve d challenges to the practice of pharmaceutical supplier who was selling its pr oducts to certain hospitals at prices lower than those charged to retail pharmacists in th areas surrounding the hospitals in question abbott laboratories v portland retail druggists association inc 425 us 1 1976 discussed the for their own use phrase in the nonprofit ins titutions act the provision was interpreted stric tly the court relied largely on the for their own use language to hold that purchases made by nonprofit hospital ar not all necessarily exempt from price discrimination prohibitions only those made in order to able to meet the needs of the hospital eg dispensing to inpatients out patients treated in the hospital emergency room use and those of staff phy sicians medical and nursing students and their dependents the congress surely di d not intend to give the hospital blank check9 although the court included within per missible uses by the hospital genuine take home prescriptions intended for limited and reasonable time as continuation of or supplement to the treatment that wa s administered at the hospital to the patient who needed and now continues to need that treatment it specifically excluded from the robinsonpatman exemption embodied in the nonprofit institutions act the refill for the hospitals former patient10 further the court refused to sanction purchases by the hospitalbased physician for use in that tion of his private practice unconnected with the hospital11 while the primary concern ddressed by the court in

onprofit institution acts treatment of prescription refills by hospitals prohibited and drug sales to members by hmos permitted refilling prescriptions goes beyond the basic ins titutional function of feeforservice hospital which is to provide temporary medical care for its patients id n 7 emphasis added the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit expanded on that reasoning when in us

grade and quality dictated that government nonprofit hospital purchases fo r use in retail competition with private enterprise as opposed to those for traditiona l governmental hosp ital functions are fully subject to the strictures of the act the court held that purchases of pharmaceuticals by the university of alabam hospital for uses other than in the treatment of its patients as for example in retail sales may not be made at prices which would give the university hospital an unfair price advantage over its competitors in the retail sale of pharmaceuticals health maintenance organiza tions were found to be elig ible institutions under the nonprofit institutions act in modena v kaiser founda tion health plan inc 743 f2d 1388 9th cir 1984 cert denied 469 us 1229 1985 after acknowledging that the act does not explicitly list hps health plans and that case law at that time specifically included hps as charitable institutions the appeals court relied on precedent defining the term charitable fo r purposes of the tax code and the law of charitable trusts to reach its conclusion the emergence of social welfare insurance and municipal hospitals has drastically reduced the number of poor requiring free or below cost medical services this reduction eliminated the rationale upon which the traditional limited definition of charitable was predicated resulting in move towards less restrictive interpretation of the term in recent years now all nonprofit organizations which promote health ar considered charitable under the law of charitable trusts further number of c ourts have specifically held that health maintenance organizations such as hps are charitable institutions for tax purposes given this increasingly liberal interpretation of the term we conclude that the defendant hps are charitable institutions within the meaning of the nonprofit institutions act13 further the court relied on the expression of the for their own use criterion propounded by the supreme court in abbott laboratories v portland reta il druggists14 to decide that the basic institutional function of health plan providi ng complete panoply of healthcare services including continuing and preventative services to its members requires that drugs purchased by an hmo for resale to its members be considered as purchased for the hmos own use with in the meaning of the nonprofit institutions

liaison agreements between the department of justice and the federal trade commission the ftc has taken primary responsibility for civil enforcement of the act despite th fact that theoretically at ast it is equally enforceable by both agencies leaving the department of jus tice with responsibility for criminal prosecutions under section 3 which provides for 5000 fine andor imprisonment for not

resulted in hr rep 941738 94th cong 2d sess 1976since its enactment the robinsonpatman act has been less than enthusiastically viewed by the department of justice which has believed since 1936 th at the act is not beneficial to consumers accordingly government enforcement of the act has always been entrusted to the federal trade commission ftc16 in its 1977 r eport on the robinsonpatman act the antitrust division noted that it should not be surprising that robi nsonpatman can be shown to have many adverse effects on the economy to be sure there are some who do not recognize these effects or who argue that they are out weighed by benefits to specific sectors of the economy notably small business to competition by preventing increased concentration in line of commerce and to public values in general by establishing as legal norm the concept of fair dealing in pricing but any discussion of the benefits of robinsonpatman can be made only with clear understanding of the burdens that the statute places on american economic activity17 in the mid 1970s the 94th congress throug h an ad hoc subcommittee of the house small business committee held hearings on nd considered proposals to amend or repeal the robinsonpatman act18 although the subcommittee received several draft b ills from the department of justice to either substantially amend or to repeal the act legislation was introduced at that time nor are we aware of any introduced at any time thereafter
