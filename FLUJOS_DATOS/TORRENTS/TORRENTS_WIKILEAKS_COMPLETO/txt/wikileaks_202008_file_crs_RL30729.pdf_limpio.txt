aftermath dominated us foreign policy during much of the 106th congress from 1999 to 2000 international focus on kosovo evolved from peace negotiations to nato air war to postwar peacekeeping and an international protectorate for the province scenarios regarding the use of us military forces in and around kosovo were central issue in the congress before during and after natos air operation against serbia in early 1999 some members of congress challenged the presidents authority under the constitution to engage us armed forces in military operations in the balkans without congressional approval greater number of others however abandoned or rejected options that might have dictated forced removal of us armed forces from kosovo operations antagonistic relations between congress and the white house as well as divisions within both parties at times undermined the effort to reach consensus on legislation for the most part congress supported the presidents requests for funding for military operations but was less supportive of funding requests for civilian reconstruction programs during operation allied force members of congress spoke out for and against the mission the constitutional role of congress in decisions regarding the use of force became prominent focus of debate however congress rejected resolutions that would declare outright war against serbia or alternatively mandate the removal of us armed forces from the region congress also considered alternative strategies such as preparing for possible ground invasion of serbia and promoting the democratic opposition to milosevics rule in serbia after milosevic agreed to natos terms to terminate the air operation in june 1999 attenti on turned to peacekeeping and the international administration of the kosovo province the commitment of us resources and burdensharing with the european allies became major concern in congress several pieces of legislation reflected this concern near the end of the 106th congress events took dramatic turn in serbia slobodan milosevic was force d to step down from power after losing democratic elections and facing massive public demonstrations against his continued rule the new situation in serbia and the ongoing peace efforts in kosovo are likely to be promine nt issues of interest to the new administration and the 107th congress changes in the postmilosevic period may carry implications for the natoled military presence in the balkans this report first reviews key developmen ts in kosovo and us policy during 1999 and 2000 it then

appendix 2 106th congress major legislation on kosovo summaries by theme 32httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30729kosovo and the 106th congress introduction the kosovo crisis and aftermath dominated us foreign policy during much of the 106th congress members of congress considered steady stream of legislative proposals over the twoyear period held dozens of hearings on the subject participated in frequent consultative briefings with the clinton administration and many traveled to the region congress succeeded in enacting into law expressions of the sense of congres s on various aspects of kosovo policy some of the appropriat ions bills set spending caps on us military and reconstruction contributions and imposed reporting requirements on executive branch agencies however attempts by some to fundamentally alter us policy to require explicit congressional authorizati on for military operations or to impose concrete policy conditions on military spending proved unsuccessful clear consensus in congress on current or alternative policies in kosovo emerged before the 2000 elections scenarios regarding the use of us military forces in and around kosovo were central issue for the 106th congress these scenarios evolved with changing events anticipating the creation of peacekee ping force to implement the rambouillet accords in early 1999 congress considered legislation to approve condition or block us participation in such force as the situation in kosovo turned away from peace talks and toward enforcement action congress reviewed proposals that supported or disapproved of the nato air operation the senate but not the house endorsed the air strikes congress later considered but did not agree to resolutions that invoked the war powers resolution in an effort by sponsors to assert congress role in authorizing the military action some members of congress challenged the presidents authority under the constitution to engage us armed forces in military operations in the balkans without congressional approval greater number of others however abandoned or rejected options that might have dictated forced removal of us armed forces from kosovo operations in spite of some serious misgivings about the nato air operation in kosovo most members of congress strongly supported providing full funding for department of defense expenditures in the balkans out of concern for perceived budgetary shortfalls in the us military thus even members who vehemently opposed operation allied force voted to substantially increase funds for us military forces participating in the operation the same kind of support was not evident for meeting the clinton adm inistrations request for emergency supplemental funds for civilian reconstruction and regional financial stabilization efforts on these matters congress established spending limits and cut back on requested funds for regional stabilization assistance several pieces of legislation sought to address burdensharing concerns in congress especially with regard to the europeanled nonmilitary reconstruction efforts in kosovohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30729crs2 1hill gop leaders take cautious course on kosovo washington post april 28 1999politics played conspicuous if inconsistent role in the kosovo debates at the start of the kosovo crisis relations between the white house and congress were arguably at their lowest point of the clinton administration mired in impeachment proceedings the president struggled to rally republicans and even some democratic members around case for armed intervention in kosovo while openly distrustful of the president the republican leadership in congress did not press for passage of legislation that opposed the war or directly challenged the presidents authority to deploy us armed forces instead republican leaders opted to keep largely silent on kosovo leaving responsibility for and ownership of the conflict to the president1 some members referred to the kosovo operation as clintons war one result of the intentionally weak direction by the leadership was seemingly inconsistent voting record by members on kosovorelated legislation in some cases the final outcome of votes hinged upon lastminute interventions by individual party leaders or by president clinton and other officials positions on kosovo did not fall cleanly along party lines however as with the case of bosnia some years earlier many democratic members of congress supported relatively hawkish stance against the aggressive actions of slobodan milosevic in contrast many republicans claimed that vital us interests were at stake in kosovo and were wary of additional commitments and burdens on the us military the positions of other members of congress remained even less predictable some democrats such as senator byrd strongly asserted legislative prerogatives in matters relating to us military deployments some republicans among them senator mccain pressed for consideration of deeper militar engagement including deployment of us combat forces against milosevic republican representative campbell an opponent of us participation in the nato air war defied the wishes of his partys leadership by introducing resolutions on kosovo that invoked the war powers resolution the kosovo debates revealed lack of consensus more generally on the use of force in international conflicts and the appropriate us role in such affairs the kosovo conflict touched upon several controversial subjec ts including the international legal basis for military intervention the role and mission of nato and the conduct of limited war reliant on air power in the runup to the 2000 presidential elections us participation in balkan peacekeeping became prominent campaign issue with republican candidate george w bush and his advisors indicating that bush administration would move to withdraw us armed forces from the balkan operations democratic candidate gore in contrast denounced this proposal as risky the issue of presidential versus congressional responsibility for war powers also reared its head during the 106th congress some members of congress were far more willing than others to challenge the presidents authority to deploy us armed forces in overseas operations without congressional endorseme nt legislative proposals seeking to enhance congressional controls did not solely target the clinton presidency since some proposals considered late in the 106th congress would have imposed deployment deadlines on clintons successor in the white house

united states russia britain france germany and italythe kosovo debates also demonstrated variety of means of influence available to the congr ess among the many standalone bills and resolutions introduced on kosovo few came to the floor for consideration and none were enacted instead many bills or new proposals on kosovo were considered as amendments to mandatory spending or authorizing legislation the defense authorization and appropriations bills for example were prominent vehicles for kosovorelated legislation in addition to legislation members expressed their positions in formal hearings and in informal consultations with the clinton administration although several complained that the consultation process was lacking many members also traveled to the balkans region before during and after the conflict some observers contend that members of congress can informally influence the decision making process by conveying likely trends of support or dissent in the congress for example the perception that congress would revolt against the introduction of us ground combat troops in serbia may have influenced the white houses decision to state initially that ground forces would become involved in operation allied force congressional focus on burdensharing in the reconstruction process and the threat to pull out us armed forces unless europe fulfilled commitments may have increased pressure on the european union to implement its programs more quickly this report first reviews key developments in kosovo and us policy during 1999 and 2000 it then examines the congressional responses to the kosovo peace talks at rambouillet the nato air war against yugoslavia the aftermath and lessons learned from the conflict and the subsequent efforts by the united states and other countries to reconstruct and stabilize kosovo concluding section looks at potential trends that may become important in the 107th congress appendices provide survey of key legislative provisions on kosovo developments in kosovo and us policy 1999 2000 at the start of the 106th congress in january 1999 the situation in kosovo had reached crisis stage tensions between the mostly albanian population led by the insurgent kosovo liberation armykla in the southern serbian province and the serbian security forces had exploded into violence in early 19982 over the next months the security council and the international contact group3 repeatedly demanded that both parties to the conflict cease hostilities and resume dialogue on political settlement in october 1998 nato threatened belgrade with air strikes if it did not comply with demands including the withdrawal of most of its forces from kosovo air strikes were avoided by lastminute deal with federal republic of yugoslavia fry president milosevic on complying with demands and allowing an unarmed monitoring mission into kosovo meanwhile us diplomats ledhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30729crs4 4the estimate on the us

state fact sheet march 26 1999shutt diplomacy talks between the serb and albanian parties on autonomy arrangements for kosovo the october ceasefire agreement broke down however by the end of the year the killing of about 45 ethnic albanians in the village of racak on january 15 1999 prompted several emergency international meetings among contact group members to address the kosovo situation international leaders called for convening direct negotiations with the parties to the conflict and increasing preparations for possible nat air strikes peace negotiations sponsored by the contact group opened in rambouillet france on february 6 1999 as talks at rambouillet focused on autonomy arrangements in kosovo president clinton pledged to contribute up to 4000 us troops to an envisaged natoled peacekeeping force in kosovo should the parties reach strong peace agreement4 us participation in the security force was seen to be essential for securing kosovar albanian agreement to the rambouillet draft peace plan after several deadlines had passed the kosovar albanian delegation to rambouillet conditionally accepted the draft peace plan of the contact group it formally accepted the accords in paris on march 15 the serb delegation maintained several objections to the accords especially with regard to an armed international force to oversee implementation of the peace agreement the talks were adjourned unsuccessfully on march 19 on lastditch mission to belgrade us envoy richard holbrooke met with milosevic for final discussion but reported significant change in the serbian leaders position on march 24 1999 nato launched operation allied force an air campaign against serb targets in kosovo and the rest of the fry in televised address president clinton said that natos objectives were to demonstrate natos resolve deter president milosevic from continuing his attacks on kosovos civilians and damage serbias capacity to wage war placing confidence in the air strike option president clinton stated that he did not intend to put our troops in kosovo to fight war us objectives and interests at stake in the kosovo crisis as cited by the clinton administration were to avert humanitarian catastrophe preserve stability in key part of europe and maintain the credibility of nato5 the security council which had not explicitly authorized the air operation considered but failed to pass russiansponsored resolution to demand an end to the nato operation by vote of 3 in favor 12 against in kosovo milosevic accelerated his ethnic cleansing campaign driving hundreds of thousands of kosovar albanians into neighboring albania macedonia and montenegro and greatly destabilizing the southern balkan region after the first few days of limited strikes nato expanded its target list to include downtown belgrade and other serbian cities in april nato formulated five core demands for milosevic to meet before air strikes would cease he must stop all military action in kosovo withdraw his forces from kosovo agree to the stationing in kosovo of an international military presence agree to the returnhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30729crs5 of all refugees and agree to work on political framework agreement for kosovo on the basis of the rambouillet accords the united states and its nato allies carried out operation allied force for total of 78 days allied unity was upheld although some differences among the nineteen alliance members emerged during the course of the campaign some allies led by britain pressed for nato to begin immediate preparations for ground invasion of the fry us officials demurred although some members of congress supported the call for invasion preparations president clinton pledged to congress that he would ask for congressional support before agreeing to commit us armed forces to kosovo in nonpermissive environment other european countries such as greece supported pause in the air campaign to allow milosevic to comply with natos terms the april 1999 summit commemorating natos 50th anniversary held in washington dc emphasized allied unity and resolve in operation allied force as the air campaign wore on however some members of congress as well as observers around the world questione d natos strategy especially after the accidental bombi ng of the chinese embassy in belgrade and with the rising civilian casualty toll of the bombing in may the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia publicly indicted milosevic and other top serbian leaders for war crimes finally on june 3 president milosevic agreed to peace plan brought to belgrade by eu representative and finnish president martti ahtisaari and russian balkans envoy viktor chernomyrdin the plan was based on nato demands and proposal from the group of eight countries the contact group plus canada and japan several foundational agreements ensued on june 9 nato and the yugoslav armed forces concluded military technical agreement outlining terms of complete yugoslav military withdrawal from kosovo claiming victory nato leaders ended the air strike operation on june 10 on the same day the security council approved unsc resolution 1244 which incorporated the ahtisaari chernomyrdin plan and the g8 principles on june 20 the kla and nato signed document on the demilitarization of the kla in the aftermath of the koso vo war president clinton briefly espoused new principle for military intervention in global conflicts addressing us troops stationed in macedonia in june 1999 clinton stated that if it is within our power to stop it we will stop the killing of innocent civilians being targeted because of their race ethnic background or religion later the socalled clinton doctrine appeared to be tempered by statements by clinton administration officials and by the limited us response to violence in east timor moreover the spate of violent revenge attacks by returning kosovar albanians on the serb population appeared to diminish somewhat the sense of triumph about the western intervention natos peacekeeping force in kosovo dubbed kfor has been charged with the task of establishing secure environment throughout the province its strength in mid2000 was around 45000 troops including about 6700 us troops resolution 1244 establ ished unrun transitional administration in kosovo the mission

after the serb withdrawal over 800000 kosovar albanian refugees returned to the province from abroad on the other hand most serbs from kosovo have left the province remaining serb communities have continued to be the target of attacks throughout the province leading many observers to question the prospects for peaceful coexistence among kosovos ethnic groups two international donors conferences have been held the first in july 1999 for immediate humanitarian needs and the second in november 1999 for longerterm reconstruction projects at the donors conferences the united states pledged over 220 million in reconstruction funds and 270 million in humanitarian assistance the european union and the united states are also leading an international initiative the stability pact for southeast europe to promote cooperation and development in all of southeastern europe the fry had been excluded from the stability pact until late october 2000 kosovos first postwar elections held at the municipal level on october 28 2000 registered victory for the moderate democrat ic league of kosovo party while most of the provinces ethnic albanian population registered for the vote very few about 1000 of the serb population had elections to kosovowide positions will be held sometime in 2001 kosovos final status meanwhile has yet to be addressed by the united nations all of kosovos ethnic albanian political parties support independence for kosovo the clinton administration has maintained throughout the kosovo conflict that it supports autonomy not independence for kosovo6 in serbia meanwhile slobodan milosevic was defeated in yugoslav presidential elections in septe mber 2000 and stepped down in early october in the face of mass demonstrations the ascendance to power of democratic opposition leader vojislav kostunica appeared to usher in dramatically different environment in serbia with possibly farreaching consequences congressional response rambouillet and the prospect of us participation in peacekeeping after the start of the kosovo conflict in early 1998 and especially after the january 1999 racak massacre most members of congress consistent with prevailing international opinion lay most of the blame for the conflict on fry president slobodan milosevic some members expressed sympathy with the plight of the kosovo albanian population and introduced resolutions recommending recognitionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30729crs7 7see hconres 9 and hconres 32 see also independence for kosovo washington post oped by senator mitch mcconnell january

albanians right to selfdetermination7 some pressed for nato to follow through on its earlier threats of air strikes in order to compel milosevic to comply with demands with the commencement of the peace talks at rambouillet in february 1999 members of congress focused on the possibility of sending us armed forces to kosovo as part of an international peacekeeping presence in kosovo president clinton pledged in principle to contribute us troops to such military presence specifics on the mission command arrangements costs composition and other aspects were to await the successful conclusion of peace agreement the nato led stabilization force sfor implementing the dayton accords in bosnia was seen to be model example for future kosovo force commanded by nato and with substantial troop contributions from other nato and partnership for peace count ries8 clinton administration officials indicated that the us share of peacekeeping troops in kosovo would be smaller than in bosnia unlike bosnia the kosovo force was to be under european rather than us command in sever hearings and consultations with members of congress clinton administration officials presented reasons for the united states to be engaged in kosovo peacekeeping once peace agreement was reache d they argued that the united states had strong interest in ensuring regional stabili ty and reducing possibility of conflict spillover they said it had an interest in preventing humanitarian disas ter in kosovo and suffering throughout the region upholding natos credibility as the most effective military organization in europe was another key interest cited9 preliminary estimates foresaw force of about 28000 troops of which the united states would contribute up to 4000 at an estimated cost of 15 billion to 2 billion per year for their part members of congress appeared divided in their opinions of the prospect of us participation in peacekeeping in kosovo in view of the likelihood of imminent intensified conflict in kosovo if the situation there was not stabilized10 some expressed the view that us armed forces should participate in post settlement peacekeeping force many supporters felt however that europe had stronger interests at stake and therefore should take the leading role in manning such force with the united states contributing smaller share others viewed the kosovo peacekeeping option more negatively they expressed wariness over supporting the kla the leading resistance force in kosovo but also group seen byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30729crs8 11for example see

by the clinton administration with having committed terrorist activities they pointed out that kosovo unlike bosnia was not sovereign country and that us and nato troops woul d be deployed on the territory of the fry for the first time they argued that kosovo failed to present compelling us interest an achievable milita ry objective or clear exit strategy they also expressed concerns about the impact such deployment would have on us military readiness11 above all several members of congress demanded that the clinton administration provide detailed information and consult with congress in timely fashion about the potential us peacekeeping engagement many went further and asserted that congress had constitutional responsibility to exercise stronger role in matters regarding the overseas deployment of us armed forces in early march house and senate leaders hastened to bring up kosovo legislation for floor consideration expressing concern about the practice of the administration taking action without congressional action or approval senate majority leader lott said it was important to have debate in congress on the matter before us troops were actually deployed12 several republican leaders expressed frustration that the clinton administration appeared to want to circumvent congress on such policy decisions as they argued it did with bosnia and expected congress later to approve supplemental funding for the operation the clinton administration argued that under the constitution it did not require congressional authorization to commit us troops to kosovo peacekeeping force although it said it would welcome expressions of congressional support for us troops engaged in the deployme nt clinton administration officials criticized the timing of the congressional debates as premature and potentially disruptive to the ongoing peace proceedings at rambouillet in early march rep gilman introduced hconres 42 bill to authorize the deployment of us military personnel to kosovo as part of nato peacekeeping operation neither criticizing nor opposing the deployment the resolution as introduced was intended to allow the house to participate in the decision to deploy us armed forces to kosovo house speaker hastert took up the gilman resolution though he declined to provid leadership position on it in opposing the rule permitting floor consideration rep gephardt stated that the timing of it was wrong and irresponsible given that the peace talks were still ongoing over 50 amendments to the resolution were filed including one offered by rep fowler to prohibit us ground troops from deploying to kosovo13 supporters of the fowler amendment said that kosovo was humanitarian crisis that did not warra nt us troop deployment after extensive and divisive debate the house passed final amended version of the resolution that conditioned authorization of the deployment on the requirement that us armed forces comprise more than 15 of the total forcehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30729crs9 and called for the president to submit detailed reports on the deployment while the march 11 vote 219 in favor to 191 against did not run counter to clinton administration policy on kosovo neither was it seen to be ringing endorsement most of the votes were cast by republican members in the senate republican leaders agreed to consider an amendment on kosovo with debate on an emergency spending bill unrelated to kosovo s 544 the kosovo amendment sponsored by senator hutchison sought to bar defense funds for the deployment of us ground forces to the fry unless several conditions were met including the conclusion of peace agreement and the submission of presidential report on aspects of the deployment the amendment would have also required the president to submit bimonthly reports on the benchmarks that were to be established to measure progress and determine the ultimate withdrawa l of us armed forces from kosovo while the senate was considering this amendment however the situation with regard to kosovo changed from one focused on reaching an agreed settlement and considering peacekeeping force to one of imminent war against the holdout party serbia in briefings with house and senate members on march 18 and 19 president clinton and other administrati on members made clear that the united states was prepared to lead nato forces in military actions against the fry subsequent legislation and debate turned its focus to that prospect operation allied force and the role of congress on march 18 the kosovo albanian delegation to the rambouillet talks signed the draft peace plan in paris with the yugoslav delegation offering sign of agreement nato countries made final preparations for air attacks against the fry before the congress us armed services chiefs gave testimony on the likely risks involved in such an operation they anticipated that the majority of aircraft would come from the united states the turn of events appeared to catch many in congress by surprise and left little time to consider legislative responses president clinton and administration officials held several meetings and briefin gs with members of congress just prior to and after the start of operation allied force on march 19 senate majority leader lott introduced an amendment to reflect evolving circumstances amending an existing amendment of supplemental spending bill the hutchison amendment see previous section lott and other supporters of the amendment argued that congress should be involved and take stand on military action by the united states the lott amendment sought to bar department of defense funds for the purpose of conducting any military operations in the fry with the exception of intelligence and logistics support operations unless congress first authorized us participation in such an operation the amendment specified that united states national security interests in kosovo do not rise to level that warrants military operations by the united states on march 23 after several members met with president clinton the senate voted 55 to 44 not to invoke cloture on the lott amendment eliminating the prospect for an upordown vote on the amendment the hutchison amendment and therefore also senator lotts second degree amendment was ultimately withdrawn the same

president is authorized to conduct military air operations and missile strikes in cooperation with our nato allies against the federal republic of yugoslavia opponents cited many objections to the policy among them trying to coerce the fry into peace agreement becoming directly involved in civil war expanding natos mission beyond the collective defense of the allies and leaving unspecified what might follow air strikes opponents questioned why the united states should become involved in the kosovo conflict when it did not respond to humanitarian crises elsewhere in the world fearing descent by the us armed forces into military quagmire senator stevens sought to add language to s res 21 barring funds for ground forces in nonpeacekeeping role but later dropped the provision15 proponents of the resolution said it was appropriate for nato to act in response to the security threat and humanitarian crisis resulting from milosevics actions in kosovo they cited the lack of alternative options and the need to maintain us and nato credibility the senate approved s res 21 on march 23 by vote of 58 in favor 41 against nearly all of the votes against the resolution were from republican members

differences about policy and uniting behind us military personnel carrying out the policy members spoke both for and against the mission but all expressed support for us armed forces the senate followed by passing s res 74 an identical resolution praising members of the us armed forces by unanimous consent contrary to some expectations milosevic showed signs of capitulating after few days of air strikes and even accelerated the drive to expel hundreds of thousands of kosov albanians creating refugee crisis in neighboring countries after congressional recess during which time several members visited the region congress revisi ted the question of its role in the military campaign in yugoslavia individual members made numerous statements for and against the nato operation and other

as well as it became clear that the nato air campaign was going to last well beyond most initial estimates some members also began to call for preparations for additional measures including the introduction of ground troops the republican leadership in both houses however provided little guidance on party positions indeed both parties revealed wide range of opinions on these issues arming the kosovars as early as at the start of operation allied force senator mcconnell and senator lieberman announced their intention to introduce the kosovo selfdefense act s 846 bill to provide up to 25 million to arm and equip the kosovo albanian forces for their selfdefense in the house rep engel introduced complementary bill on kosovos selfde fense hr 1408 the bill sponsors said that their intention was to provide followon strategy to the kosovo crisis if the bombing campaign alone did not achieve peace they argued that the united states had moral obligation to enable the kosovo popula tion to defend themselves especially if nato had intention of introducing ground troops into kosovo in nonpermissive environment assisting the kosovars to provide for their own defense against milosevics forces they argued would provide the united states with an exit strategy in the absence of peace agreement they hearkened to earlier extensive and divisive debates in the congress over arming and training the bosnian government during the bosnian war in the early 1990s others including the clinton administration viewed this initiative as inappropriate in the midst of major military operation and likely to fuel an arms race they said this policy would violate the arms embargo and run counter to the goal of achieving the demilitarization of both parties to the conflict arming the kosovars might also imply support for kosovos independence which the clinton administration opposed some argued that such move would constitute an invitation for russia theoretically partner in international efforts to end the kosovo conflict to provide arms to serbia while neither chamber brought the kosovo selfdefense bills to the floor for consideration the senate voted to include some funds for similar purpose in the fy 2000 appropriations bill for foreign operations the senate bill s 1234 earmarked 20 million in support for east european democracy seed act funds for training and equipping kosovo security force the clinton administration opposed this provision since it could be interpreted as military aid designated for the kosovo liberation army22 the earmark was later

arguments against ground force invasion and estimate d that an invasion operation would have to involve hundreds of thousands of troops under very dangerous circumstances they also indicated that there was consensus within nato to embark on such plans and that any move to consider this option would threaten allied cohesion on april 20 1999 senator mccain and senator biden introduced sjres 20 resolution to authorize the president to use all necessary force to meet natos goals in kosovo the phrase all necessary force was intended to mean possible ground invasion of yugoslavia sponsors of

wanted neither to endorse an escalated war nor to reveal to milosevic lack of resolve other senators expressed concerns that the resolutions authorization was too broad and that the timing of it was

reconstruction burden several provisions in the foreign operations appropriations bill for fiscal year 2000 set forth prohibitions on reconstruction aid to serbia and barred assistance to states harboring war criminals reconstruction aid for kosovo was conditioned on the secretary of state certifying that the us pledge at an upcoming international donors conference would not exceed 15 of the

more depth in 2000 see discussion on burdensharing next section many committees convened hearings on the lessons learned from the kosovo conflict at hearings with us and nato political and military leaders members reviewed events and decisions that led to the start and conclusion of the allied force operation us officials emphasized the missions unqualified success defense secretary cohen said

the operation also revealed wide techn ological gap between the united states and its allies in military capabilities36 they indicated that addressing these disparities woul d become priority for the clinton administration in alliance relations resources and burdensharing in postconflict kosovo the issue of equitable burdenshari ng between the united states and its european allies in european security affairs has long been of interest to the congress in recent years some members of congress have contended that the united states should withdraw its military forces from bosnia and allow the european allies to take over that peacekeeping operation some members have argued the same for kosovo believing that europes closer proximity to and therefore greater national interests at stake in the balkans should be reflected in greater responsibility for the military and economic reconstruction burden in particular they have pointed to the disproportionately large contributions made and costs incurred by the united states to operation allied force the united states contributed the largest number of aircraft which flew the largest number of sorties and brought to the mission the most highperformance equipment and weaponry proponents of this view argue that overseas missions such as the balkan operations have strained military readiness and diverted attention and resources from core us national security interests the clinton administration has maintained that the united states should continue to participate in international programs to stabilize the balkans but that the european nations should lead the postwar reconstruction effort in early 2000 us officials and members of congress openly began to criticize the european allies contributions to date in efforts to secure in the peace in kosovo defense secretary cohen pointed to clear failure by participating nations and especially by nato allies to provide sufficient numbers of civilian police to the administration in kosovo he criticized the need for kfor soldiers to perform police activities in the absence of fullydeployed civilian police force37 some members of congress who had visited the

simply not doing their job moreover he pointed out that the ability of us armed forces eventually to withdraw from kosovo and from bosnia was directly tied to the ability of these organizations to fulfill the objectives of their mission38 in early march the president submitted request to congress for emergency supplemental funding for fy 2000 that would provide about 2 billion for military costs for us participation in kfor and about 600 million for reconstruction and other economic aid to the region including 928 million for kosovo reconstruction39 senator warner and senator levin among others warned that they would introduce amendment s to the supplemental funding bill to address burdensharing issues in kosov they said they would propose restricting military funds or imposing withdrawal date for us armed forces unless the president could give assurances on the pace of implementation of the europ ean allies commitments to civilian and reconstruction efforts in kosovo senator byrd argued that the united states should take steps to turn over the kosovo operation to the european allies since the united states won the war europe should keep the peace40 the house considered the presidents supplemental fundin g request in hr 3908 the house committee on appropriations recommended fully funding the presidents request for 2 billion for kosovo peacekeeping it cut nearly by half the presidents request for economic assistance for southeast europe and kosovo citing concerns about other nations contributions to kosov peace implementation the committee allocated only 124 million of the 928 million requested for kosovo and allocated this amount only for us police officers serving in the civil police force it also said that the presidents request for additional resources for kosovo reconstruction ran counter to the clinton administrations assurances that the united states would not lead the rebuilding effort of postconflict kosovo41 rep kasich introduced an amendment to hr 3908 based on an amendment developed by senator warner that would withhold half of the funds for the kosovo peacekeeping deployment until the president certified that the europea n

was defeated by vote of 200 in favor 219 against on march 29 the house passed hr 3908 the same day the senate leadership chose not to consider hr 3908 but to attach portions of the supplemental

presi dent submitted report requesting specific authorization for continued deployment and congress enacted joint resolution authoriz ing continued deployment the president would be able to waive for maximum 180 days the limitation on funding in emergency situations us military personnel providing intelligence support air surveillance and related activities were exempted from the restriction second the president was to develop plan on the transition to kosovo force that did not include us armed forces by july 2001 the president would have to report regularly on the remaining number of us troops in kosovo and the costs of the kosovo operation the third section of the amendment said that not more than 75 of the funds provided by this bill for fy 2000 could be used until the president certified by july 15 2000 that the european allies had obligated at least 33 of the amounts they pledged for reconstruction assistance in kosovo 75 of pledges for humanitarian assistance 75 of pledges for the kosovo budget and 75 of pledges of police personnel for the interna tional police force if the president did not submit the report by july 15 2000 the remaining 25 of funds would be available only for the purpose of withdrawing us military personnel from kosovo unless congress enacte d joint resolution that authorized that amount to be used for purposes other than withdrawal this last provision removed the automatic trigger of withdrawal that was implicit in the failed kasich amendment in the house elaborating on the appropriations committees approval senator warner said that the amendment which had been circulati ng in draft form since march had already served as wakeup call to the european allies to expedite the process of fulfilling their commitments on rebuilding kosovo he acknowledged that the allies had indeed improved the pace of obligating their contributions but argued that the amendment was still needed as means for congress to exercise its constitutional duty he said that the amendment would allow the next president after the 2000 presidential elections to seek and receive in mid2001 congressional authorization to continue the deployment of us armed forces in

us commitment of military forces to kosovo and bosnia also emerged as prominent campaign issue in the runup to the 2000 presidential elections in october the bush campaign indicated that it would establish as goal the withdrawal of us armed forces from the balkans and hand over peacekeeping responsibilities to the europeans the gore campaign criticized the proposal as risky and irresponsible and said it would maintain the us presence in these operations kosovo and the surrounding region are likely to remain prominent foreign policy concerns to the united states in the coming years the continued deployment of us military forces in the region and the status of politi cal and economic efforts to establish peace will continue to be subjects of interest to the next administration and congress the emergence of democratic regime in serbia will present new policy challenges to the international community the impact of the change in serbian leadership on the kosovo situation however remains unclear as the positions of both the albanian and serbian parties on kosovos permanent status appear closer than before terms of the us engagement of military and financial resources to kosovo may be further questioned and debated in the 107th congress members of congress who objected to the initial deployment of us troops to kosovo may again express opposition to their continued deployment they may be joined by those who supported us participation at first but now wish to see the united states articulate some exit strategy for us troops such as turning over the mission to the european allies some may see the fall of milosevic in serbia as positive sign for the eventual withdrawal of us armed forces from the region some members both supporters and opponents of the kosovo mission may try again to assert what they view to be congress authority and legislative prerogatives in matters relating to the use of us armed forces abroad finding consensus on kosovo policy in congress has proven difficult in the past and is likely to remain elusive in part this arises from the inherent complexity of the issues involved with kosovo for opponents to continued military deployment kosovo represents an illdefined potentially dangerous and openended mission49 the kosov deployment incurs substantial annual incremental costs to the us military and opponents would argue damages military readiness for deterring and fightin g wars opponents would cite the disproportionate us contribution to operation allied force as rationale for turning over the peacekeeping mission to the european

contribute to building peace in region vital to us interests they may argue that the united states should fulfill its commitments especially since it is already providing much smaller share of military and financial resources to kosovo than the european allies finally they may predict negative consequences to follow unilateral us withdrawal of troops from kosovo still others may fall somewhere inbetween supportive of efforts to find an exit strategy for the us military in kosovo but unwilling to try to impose such strategy on the president or on nato another challenge to consensusbuilding are the means available to congress to address kosovo policy legislative proposals considered during the 106th congress often used the blunt threat of withho lding or cutting off funds to achieve various policy objectives many proposals included complex formulations that tied military funding to specific dates presidential certifications or other nonmilitary criteria many members of congress have been wary of mandated troop withdrawals that they believe could adversely affect the us military and have been inclined to defer to presidential authority on such matters proposals requiring executive branch reports on the achievement of tangible benchmarks have elicited wider support how kosov plays in domestic politics may again prove to be an important factor the state of executivelegislative relations after the 2000 elections may shape the congressional response on kosovo the new presidents ability to exert leadership and communicate convincing strategy on kosovo may influence positions of the congress party leadership may also play key role especially since positions on kosovo in both chambers frequently cut through party lines in the past the congressional response will obviously also be tied to events as they unfold in kosovo and in the region for example kosovos future permanent status has remained unresolv ed the international community has sought thus far to devise autonomous political structures in kosovo without redrawing international borders most countries including the united states do not officially support independence for kosovo the issue of whether independence is inevitable what other options are available and what consequences may arise from kosovos independence is likely to come under closer scrutiny in the near future some observers contend that ongoing attacks by albanians on the serb population in kosovo have further diminished international support for kosovos independence others argue that not moving forward on this issue will only provoke more violence prospects for peace in kosovo will also remain closely tied to events in volatile serbia many observers predict that the key for successful exit for us armed forces from kosovo will depend on serbias successful transition to peaceful democratic country milosevics fall from power in october and the emergence of democratic regime in belgrade may or may not facilitate solution to the koso vo problem the democratic development of serbia and the appropriate us response to this process is likely to become major foreign policy focus in the 107th
