1972 the us supreme court found the death penalty as written in various state laws to be arbitrary and capricious therefore the court found it to b unconstitutional under the eighth and fourteenth amendments and subsequently executions throughout the states were stopped shortly after that states began t rewrite their capitalcrime laws using the new guidelines promulgated by the court and capital punishment was resumed in the united states none of the cases decided during the last term 199798 are likely to be remembered as landmark decision s which will impact significantly on the c urrent drift of the court in capital punishment decisions it held in breard v angelone that the eighth amendment did not require special jury instructions on the concept of mitigation or on the statutorily define d mitigating factors and that in the context of the case jurors were unlikely to hav misunderstood their obligation to c onsider mitigating evidence in the other decision on jury instructions the court held in hopkins v reeves that instructions on lesser offenses are constitutionally required only if the s tate law recognizes them as included in the capital crime charged in decision that was critical of action taken by federal court of appeals to cancel state prisoners imminent execution the court i n calderon v tho mpson set an onerous standard for the appeals court to meet before it voluntarily recalls mandate denying habeas relief to the prisoner in order t reassess the merits of the prior decision in the breard v greene case the court noting that the procedural rules of the forum state govern the implementation of the treaty in that state declined to halt the states execution of foreign nationa l notwithstanding claims by the prisoner and his country that state officials violate d provisions of the treaty lastly the court in ohio adult parole authority v woodard decided that conferring upon the inmate the option of voluntaril particip ating in prehearing interview with members of the parole board withou t giving him immunity for his statemen ts at the interview did not compel the inmate to speak and therefore did not violate his fifth

found the death penalty as1 written in various state laws to be arbitrary and capricious the effect of thi s decision was to invalidate most of the existing state and federal death penalt provisions prior to 19 72 the states generally allowed the jury to be the conscience of the community as well as the judge in determining whether or not to impose th death penalty2 soon after the furman decision states began rewriting their capitalcrime laws using the supreme courts guidelines with these new and revised death penalt statutes the supreme court in 1976 in gregg v georgia decided that capita l3

convicted of capita l13 murders of his father stepmoth er and two brothers evidence was presented during the sentencing phase of the trial regarding the petitioners troubled family life the jury received instruct ions stating that before the death penalty could be imposed the state first had to prove beyond reasonable doubt the existence of the aggravatin g factorthe vileness of the crimeit sought to prove the instruction added that if the jury found the vileness condition met then you may fix the punishment of th defendant at death or if you believe from all the evidence that the death penalty is not justified then you shall fix the punishment of the defendant at life imprisonment14 the trial court refused the petitioners request to give additional instructions listing four statutory mitigating factors and explaining that if the jury found any to exist then that is f act which mitigates against imposing the death penalty and you shall conside r that fact in deciding whether to impose sentence of death or lif imprisonme nt the court also declined to instruct the jury that besides othe r15 mitigating factors it should consider the circumstances surrounding the offense the history and background of buchanan and any other facts in mitigation of th offense the jury returned death sentence16 the petitioner tended that the trial court violated his eighth and fourteenth amendment rights to be free from the arbitrary and c apricious imposition of the death penalty by failing to provide the jury with express guidance on the concept f mitigation and to instruct the jury on particular statut orily defined mitigating factors17 the fourth circuit court of appeals rejected the petitioners argument and i t was affirmed by the supreme court the court

with two options convicting th e31 defenda nt of capital crime and imposing death sentence or acquitting him outright although alabama law recognized the existence of noncapital lesser included offense it forbade juries from being instructed on it mitigating evidence the instructions given in this case did not foreclose the jurys21 consideration of any mitigating evidence and the direction to base its decision on all the evidence afforded the jurors an opportunity to consider mitigating evidence furthermore the majority concluded the volume of mitigating evidence presente d and with the instructions that they had to weigh it ensured that in terms of th constitut ional test set forth in boyde v california there was reasonabl e22 likelihood that the jurors understood the contested instructions to preclud conside ration of relevant mitigating evidence notwithstanding we have neve r23 gone further and held that the state must affirmatively str ucture in particular way the manner in whi ch juries consider mitigating evidence and indeed the court said24 our decisions suggest that complete jury discretion is constitutionally permissible25 hopkins v reeves in the second capital

form of first degree murder and renders defendant eligible for the death penalty the respondentdefendant sought jury instructions on seconddegree28 murder and m anslaughter but the trial court denied

specific artificial barrier to the provision of instructions on offenses that actually are lesser included offense s under state law this case is distinguishable from beck in33 two critical respects the majority said the alabama statute at issue in beck proh ibited instructions on offenses that state law clearly recognized as lesse r included offenses of the charged crime and it did so only in capital cases in this34 case by contrast the nebraska trial court did not deny respondent instructions on any existing lesser included offense of felony murder it merely declined to giv instructions on crimes that are not lesser included offenses 35 the court said that the rule announced by th court of appeals limited state sovereignty more severely than the rule in beck the court of appeals 36 required in effect that states create lesser included offenses to all capital crimes b requiring that an instruction be given on some other offensewhat could be called lesser relatedwhen lesser included offens exists such requirement is not37 only unprecedented but also unworkable said the majority38 calderon v thompson common strategy to avoid the bar on successive39 federal habeas appeals

had to prepare his clemency application limitations on participation by hi s attorney and the procedures governing the conduct of the hearing51 the court was unable to reach decision about what fourteenth amendment due process clause standard applies to clemency proceedings for prisoners who are facing death sentences the case was resolved by the agreement of eight justice s52 that the ohio deathrow inmate was not denied due process by any applicabl standard the court ruled that giving the inmate the option of voluntaril y53 participating in prehearing interview with members of the parole board without giving him immunity for his statemen ts at the interview did not compel the inmate to speak and therefore did not violate his fifth amendment privilege against self incrimination54httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30145crs8 conclusion none of the cases decided during the 199798 term are likely to be remembered as landmark decisions which will impact s ignificantly on the current drift of the court in capital punishment decisions this may be due in part to tendency of the court to avoid deciding major constitutional issues which test the powers of the states this notion is based upon two distinct characteristics of the fi ve decisions 1 they did not break any new ground in so far as capital punishment sentencing procedures ar concerned and 2 instead of preeminence at the federal level the court give s considerable recognition to the traditional powers of the state to regulate crime applying the rational of calder on v thompson as an example there have been very few cases which have been acc epted for review by the court which address lingering issues surrounding the 1996 antiterrorism and effective death penalty act whic h sharply limits the federal appeals by death row inmates by raising the standards fo r overturning state decisions sequently one might argue that the rulings on death penalty ap peals which were decided during the last term are procedural wins for the states which may be due in part to congress response to complaints about the length costly and seemingly endless federal appeals by state death row inmates b authorizing new fasttrack procedure
