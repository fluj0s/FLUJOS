the second vehicle fully armored toyota land cruiser and escaped injurythe first vehicle in the motorcade received the brunt of the blast two police bodyguards in the vehicle along with anumber of pedestrians were injured in the attack this is the second attempt on vargas life in december 2002 he lostthree fingers on his left hand whileopening letter bomb sent to hiscongressional office sbu crime scene investigation revealed the car bomb consisted ofapproximately 50 kilograms of mixtureof ammonium nitrate and fuel oil oranfo the device was placed under theleft rear seat of the vehicle

typicallydeployed against stationary targets their use againstmotorcades is becoming increasingly prevalent thevbied especially when operated by suicidebomber is the poor mans cruise missile they are relatively easy to assemble in secure location and the vehicle provides not only concealment for thebomb but the delivery method as well the vbied isthe most likely terrorist device to cause masscasualties sbu the explosives used to assemble vbieds varies widely but can be generalized in two majorclassifications commercial and military grade highorder explosives such as c4 semtex and tnt arethe most powerful on pound for pound basisimprovised explosives manufactured by terroristgroups such as anfo or compounds featuringammonium nitrate with aluminum sugar or potassiumchlorate with tnt sulfur or sugar are widelyemployed due to the difficulty in acquiring largequantities of commercialmilitary grade explosivessmaller vbieds are more likely to be comprised ofthese products whereas larger bombs typicallyfeature improvised explosives military andcommercial explosives weigh about 100 pounds percubic foot concealing 200 to 500pound bomb ina sedan is relatively easy sbu the vast majority of injuries resulting from blast events are due to flying glass and structuralcollapse it is important to understand that healthy charts for this article courtesy of the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearmsdecember 2005diplomatic securitydailydailydailydailydaily page5 sensitive but unclassifiedsensitive but unclassified continued on next pageindividuals can withstand blast forces that would destroy conventionally constructed buildings typically found inurban locations for example 500pound car bomb whichcan easily be secreted in compact sedan will demolishconventional commercial buildings out to well beyond 100feet an individual out in the open would be knocked to theground and would suffer eardrum rupture if exposed tocomparable blast forces but in all probability this would notbe fatal sbu another threat posed by these weapons is shrapnel from the vehicle itself and fragments from adjacent structuresa common technique employed to enhance the effectivenessof vbied is to pack metal objects ball bearings nutswashers scrap metal etc in contact with the explosive as iscommon with suicide vest bombers this debris field whilelocalized can throw piece of steel hundreds of yards atvelocities sufficient to be lethal technical support working grouptechnical support working grouptechnical support working grouptechnical support working grouptechnical support working group sbu the technical support working group tswg which is an interagency consortium for coordinating researchand development of security related issues published studyof vbieds entitled vehicle borne improvised explosive devices in worldwide terrorism this for official use only document is an open source examination of approximately200 incidents from january 1 2000 until december 31 2003an annex of the report specifically addresses and tracks thevbied phenomena in iraq through february 2004 while thisstudy may not capture all salient developments related tothe significant ramp up of vbied attacks in iraq that haveoccurred in the last 20 months it does offer insights into thetactics trends and techniques employed in vbied attackspecific points stated in the report include 75 percent of vbied attacks employ sedanstyle vehicles 70 percent of the attacks utilized explosive chargesranging from 10 to 100 kg 20 percent of vbied attacks employ charges rangingfrom 100 to 1000 kg recent reporting from iraq indicatethat while this trend generally holds true there is anincreasing number of attacks employing larger bombs 80 percent of the time the vbied is concealed in thetrunk sbu detonation of the vbied is also addressed in this report there are three general methods of detonation themost difficult to defeat and rapidly becoming the statisticalleader is the suicide bomber the prevalence of this deliverymethod reinforces the need for sound physical and procedural security measurers there is time to adapt tothis tactic on the fly many law enforcement and militarycommunities are changing firearms training doctrine awayfrom shots to the center of mass to headshots as responseto the suicide bomber threat sbu the next most likely triggering devices are mechanical timers these are especially effective against staticdecember 2005diplomatic securitydailydailydailydailydaily page6 sensitive but unclassifiedsensitive but unclassified targets like us embassies the tswg study revealed that mechanical timers typically do not allow or are not configured to provide delays exceeding 60 minutes this feature of the mechanical timer also forces the hand of local eod teams toensure that render safe procedures can be implemented rapidly if the eod render safe procedures takes more that coupleof minutes theyre likely to be ineffective this drives home the critical need to have standard operating procedures anddecision tree events clearly defined and to have staff well versed in each persons role and responsibility in reacting toa potential vbied threat sbu the most difficult vbied triggering system to defeat is the commanddetonated system cell phones garage door openers and command wire systems have been among the dozens of methods employed it is not uncommon to designvbieds to detonate from multiple sources andor to incorporate mechanical timer back up systems this tactic hastraditionally been used to facilitate selectively attacking first responders and eod assets sbu the best vbied is the one that looks innocent as stated above significant portion of the vbied attacks involve small to midsized sedans these innocuous vehicles are readily available accommodate sufficient payload and blend ineasily with their surrounding environs recent alqaida attacks have employed taxis ambulances and police cars anambulance was used to attack the red cross building in baghdad on october 27 2003 another tactic employed is to secreteexplosives within the frame or body of empty flat bed trucks provisional ira vbied harboring 6000 pounds ofimprovised explosives in the bed was apprehended in november 1992 before it could be used the lesson here is that thereare inherently safe vehicles and that sound security procedures need to be enforced matter what the vehicleconfiguration may be sbu another troubling development is the increase in vbied attacks that employ multiple vehicles andor are combined with small arms fire support this was common element in the attacks on three housing compounds in riyadh in may 2003here again sound physical and technical security equipment and practices combined with maximizing the effectiveness ofa layered security approach are essential remnants of the car bomb in the vargas attack
