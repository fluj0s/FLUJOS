influenza viruses and access to vaccines and other benefits noting the continuing risk of an influenza pandemic with potentially devastating health economic and social impacts recognizing the need for fair transparent and eq uitable multilateral framework for the sharing of h5n1 and other influenza viruses with human pand emic potential and the benefits resulting from their use recognizing the sovereign right of states over thei r biological resources and the importance of collective action to mitigate public health risks recognizing that intellectual property rights do t and should not prevent member states from taking measures to protect public health acknowledging the entry into force of the internati onal health regulations 2005 and their continued importance as the key global instrument f or protection against the international spread of disease noting that the routine and timely sharing of h5n1 and other influenza viruses with human pandemic potential enables the world health organiz ation to ensure that the worlds best expertise is brought to bear in assessing the global risk of an influenza pandemic and allows the world health organization and member states to take actions to r educe the risk of the emergence of pandemic and to facilitate the development and production of the vaccines diagnostic materials and other pharmaceuticals that can assist in containing and r esponding to an emerging pandemic recognizing that global influenza vaccine manufactu ring capacity is insufficient to meet demand in pandemic and that in the absence of m ultilateral system of benefit sharing some member states particularly developing countries c an neither afford nor access the vaccines and othe r benefits resulting from the system of virus sharing noting the who global pandemic influenza action pla n to increase vaccine supply gap and its goal of reducing the gap between potential vaccine demand and supply during an influenza pandemic by expanding the global capacity to produ ce influenza vaccine recognizing that member states and organisations wi th access to vaccine manufacturing and other technologies for the control of influenza sho uld make specific efforts to transfer these technologies to other member states particularly d eveloping countries consistent with international and national laws including those relating to prop erty rights and access have agreed as follows apipigmwg 6 draft 4 2 objective the objective of this multilateral framework is to improve pandemic influenza preparedness and strengthen global public health security by ref orming the global influenza surveillance network as the who network and implementing fairer mor transparent and more equitable system for the sharing of h5n1 and other influenza viruses with hu man pandemic potential and the benefits resulting from their use api pigmwg6 draft 5 3 scope this multilateral framework for the sharing of infl uenza viruses and access to vaccines and other benefits to which all member states commit applies to h5n1 and other influenza viruses with human pandemic potential it does not apply to seas onal influenza viruses apipigmwg 6 draft 6 4 definitions and use of terms for the purpose of this framework the following rms shall have the meanings assigned to them below scientific terms pandemic influenza preparedness biological materia ls or pip biological
