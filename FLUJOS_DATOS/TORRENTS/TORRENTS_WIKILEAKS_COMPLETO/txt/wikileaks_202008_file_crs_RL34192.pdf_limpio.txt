children who have lost one or both parent s to the virus unaids an ticipates that in 2007 about 420000 children will contract hiv due in large part to inadequate access to drugs that prevent

332 million people are living with human immunodeficiency virus acquired immunodeficiency syndrome hivaids some 16 fewer people than it initially estimated in 2006 about 395 million unaids asserts that the decline reflects improvements in data collection and analysis expanded and improved hiv surveillance systems and household surveys reportedly provided more precise count of hiv prevalence than earlier studies 1 in most of the 30 countries where household studies were conducted prevalence rates in 2007 were lower than those reported in 2006 table 1 unaids also used the expanded studies to adjust prevalence estimates of countries that had not conducted household surveys but had similar epidemics after retrospectively applying the improved methodology unaids estimated that in 2006 327 million people were living with hiv adjusted from the original estimate of 39 5 million the revised estimates for india 25 million down from 57 million combined with revisions in five subsaharan african countries angola kenya mozambique nigeria and zimbabwe accounted for 70 of the reduction2 g344g342g342g349g561g7g156g157g146g150g138g157g142g156g561 unaids notes that hivaids prevalence rates have largely stabilized since 2001 and hivaids incidence rates are mostly declining see table 2 3 although prevalence rates have stabilized and incidence rates are mostly declining the total number of people living with hivaids continue to rise though at slower rate unaids predicts that 25 million people will contract hiv in 2007 compared to the estimated 32 million who became hivpositive in 2001 unaids does not expect the number of hivaidsr elated deaths to decrease however in 2007 some 21 are expected to die from aids while 17 million died in 2001 1 for example in india the number of sentinel surveillance sites increased to more than 1100 in 2006 up from 155 in 1998 and now more extensively cover atrisk populations since 2001 30 countries in subsaharan africa asia and the caribbean have conducted national populationbased surveys results from such populationbased surveys have generally indicated lower national hiv prevalence than extr apolations from sentinel s ite surveillance for more information on this process see unaids 2007 aids epidemic update httpdataunaidsorgpubepislides2007 2007_epiupdate_enpdf 2 for 2006 estimates see unaids 2006 report on the global

is contributing to rising tb prevalen ce in areas with high hivaids prevalence particularly in africa4 the weakened immune systems of hivpositive people places them at greater risk of contracting tb correspondingly tb considerably shortens the survival of people with hivaids in 2005 about 80 of all hivpositive people with tb were found in africa that year nearly 630000 people were coinfected with hivaids and tb some 500000 of whom were african about 160000 of the nearly 195000 coinfected patients who died from tb were african representing 82 of those deaths although most forms of tb are curable the worl d health organization who estimates that in 2005 the year for which the most current data are available the disease killed 16 million people including 195000 who were also infected with hivaids 5 some 88 million people contracted the disease in 2005 of which 84 of the cases occurred in 22 countries6 all but three of those highburden countries were found in africa or asia about half of all new tb cases were in six countries bangladesh china india indonesia pakistan and the philippines g15g138g149g138g155g146g138g561 while hivaids tb and malaria are preventable diseases their impacts have been catastrophic particularly in subsaharan africa researchers have found that people infected with one of the three illnesses are more likely to contract either of the other two and the symptoms are more severe in people with two or more of the diseases according to who each year there are about 300 million acute malaria cases 7 which cause more than 1 million deaths annually health experts believe that between 85 and 90 of malaria deaths occur in africa mostly among children8 killing an african child every 30 seconds9 4 information in this paragraph was summarized from who

committees that describe how us funds support efforts to prevent hivaids tb and malaria and provide care and treatment for those affected by the three diseases however since president bush launched the presidents malaria initiative pmi in june 2005 the office of the global aids coordinator ogac determined that it would longer include malaria spending in its annual reports to congress and that budgetary requests for the disease would be made separately from hivaids and tb requests 14 the administration requests support for pmi through the us agency for international development usaid as the coordinating agency for comparability and because pl 10825 considers efforts to combat malaria as critical part of pepfar table 3 includes appropriations to malaria programs as congress considers

risk of mtct can be reduced to under 2 by interventions that include the provision of arv treatments elective caesarean delivery and complete avoidance of breastfeeding can also reduce the risk of hiv

begun to debate the role that circumcision could play in hiv prevention efforts three randomized trials conducted in sout h africa kenya and uganda demonstrated that male circumcision reduced the risk of acquiring hiv by more than half some believe that if mass circumcision was to be conducted in areas of high transmission the procedure could avert about 57 million new hiv infections and 3 million deaths over 20 years among both men and women25 who and unaids have endorsed the practice to be added to hiv prevention initiatives26 the organizations warn however that the practice should not be seen as magic bullet as it does not prevent men from acquiring the virus it only reduces the risk of infection as result health experts urge those who perform the surgeries to counsel the men and explain that they must maintain other protective practices such as abstaining from sex reducing their number of sexual partners and using condoms some observers argue that the studies should not yet be widely embraced particularly since only few trials have been conducted number of scientists question the validity of the studies since they were terminated early practice critics contend that skews the results27 dissenters argue that there may be other explanations for the drop in transmission skeptics contend that circumcision reduces the incidence of genital symptoms allowing men to receive fewer unsafe injections and other blood exposures during treatm ent also in subsaharan africa circumcised virgins and adolescents are reportedly more likel to be hivinfected than their uncircumcised counterparts researchers suspect that unhygienic circumcision procedures might be large factor in this phenomenon 28 critics and advocates of the practice agree that additional studies need to be conducted and number of precautions must be taken should the practice be implemented on larger scale29 additional research is needed to determine how the procedure might impact hiv transmission to women the most affected population in africa th ere is consensus that male circumcision must be considered part of comprehensive hiv prevention package which includes treatment for sexually transmitted infections the promotion of safer sex practices and the provision of male and female condoms and promotion of their correct and consistent use hivaids advocates maintain that men and their sexual partners must also be counseled to prevent them from developing false sense of security and engaging in highrisk behaviors that could undermine the partial protection provided by male circumcision health experts agree that african health systems need to be strengthened in order to ensure safe and clean operations circumcision must be done under hygienic conditions by trained personnel with access to sterile surgical instruments 25 circumcision and circumspection the lancet infectious diseases may 2007 vol 7 5 httpwwwthelancetcomjournalslaninfarticlepiis1473309907700877 26

administration asserted that whos prequalification process was inadequate and that generic drugs purchased with pepfar funds had to be first inspected by the us food and drug administration fda35 the

unnecessary and delayed the distribution of arvs37 in january 2005 gao reported that the policy limited the selection of arv products available did not fully support the treatment strategies of the focus countries and was not optimally coordinated with other multinational initiatives gao indicated that better coordination with the focus countries and with other treatment initiatives could facilitate more rapid implementation of the emergency plan moreover given the intended scale of the plan lower prices for arvs could result in savings of hundreds of millions of dollars which could be used to treat additional patients or to support other aspects of the program 38 in march 2007 iom found that in many of the focus countries number of those implementing hivaids programs complained that the us treatment policy complicated national treatment efforts39 the institute recommended that ogac work to support who prequalification as the accepted global standard for assuring the quality

lessening agricultural productivity the united nations food and agriculture organization fao estimates that fo od consumption drops by 40 in homes affected by hivaids due in large part to diminished capacity to farm 42 in communities struggling with food security decreased food production can complicate efforts to maintain treatment regiments if patients do not consume adequate amounts of nutritious food they can suffer significant side effects while taking arvs and the drugs can be less effective at the 2006 international aids conference one aids advocate cited study that showed that patients who were malnourished when they started arv therapy were six times more likely to die than wellnourished patients and were more likely to suffer sideeffects which often caused them to stop taking the treatments43 these issues are particularly acute in rural communities where aids incidence is rapidly increasing and access to care is usually more limited than in urban areas in the 25 most aidsaffected countries in africa more than 23 of the population live in rural areas and rely on agriculture for their livelihoods44 in april 2007 the house foreign affairs committee held hearing on the progress of pepfar at the hearing global aids coordinator mark dybul testified that pepfar funds provided limited food assistance for specific highly vulnerable populations and cited support for pilot program that enables local food manufacturer to distribute nutrientdense food to orphans and vulnerable children clinically malnourished hivpositive people and hivpositive pregnant and

in fy2007 ambassador dybul conceded that pepfars engagement in food insecurity is limited he contended however that efforts are intentionally limited because ogac prefers to remain focused on hivaids

ambassador dybul asserted at the april 2007 house hearing that pepfar strengthens health systems and expands the health workforce this assertion counters the findings that the institute of medicine published in its march 2007 report pepf ar implementation progress and promise57 though iom concluded that pepfar has ma promising start it found pepfar might further limit health care options for those not suffering from hivaids pepfars hivaids activities have sometimes negatively affected other aspects of public health systems and exacerbated resource constraints particularly those related to national human resource settings if focus countries national plans for expanding their health workforce are not supported pepfar might worsen national shortages by shifting disproportionate share of the workforce to hivaids activities which might cause other health areas to be neglected pepfars initial emergency approach to meeting personnel needs has been to focus on hivspecific training of existing clinicians and other health care workers support for expansion of the professional clinical workforce has been limited even when such expansion is an explicit part of the countrys hivaids plan and the effort is endorsed and supported by other donors pepfar country teams often expressed concern that they were not allowed to fund activities unless those activities were specifically part of the hivaids effort and so could not support for example the training of new clinical officers who in some countries are the mainstay of the treatment efforts 58 iom recommended that ogac work more closely with governments to analyze the impact that pepfarsupported programs might have on public health systems particularly in areas related to maternal and child health and immunizations iom suggested that the analysis consider whether pepfars incentives and salaries draw workers out of public systems and shift disproportionate share of the workforce to hivaids efforts the report also asserted that pepfar should increase support to the education of new health professionals 57 httpwwwiomeducms37832477041804aspx 58 ibid httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34192g18g7g18g8g3g20g497g561

there is growing consensus that health systems including those that address hivaids must be strengthened in order for health interventions to be effective on august 22 2007 british prime minister gordon brown and german chance llor angela merkel announced their intention to launch an international health partnership ihp aimed at accelerating progress towards reducing child and maternal mortality combating infectious diseases including hivaids tb and malaria and strengthening health systems59 the leaders acknowledged in their statement that the fragmented method of applying global health aid has reduced the effectiveness of aid in large part because donors compete for limited trained staff and implement the projects without considering the countries priorities and structures60 according to dfid there are more than 40 bilateral donors and 90 global health initiatives each maintaining their own reporting requirements and most focusing on specific health issues such as hivaids61 dfid asserts that few global health efforts focus on activities that wo uld strengthen struggling health systems such as training doctors and nurses building clinics or supporting basic health services parties62 of the ihp commit to improving donor coordination focusing on health systems rather than specific diseases or health issues and supporting the health plans of recipient countries the leaders did not indicate how much would be allocated towards this initiative or how it would be implemented though seven countries were identified as first wave partner countries 63

like congress to boost s upport for health systems research if it were to extend pepfar64 the global health council estimates that less than 1 of research dollars are spent on health systems research though it could identify where health systems failures exist make health interventions more effective and affordable and improve the accessibility of health care 65 in hivaids programs health systems research could help administrators develop effective forecasting and distribution systems for drugs and other commodities and make stock outs and shortages of contraceptives arvs and other commodities

some have argued that structural adjustment programs mandated by international financial institutions have led to decline in public sect or employment and limited investment in health worker education 66 in many of the countries with health worker shortages there are thousands of unemployed health workers while kenya has shortage of some 10000 nurses in the public sector for example thousands of unemployed nurses are leaving for britain to find jobs as the kenyan government is under recruitment freeze due to world bank and international monetary fund imf stipulations 67 health sector reform critics argue has led to decline in the quality of education and training opportunities for medical students perpetual shortage of health supplies and equipment eg sanitation gloves and hyperdermic needles insufficient medicine and vaccine stocks and brain drain of african health workers according to who on average each year the 57 countries with severe shortages of health workers spend an average of about 33 per person on health table 6 the entire continent of africa spends about 1 of the worlds expenditure on health the who contends comparat ively each year the united states spends approximately 5711 per capita on health some analysts have expressed concern about the extent to which countries rely on the world bank to fund their health programs the bank estimates that it has lent 15 billion in health nutrition and population funds from 1997 to 2006 an average of about 15 billion per year 68 observers worry that the loans add to significant debt loads that many countries already face and to which they commit considerable portions of their annual gross national products69 in some countries governments are reportedly paying more on debt service than public health programs oxfam estimates that of the 26 countries participating in the highly indebted poor countries hipc initiative half are still spending 15 or more of government revenues on debt payments70 some

of children orphaned by hivaids 71 the us leadership against hivaids tuberculosis and malaria act of 2003 authorizes 10 of hivaids funds to be used to support children affected by the virus some of pepfars implementing partners have reportedly suggested that in areas with high hivaids prevalence all children should be considered affected by or made vulnerable by hivaids and that in high prevalence areas programs should allow communities to define vulnerability related to their contexts and to identify which children participate in programs 72 in the 109th congress congress enacted the assistance for orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries act of 2005 pl 10995 which established monitoring and evaluation system to measure the effectiveness of related assistance activities required the secretary of state to appoint special advisor for assistance to orphans and vulnerable children within usaid and required an annual report on project implementation congress did not appropriate funds for these activities 73 number of hivaids advocates encourage congress to appropriate funds to make permanen t and bolster the power and influence of the special advisor those who would like for congress to fund such permanent position suggest that the advisor would report directly to the secretary of state and have independent authority to approve and coordinate all us spending on activities related to orphans and vulnerable children supporters of this idea also maintain that the special advisor would need appropriations for an office that would be similar in structure to the one at usaid for the presidents malaria initiative proponents contend that the offices staff would 1 devise comprehensive us strategy to address the needs of children affected by hivaids 2 ensure efficient use of us funds by coordinating all related us programs including those funded by ogac usaid and other us departments international organizations like unicef and public private partnerships and 3 monitor evaluate and submit reports to congress that detail us spending on related programs critics of this idea counter that this position would duplicate and add to
