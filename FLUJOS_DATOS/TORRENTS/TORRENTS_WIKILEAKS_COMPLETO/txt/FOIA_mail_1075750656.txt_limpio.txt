from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk to rashit hantemirov rashitecologyuranru subject re2 stephen mcintyre date mon feb 2 143736 2004 rashit that sounds great at least i am happy you are working on the sub fossil material still i have done some work comparing the swedish and finnish long series after standard rcs detrending and there is good similarity at the century timescale for some considerable periods but significant differences over some others even allowing for uncertainty in the series these are only 300 km separated so this is an interesting indication of changes in continentality perhaps i am also interested in extending the highfrequency density series before 1400 ad to show earlier volcanoes even though the spatial coverage is poor it would be interesting to see your extreme year series do you have preprint of your paper i would really like to get support to continue wider collaboration including other northern long series to produce wide scale integrated series what is the latest state of your treeline reconstruction for periods earlier than you showed in the holocene paper i am still hoping such support may come again from europe very best wishes keith at 0728 pm 2204 0500 you wrote dear keith it is very nice to hear from you we live and work in the old way stepan has been updated his woody vegetation descriptions in the polar urals to reconstruct dynamics of forest structure near upper timberline for the last century because of some reasons sometimes without any reasons the work on constructing yamal chronology is going not very well duration of chronology is now 7315 years 7314 bc ad 2000 the last valuable field work has been realized in 2000 when we have collected 370 subfossil samples half of them have been dated now i successfully collect money for field work for helicopter rent i hope this field season will be fruitful meantime we have analyzed frost and lightring frequency in yamal tree rings for the last 2100 years to reconstruct extreme events the later half of this reconstruction i hope will be published this year in palaeo3 now i contracted together with stepan to write by june something like textbook on treering dating for archeologists in russian then im going to return to work on yamal chronology it would be pleasure to keep on our joint work best regards rashit hantemirov institute of plant and animal ecology 8 marta st 202 ekaterinburg 620144 russia tel 73432514092 fax 73432514161 email rashitecologyuranru monday february 2 2004 15737 pm you wrote kb dear rashit kb thanks for this these people ask many questions as they try constantly to kb attack the global warming proponents i answer sometimes but it usually kb means they come back with many more questions all part of science i suppose kb how are you and stepan i have student working on trying to refine the kb rcs approach to allow less trees and reduce bias that comes from using kb only recent data hope to get him to test new methods on your and kb vaganovs data if that is ok with you i wish to work towards new kb eurosiberian series for several millennia at least are you still adding kb new data how are you all kb keith professor keith briffa climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk phone 441603593909 fax 441603507784 1httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa2 references 1 httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa 2 httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa
