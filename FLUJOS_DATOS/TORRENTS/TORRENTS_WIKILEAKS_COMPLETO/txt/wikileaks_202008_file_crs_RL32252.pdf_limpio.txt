31 million died from aids subsaharan africa remains the most affected region with 254 million people livin g with hivaids at the end of 2004 19 million of whom were children under the age of 15 the united states agency for international development usaid the united nations childrens fund unicef and unaids estimate that at the end of 2003 15 million children under the age of 18 had lost one or both parents to aids with the majority 82 in sub saharan africa in just two years from 2001 to 2003 the global number of children orphaned by aids increased from 115 million to 15 million by 2010 it is expected that more than 25 million children will be orphaned by this deadly virus due to the 10year time lag between hiv infection and death officials predict that orphan populations will continue to rise for s imilar period even after the hiv rate begins to decline experts say only massive spending to prolong the lives of parents could be expected to change this trend the impact of hivaids on children is just beginning to be explored not only are children orphaned by aids affected by the virus but those who live in homes that have taken in orphans children with little education and resources and those living in areas with high hiv rates are also impacted children who have been orphaned by aids may be forced to leav school engage in labor or prostitution suffer from depression and anger or engage in highrisk behavior that makes them vulnerable to contracting hiv children w ho live in homes that take in orphans may see decline in the quantity and quality of food education

ninetyfive percent of those living with hivaids reside in veloping countries subsaharan africa remains the most affected continen t with 19 million of the 22 million infected children1 joint study conducted by the us agency for international development usaid the united nations children s fund unicef and the joint united nations program on hivaids unaids found that at the end of 2003 15 million children under the age of 18 had lost one or both parents to aids with 123 million of them found in subsaharan africa2 between 1990 and 2003 subsaharan afri cas population of children orphaned by aids increased from less than 1 million to more than 12 million3 due to the 10 year time lag between hiv in fection and death experts predict that without the availability of antiretrovira l medications orphan populati ons will continue to grow for at least two decades after country has reached its peak hiv infection rate in uganda for example although the epide mic has been on steady decline from 14 in the late 1980s to 41 in 2003 the number of orphans under the age of 15 continued to climb for 10 years after the countrys infection rate peaked experts report that the number of orphans is only now expected to decline in the country from 146 of ugandan children in 2001 to projected 96 in 20104 thailand long hailed for having significantly reduced its hivaids rate is still witnessing an increase in children orphaned by aids in 1995 there were 63000 children who had lost their parents to aids in 2001 the number increased to 289000 and in 2005 an estimated 380000 are expected to lose their

those that serve children affected by hivaids caution against the use of this term because they believe it further stigmatizes the children consequently the terms or phans and vulnerable children ovc children affected by aids and aidsaffected children will be used hereafter to refer to aids orphans6 the growing population of children or phaned by hivaids is concern because had it not been for hivaids the global percentage of orphans would be declining instead of increasing by th end of 2003 43 million children 12 of all african children were orphaned in s ubsaharan africa 123 million 32 of all african orphans of those were due to aids although asia had lower number of children orphaned by aids in 2001 18 million 28 of all orphans it had much larger overall orphan populati on than subsaharan afri ca with 65 million orphans7 some have expressed concern that as ias relatively larg population hides its significant population with hivaids for example although india had seroprevalence8 rate of less than 1 at the end of 2003 51 million people were living with hivaids at that time9 this is almost as many people who had the virus in south africa 53 million at the end of 2003 which had seroprevalence rate of 21510 children living in high seroprevalence areas may see decline in access to education or in the quality of education 2000 study found that an hivinfected teacher loses approximately six months of professional working time before succumbing to the virus11 this has had significant impact on heavily affected countries such as kenya wher teachers are dying faster th an they can be trained and replaced kenya faces the loss of 6570 t eachers annually due to hivaids which translates to 18 teacher deaths per day12 in the central african republic almost as

unicef state of the worlds childre n 2003 table 1 p 85 at httpwwwuniceforgtwothirds of the schools have closed due to staff shortages13 heavily affected communities produce lower crop yields due to reduction in land use those who are ill with aids are often too weak to farm and decline in the variety of crops grown the infrequent use of fertilizers in the fields often results in decline in soil fertility increases in pests and diseases and decline of external production outputs including cash crops14 as result countries sign ificantly impacted by hivaids have experienced rise in child mortality and decline in the gains made in child survival over the past decad for example child mortality in kenya was 205 per 1000 in 1960 and had fallen to 97 per 1000 in 1990 however due to hivaids the rate increased to 122 per 1000 in 200115 the majority of children orphaned or made vulnerable by hivaids are living with surviving parent or within their extended family often grandparent an estimated 5 of children affected by hi vaids worldwide have support and are living on the street or in residential ins titutions although most children live with caretaker they face number of challenges including finding money for school fees food and clothing experts contend that effective responses must strengthen the capacity of families and communities to continue providing care protect the children and to assist them in meeting thei r needs there are thousands of localized efforts many of them initiated by faithbas ed groups to address the needs of children made vulnerable by aids proponents argue that supporting these grassroots efforts can be highly costeffective re sponse although additional mechanisms are needed to channel such resources they fu rther assert that dditional resources are needed to expand the limited programs nd to support the children who are on the street or in institutional care most recent developments the plight of children affected by hivaids is gaining increased congressional attention particular ly through the enactment of pl 10825 the united states leadership against hivaids tube rculosis and malaria act of 2003 which authorized 10 of global hivaids funds to be used for children orphaned or made vulnerable by the virus ovc in the 108t h congress there was considerable debate on how the funds should be allocated many pointed out that activities related to children affected by hivaids should be streamlined some wanted to create coordinator for children orphaned and affected by hivaids in the aids coordinators office of the state department still others argued that the scope of assistance should be expanded to include children who are orphaned from other causes as they are just as vulnerable as those orphane d by hivaids in the 108th session congress considered four bills that targeted children orphaned and affected by hivaids though none made it to full conference httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32252crs4 16 for more

implementation orphans and other children made vulnerable by hivaids challenges for governments the continued increase in international hiv rates is proving devastating for governments heavily affected by hivai ds not only because their most productive populations are being decimated but also b ecause the future of these countries and their children is at risk governments with significant populations of children orphaned and made vulnerable by hivaids may be faced with range of issues including surging street children populations rise in child labor child prostitution and other forms of exploitative work vulnerability to crime militias and terrorist organizations growing population of unedu cated and unskilled laborers and long term foreign aid dependence this section will explore some of these challenges and the implications that they have on affected countries street children and exploitation as hivaids rates continue to so ar around the world and household poverty deepens children are increasingly pre ssured to contribute financially to the household the streets have become the place where children orphaned and made vulnerable by hivaids often turn to supplement lost wages find refuge and sometimes to find an escape from stigma while on the street children can be exposed to rape drug abuse child labor16 including child prostitution and other forms of exploitation making them more vulnerable to contracting hivaids children as young as nine years old have been found to be engaged in sex work17 while one seems to know how many children actually live on the

scientists ve raised concerns about the growing number of children orphaned nd made vulnerable by hivai ds others feel that the prediction of rising crime rates and increased political instability is alarmist27 those who dispute the linkage between social breakdown and increas ed orphanhood cite lack of evidence and reliance on anecdotal data furthermore they argue that children have lived among extended family members for some time particularly in southern africa where significant proportion of the population are migrant laborers those that believe the family networks are strong and can support and adapt to the growing number of orphans poi nt to study conducted in cape town south africa which found that before aids was factor at some point in their childhoods 18 of africans surveyed were r eared in households that were headed by neither their mother nor father28 the key point that critics underscore is that linking orphanhood to increased crime or insecurity prematurely labe ls orphaned children and youth as delinquents and criminals before the necessary contextual research has been carried out29 critics argue that this only furthers the stigma that children orphaned and made vulnerable by hivaids already face education and the economic impacts some social scientists are concerned that the growing number of children affected by hivaids could lead to decrease of skilled laborers within country further destabilizing the nati onal economy and society at rge the issue is that an inefficient transfer of skills and scholarship leads to decline in human capital the body of knowledge and ability found in popul ation it is human capital that drives economic growth some experts argue and when that is threatened so is the economic security of nation 2003 world bank

the majority of their food consumpti on and income however significant populations of engineers miners police lawyers and the like rely on skills gained through education and profe ssional training for income children who are affected by hivaids are less likely to be employed in these professions as they have lower chance of completing basic and sec ondary education without education and skills training children orphaned and made vulnerable by hivaids are more likely to fall deeper into the cycle of poverty and engage in highrisk behavior which perpetuates the cycle of hiv transmission ultimately the affected countries might find it harder to overcome national poverty and become effective members of the international economy the economic challenges of children affected by hivaids occur in stages the first stage often begins when children realize that their parent has aids and is likely to die they begin to fear for th eir future wonder who will care for them and worry about how they will be able to stay in school children are often pulled out of school to care for an ailing family member or because meager household income is now spent on the sick school fees notebooks and pencils become unaffordable and children begin to struggle to provide care and replace lost adult labor and income at this stage the quality of childrearing is compromised and many important lessons on life skills and selfsufficiency ar not taught mostly because the parents is too ill to transfer the knowledge after one parent dies most children continue to live with the surviving parent or relative but they often slide more deeply into poverty for some the next stage begins when they find themselves the heads of households young adolescent may be re sponsible for many siblings some of whom may be infants children who are the heads of households are in difficult position not only because they must now s upport their siblings with little to education andor employable skills but so because they most likely have limited resources in many cases much of the familys possessions may have been sold to care for the sick large numbers of orpha ned children find themselves in homes that cannot afford to pay school expenses and drop out to work in the household fields or on the street young children with min imal education or employable skills can be found doing work such as shining shoes begging for money in the streets bartending selling food nd most often in the case of girls becoming domestic workers many observers believe that th desperation of these young children makes them more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation u ltimately making them more susceptible to contracting hiv agricultural and food impacts stories of children going hungry or star ving in areas that

in africa where 67 of all people infected with hivaids are women33 farmers in the last stages of aids usually produce little to crop yields lower crop yields within households require th families to spend more of their money on food leaving less money for education and health care additionally families affected by hiv often switch to monocrop sy stem or shift from laborintensive corps such as vegetables to less laborintensive crops such as roots both changes impact nutrition as the family has less access to va riety of nutritious foods because of decline in productivity and in purchasing power the economic impact of hivaids on africas agricultural system is also being felt particularly in southern africa the region with the highest hivaids rates and from where much of the continents f

in many rural countries follow traditional cultural pr actices which are based on the extended family structure however in the wake of the hivaids pandemic they inadequately protect orphans and widows

foreign aid programs are implemented and other related international initiatives targeting assistance due to the high level of stigma still associated with hivaids many who work in the development community avoid usin g the term aids orphans the term some argue only serves to further stigmatize and separate the children from the others in the community those who offer support to communities affected by hivaids have found that the early pr ograms which focused specifically on children whose parents died of aids of ten missed other vulnerable children such as those who are at high risk of becoming orphaned by aids because their parents have hiv those who live in households w ith children orphaned by aids and those who may have been orphaned from other cau ses like war or disease are equally vulnerable additionally in many co mmunities it is often not known who has hivaids and who does not due to stru ggling health care infrastructures and minimal hivaids testing as result many of

2002 34 of pregnant wo men had access to nevi rapine in botswana and 10000 people were using arvs94 the capacity challenges remain significant challenge for countries that face the hivaids epidemic as many of them including botswana have considerable shortages of health care workers the president of botswana festus mogae recently discussed this issue when he noted that botswana struggles with brain drain as skilled health care professionals leave the government or country for more lucrative salaries95 botswanas slow arv distribution has strengthened critics arguments that widespread arv distribution is not only hinde red by high costs but also by resource constraints some have stated that health care infrastructures must first be strengthened before arv dist ribution could be more rapi dly scaled up one area that has gained increasing attention is the shortage of trained african health care workers to offer arv treatments unaids repor t recently cited studi which estimated that

already offered nevirapine in some areas to pregnant women and emergency aids medication to rape survivors the country leadership came under heavy criticism for not developing an effectiv national arv

unable to swallow pills this requires that they receive the drugs in liquid form which has more stringent handling and stor age guidelines additionally drug doses are based on childrens changing weights and must be recalculated based on current weight or body surface area and then conve rted to the appropriate volume based on the formulation strength this proce ss requires greater human resources the recalculation of dosages at each visit and fullytrained doctors liquid treatments are not available in all arvs and the transition period from liquid to solid pills vary among medications when liquid treatment s are unavailable providers would need to break adult tablets for lower doses or cr ush pills into food or fluid proper dosage is hard to ensure using these methods the current shortage of health care practitioners in many developi ng countries particularly in subsaharan africa has posed considerable challenges in treatment efforts among adults the more complex demands and challenges of treating child ren has presented additional issues for affected countries insufficient supplies of hiv testing kits are also considerable problem in many of the most affected count ries for example in 2004 35 of hivpositive babies in nairobi kenya died by their second bi rthday the country had two specialized machines for detecting hiv in the country pediatric diagnostic equipment costs around 40000 per unit in kenya while the cost of testing child is about 55 in its 2004 global report unaids said 90000 infa nts were exposed to hiv by birth and breastfeeding every year at least 46000 of them were infected and 60 died before their second birthday102 other tools debt relief some argue that the huge debt burden of developing countries particularly those severely affected by hivaids hinders their ability to develop an effective response to hivaids proponents of heavier debt relief argue that many countries including those recei ving debt relief spend more money on debt payments than on social services this money th ey argue could be used on other programs that are effective in combating the virus such as supporting education and health infrastructures103 oxfam estimates that of the 26 countries participating in the highly indebted poor countries hipc initiative half are still spending 15 or more of government revenues on debt repayments for example zambia is spending 30 more on debt repayment than on health104 furthermore hivaids is sinking these countries deeper into poverty making the debt repayments increasingly harder

sought to expand debt relief efforts to countries heavily affect ed by hivaids similar legislation is expected to be introduced in the 109th session some are concerned that debt reduction initiatives can be abused and corruption will under mine debt reduction strategies furthermore it has been argued that it is not debt repayments that are sinking these countries deeper into poverty but the lack of strong revenue sources if some of these countries would revise their economic and social policies there would be less of need for debt relief critics say in an effort to limit the corruption and careless use of debt relief international institutions such as the world bank and unaids are working with countries to velop effective transparent plans to incorporate hivaids efforts in to debt reduction strategies105 agricultural subsidies countries heavily aff ected by hivaids need increased revenue to support crumbling hea lth and education infrastructures offer hivaids treatment and develop comp rehensive hivaids programs for example unicef recently reported that kenya would need 70 million per year to support 12 million kenyan children affected by hivaids106 some argue that agricultural subsidies hinder the economic growth of countries like kenya that are affected by hivaids and consequently their ability to combat the epidemic it is estimated that in 70 of developing countries agriculture is the main source of revenue for families as well as the national economy107 however some have said that agricultural subsidies prevent farmers in agriculturebased economies from exporting their products to global markets because their unsubsidized prices are higher than the belowmarket prices of subsidized agricultural goods the world bank recently reported that agricultural subsidies in industrialized countries total 311 billion ear with sugar subsidies that are nearly equivalent to all exports from ll developing nations at 64 billion108 the bank estimated that if agricultural subsidies we re eliminated agricu ltural and food exports from low and middleincome countries coul d rise by 24 increasing rural income by about 60 billion109 some use the world

aid 110 with us subsidies to cotton growers totaling 39 billion in 2003 th ree times the amount of us foreign aid to africa111 concurrently critics of agricultural subsidies are concerned that the subsidies also increase reliance on foreign aid because subsidies encourage surplus production of agricultural goods that are u ltimately exported to poorer countries who are unable to produce domestic goods at competitive price they assert that consequently people living in agricultu rebased economies have less income to purchase basic necessities including f ood heightening reliance on foreign aid112 in an effort to address agricultural trade issues members of the world trade organization wto agreed in doha qata r in 2001 to lower tariffs and other barriers to free and fair agricultural trade the wto ministerial conference in cancún mexico was to followup the agr eement and develop concrete plans to revise the trade laws113 however talks collapsed wh developing countries and industrialized nations could not agree on veral issues since progress was made agricultural tariffs and subsidies remain the united states maintains that it will continue to work with countries to velop strategies to gradually eliminate agricultural subsidies and other barriers to trade114
