tyndall centre research funding principles process and timetable tyndall research projects will be funded in three rounds round 1 will be for internal projects only rounds 2 and 3 will be for both internal and external projects the budgets for the funding rounds total approximately 18m 29 and 21m respectively the process of refining and selecting round 1 projects will take place between july and november 2000 round 1 is an internal call and therefore project pis need to come from within the proposing and eligible tyndall departments there is nevertheless the option for some external collaboration in round 1 the rules governing eligibility for internal and external funds are outlined in annex round 2 will be announced during the springsummer of 2001 and round 2 during the springsummer of 2002 the round 2 and 3 calls for external projects will be directed according to tyndall centre objectives although about 5 of overall research funds in these later rounds are set aside for the tyndall innovation fund tif which will be open for more exploratory and less directed research the timetable for the refining and selecting of projects for round 1 is approximately as follows you must read the guidance notes for round 1 proposals 2page project outlines to be prepared by any eligible internals with external partners where desirable and to be submitted to the executive director by 8th september 2000 these need not involve two or more tyndall institutions at this stage although this nevertheless remains desirable objective on 19th september or thereabouts research programme managers will meet together with the executive director and regional assistant directors to look at all proposals and build alliances and streams of integration from the submitted outlines the tyndall 43 see annex b plus other relevant externals will meet in october tyndall consultative forum date 9th october cambridge for presentation and discussion of the proposed

ideasactivities when preparing 2page proposals you should aim to cover the following points even very briefly since the full 6page proposals will need to follow the template below summary research objectives inc how it fits into tyndall strategy eg the rps methodologywork plan outputsbenefits partners academicstakeholder interaction with other tyndall activities tyndall valueadded eg why not fundable through single rc channels project management dissemination of outputs milestones and budget you should also take into account the criteria that will be used by the tyndall cmt in evaluating final proposals and guiding the funding allocation process annex d mike hulme 19 july 2000 annex eligibility rules for tyndall centre funding 1 those eligible as principal investigators pis for
