except that it contains proposed budget amendment to make the bill deficit neutral on june 2 2008 the nate invoked cloture on motion to proceed on s 3036 allowing discussion of the bill but not allowing amendments to be introduced as of june 4 2008 it is uncl ear whether the senate will agree on the motion to proceed leading to further di scussion and allowing amendments to be introduced the two proposals s 1766 and s 2191 would establish marketbased systems to limit emissions of greenhouse ga ses however the proposals differ in how those systems would work s 2191 would establish an absolute cap on emissions from covered entities and woul d allow ent ities to trad emissions under that cap s 1766 would establish emissi ons targets on covered entities and allow those entities to either meet emission reduction targets through trading program or make safety valve paymen t in lieu of reducing emissi ons under both proposals shortterm us emissions would likely be below businessasusual scenario although reductions under s 2191 are guarant eed by the cap and are projected to be larger particularly over the longterm in contrast costs under s 1766 are likely to be lower and more pred ictable than under s 2191 major policy question is whether one is more concerned about the possible economic cost of the program and therefore w illing to accept some uncertainty about the amount of reduction received ie favor ing safety valve like s 1766 or one is more concerned about achieving specific emission reduction level with costs handled efficiently but not capped ie pure tradeable permits as in s 2191 s 2191 leans toward the quantity total emissi ons side of the equation s 1766 leans toward the price side of the equationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34520contents

the nationa l level in 1992 the united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc which called on industrialized countries to take the lead in reducing the six primary greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 20001 for more than decade variety of voluntary and regulatory actions have been proposed or undertaken in the united states including monitoring of power plant carbon dioxide emissions improved appliance efficiency and incentives for developing renewable energy sources however greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase in 2001 president george w bush rej ected the kyoto protocol which called for legally binding commitments by devel oped countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions2 he has also rejected the concep t of mandatory missions reductions3 since then the administration has focused us climate change policy on voluntary initiatives to reduce the growth in greenhous gas emissions in contrast in 2005 the senate passed sense of the senate resolution on climate change declaring that congress should enact legislation establis hing mandatory marketbased program to slow stop and reverse the growth of greenhouse gases at rate and in manner that will not significantly harm the ited states economy and will encourage comparable action by other nations4 number of congressional proposals to dvance programs designed to reduce greenhouse gases have been introduced in the 110th congress these have generally followed one of three tracks the first is to improve the monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions to provide basis for res earch and development and for any potential future reduction scheme th second is to enact ma rketoriented greenhouse gashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34520crs2 5 for discussions of relevant energy

present greenhouse gas emissions under s 1766 and s 2191 as estimated by the models for s 2191 the spread in projected emissions reductions is largely the result of two factors 1 estimated emissions growth in the 1015 of the economy not covered unde r the bill and 2 estimated use of international allowances or offsets to m eet emission reduction re quirements if covered entity submits an international allowance or offset for compliance purposes the entity can emit comparable amount dom estically this latter point is most evident in the adage estimates for s 1766 the spread would also be in response to these uncertainties although the epa cases and eias updated analysis did not include international credits what the figu res do not show is that the tap safety valve is increasingly used by covere d entities after 2030 preventing the projected emissions from achieving the ta rgets specified under the bill this result is discussed more fully later

auction re venues only to 2030 for two reasons first s 1766 requires new congressional vote under special procedures in order to continue beyond 2030 second based on the analyses available the tap becomes the dominant compliance strategy afte r about 2030 suggesting congress may want to reassess its level at that time if additional reductions are considered warranted analysis addressing the price versus quantity issue s 1766 and s 2191 represent differe nt answers to the choice between controlling the price and the quantity of emissions under marketbased control strategy in general marketbased m echanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions focus on specifying either the acceptable missions level quan tity or compliance costs price allowing the marketplace to determine the economically efficient solution for the other variable if one is more concerned about the possible economic cost price of the program then use of safety valve to limit costs could appear to some more appropriate ev through it introduces some uncertainty about the amount of reduction achieved qua ntity in contrast if one is more concerned about achieving specific emission reduction level quantity with costs handled efficiently but not capped tradeable per mit program without safety valve may be viewed as more appropriate in the case of these alternatives s 2191 leans toward the quantity total emissions side of the equation s 1766 leans toward the price side of the equation uncertainty in emissions reductions the projected emission reductions under s 2191 are more certain than under s 1766 there are two key sources of uncer tainty for s 2191 1 the precise number of covered entities that must meet the reduction requirements and the future emissions growth from noncovered entitie s and 2 the availability and use of international allowances that meet the bills compliance requirement but do not reduce domestic emissions s 2191 is estima ted to cover about 85 of the countrys greenhouse gas emissions in addition the analyses presented here assume that international credits that meet s 2191s eligibility requirements would be available at reasonable prices in ot her analyses of s 2191 this assumption is disputed s 1766 has these uncertainties plus an dditional one in the form of the safety valve as indicated in the results secti on the cases reviewed here generally assume that the allowance price equals the safety valve price or is very close this results in banking in the early years of the program nd use of that bank later as the program approaches 2030 the bank is exhausted and covered entities begin making tap payments as illustrated in figure 10 the result is an actual emissions level that is higher than the level targeted by the bill18 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34520crs20 18 continued cumulative emissions approach and eventually equal the bill target when the tap is included once the bank is exhausted and cumulative emissions are equal to the target annual and cumulative emissions exceed the targets in all future years 19 however s 1766 allows covered entities to meet only 10 of allowance requirements through international offsetsbecause the tap price becomes the allo wance price over time in all cases under s 1766 projected emissions exceed the bill s target once the tap is triggered this situation reveals the emissions uncertainty that safety value introduces the tap price is compliance strategy independent of the capandtrade compliance strategy thus the actual emissions reduction under s 1766 depends on the interplay between allowance prices and tap prices for example epaigemref sensitivity analysis indicates unlimited availability of international credits would keep allowance prices below the tap price19 eianems does not project beyond 2030 however none of the sensitivity analyses from eias previous analysis resulted in an allowance price below the tap price in 2030 the result could change if the sensitivity analyses were updated to the 2008 annual energy outlook aeo baseline with lower projected baseline emissions and thus presumably lower compliance costs source crs analysis of data from epaadageref s 1766 case uncertainty in cost estimates the projected cost effects under s 2191 are more uncertain than under s 1766 major source of uncertainty for s 2191 is future businessasusual

change costs and benefits of s 2191s 3036 by larry parker and brent yacobucci p 47 potential for higher emissions that would have to be offset to maintain the cap in general greater emissions reduction leads to higher costs if economic growth is less robust fewer reductions would be necessary and costs would be less20 s 2191 cost estimates are affected by several other uncertainties as noted earlier the span of estimated allowance prices under s 2191 is significant the differing estimates are based on varied ssumptions about the availability of the following 1 costeffective energy effici ency improvements 2 costeffective non co2 greenhouse gas reductions and other of fsets 3 costeffective carbon capture and storage technology ccs and other lowcarbon emitting technology and 4 costeffective international allowances andor credits with program designed to achieve leastcost solution through marketbased allowance trading system restricting the availability of options be they emissions reduction opportunities ie offsets or new technology increases projected costs hence the incentives and funding for new technology and the av ailability of offsets and credits under s 2191 are critical to its longterm success s 1766 cost estimates are not as sensitive to the factors iden tified above partly this is by design and partly this is because s 1766 targets less emission reductions than s 2191 the reduction targets under s 1766 are not as stringent as the emissions cap under s 2191 as discusse d earlier fewer emissions reductions required translates into lower costs this is reinforced by the tap price which is projected to become the dominant compliance strategy in the longterm the effect of lower emission reduction targets is illustrated by the impact of the two bills on projected 2030 electri c generation as illustrated in table 2 as discussed in crs report rl34489 in some ways the interplay between nuclear power renewables and coalfired capacity w ith ccs is proxy for the need for lowcarbon source of electric genera tion in the mid to longterm21 as indicated considerable amount of lowcarbon genera tion will have to be built under s 2191 in order to meet the reduction requirement the amount of capacity constructed depends on the models base case assumptions about future supply and demand and need for capacity replacementretirement under s 2191 along with the degree of consumer response to rising prices and incentives contained in s 2191 the amount necessary under s 1766 is substantially less as fewer existing facilitie s are retired or replaced for example epaipm estimates that for 2025 about 193 gigawatts gw of oil fired natural gasfired and coalfired capacity would be retired under s 2191 it estimates only 95 gw of such capac ity would be retired under s 1766 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34520crs22 table 2 assumptions about the availability of current electric generating technologies and ccs in 2030 nuclear powerrenewable

is affected by the assumed availability of costeffective control measur such as those noted above energy efficiency improvements nonco2 greenhouse gas reductions and other offsets carbon capture and storage technology and other lowcarbon emitting technology and costeffective international credits however s 1766 doe s not represent as much of shift in generation supply as does s 2191 this is evident from the projected impact of s 1766 on coal production for electricity gene ration where the model results indicate stable producti on under s 1766 under s 2191 future coal production is heavily dependent on the models assu mptions about the availab ility and costeffectiveness of ccs technology compared with alte rnatives such as nuclear power combined with more modest reducti on requirement s 1766s safety valve caps the upside risk of costs and ensures its costs would be lower than s 2191 although there are uncertainties in s 1766s potential costs its safety valve puts strict upper limit on compliance cost 12 ton nominal 2012 increasing 5 annually in real terms besides putting an upper bound on cost s 1766s safety valve narrows the band of potential costs s ubstantially the remaining cost uncertainty is only with respect to the lower bound of costs price versus quantity the safety valve the purpose of safety valve price is to bound the costs of any climate change control program price at the expense of reductions achieved quantity25 in general marketbased mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions focus on specifying either the acceptable emissions level quan tity or compliance costs price and allowing the marketplace to determine th economically efficient solution for the other variable for example trad eable permit program sets the amount of emissions allowable under the program ie the number of permits allocated capshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34520crs24 26 for another discussion of this tradeoff see epa tools of the trade guide to designing and operating cap and trade program for pollution control june 2003 p 25allowable emissions while letting the ma rketplace determine what each permit will be worth likewise carbon tax or the safe ty valve contained in s 1766 sets the maximum unit cost per ton of co2 that one should pay for reducing emissions while the marketplace determines how much actually gets reduced in one sense preference for pure tradeable permit system or inclusion of safety valve depends on how one views the uncertainty of cost s involved and benef its to be received26 for those confident that achieving specific level of greenhouse gas reduction will yield significant benefits enough so that even the potentially very high end of the marginal cost curve is not concern pure tradeable permit program may be most appropriate gree nhouse gas emissions would be reduced to specific level and in the case of tradeable permit prog ram the cost involved would be handled efficiently though not controlled at specific cost level this efficiency occurs because through the trading of permits emission reduction efforts concentrate at sources at which controls can be achieved at least cost however if one is more concerne d about the potential downside risk of substantial control costs to the economy than of the benefits of specific level of reduction then including safety valve may be most appropriate in this approach the level of the safety valve effectively caps the marginal cost of control that affected entities would pay under the re duction scheme but the pr ecise level of greenhouse gas reductions achieved is less certain emitters of greenhouse gases would spend money controlling greenhouse gas emissions up to the level of the safety valve however since the marginal cost of control among millions of emitters is not well known the overall emissions reductions for given safety valv level on greenhouse gas emissions cannot be accurately forecast in essence the safety valve contained in s 1766 could be seen as contingent carbon tax conclusion the two proposals s 1766 and s 2191 would establish marketbased systems to limit emissions of greenhouse ga ses however the proposals differ in how those systems would work s 2191 would establish an absolute cap on emissions from covered entitie s and would allow entities to trade emissions under that cap s 1766 would establish emissi ons targets on covere d entities and allow those entities to meet those targets either through trading program or by making safety valve payment in lie u of reducing emissions under both proposals short term us emissions would likely be belo w businessasusual scenario although reductions under s 2191 are guaranteed and pr ojected to be larger particularly over the longterm in contrast the cost of s 1766 is likely to be less and more predictable than s 2191 hence major policy question is whet her one is more concerned about the possible economic cost of the program and therefore willing to accept somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34520crs25 uncertainty about the amount of reduction r eceived ie safety valve or one is more concerned about achieving speci fic emission reduction level with costs handled efficiently but not capped ie pure tradeable permits s 2191 leans toward the quantity total emissions side of the equation s 1766 leans toward the price side of the equation
