foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31624pakistanus antiterrorism cooperation summary pakistan is key frontline ally in th usled antiterrorism coalition after september 2001 pakistani president musharra f ended his governments ties with the taliban regime of afghanista n and has since cooperated w ith and contributed to us efforts to track and capture remnants of qaeda and taliban forces that have sought refuge inside pakistani terr itory pakistans cooperation has been called crucial to past and ongoing us successes in the regi on but there is growing concern that the bilateral relationship is fra gile and may be undermined by potentially disruptive developments in the areas of weapons proliferation democracybuilding and pakistanindia relations remaining proliferation and democracy related aid restrictions on pakistan were removed in the final months of 2001 and the united states continues to make large aid donations to pakistan and to suppor t that countrys interests in negotiations with international financial institutions there are concerns that october 2002 national elections in pakistan were not sufficiently free and open by western standards and that the militarydominated government in islamabad intends to remain in power through manipulation of constitutional and democratic processes this possibility led some members of the 107th congress to seek the renewal of aid restrictions or modification of the pres idents waiver authority until such time that more robust democratic process is sustained and civilianled government effectively is in place there also is concern that possibly growing antiamerican sentiment in pakistan and the potential re talibanization of th at countrys western provinces bordering afghanista n could adversely affect u s interests in the region during 2002 the united states took an in creasingly direct if lowprofile role in both law enforcement and military ope rations being conduc ted on pakistani territory these operations have led to fa vorable results in tr acking and apprehending dangerous islamic militants but the activities of us pe rsonnel in the country have led to increasing signs of antiamerican b acklash and pakistani sovereignty concerns recent electoral gains by coalition of pa kistani islamist political parties are viewed as an expression of such sentiments that may lead to reduced pakistanus cooperation in counterterrorism operations in the future the civilian parliament and prime minister that were seated in islamabad in novemb er 2002 may powerfully influence the course and scope of future us presence in the region this report reviews the status of pakist anus antiterrorism cooperation in the areas of law enforcement intelligence and military operations us
