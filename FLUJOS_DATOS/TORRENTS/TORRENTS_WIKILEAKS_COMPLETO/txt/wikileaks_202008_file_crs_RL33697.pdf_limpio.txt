divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33697potential challenges to us farm subsidies in the wto summary prior to its expiration on january 1 2004 the world trade organizations wtos peace clause article 13 of the agreement on agriculture provided protection from trade remedy consideration and wto dispute settlement for domestic farm subsidies provided they t certain compliance conditions absent the peace clause challenges to us farm subsidies now appear to confront lower threshold for success that of establishing serious prejudice under articles 5c and 63 of the agreement on s ubsidies and countervailing measures scm in particular the criteria for establishing rious prejudice claims include demonstrating 1 the magnitude of commoditys subsidie s either as share of returns or as an important determinant in covering production costs 2 the relevance of the subsidized commodity to world markets as share of either world production or world trade and 3 causal relationship between the subsidy and the adverse effect in the relevant market evidence of these criteria favors successful challenge ruling by wto panel as demonstrated by brazils successful wto challenge of the us cotton program review of current us farm programs measured against these criteria suggests that all major us program crops are potentially vulnerable to wto challenges in addition review of recent economic analys suggests that partial policy reform of the nature suggested by the us doharound proposal would do little to diminish the causal relationship between us crop subsidies and adverse effects in international markets instead the mo st clear method for decreasing exposure to wto legal challenges is through extensiv decoupling of us programs ie removing the linkage between payments nd producer or consumer behavior such decoupling would sever the causality linkage necessary to consummate successful wto challenge the potential success of wto challenges against us farm programs is of concern to the us congress if such challenges occur and are successful the wto remedy likely would imply either the elimination alterati on or amendment by congress of the programs in question to re move their adverse effects since most governing provisions over us farm progra ms are statutory new legislation could be required to implement even minor changes to achieve compliance alternately in light of an adverse ruling the united states could choose to make compensatory payments under agreement with the challeng ing country to offset the alleged injury this report provides background regarding the vulnerability of us agricultural support programs to potential wto dispute ttlement challenges it does not predict which wto members might challenge us commodity subsidies nor the likelihood that such challenges will be brought instead this report reviews the general criteria for successfully challenging farm subsidy pr ogram and then uses available data and published economic analyses to

hereafter referred to as stewart and dwyer 2006potential challenges to us farm subsidies in the wto introduction the combination of three relatively recent events the expiration of the world trade organizations wtos peace clause1 on january 1 2004 brazils successful challenge of certain provisions of the us cotton program in wto dispute settlement proceeding uphe ld on appeal in march 2005 and the indefinite suspension of the doha round of wto trade negotiations in july 2006 have raised concerns among us policymakers th at us farm programs could be subject to new wave of wto dispute settlement challenges prior to its expiry the peace clause had provided degree of protection from wto challenges under both domestic countervailing duty proceedings and the wto dispute settlement process to mo st domestic agricultural support measures provided they met certain compliance conditions the success of brazil in challenging us cotton program provisions within the wtos dispute settlement process demonstrated the vulnerability of us commodity programs to wto challenges in the absence of the peace clause2 furthermore those countries most likely to bring new wto challenges against us commodity programs may feel more inclined to do so in light of th diminished likelihood of further negotiated reductions in us domestic support following the indefinite suspension of the doha round of trade talks nevertheless some trade specialists argue that despite the indefinite suspension of doha round talks and the s ubstantial market distortions linked to several of the major us domestic support programs rge number of additional wto challenges of us farm support is unlikely they cont end that the factintensive nature of wto challenges their extensive costs and the potential negative conse quences in broader geopolitical terms may far outweigh any potential trade gains achieved through wto litigation or dispute settlement proceedings3 in addition others have argued that there is large inherent risk involved in bringing challenge against another countrys subsidy program if the challe nge fails it could legitimize those very programs that it had sought to discipline

release 033306 august 31 2006successful cotton case is indicative of the substantial investment brazil has made over the past decade in human and instituti onal capacity to monitor trade issues and to use the wtos dispute settlement process in protecting its interests few if any other developing countries ve developed similar capacity the potential success of wto challenges against us farm programs is of concern to the us congress the current 2002 farm bill is set to expire in 2007 at which time congress is expected to either extend amend or rewrite the current farm bill usda secretary johanns has stated that one of his primary objectives for the next farm bill is to make us farm programs beyond challenge4 if such challenges occur and are successful the wto remedy likely would imply either the elimination alteration or amendment by congress of th programs in question to remove their adverse effects since most governing provisions over us farm programs are statutory new legislation could be required to implement even minor changes to achieve compliance alternately in light of an adverse ruling the united states could choose to make compensatory payments under agreement with the challenging country to offset the alleged injury report overview and disclaimer this report provides background concerni ng the potential vulnerability of us domestic agricultural programs to new ch allenges under current wto agreements in addition it provides brief summary of the current status of the major ongoing wto challenges against us agricultural products however it is not an official crs legal analysis of us program vulnerability to wto challenge and it does not attempt to predict which wto members might challenge us commodity subsidies the likelihood that such challenges will be brought or the potential outcome of such challenges instead this report reviews the general criteria for successfully challenging farm subsidy program then uses available data and published economic analyses to weigh us farm programs agai nst these criteria as such it acts as primer on the issue of the vulnerability of domestic farm programs to wto challenges and provides numer ous references for those seeking greater detail and more background information the report is divided into four sections the first section briefly summarizes the recent developments concerning ongoing wto dispute settlement ds challenges against us farm programs the second section reviews some provisions of wto agreements that would be implicated in potential wto challenges review of both the policy commitments and compliance rule s established during the uruguay round is important in understanding which particular commodities would be most vulnerable to potential challenges and how challenge might be framed this section also includes discussion of braz ils successful wto challenge of certain provisions of the us cotton program ce it is also suggestive of how future cases against us farm programs may be fash ioned as well as being indicative of the policy consequence of such challengeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33697crs3 5 for more information and the us response see crs report rs22187 us agricultural policy response to wto cotton decision by randy schnepf 6 for more information and the us response see crs report rl33853 canadas wto case against us agricultural support by randy schnepfthe third section of the report provides review of us domestic support by program and by commodity with discussion of how each program fits into the scheme of wto liberalization commitments this section includes review of various cropspecific measures that might suggest farm program vulnerability to wto challenge and discusses how us programs could be altered to minimize the threat of challenge the final section briefly reviews seve ral broader issues related to wto challenges of commodity subsidy prog rams including likely remedies under successful challenges defining subsidy cr iteria under the serious prejudice claim and potential redesign of farm programs to reduce their vulnerability to wto ds challenges recent developments wto challenges of us farm programs two significant wto ds cases against us farm programs remain active the brazil case ds267 against certain feat ures of the us cotton program and the canada case ds357 against cer tain features of us farm programs in general and more specifically against the us corn program concerning the cotton case wto appellate body ab issued final ruling in march 2005 recommending that the unite d states remove both the prohibited subsidies and the adverse ffects defined by the case5 in response the united states eliminated the step 2 program august 1 2006 and indicated that the market loss payments cited in the case have also ende d however brazil claims that additional permanent modifications to us farm programs are still needed to fully comply with the wto ruling on august 21 2006 brazil submitted request for wto compliance panel to review whether the united states has fully complied with panel and ab rulings compliance panel was established on october 25 2006 on january 9 2007 the compliance panels chairman announced that work would be finished in july 2007 if the compliance panel finds that the united states has not fully complied with the ab rulings brazil could ask wto arbitration panel to resume its work that was temporarily spended in mid2005 br azil has claimed the right to retaliate against 3 billion in us exports to brazil based on the prohibited subsidies and proposed 1 billion in reta liation based on the ac tionable subsidies on january 8 2007 canada requested c onsultations with the united states under the auspices of the wto ds process to discuss three explicit charges against us farm programs all three charges derive directly from the legal precedent of the brazil cotton case6 first canada contends that us corn subsidies have caused serious prejudice to canadian corn producers in the form of market price suppressionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33697crs4 7 for more information and general discussion of trade remedies see crs report rl32371 trade remedies

the 1996 to 2006 period second canada argues that the us export credit guarantee program operates as wtoillegal export subsidy third canada claims that us fixed direct payments are not green box compliant and should therefore be included with us amber box payments in which case the united states would be in viol ation of its 191 billion amber box spending limit for 1999 2000 2001 2004 and 2005 if successfully litigated this case could affect broader us agricultural policy since the charges against the us export credit guarantee and direct payment prog rams extend beyond corn to all major program crops consultations are still ongoing and canada has not yet requested the formation of wto panel if wto panel is requested and ultimately agreed to by the wto dispute settlement body it would set in motion the full rules and timetables of the wto ds process in examining canadas cas should any eventual changes in us farm policy be needed to comply with wto ruling in canadas favor such changes would likely involve action by congress to produce new legislation congress will be revisiting us farm legislation this year and could potentially address some of the issues raised by canadas wto challenge wto commitments rules and challenges overview the linkage between agricultural subsid ies and market distortions has long provided basis for trade remedy claims7 article vi of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt of 1947 helped to standardize interna tional trade remedies where claims of dumping and subsidizati on were alleged article xvi of the gatt also addressed subsidies however ag ricultural support polic ies and their linkage to commodity markets and trade were firs t addressed in the uruguay round ur of multilateral trade negotiati ons in 1994 under the agreement on agriculture aa this agreement attempted to specify and discipline agricultural support policies and to develop process for settling disputes between member countries concerning the use of agricultural subsidies8 both antidumping ad and counterva iling duty cvd trade remedies have remained ava ilable to member countries of the wto since its establishment in 1994 however article 13 of the aa the socalled peace clause called for due restraint among wto members in seeking cvd or wto dispute settlement claims particularly if the subsidies in question remained within certain limits as spelled out in the aa and in each member countrys schedule of concessions article 13 was limited by sunset provision that fixed its duration to the nineyear implementation period running from january 1 1995 through december 31 2003httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33697crs5 9 for more information on wto aa liberaliz ation commitments as well as notification requirements special treatment of developing

formal clearly defined commitments to reduce or limit agricultural support9 in addition wto members have agreed to formal procedures for re solving disputes concerning compliance with wto disciplines this report assumes general knowledge of wto rules and procedures however those aspects deemed most relevant for understanding potential challenges to us agricultural prog rams are briefly described

agricultural policy reform commitments to limit and reduce the amount of distortive subsidies directed to their agricultural sectors wto members have agreed to disciplines in agricultu ral support in three broad areas domestic support programs export subsid ies and market access since much of the potential for new challenges of us farm progra ms involves compliance with these policy reform commitments each of these broad po licy reform areas is briefly discussed below domestic support in article 6 of the aa domestic support programs were categorized based on their potential to distort commodity markets13 domestic support that is deemed to have direct effect on agricultural markets is measured by an index referred to as the aggregate measure of support ams14 the ams combines the monetary value of all nonex empt agricultural support into one overall measure the ams includes budgetary outlays in the form of actual or calculated amounts of direct payments to producer s under various commodity programs such as marketing loan provisions input subsid ies and interest subsidies on commodity loan programs as well as revenue transf ers from consumers to producers as result of policies that distort market prices once measured the ams is then subject to reductions and cap however to acco mmodate legitimate dom estic policy goals the aa defined four major categories of dom estic support three of which are eligible for exemption from reduction commitments15 green box this category covers domes tic programs deemed to be minimally or nonmarket distorting such as agricultural research and extension programs16 blue box this category includes s upport that is productionlimited for either crop or livestock production17 product and nonproductspecific minimis

article 8have to be included in the ams calculation18 such commodity specific support can be evaluate d for each individual commodity similarly nonproduct specific support th at is below 5 of the total value of production fo r all commodities may be exempted from ams limits since the value of us agricultural pr oduction averages in excess of 200 billion annually this latter exemption can cover as much as 10 billion in nonproduct specific support amber box after excluding all of the exempted categories the remaining ams support is placed in the amber box us amber box ams has been capped at 191 billion since 2000 each wto member has certain obligations to notify the wto of spending under each of these domestic support categor ies amber box blue box minimis and green box19 the aa is fairly specific on the criteria for designating domestic support programs into the various ams cat egories however each country makes its own designations and there is not alwa ys clean fit between domestic program and wto ams category as result disagreement may arise between wto members over particular pr ogram designation eg exemption status with respect to the ams or whether the support unde r particular program has been fully counted such disagreements may manifest themselves as formal dsu challenges for example as part of its wto cotton cas brazil successfully challenged the us designation of production flexibility contr act pfc payments as fully decoupled and therefore green box compliant20 however increasing tardiness in notifying domestic crop subsidies to the wto particul arly on the part of those countries with the largest domestic subsidies the ited states the eu and japan has diminished the ability of third countries to use notifications as basis for challenge export subsidies the aa imposes limits on direct agricultural export subsidies but not on indirect export s ubsidies indirect methods of export subsidization include government subsidized financing for exports eg export credit guarantees export promotion and information activities tax benefits or other forms of assistance that may lead to lower than normal costs for exported products21 wto members agreed to both volume and value reductions in the use of direct export subsidies from 198690 base period each countrys schedule specifies both how much can be exported with subsidy as well as the permitted subsidy expenditure for each listed commodity wto member ma not initiate new export subsidies for commodities that are not in its country schedule22 because indirect export subsidies are less transparent but may still provide substantial market support their use represents potential source for dispute between nations and may lead to newhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33697crs8 23 aa

program for detailschallenges for example as part of th wto cotton case the panel found that us export credit guarantees operated as prohib ited export subsidies nd were permissible only to the extent that they complied with the export subsidy commitments listed in the us country schedule market access market access refers to the ex tent to which country permits imports within the wto market access re fers more specifically to the conditions governing tariff and nontariff measures ag reed to by members for the entry of specific goods into their markets23 wto members agreed to bind the maximum tariff rates that may be app lied to imported products at base period 198688 levels member countries are free to apply tariff rates that ar below the bound rate but may never apply tariff rate in excess of the bound rate without first consulting the other members most likely to be affected by such change and agreeing on some level of compensation24 in addition to the binding of maximum tariff rates member countries have agreed to reductions in the bound rates as specified in their country schedules in some countries tari ffrate quota trq was established for sensitive products that included minimum lowtariff access quota component and more protected abovequota component the specific quota and tariff rates for all trqs are listed in the country sche dules violations of tariffs and trq provisions are challengeable as are indirect import restrictions in the form of variable import levies discretionary import licensing nontariff measures maintained through state trading enterprises voluntary export re straints and most border measures other than ordinary customs duties however the peace clause did not apply to market access commitments as result the status of wto legal challenges of market access commitments has not changed with the expiration of the peace clause wto subsidy challenges under the peace clause subsidies under the scm agreement as mentioned earlier the agreement on subsidies and countervailin g measures scm establishes formal definitions and rules for subsidies incl uding whether they are prohibited or actionable as well as providing for consultations and dispute settlement prohibited subsidies the scm is explicit in its prohibition of subsidies that directly affect trade25 two types of subsidies are prohibited subsidies contingent upon export performance and subsidies contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods these prohib itions apply except as provided in the aa26 for example in the wto cotton case us step 2 cotton payments to exporters were identified as unscheduled export subsidies while step 2 cotton payments to domestic users were identified as illegal import substitution subsidies27 thus both step 2 payments were subject to the scm agreement prohibition in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33697crs9 28 scm article 47 29 scm article 5 30 the evaluation of wto legal provisions and their potential

13 appended to this memo as appendix b wtos dispute settlement process prohib ited subsidies are treated with greater urgency than are actionable subsidies if policy measure is found to constitute prohibited subsidy under dsu challenge then the dsu panel shall recommend that the subsidizing member withdraw the subsidy without delay28 actionable subsidies actionable subsidies ie those subsidies that are not expressly prohibited but against which legal action may be taken are broadly defined in scm article 5 as those subsidies defined in scm article 1 which cause adverse effects to the interests of other members ie injury to the domestic industry of another member b nullification or impairment of bene fits accruing directly or indirectly to other members under gatt 1994 in particular the benefits of concessions bound under article ii of gatt 1994 c serious prejudice to the interests of another member29 trade analysts have argued that the adverse effects criteria represent lower threshold for achieving successful challeng to agricultural support programs than the injury requirement under counterva iling duty claim this is b ecause under scm article 5 serious prejudice but not injury must be established discussed below30 prior to its expiration the peace cl ause had provided protection from trade remedy consideration for actionable s ubsidies provided that they met certain compliance conditions discussed in the following section the peace clause during the nineyear period from january 1 1995 through december 31 2003 article 13 of the aa known as the due restraint or socalled peace clause exempted most domestic commodity support measures from domestic c ounterva iling duty cvd and dsu challenge so long as the support provided for any specific

level of support received during the be nchmark 1992 marketing year31 in other words for those agricultural support programs in full compliance with the terms of the aa the peace clause provided relief from domestic cvd and dsu challenge provided the value of the support did not exceed the 1992 spending benchmark the intention of the peace clause wa s to allow wto members sufficient time to

on march 21 2005 the wto dis pute settlement body dsb adopted the reports from both the wto appellate body and the original wto panel hearing brazils claims against the us cotton program33 several of the rulings from the cotton case have important implications for future dsu challenges against us farm programs and are brie fly summarized below34 first ruling peace clause violation the existence of the peace clause did not prevent brazil from bringing its case against the us cotton program in part because brazil thought it could prove that th united states was in violation of the peace clauses 1992 spending limit after reviewing the evidence presented the panel found that us cotton support leve ls for each of the marketing years 1999 through 2002 exceeded the peace clauses 1992 benchmark spending threshold as result according to the panel the peace clause exclusion could not be used to protect the us policy measures had brazil failed to show violation of the peacehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33697crs11 35 chad hart the wto picture after the cotton ruling iowa ag review vol 11 2 spring 2005 pp 1011 available at http www cardiastateeduiowa_ag_review spring_05

reduction commitments for the following thirteen commodities wheat coarse grains ri ce vegetable oils butter and butter oil skim continuedclauses 1992 support threshold it is unlikel the panel would have pursued the case further thus demonstrating the importa nt protection provided to domestic support measures by the nowexpired peace clause key element of the panels determination regarding the peace clause was that us production flexibility contract pfc payments made under the 1996 farm bill and direct payments dp made under the 2002 farm bill failed to fully meet the green box conditions for decoupled income support disqualification arises because of planting restrictions on fruits vegetables and wild rice as result the panel ruled that they should count against the us 1992 spending benchmark in its notifications for 1996 through 2001 the united states notif ied pfc payments as fully decoupled green box support thereby not counting against the us ams limit of 191 billion although the panel did not declare that pfc and dp payments should be notified as amber box payments the panel implied as much this particular finding was not part of the serious prejudice finding that required remedy however it establishes precedent for interpreting the notification status of us direct payments as such the ruling represents an obvious vulnerab ility should another country choose to specifically challenge the notification status of pfc and dp payments such dsu challenge if successful would have important implications for the united states ability to meet its domestic s upport commitments what would happen if pfc and dp payments are included as amber box rather than green box two economic analyses conclude that the united states would have violated its ams limit of 191 billion during the years 1998 1999 2000 2001 and 200635 n w legislation would be necessary to make these direct payments green box compliant second finding prohi bited subsidies on sept 8 2004 the panel found that both the step 2 cotton program and the export credit guarantee program acted as prohibited subsidies and shoul d be withdrawn ie termin ated within six months of adoption of the panel report by the wto or by july 1 2005 whichever was earlier36 furthermore the panel found that this applied not just to cotton but to all commodities that benefit from us commod ity support programs and receive export credit guarantees as result us ex port credit guarantees for any recipient commodity are subject to previously scheduled export subsidy commitments for that commodity as listed in the country schedule for the united states this refers to export subsidies listed under the export nhancement program eep and the dairy export incentive program deip37 among those commodities eligible for

41 wto dispute settlement body dsb sets up compliance panel to review us implementation of cotton rulings 2006 news item september 28 2006deip the panel found that us rice exports received export credit guarantee benefits in excess of its eep volume commitments the panel found that all unscheduled program commodities such as cotton receivi ng export credit guarantee benefits were also in violation of wto commitments the panel ruling on export credits hinged on determination that the financial benefits returned to the government faile d to cover longrun program expenses thus implying that they functioned effectively as export subsidies38 an amendment to the statute is needed to eliminate the lleged subsidy component of export credit guarantees ie below market user fees due to 1 cap on user fees for gsm102 the primary export credit program this statutory cap prevents charging higher riskbased fees as recommended by the pane l other us trade assistance programs such as the various market development programs appear to operate within wto rules however if brought under more intensive scrutiny they could be vulnerable to interpretation charging that they effectively function as export subsidies which would potentially subject them to scheduled export subsidy commitments39 third finding serious prejudice the panel ruled that the united states should remove the prejudicial effects of pricecontinge nt support measures including marketing loan provisions step 2 paymen ts market loss payments and counter cyclical payments the extent of program change needed for compliance is not clear particularly since the step 2 program ended on august 1 2006 and market loss payments have been made since 2002 howe ver brazil claims the right to impose retaliatory tariffs

with wto commitments may be subject to dsu challenge under various legal provisions of the gatt 1994 and the scm agreement42 one legal analysis of the potential for postpeaceclause dsu challenges undertaken by steinberg nd josling suggests that the most likely avenue for future dsu challenges against the alleged adverse effects of us farm programs under scm article 5 would be claims of seri ous prejudice as defined in scm article 5c primarily because this pr ovision contains the lowest threshold that challenge must meet43 scm article 6 defines the nature of serious prejudice and the cases in which it may be said to exist in particular ar ticle 63 provides that serious prejudice in the sense of paragraph c of article 5 may arise in any case where one or several of the following apply the effect of the subsidy is to displace or impede the imports of like product of another member into the market of the subsidizing member b the effect of the subsidy is to displace or impede the exports of like product of another member from third country market c the effect of the subsidy is significant price undercutting by the subsidized product as compared with the price of like product of another member in the same market or significant price suppression price depression or lost sales in the same market d the effect of the subsidy is an increase in the world market share of the subsidizing member in particular subsidized primary product or commodity as compared to the average share it had during the previous period of three years and this increase follows consistent trend over period when subsidies have been granted44 scm article 64 adds further precision to the nature of market displacement identified in article 63b by indicating that displ acement may be demonstrated by showing that change in relative market shares has occurred to the disadvantage of nonsubsidized like product steinberg and josling conclude that the biggest challenge to making trade remedy claim under scm article 63 would be to credib ly and reliably establish that agricultural subsidies are causing seri ous prejudice as defined by the above provisions45 steinberg and josling

econometri c model results were included to support the argument of strong dverse policytoprice linkages 46 specifically the wto panel cited four ma in grounds that supported causal link between the implicated us cotton subsidies and significant price suppression47 the united states exerts substantial influence in the world cotton market due to the relative magnit ude of us cotton production and exports the relevant us subsidies are pr ice contingent ie linked directly to world prices for upland cotton thereby insulating us producers from low prices there is discernible temporal coincidence of suppressed world market prices and the pricec ontingent us subsidies and there is divergence between us cotton producers total costs of production and their revenue from co tton sales suggesting that it is the us subsidies that permit cotton sales at prices that fail to cover costs these same criteria are relevant for evaluating the potential vulnerability to future wto legal challenges for

fy2007 appropriations jim monke coordinatorus farm program subsidies overview as mentioned earlier each wto member country is expected to routinely submit notification reports on the implementation of its specific policy reform commitments including domestic farm support outlays to the wto48 the country notifications along with any other pub licly available information on domestic support outlays provide the basis for eval uating and challenging compliance with wto commitments as of this writing the united states has notified domestic support ou tlays for only calendar years 1995 through 2001 however usda routinely publishes estimates of us farm program support for historical current and projected crop years49 in building its case against the us cotton program brazil made ample use of usda public data sources furthermor critical issue for us commodity subsidies with respect to their inclusion in wto legal challenge is not how they were notified to the wto but the extent to which they can be linked to specific commodity this section reviews both us domes tic support notifications and publicly available usda data since 1996 to evaluate the potential vulnerability of us farm commodities to new wto legal challenges this section begins with review of us farm support programs including discussion of differences between actual usda outlays and the ams support levels tified to the wto this is followed by an evaluation of domestic support fo r each of the major us program crops against the criteria for measuring potential linkages between policy and market effects as developed in the first section of this report us domestic support outlays and notifications the united states operates wide rang and large number of federal programs that both directly and indi rectly support us agricultural production for example in fy2006 usda and related agencies the food and drug administration and the commodity futures trading commission r eceived budget authority of an estimated 999 billion that included domestic food assi stance programs agricultural research and extension rural development c onservation foreign aid and commodity programs50 however most of these programs and activities are considered minimally production and trad distorting under the terms of the wto agreement on agriculture aa wto challenge under scm articles 5 or 63 appears likely to focus on those programs that are categorized under th wto criteria as production and tradehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33697crs16 51 for more information on us farm programs see crs report rs21999 farm

agricultural support programs by wto category based on the domestic support notifications submitted by the united states during 19952001 during the 19952001 period the united states notified an annual

payments were eliminated by the 1996 farm bill during that same 19952001 period the united states notified an annual average of 50 billion in green box support outlays the 2002 farm bill farm security

been notified as productspecific ams support see table 2 heading 2 nonexempt direct payments like marketing loan benefits ccp payment are specific to commodity unlike marketing loan be nefits which depe nd on actual production ccp outlays are based on hist orical base acres and national average prices as result ccp payments are decoupled from producer planting decisions but do retain link to market prices because ccp payments were not made until calendar 2003 they have yet to be notified to the wt however the commoditydecoupled but pricelinked nature of ccp payments suggests that they would likely be notified as nonproduct specific ams support under current wto criteria as result ccp would likely qualify for exemption from the ams limit under the nonproduct specific minimis exemption direct payments dp are paid annually and are based on historical base acres and yields as result they do not vary annually based on current production or market conditions dp under the 2002 farm bill are an extension of the plantinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33697crs17 flexibility contract pfc payments of the 1996 farm bill pl 104127 the principal difference between dp and pfc payments is that farmers were allowed to adjust their declared base acres and crops at signup time for the 2002 farm bill as result the share of dp payments across program crops shifted slightly between the 1996 and 2002 farm bills the united states has always notified both dp and pfc to the wto as decoupled greenbox support however the wto panel and appellate body hearing the cotton case ds267 found that dp payments are not fully decoupled because of prohibition on planting fruits vegetables and wild rice on payment acres as result the panel ru led that dp payments did not qualify for inclusion in the green box and theref ore were counted against the 1992 peace clause spending limit discussed earlier this raises the question of whether or not the us will continue to classify direct payments as green box or report them in the future as amber boxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33697crs18 table 1 categorized list of us support programs 19952001 green box programs non or minimally production and trade

based on specific ams criteria the ited states notifie d support under many of these smaller programs including mla payments as noncommodityspecific domestic support such that they qualif ied for the

sources for example mla pa yments were based on specific crop yield conditions similarly the united states has notified its crop insurance subsidies as noncommodityspecific support since all crop production is universa lly eligible for such insurance however most crop insurance subsidies with the exception of adjusted gross revenue insurance can be linked directly to specific insured crop53 government support of crop insurance s expanded greatly in the past decade and is currently available to all crops grown in the united states as result federal crop insurance subsidies have greatly ex panded the pool of subsidized commodities in the united states crop insurance support is administered by usdas risk management agency rma and funded th rough the federal crop insurance fund rather than from the ccc therefore crop insurance subsidies are not included in ccc budget tables since fy2002 government ne t outlays including premium subsidies and government losssharing have averag ed

production is supported indi rectly through import quotas domestic marketing allotments and nonrecourse ans to processors of domestically grown sugar the nonrecourse loan rate varies for refined sugar from sugar cane 18 per lb and from sugar beets 229 per lb as result of these indirect support programs us farm prices for sugar cane and sugar beets are maintained at levels that are substantially above international market prices because of the absence of direct payments price s upport under the sugar and dairy programs is defined by the wto as the difference between the higher protected domestic price and the unprotected inte rnational market price times annual production the relevant pa rameters for calculating pri ce support were measured at the farm gate and fixed by agreement dur ing the uruguay round as result these reference prices do not change even as worl d market conditions fluctuate for dairy the us administered domestic price of 990 per cwt is compared with the international reference price of 725 pe r cwt to obtain the difference of 265 of subsidy per cwt of domestic milk production for sugar the us administered price of 17 per lb is compared with the inte rnational reference price of 105 per lb to obtain the difference of 65 of subsidy pe r lb of domestic sugar production wto measured support for dairy and sugar vari annually with the volume of domestic producti on b ecause of the indirect nature of government support usda direct outlays for dairy and sugar are signifi cantly less than the level of annual ams support notified to the wto prior to th 2002 farm bill us peanut support was calculated in similar manner based on u s administered price of 305 per lb and an international price of 1875 per lb however the us peanut program was revised as part of the 2002 farm bill such that peanuts are now essentially covered commodity and qualify for both market loan benefits and ccp payments the list of commodities that normally do not receive direct support includes meats poultry fruits vegetables nuts and nursery products producers of these commodities however may be affect ed by the support programs because intervention in one farm sector can influe nce production and prices in another for example program commodities such as corn are feed inputs for livestock congress and the administration ofte n provide periodic assistan

even this was not accomplished for sorghum and wheat see figure 1 in the most extreme case market revenue for rice amounted to 70 of total costs but with the addition of subsidies the total reve nue

question of whethe r production would decline without the subsidies some and possibly substan tial portion of the lost production from high cost farms that would leave the sector in the absence of

marketing loan benefits as export subsidies another important issue surrounds the natu re of marketing loan provisions and the contention by other wto members that their benefits should be classified as prohibited export subsidies under us marketing loan provisions commoditys loan rate functions as guaranteed price if market prices fall below the loan rate producers of loan crops are eligible for additional subsidies as either loan deficiency payments ldps marketing loan gains mlgs or certificate exchange gains cegs all of farmers production of loan crop is eligible for marketing loan benefits based on current market conditions making the subsidy payments potentially market distorting when market prices are low the subsidies arguably encourage greater production in spite of mark et signals to do just the opposite in part because the subsidies on average help to cover costs that low market returns are unable to cover thus marketing loan benefits on average offset what would otherwise be revenue losses and encourage greater production than the market wants other wto members such as the eu have argued that if the surplus us production generated by the ma rketing loan benefits is then exported at market price that is below the loan rate and in many cases below the commodities cost of production the marketing loan subsidy is effectively behaving like an export subsidy similarly they contend that the subsidized production displaces imports from other nonsubsidizing countries as result critics argue that because the subsidy provides benefit to us commodity that is not available to competitors exports of likeproducts in either the u s or thirdcountry market it bears all of the hallmarks of prohibited export subsidy figure 9 us share of world production and trade selected program

all of its farm programs including the marketing loan provisions operate within the framework of us commitments to the wto and are therefore in compliance furthermore since the wtos establishment in

part of the federal crop insurance program indemnify for diminished cropspecific revenue whether from reduced yield or from low market pri ces possible option for the next farm bill is to expand

programs by replacing them with sing lepayment program would increase program transparency eliminate program duplication reduce administrative costs and largely eliminate over and undercompensation of

current prices and current planted acres as result th ey are exempted from ams limits under the minimus exclusion whether modifications could make them comply with current or new international subsidy

purchase revenue insurance coverage for up to 90 of losses depending on the particular policy selected65 green payments the term green payments refers to providing financial rewards to producers based

translating the concept of green payments into program this program was enacted as the first true entitlement program for conservation meaning all producers who meet eligibility qualifications would

to the extra costs or loss of income due to requirements of government program including conditions related to production methods or inputs67 thus any sort of incentive payment associated with green

adjustments to the export credit guarantee program to make them more compatible with wto rules finally the proposal includes adjustments to pricecontingent commodity programs ie the marketing loan program and the ccp that would likely make them more wto compliant and potentially lower the vulnerability to ch allenges under the serious prejudice charge69 program buyout an alternative to program decoupling th at has received some attention as part of the 2007 farm bill debate is the idea of program buyout70 under buyout program title i commodity programs w ould be eliminated entirely and

in the reference section at the end of this report and include steinberg and josling 2003 sumner 2003 sumner 2005 fapri 2005 oxfam briefing paper 81 2005 and abare 2006 as general rule these studies support the idea that us and other developed country agricultural support programs ne gatively influence international market prices and tend to disadvantage thirdcount ry trade of nonsubsidized like products while one may disagree with their results the modeling techniques used in these studies are not out of the mainstream of accepted modeling methodology found in the professional economics literature and as taught in agricultural ec onomics departments at us landgrant universities they are included here because of both their adequacy as economic analyses and their usefulness in indicating those commodities and programs that are most vulnerable to potential wto challenge from another wto member country steinberg and josling 2003 steinberg and josling developed series of regression models to evaluate the market ffects of seven classe s of us subsidies for six major commodities barley beef corn milk rice and wheat based on data for the 19862001 period their categories of commodityspecific subsidies were based on definitions devel oped by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and included 1 mark et price support which incorporated the effects of import barriers and export subs idies 2 payments based on output 3 payments based on area planted 4 payments based on historical entitlements 5 payments based on input use 6 paymen ts based on input constraints and 7 payments based on ove rall farming income steinberg and josling performed regression analyses for each commodity market using the market share and export volume cr iteria of article 63 b and the relative market share criteria of article 64 for the ten largest exporting nonsubsidizing wto members ie potential complainants as the dependent variable each of the subsidy categories was included as an indepe ndent variable along with other relevant control variables second regression was included that incorporated the subsidies as single aggregate category steinberg and josling evaluated these regressions for impacts in both us and thirdcountry mark ets with respect to the us market their analyses found significant negative relationship between us subsidies and imports of nonsubsidized thirdcountry product for barley and milk ie higher us subsidies are associated with lower us imports of nonsubsidized likehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33697crs41 products in

model the subsidies influence us producer behavior primarily through net returns per acre for cotton relative to competing crops on the demand side subsidies influence the net price paid by buyers of us cotton the sumner cotton model was simulated for the removal of all subsidy programs as well as for each individual component subsidy for the fiveyear period 20032007 because the ldp and ccp program payments va ry with market conditions their influence also varied from year to year as market conditions changed over the fiveyear period the removal of all us cotton s ubsidies led to an annual aver age reduction in us cotton production of over 27 reduction in us cotton exports of nearly 43 and an increase in the world cotton price of almost 12 although the united states argued str ongly against inclusion of the sumner cotton model as relevant evidence of serious prejudice primarily on technical modeling grounds rather than on the substa ntive value of econometric modeling per the panel noted that we observe that the simulations were prep ared by experts and explained to the panel by experts the outcomes of the simulations are consistent with the general proposition that subsidies bestowed by member governments have the potential to distort production and trade nd the elimination of subsidies would tend to reduce artificial incentives fo r production in the subsidized member this is one of the underlying rationales for the establishment of the subsidy disciplines in the scm agreement72 as result it is not unreasonable to assume that the sumner cotton model results supported if not directly contributed to the panels general finding in support of brazils challenge sumner 2005 in followup analyses published by the cato institute sumner used similar analytical approach to review the vulnerability to wto legal challenge of us program subsidies for corn wheat rice and soybeans cotton was also included for comparative purposes73 first looking at the 2004 to 2006 period sumner evaluated the magnitude of us crop subsidies by comparing total subsidy outlay to the value of production for each crop the subsidys share of production ranged in importance from 5 to 7 fo r soybeans and 15 to 45 for corn up to 80 for cotton in 2005 and 78 for rice in 2004 table 9 in addition the subsidies were examined in relation to net returns market revenue minus costs of production net returns were evaluated with and without subsidies for 2003 through 2005 for every case per acre average co sts exceeded per acre market returns without subsidies it is only with the ddition of the subsidy that net returns cover costs in 7 out of 12 cases this preliminary comparison based on limited number of years would suggest that subsidy paym ents have had substantial market impact particularly for rice and cornhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33697crs43 74 ibid p 23table 9 evaluating the importance of us crop subsidies cropsubsidy share of production net returns without subsidy

the causal linkage between us crop subsidies and international market prices the model assumed that the extent to which subsidies caused market price suppression depended on the subsidy rate relative to the value of production the degree to which the subsidy provided production incentive ie the extent of coupling the share of the subsidized producti on in the relevant world market the share of demand in each market and the supply and demand elasticities in the us and world markets sumner found that us subsidies for cor n wheat and rice were associated with substantial degree of market price suppre ssion removing us subsidies for these crops resulted in world price increases of 9 to 10 for corn 6 to 8 for wheat and 4 to 6 for rice these rates of change compare with world price impact of over 12 associated with us cott on subsidies in sumner 2003 in his cato institute paper sumner included several additional highly relevant observations in regards to potential wto legal challenges of us commodity programs in particular he observed that challenges based on serious prejudice need not be global in scope but can be re stricted to specific geographic market or product submarket74 sumner argues that such geographically restricted claims may in many instance be stronger and more easily defended than claims that embrace one commodity in the global marketplace for example mexico japan and taiwan are major markets for subsidized us corn and displacement of corn exports from argentina is likely and could present th opportunity for geographicallyfocused challenge similarly us sales of subsidized wheat into major markets like japan china mexico and various middle easter n and asian markets are also potentiallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33697crs44 75 ibid 76 ibid 77 ibid 78

exporter of all major classes of wheat har d red winter soft re d winter white wheat hard red spring and durum and ri ce varieties indica and japonica sumner observed that to the extent that many th irdcountry markets are segmented by preference for specific wheat class or ri ce variety an analysis focused on specific class or variety might actually implicate th united states as playing larger market role in terms of production and export share than for the generic commodity75 also evidence of displacement of quantities might be more direct in localized geographic market as specific example sumner points out that while the united states has relatively small share of world rice trade for indica longgrain rice the us share of indica rice trade in central and latin america and the caribbean is significantly larger uruguay has recently claimed that us exports to those and other markets hinder its ability to market nonsubsidized indica rice that competes directly with heavily subsidized us rice76 sumner also suggests that the us dairy subsidies probably create more vulnerability to wto claims than any remaining farm subsidy77 not only are dairy price supports substantial portion of u s ams notifications averaging nearly 41 of total us amber box subsid ies notified to the wto during 19952001 table 2 but sumner points out that the price discrimination and pooling schemes under the milk marketing orders stimulate overall milk production and divert milk from beverage products that are generally not traded internationally to manufactured dairy products eg cheese milk powder and butter which are the main traded dairy products the net result is lower price of the tradable products and displacement of us imports or stimulation of us exports to the detriment of other dairy export competitors such as australia or new zealand78 with respect to the us sugar program sumner points out that benefits for us sugar producers derive mainly from the im port trq scheme and that although the price support scheme cont ributes more than 1 b illion nnually to the us ams table 2 it provides little additional distorti on above that caused by the wto scheduled trq as such he concludes that the suga r program does not appear to be likely candidate for wto legal challenge in its present form79 sumner expresses concern that detailed analysis might reveal prohibited subsidies for commodities supported under sma ller programs such as markethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33697crs45 80 ibid 81 fapri potential impacts on us agriculture of the us october 2005 wto proposal fapriumc report 1605 december 15 2005 research and development programs crop insurance irrigation subsidies etc 80 this might occur for example if the program provided benefit to us commodities that is not available to an imported commodity or to competitor exports of likeproducts in thirdcountry markets as final observation sumner notes that two important domestic support programs irrigation subsidies and subs idized grazing on governmentowned land have been classified as nonproductspeci fic ams subsidies as such they have been excluded from the amber box under the minimis exclusion throughout the 19952001 notification period sumner suggests that subsidized grazing fees represent low benefits relative to market revenue for the beef sector the primary beneficiary and are therefore unlikely to contribute to wto violations with respect to irrigation subsidies sumner notes that although larger in value than grazing fees they are also generally small in value relative to the revenue of benefitting crops furthermore irrigation subsidies are both difficult to measure and difficult to attribute to specific crop fo r both of these reasons brazil chose not to add irrigation subsidies to the list of u s programs supporting cotton in the wto cotton case fapri 2005 in december 2005 the food nd agricultural policy research institute fapri released report summarizing its analysis of the potential market effects of the us policy reform proposal made as part of the doha round of trade negotiations81 fapri employed largescale multicommodity multicountry economic simulation model to evaluate th various market effects of hypothetical policy scenarios in its analysis of the us doha proposal fa pri evaluated several policy reform scenarios including scenario based on unilateral us policy reform ie policy changes in other countri with offsetting greenbox direct payment compensation to producers for loss of program benefits specifically the us proposal offered the following reduction in us domestic support 60 cut in the total amber box ceiling from 191 billion to 76 billion cut in the minimis threshold from 5 to 25 of total production value productspecific ams caps ba sed on 19992001 levels and redefined blue box with an expanded definition to permit inclusion of ccp payments but with new ceiling on qualifying subsidies of 25 of total production value per commodity blue box subsidies are presently unlimited in addition to the domestic subsidy re duction several mark et access concessions were incorporated into the study including the elimination of export subsidies by 2010 substantial reductions of tariff upper bounds and the expansion of trqs from current levels by 75 of average domestic consumption during 19992001 it should be noted that an analysis of the us proposed reduction of 60 in amber boxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33697crs46 82 fapri applies repetitive stochastic estimation technique to its simulation model that generates 500 outcomes for each scenario it is these outcomes that are evaluated to ascertain scenario effects based on this pproach fapri reduced target prices and loan rates for major program crops until the incidenc of the stochastic outcomes violating the aggregate spending limit occurred in 5 or less of each scenarios 500 outcomessupport does not compare directly with an analysis of the co mplete elimination of us farm support as would be needed to investigate their full market effects however by studying unilateral us policy reform ie independent of multilateral reform this partial reform scenario provi des at the least some indication of the extent to which policy reform can reduce the causal linkage between us farm supports and the adverse market effects of scm article 5 since there is unique set of policy ad justments required for the us to meet its proposed support comm itments and the us pr oposal contained program specific recommendations fapri made certain assumptions regarding how support programs would be altered to obtain the proposed 60 reduction in us amber box support the current regime of us polic parameters offers only few options with the major policy levers being target prices and loan rates simply reducing absolute spending levels or fully d ecoupling spending are alternat options not considered by fapri to remain somewhat neutral regarding the issue of equity across programs and commodities fapri applied uniform percentage cuts to commodity loan rates and target prices so as to achieve the aggregate spending goals82 the required cuts included an 11 reduction in commodity an rates and the milk support price 16 reduction in sugar loan rate s adopted to avoid public stock accumulation targets under ex pected import increases 7 reduction in commodity target prices sugar and butter trqs were expanded by 75 of the 19992001 average consumption level and fixed direct payments are assumed to be greenbox compliant incontrast to the nongreenbox co mpliant determin ation under the wto cotton case under this scenario of domestic s upport reductions usda commodity credit corporation ccc outlays declined by an annual average of 35 billion from 165 billion to about 13 billion over 80 of the reduction in subsidies was accounted for by three crops corn 42 soybean s 19 and cotton 19 the majority of the annual average reduction in ccc outlays came from two programs marketing loan benefits 19 billion and ccp payments 13 billion with respect to wto subsidy categories us productsp ecific amber box subsidies declined from an average of 94 billion per year in the baseline to 50 billion under the scenario while ccp outlays declined from 31 billion to 18 billion per year however the individual commodity price and trade effects of this limited policy reform scenario were generally very small only peanut rice and cotton scenario prices exceeded baseline levels by more than 1 the largest average price change was for peanutshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33697crs47 at 24 us annual average export declin under the scenario were greatest for cotton 41 and rice 22 part of the relatively small market effects resulting from 60 cut in the us domestic support ceiling to 76 billion resu lts from significant portion of the reduction being water that is unus ed but allowable support under the 191 billion ceiling for example from 1995 to 2001 us amber box spending averaged 11 billion see table 2 total nonexempt ams outlays this would suggest that the effective cut in actual domestic sp ending under the us pr oposal is much smaller 31 from 11 billion to 76 billion than the 60 cut in the ams ceiling at any rate the limited market effects resulting under the us doharound proposal when compared with the more substantia l effects found in steinberg and josling 2003 sumner 2003 and sumn er 2005 suggest that pa rtial policy reform of the nature suggested by the us doha round proposal would provide only modest decoupling between us commodity subsidies and their adverse effects as result us subsidy programs would appear to remain vulnerable to wto challenge under scm article 5 and 63 following policy reform like the us doha proposal oxfam briefing paper 81 2005 in paper from report series written to inform public bate on development and humanitarian issues the international development organization oxfa

cotton program oxfam claims in its report to reveal add itional us and eu subsidies that are illegal under wto rules while several us commodity groups have questioned the objectivity of report published by development organization that advocates on behalf of developing countries the report and its results are indicative of the type of scrutiny under wh ich us farm support programs are likely to be placed in the postpeaceclause trade environment based on review of previously publis hed work oxfam suggests that three major us field crops corn rice and sorghum are particularly vulnerable to future wto legal challenge table 10 according to oxfam major exporters of these crops could challenge us domes tic subsidy payments under scm articles 5c and 63 b and c ie serious prejudice due to export displacement and market price suppression while major im porters of those crops from the united states could challenge the us domestic subsidies paid to those crops under scm article 5a ie injury to the domes tic industry of another wto member in supporting its arguments oxfam cites evidence that for each crop the united states is major producer and exporter market returns fail to cover pr oduction cost for an average us producer without government subsidies government subsidies provide substantial portion of annual average returns to each sector and relevant economic
