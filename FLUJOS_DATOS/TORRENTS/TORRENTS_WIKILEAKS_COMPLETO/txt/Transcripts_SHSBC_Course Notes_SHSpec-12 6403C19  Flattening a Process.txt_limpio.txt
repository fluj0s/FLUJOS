6403c19 shspec12 flattening process an auditor can lay aside some basic fact do something else and then wonder why he is having trouble flattening process is such fact there are two aspects to ending process both having to do with what you are doing with the process 1 fixing the pc up so that he can be audited rudiments 2 auditing the pc this gives you two different endings in rudiments you are doing just enough to cure the elsewhereness of the pc you dont want any ptp to get in the road of auditing use the ruds kit to brush off pt hassles destimulate the pc and get on with what you started as major cycle not knowing this you will never complete cycle of action on pc you will keep on having to audit outruds never finishing cycle because you dont use tools of destimulation to push the outrud out of your road the other extreme is to abandon prepcheck or some major action because the pc had little cognition about something dont use rudslike whisk broom on major action you dont end off in three minutes with little bitty cog you use the ta and you get action off the area you have to unflatten subject before you can flatten it running all the ta out of it that is mainbodyofthesession auditing mainsession auditing is all done with the ta never as with the rudiments if you use the wrong approach you will get the wrong ending and the pc will go nowhere you have to restimulate the pc to audit him you only leave major actions when the ta is off you dont chicken out and say oh it is seeming bit better now is it fine thats cog so we will end off now flunk auditing by list is like r2h you could use sec check list carefully not impinging on the pc not restimulating anything to audit but that is not the way to handle the body of the session where you really want to handle things the approach you use in the ruds is to restimulate nothing so that you can get in and audit something else later auditors who treat bodies of sessions like rudiments damage the pc because they leave processes unflat all sorts of charge will have been left bypassed if this happens the effect of this is dramatic and fastacting in r6 it is less so at lower levels but the long term result is the same you could run what process has been left unflat and get considerable gain what happens if you start prepcheck on one thing and shift to another thing before you finish for one thing the pcs ability to be prepchecked will suffer he will be harder to prepcheck also if you prepcheck with bad comm cycle the tool would get blunted you could even prepcheck prepchecking or prepcheck each prepcheck button the basic reason why prepcheck button goes out is an incomplete cycle of action thetans have bug on continuing they like to see cycles continue that gives the longevity and mass of the physical universe at low level any case is subject to the cycle of action fatalism is total subjugation of the individual by the cycle of action what will be will be the individual is at total effect people are in agreement with the cycle of action but not because it is ultimate truth however it only fades out way up there at higher levels you can widen your timespan and do various odd things with time everybody is used to and in agreement with the cycle of action so it is reality but not truth that you use in auditing violations of it bring about an unreality that is what happens if you start an auditing cycle with pc and dont finish it the pc is parked in the middle of some incompletely asised mass which he carries on into the next process and so on things start looking more and more complicated to the pc as these incomplete cycles stack up freedom is real to him as completing cycle of action so there is both the mass that he hasnt asised and the incompleteness of the cycle the idea of win usually goes along with the cycle of action one wins when one accomplishes something even if it is just the accomplishing of still being there the upper echelon of this comes under intention intention is part of but senior to the comm cycle it has in it every power the thetan has including the power to throw lightning bolts to hold position to make something continue to do away with something strength accomplishment and wit when you are halfshot as thetan when you are pretty bad off but not yet in body when you are pretty gummed up with mass your intention is still quite good enough to intend the emeter across the desk or crayon into the air or the telephone receiver off the cradle the ability to intend is all there is to thetans power all you have to do to weaken thetan is to foul up his intentions which you can do by blunting or giving him loses on his intentions weakness is the only thing that traps the thetan that holds him down etc so the main thing we have to watch in auditing is that we dont weaken the pcs own intention never blunt the pcs own intentions to avoid doing this we must differentiate between the pcs intentions and his bank dramatizations dramatizations are not intended validate the pc not the bank you dont ruin pc by blunting his intentions but you can key in incidents where his intention was blunted if you interrupt cycle of action half way through failure to complete auditing cycles validates the bank and blunts the pcs intentions getting the pcs goals for the session if possible is important in this regard you should at least get them cared for as ruds before getting the body of the session going so that his gis are in and his attention is free so that he has had win in every ptp the pcs intention has been blunted person makes progress when he has ptp because his intentions are blunted he has an intention which something else counters with equal force so that it hangs up in time level v demonstrates this marvellously oppose was the way the power of the thetan was knocked out by taking his goals and intentions and implanting an automatic blunting mechanism the implant gpms themselves oppose each other opposition is the keynote of an implant and it is the only way in which they are aberrative they have too little mass to be really upsetting by themselves it is what has been done to intention that is upsetting children get spoiled not because the get all the want but because they get their reactive intentions validated eg they get rewarded for tantrums and they get their analytical intentions opposed ie the child is not allowed to do what he wants analytically the auditor who only pays attention to pc when he arc breaks is doing the same thing pcs dont turn nasty they get overwhumped by the bank when their own intentions are blunted and the bank dramatizes person who is weakened is unable to hold anything at distance so everything collapses on him if you dont so anything about the pcs intentions you get the pcs dramatizations the auditors intention is valuable to the session because he is less susceptible than the pc to dramatization in the pcs bank his intention is senior to the pcs but if the pcs intention is neglected it weakens and we get an increased chance of dramatization the pcs analytical intentions are also valuable to the session down deep the pc intends to get freedom and return of power ie return of intention he can now go all the way if he works along certain path the intention for him to arrive is sotto voce in the pc and more explicit in the auditor since the auditor isnt getting distracted by the bank the pc can mix up freedom and escape and not want to confront things person is weak to the degree that he has allowed his intention to be blunted and strong to the degree that his intention is free thetans become worried about and hold back their intentions because they have been convinced that their intentions are out of their control and that they can cause bad effects as result if you asked pc what intentions do you have to keep under wraps you would get roaring automaticity scientology can get ahead partly because people attacking scientology have idea what our intentions are world of wars insanity etc is very unreal to them they think that couldnt be their real intention so they attack nonexistent intentions which is why they come off looking like asses if case is recovering he is really just removing his blunted intentions ie he is removing the obstacles that he has put there or agreed to doingness intention has time added to it therefore it is tied into the cycle of action pure intention doesnt necessarily involve time or cycle of action or space you could make an intention in the past present or future time and space are the result of intention which is senior to them as pc comes downscale to normal levels though his agreement with cycle of action results in the disappearance of his intention out of the cycle of action if you take someone who is having terrible time you can show him cycles of action with shortsessioning cchs etc eventually his own intentions start to free up out of the mestiness of it all the only way the auditor can foul this up is to leave his own cycles of action incomplete if we are going to have wins we must validate analytical intention knock out dramatizations and complete cycles of action by flattening processes within the reality of the process involved and in accordance with how much is there to be flattened if you can get an auditing cycle completed you will get win if you dont you will get lose it is that simple
