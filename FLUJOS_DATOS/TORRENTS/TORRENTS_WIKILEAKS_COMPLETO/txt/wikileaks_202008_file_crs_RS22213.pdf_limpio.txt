the ability to claim deduction for charitable contributions that are in the form of conservation easements2 under current law donors may claim deduction for qualifying charitable contribution of an interest in real property that is exclusively for conservation purposes3 conservation purposes arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22213crs2 4 see 26 cfr 170a14d4iii 5 26 cfr 170a13cthe preservation of land for outdoor recr eation by or the education of the general public the protection of natural habitat of fish wildlife or plants or similar ecosystems the preservation of open space for the scenic enjoyment of the generalpublic or pursuant to clearly delineat ed governmental policy so long as the preservation will yield si gnificant public benefit and the preservation of an historically important land area or certified historic structure the contribution may be in the form of pe rmanent restriction on the propertys use ie an easement including facade easement relating to certified historic structure the value of the contribution is the value of the restriction which is ge nerally determined by comparing the value of the property with and without the restriction the proposal would limit the current deduction in four ways first it would eliminate the deduction for contributions th at involve property used as personal residence by the donor or family member specifically deducti on could be claimed for facade easement relating to structure that recently had been is being or could be expected to be used by the donor or family member as personal residence similarly deduction would be denied for contribution of real property interest if the donor or family member had right to use any of the property as personal residence after the contribution second the proposal would reduce the am ount that could be deducted for contributions of facade easem ents the proposal would limit the deduction to the lesser of 5 of the structures fair ma rket value determined without regard to the facade easement or 33 of the easements value for all other contributions the proposal would limit the deduction to 33 of the fair market value of the contributed interest third the proposal would restrict some of the qualifying conservation purposes as mentioned above contribu tion relating to the preser vation of open space may be deducted if the preservation is pursuant to clearly delineated governmental policy ie specific conservation project4 the proposal would require that this requirement be met for any conservation purpose except for the pres ervation of an histor ically important land area or certified historic structure fourth the proposal would impose require ments on the appraiser who determined the contributions value under current law the donor must receive an appraisal for any contribution in excess of 50005 the proposal would require the appraiser to affirm that the value had been determined in accordance with generally accepted appraisal standards and that he or she met specific requirements relating to his or her ability and eligibility to conduct the appraisalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22213crs3 6 jcs0205 at 282 7 id at 28892 8 irc 170 9 jcs0205 at 290 10 id 11 id at 293307the joint committee staff explaine d the reasons for the proposal charitable deductions of qualified conserva tion contributions including conservation and facade easements present serious policy and compliance issues valuation is especially problematic because the measure of the deduction is highly speculative considering that in general there is market and thus comparable sales data for such easements in many instances presen t law does not require that the preservation or protection of conservation be pursuan t to clearly delineated governmental conservation policy only requiring such policy in cases of open space preservation if the preservation is not for the scenic enjoyment of the general public as result taxpayers and donee organizations have c onsiderable flexibility to determine the conservation purpose served by an easement or other restriction enabling taxpayers to claim substantial charitable deductions for conservation easements that arguably do not serve significant conservation purpose6 clothing and household items the joint committees staff also proposed to limit the deduction that may be claimed for contributing clothing and household items7 under current law donor typically deducts the fair market value of these items subject to the general restrictions on charitable deductions8 the proposal would limit the deduction to 500 per year the cap would apply to both new and used items household items would not include food objects of art antiques jewelry and collections the joint committee staff explained that th reason for the 500 cap is to address the problem with donors overvaluing their c ontributions of these types of goods while still allowing reasonable deduction9 the amount of the cap was chosen because under current law donors who give more than 500 in noncash goods must generally report the gift to the irs the joint committee staff felt that linking the cap and the reporting requirement woul d minimize the filing burdens of taxpayers and donee organizations10 appreciated property the proposal would also modify the existin g rules for contributions of appreciated property11 under current law the deduction for ch contribution is generally the fair market value of the property on the date of contribution the deduction is reduced to the taxpayers basis the propertys cost plus or minus certain adjustments for contributions of ordinary income property property that would not result in longterm capital gain ifhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22213crs4 12 irc 170e 13 id at 296 14 idsold tangible personal property that is used by the donee in manner unrelated to its exempt purpose and property for the use of private foundation12 in general under current law if th donor claims deduction exceeding 500 for noncash contributions he or she must repor t the contributions on form 8283 the return includes such information as description of the property the donors basis and whether the property will be used for the donee orga nizations exempt purpose if the donee organization sells or disposes of property with claimed value in excess of 5000 within two years of the contribution then the orga nization must generally file form 8282 with the irs and furnish copy of the return to the donor the joint committee staffs proposal has two options the first option would limit the deduction for any contribution of appreci ated property to the lesser of the donors basis in the property or the pr opertys fair market value this rule would not apply to contributions of publiclytraded securities qualified intellectual property qualified vehicles or property that qualified for the enhanced deduction under irc 170e the second option would be the same as th first option but with an exception for contributions of exempt us property property used by the donee organization to substantially further its exempt purpose thus for this property the existing rule would continue to apply so that the deduction c ould equal the property s fair market value there would be rules to recapture the deducti on if the donee organization disposed of the exempt use property within three years additionally the second option would change the current reporting requirements for form 8283 the donee organization would have to explain the intended use of any property for which deduction of more than 500 was claimed for form 8282 the donee organizati on would have to report any disposition of this property if made within three years of the contribution the joint committee staff explained that its reasons for the proposal include addressing the fact that while error and abuse occurs with respect to the overvaluation of this property in part because these are not arms length transactions since the donee has taxrelated reason to question the donors va lue it is often not costeffective for the irs to pursue overvaluation issues13 further the joint committee staff reasoned apart from the issues of valuation and enfo rcement the fair market value deduction for property contributions raises separate policy questions the fair market value deduction for property generally places gifts of cash and gifts of property on an equal footing primary goal of the charitabl deduction however should be to encourage gifts that are most useful to charitable organization and should not be to encourage gifts that entail significant diversion of resources from the charitable mission or that require charity to incur substantial transa ction costs cash publicly traded securities and arguably property that can be used directly in substantial furtherance of exempt purposes meet this standard other gifts of property generally do not and so need not be as favored14
