dear tim thanks for your comments some responses to them are given below ill be too busy for further correspondance as i prepare for travel leaving friday morning for week since i will be away and unreachable through next wednesday i would thus request that you and keith correspond with my coauthors ray bradley who should be able to respond upon his return from current travel on sunday monday and malcolm hughes on the revisions please cc to so i can read upon my return as i will be unreachable im sure we can come up with something mutually agreeable to all of us with this piece as is my goal with ipcc as long as their is proper communication and mutual understanding by all concerned lets strive for thischoice of language is nontrivial element best regards mike ____________________________comments________________________ one additional new comment 0 1st page in attemping to do thismann at alexemplifies is unacceptable language to us we confront the very problems that are being discussed here so it is disservice to us to say our paper exemplifies these problems it exposes or confronts would be fair language but exmemplifies is unacceptable responses to your responses to my original comments 1 im not sure how to interpret your response visavis my original comments here my point is that our use of southern hemisphere records in the reconstructions is fundamentally sound from the point of view of some very basic principles of optimal interpolation etc and given the domain we are reconstructing which is not nh only although we diagnose nh from our pattern reconstructions as key index there is basis for what sounds like criticism of our use of such data i couldnt tell if you were agreeing with this or not from your commments 2 the uncertainties are determined from the uncalibrated variance given certain predictor network the predictor network is unchanged from 1820 to present so the verification period 18541901 unresolved variance is an independent check on the calibration period unresolved variance both gives numbers in the range of 30 for the nh mean temperature reconstruction meaning that the error bars we determine from verification period are essentially the same as those we determine from the calibration period in this sense the error bars as determined from calibration and verification are essentially identical the bottom line if we had used the verification period to estimate the error bars the eye would barely see the difference there may be considerable misunderstanding on yourkeiths part regarding regarding what is actually shown by the spectrum of calibration residuals in our grl paper it does not in any way conflict with what i indicate above what this particular diagnostic shows is that there is evidence of any increase in unresolved secular variance ie centuryscale and longer in our reconstructions at least back to 1600 in contrast there is evidence that such frequencies are not as well resolved as higher frequencies with the sparser predictor network available before 1600 our estimates of uncertainty take this fact explicitly into account our uncertainties estimates are made up of two components that add in quadrature including component of uncertainty in the lowestfrequency variability as estimated from the spectrum shown and component of the highestfrequency variability from the spectrum shown these are approximated as stepwise break in the mean white noise level of unresolved variance at the edge of the secular band unlike any previous study we have actually estimated the increased uncertainty due to the loss of lowfrequency variability as it can best be estimated and this is explicitly incorporated into our error bars which is why those error bars expand considerably before 1600 this is discussed in the grl paper and is very important fact it would be very unfortunate if this fact were misrepresented 3 ill leave this to keith and malcolm to discuss malcom i think it is pretty clear in the paper what our assumptions are here and what the justification is of those assumptions there is of course room for differing opinions on this stuff as it is all somewhat speculative and we indicate that this is so in our paper 4 good enough 5 i really doubt that the 2000 year trend is meaningful and unlike the results we have shown there is confirmation that these 3 sites accurately reflect northern hemisphere mean temperatures to any reasonable level during the modern era work by us and others looking at similar data would suggest that series in such regions are not adequately representative of the largestscale trends there is further verification of the frequencydomain attributes pass any satisfactory test for these reasons i have informed julia uppenbrink directly that i dont believe this series should be shown in this context i agree it is an important series and it will be appropriate to discuss it in ipcc but it should not be considered on par with more statisticallyverified true northern hemisphere mean temperature reconstructions and it is very misleading to show it along with the nh mean reconstructions the 2000 year trend runs absolutely counter to everything we know about the mid holocene extratropical northern hemisphere summer temperatures should have been at an absolute peak 40006000 ybp and the 2000 year trend ought to at least be heading in that direction the fact that is doesnt and that the trend hasnt been verified in the sense discussed above causes real concern it would be misleading to argue we have any reason to believe that nh mean temperatures have done what that series does 2000 years back in time re the adjustment of the series i believe it is fundamentally unsound essentially agreement over the period we can best constrained 20th century has been sacrifices for agreement during the period we cant constrain apparently for the sake of getting the different series to align during the 19th century please download the figures i have prepared for the latest ipcc report ftpeclogitegeoumassedupubmannipccnhemcompareipccgif or ftpeclogitegeoumassedupubmannipccnhemcompareipccps you will see how i have aligned the series based on 19611990 reference period for the instrumental series and 20th baseline adjustment for the alignment of all series to this is the most reasonable adjusment of the series if they are to be shown together it also shows the different that latitudinal variations make explicitly by showing the difference between our true 090 lat weighted nh annual mean temp series and an extratropical 3070 deg lat average from our pattern reconstructions which approaches quite closely the overpeck et 97 and jones et 98 series seasonal distinctions then the key remain difference this is i believe the best approach to the comparisons and the one i will favor in ipcc the alternative is that true nh mean temperatures and extratropical nh mean temperatures must be shown on separate plots because adjusting them the way keith has provides misleading picture and one that i dont believe can be justified for the purposes of ipcc regardless of what you choose to do
