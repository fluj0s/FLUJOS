6110c18 shspec68 valences circuits are all thetans equal some pcs ask all cases are rough but some are rougher than others regardless of equality of thetans however we find that all beings in this area of the universe have the same type of aberration differing only in magnitude of aberration this is contrary to kraepelins index of insanity which points out its many different manifestations the only question answered by such classification is that of how aberrations manifest themselves but all aberrations arise from the same causes having only different manifestations and magnitudes the reason why we are clearing people is that we are taking people out by the same route they went in so you have to parallel what the mind is doing it works like this thetan being and acting in this universe loses confidence in himself in his ability to do and to survive having lost that confidence he then assumes an identity which he considers will stand instead of self he himself goes down into degradation what he is overwhelmed by or what he has overwhelmed consistently is adopted by him as package of behavior and that is valence valence is substitute for self taken on after the fact of lost confidence in self as thetan sinks into degradation and lost confidence in self he goes down into personal oblivion so that he has further memory of self but only memory of valence having taken on this valence he then carries it on as mechanism of survival he does life continuum actually of what he has overwhelmed or what has overwhelmed him at the point of degradation you will find it backtracking this way just before he assumed the valence he has problem concerning his own survival that he himself could not solve as himself just before that problem there was tremendous confusion in which by process of overts and withholds he became enturbulated at himself these overts and withholds were against the various dynamics that was the route by which he went in he missed his way and had overts and withholds against the mores of the group in which he was operating and he lost confidence in himself completely he felt he couldnt go on as himself which gave him tremendous problem relating to survival he felt he couldnt solve this problem so he adopted an identity he thought would stand as solution to this problem then he went on as that identity now that identity was in turn submerged by the same cycle as the identity while member of the group the thetan committed overts and had withholds from members of the group which produced an insoluble problem the thetan usually solved the problem by the acceptance not of another valence but of change to another status the cycle is always the same while member of group having certain goals he commits overts and has withholds from other group members from which arises confusion this confusion summates into problem which he then solves by _______ the _______ is the only variable early on the track the thetan always used valence but the common denominator of all his solutions is change this has always been an element that is equally true of the first assumption of valence and of every new lifetime etc the whole of the buddhist concern was the lifedeath cycle the goal of the buddhist is to escape the cycle hes afraid of change because he could become responsible for wider changes this is almost on the principle that if i shirk enough responsibility ill just float out of my head unfortunately it doesnt work it is true that occasionally accidentally thetan can sit down and go out of his head sproingg the way he does it is that he has set up an escape mechanism to spring him out of dead bodies like fighter pilot ejection seat usually they dont work every now and then one works its actually mocked up heavyenergy guillotine pcs think that if they feel enough pain they wont be able to think so they set this up to be triggered by pain at certain time they get enough pain and the guillotine is supposed to knock off the body so people wind up by now with the belief that you have to kill body to get out of it actually unless you had overts on the body you would practically float out of it people who are going around sick may have triggered the ejection mechanism and had it fail to kill the body or eject them its failed solution one of the mechanisms of the series of truths the buddhists believed was that the world was horrible poverty stricken etc the basic truths they put out were so interlarded with these other exaggerations overts and unkind thoughts criticisms and so on that it operated as selftrapping mechanism if you get guy to be still long enough you will key him in like crazy all the motions of the past will come in and kick him in the head why do you find pc sitting in the middle of problem sitting there with that solution and why is it such still solution its still point on the track and every time the pc has tried to rest hes practically been overwhelmed when you get the problem out of the way and look back for the motion and confusion the motion and confusion run and the still spot disappears the still spot is held there by the pressure and duress of an active spot behind or earlier than the still spot so when the pc tries to rest the motion threatens to overwhelm him as it gets restimulated so its upsetting to him to be still theres nothing to do once one has blown out of ones head so the goal of the buddhist must have been to do nothing that is the defeatist goal people in defeat will say they want to do nothing in some variety of ways of course the nothingness is the point of overwhelm so people who yearn for nothingness inadvertently yearn to be overwhelmed so every great culture strives for peace they get so much peace theres so much peace everywhere that some barbarian comes along and knocks the whole thing off they achieve perfect nomotion which is death so thetans ambitions can often be contrary to his best interests this is not surprising in view of the fact that there are real liabilities to being thetan except the liability of interest inaction nothing to do or have or be nowhere to go when you see people preaching these you see people in the finest possible games condition they are playing game of seeing other players overwhelmed using the mechanisms of the track which would most easily overwhelm the other players it is not really in the best interest of the other to advise rest peace and inaction the proof of this are all over the place eg soldier gets wounded gets frontline first aid result lower death rate for wounds treated there than for similar wounds treated at the base hospital society subscribes to the idea that someone can kill himself with work this is complete red herring how does thetan get sick you know that when you release the still he is stuck in hell get well what has happened to thetan that he doesnt just heal up an injured body on the spot he has been leading too quiet life thats all people in circuses take falls that would kill regular person the only reason an injured body doesnt spring back into shape is that its held out of shape by stills things wrong with people are held wrong with considerable energy the effort it takes to stay crazy must be fantastic the best way to get sudden recoveries is to run withholds because withholds are the motion before the still that was going on while the person was not participating with the motion he was withholding himself from the motion so he was already being slightly still he eventually withdraws so hard from the motion and commits so many overts against the other participants in the motion that he backs out all the way and becomes still when you havent any right to be part of motion any longer you have only one other choice to be still thats the mechanism by which you can get confusion overts and withholds becoming problem problem is the still after the problem comes the solution to the problem of course since the problem is motionless in time the solution becomes continuous in time now the thetan has the problem of how to get some motion although motion is evidently bad for thetan he nevertheless likes to move and insists on doing it if he hadnt done so much motion in the past his present still would be ok but as with car having its bumper up against another cars bumper should do harm unless it was previously traveling at 165 miles per hour its the motion prior to the still that produces the impact theres nothing wrong with still if there hasnt been some motion and motion is fine if still doesnt occur if you can tolerate both motion and stillness you wont have any trouble but there are certain motions and certain stills thetan cannot tolerate you could move insane people up the track just by giving them huge boulder in the middle of the courtyard to look at to familiarize themselves with still if we look at how thetan got aberrated we see that its cycle of action 1 overts against coaction 2 confusion leading to 3 problem which is stop leading to 4 change to solve the problem the cycle keeps repeating itself the thetan keeps picking up new bodies who are somebody else this really makes it complicated since each of them is an identity he doesnt stack up any new valences however because the basic valence is in there so solid that transient valences dont overwhelm it the basic valence motivated by the basic goal is the biggest single change that takes place in lifetime that is available to an auditor it is available on anyone with whom you can communicate if you cant communicate you can still use cchs they arent used otherwise now that the problems intensive can be used to get off hidden standards what other changes besides valences are available one is new body every death is preceded by an unsolvable problem to which death was the solution new body is solution to death which left the thetan in inaction all illness evolves from unsolved problems its always gradient scale of dying people even get sick when they win prize or get new possessions beyond what they feel they should have to survive it can be too much change and too much havingness unsafe because of ones liability to being attacked thetans arent stupid one of their aberrations may be stupidity but according to the computation on which they are living what they are doing is very clever youll always find that the very stupid have great belief in their cunning often too the very bright consider themselves to be stupid how many changes can occur just after problem in terms of mental changes very few they could suppress or enhance certain characteristics get rid of or adopt certain manifestations and thats about all the earliest step is taking on valence valence both limits and exaggerates persons own skills thetan can only set up valence or circuit to do what he can already do thetan can without body walk out on stage pick up 1000 lb weight turn it around and drop it but hes so dedicated to the idea that it takes strong mans body to do it that he only does it when hes in strong mans body then it gets to the point that he can only do it when in condition when hes well when hes employed to do it when he has problems with his manager when he believes in himself and feels powerful these are all vias the basic truth is that he can just do it each of the limitations and vias he puts in there is solution to problem he couldnt otherwise solve the problem got there because he was trying to get something done as part of group and in that motion has overts and withholds and these resolved into problem the whole cycle has to take place every time to wind up with solution like that the problems and changes you are interested in as an auditor are not very many you are not interested in his being in body he has been in and out of bodies before or he wouldnt be here but what is he doing with this body he isnt being the body he is in he is being valence which is in body in other words hes failed thetan being failed valence in body up to this point hed be easy to communicate with but new problems and changes interpose such things as constant somatics then you are auditing him through the problem which is the constant somatic circuit is like subsidiary valence it is mechanism which modifies valence solution to the realization that the valence can often be wrong so it needs to be dictated to or to have things hidden from it so when the thetan as valence runs into problem where the valence has failed he sets up valence that can think and circuit to modify the thinking of the valence after the thetan has failed everything he adopts after that is subject to failure and each one of them becomes barrier to processing circuit modifies the thinkingness and doingness of the valence it is dictational machine circuits slow down or speed up show things or hide things etc if they get too wild and complicated the person can modify the circuit with somatic when you get this much bricabrac somewhere along the line you could get hidden standard which knows more than the valence which knows more than the thetan hidden standard is just something which knows better to which the thetan is paying attention the thetans concentration on this item can be so great the dependency on it so heavy that the thetan only knows if it knows if it tells him its true if it doesnt tell him its not true when you are auditing him he lets it tell him he pays so much attention to it he hardly sees you at all to some degree everyones attention is absorbed in some part of the bank but where total overwhelm exists attention is so absorbed that only it knows people run totally on social circuitry for instance parents often have totally unreal ideas about their children whom they have never observed at all circuits are often so idiotic that when they are activated by what they are set up to produce they criticize as if it werent there eg one has the circuit childs appearance should be very good so if childs appearance in the vicinity of someone with that circuit is very good hes criticized if the childs appearance is very bad hes ignored this confuses children and causes them to feel betrayed most things that person protests against he will do himself we call this hypocrisy its caused by circuits circuitry is an escape from knowing and confront vias used by the thetan to divorce himself from life when you audit him you are part of life and you will hit his interpositions you will thus be auditing circuit which prevents him from being able to go clear on straight routine 3 if you get off his ptps arc breaks objections to the room etc he is less likely to interpose vias and you can then talk to the pc not the circuit but people have problems of such magnitude on the recent backtrack that they set up permanent circuit so you are always auditing away at the circuit and making slow progress the problems intensive directly handles and knocks out circuits so that you can audit the pc out of the valence he is in
