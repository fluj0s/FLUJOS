military operations tankers increase the range and flexibility of forces and extend the amount of time combat and surveillance aircraft can stay onstation they also extend the range of fighters bombers and other aircraft according to air force leaders clearly the tanker fleet is really some of the very fiber that holds our air forces unique global capabilities together it is an essential enabler for getting to the fight and fighting the fight14 cold war the air force initially began to purchase the kc135 fleet in the mid1950s to refuel newly acquired b52 nuc lear bombers operated by strategic air command15 additionally air refueling played significant conventional role in the vietnam war during the 1960s and 1970s by flying 194687 sorties an average of more than 21000 sorties each year that refueled 813378 aircraft with almost 9 billion pounds of jet fuel16 brief review of recent conflicts indicates the importance of tanker aircraft 1991 persian gulf during the 1991 gulf war tankers contributed to two objectives the speedy deployment of large air forces into the region and the use of these forces in large and complex air combat operations17 first nearly 100 tankers formed air bridges across the atlantic and pacific oceans that allowed fully loaded fighters and bombers to deploy nonstop from us bases directly into the persian gulf region during combat operations

specifications are listed in appendix c service organic air refueling the air force marine corps and navy maintain some air refueling capability to facilitate certain organic capabilities the air force operates modified c130s to re fuel air force speci operations and combat search and rescue helicopters while the marine corps uses modified c130s to refuel marine helicopters and fighters further some navy aircraft have been configured to refuel other navy or mari ne corps aircraft inflight as secondary mission these aircraft give carrier battle groups organic refueling capability when operating independently ho wever carrierbased naval aircraft are capable of providing relatively small fuel offloads in comparison to air force tankers thus the navy primarily relies on the use of air force tankers for longrange flight operations31 air refueling operational concepts air refueling aircraft support wide va riety of aviation missions such as but not limited to surveillance airlift long range bombing battlefield interdiction and air superiority each of these missions requires different aerial refueling capabilities therefore when planning the acquisition of tanker fleet careful consideration must be given to few key attributes for example tanker ai rcrafts method of dispensing fuel flying boom vs probe and drogue is key factor for mission planners for some missions the gross amount of fuel carried by tanker must be weighed against the number of tankers nd the number of refueling points either boom or hose that can be brought to bear finally some tankers can themselves be refueled by other tankers while in flight which can add considerable flexibility to certain air operations boom vs probe and drogue air refueling32 aircraft can be equipped to be refueled from flying boom most air force aircraft or with probe and drogue most navy marine corps and allied aircraft mission planners must ensure that tankers in the field are equipped to connect with their intended receiver aircraft figure 1 illustrates boom air refuelinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34398crs8 source usaf photo by a1c lonnie mast both the kc10 and kc135 can perform both boom and drogue refueling however while kc10s can re fuel either type on the same mission most kc135s must be converted from boom re fueling to drogue or vice versa on the ground this limitation reduces the kc135s ffectiveness in comparison to the kc 10 and potentially in comparison to the kcx which is expected to be equipped to refuel both receiver types on the same mission figure 2 illustrates hose and drogue refueling source usaf photo by tsgt erik gudmundson figure 1 photo of boom air refueling figure 2 photo of hose and drogue air refuelinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34398crs9 33 ibidcapacity vs booms in the air the type and number of receivers boom vs drogue on given mission establishe s the timing location and fuel offload demands for tankers in the field thus the number of tankers required to support mission is sometimes driven by the tankers offload capacity other times tanker mission requirements are based on maintaining sufficient tankers aloft to match the timing and location of r eceiving aircraft needs planners strive to accomplish air refueling missions as efficiently as possible while optimizing the effectiveness of the receivers mission therefore planners must ensure scheduled tankers have sufficient capacity and are scheduled in sufficient numbers to ensure the overall effects desired by joint force commanders33 thus considering the breadth of missions dod might face and considering given amount of money acquisition officials must weigh whether air forces are best served by few tankers with lots of fuel or more tankers each of which would carry less fuel tankers receiver capability tanker that is capable of both giving and receiving fuel in flight may also bolster flexibility for air operations because of the dynamic nature of military operations the type of aircraft planned to fly given mission can change often at the last minute tanker aircraft that themselves can be refueled in the air can help mitigate these last minute changes by serving as an aerial consolidation point tankers that have the wrong refu eling method due to last minute change in mission can offload thei r fuel into another tanker that has the right refueling method optimally all air force tankers would be able to take on fuel while airborne but acquiring this capability costs money how many tankers should have this capability and at what cost issues for congress the kcx program

longevity of the kc135 fleet the 2006 r and analysis of alternatives aoa also looked at the technical condition of the kc 135 fleet the dsb stated that airframe service life corrosion and maintenance cost s factors would potentially determine the kc135s operational life expectancy34 airframe service life kc135s along with their b52 counterparts were originally purchased to give the united states nuclear strategic strike capability as result both fleets of airplanes spent significant amount of time during the cold war on ground alert consequently in 2004 the average kc135 airframe had flown only about 17000 hours of an estimated service life of 36000 hours kc135e or 39000 hours kc135r thus the dsb concluded that kc135 airframe were viable until 2040 at current usage rates35 the 2006 rand aoa also concluded that the kc135 fleet can operate in to the 2040s but not without risks36 corrosion the 2004 dsb task force concl uded that corrosion did not pose an imminent catastrophic threat to the kc135 fleet and that the air forces maintenance practices were postured t deal with corrosion and other aging problems37 the task force went on to say however because the kc135s are true first generation turbojet aircraft designed only 50 years from the time man first began to fly concerns regarding the ability to continue operating these aircraft indefinitely are intuitively well founded38 maintenance costs kc135 maintenance costs were the subject of widespread concern earlier in this decade for example the government accountability office found that kc135 flying hour costs increased by 29 between 1996 and 2002 when adjusted to constant 2002 dollars39 in contrast the 2004 dsb task force agreed that kc 135 maintenance costs had increased significantly but found they had leveled off

of the services41 rands aoa was less conclusive for example the aoa believe it is possible that kc135 will be able to opera in the 2040s however the aoa lacked confidence that future operation could

direction the acting undersecretary for defense for acquisition technology and logi stics directed the air force to conduct an analysis for alternatives aoa for air refueling the aoa had two purposes first to identify lowest cost options for recapitalizing the air forces kc135 fleet and second to inform recapitaliza tion timing the rand corporation was subsequently selected to conduct the aoa and the findings were independently reviewed for sufficiency both within dod nd by the institute of defense analysis44 rand considered the following lternatives for recapitalization newly purchased

air refueling as such rands aoa did not draw conclusions about the impact of various sized aircraft on ramp space and infrastructure in operational scenarios rather rands aoa deferred both matters to senior decision maker judgment46 the 2006 aoa presented the following conclusions regarding kc135 recapitalization new commerciallyderived tankers of medium to larger size 300000 to 1000000 pound maximum gross takeoff weight are the most costeffective alternative specifically the aoa found the airbus 330 and 340 and the boeing 747 767 777 and 787 all to be viable candidates small eg boeing 737 and airbus 321 and very large eg airbus 380 are not cost effective altern atives even in mixed fleets with medium to large sized tankers used commercial aircraft are not as costeffective as buying newcommercial aircraft however the cost penalty is not high enough to exclude this option under certain circumstances note this option will be discussed later in this report newdesign tankers are not costeffective alternative unmanned tankers are not costeffective alternative stealthy tankers are significantly more expensive than nonstealthy tankers although they offer some effectiveness benefits the aoa defers to military judgement to determine if the additional capability exists to justify the increased cost there is compelling reason for the air force to outsource aerialrefueling note this option will be discussed later in this report 47 how many tankers does the air force need air refueling requirements ultimately derive from the presidents overall national security strategy based on

aggression and coercion and set conditions for future operations even when committed to limited number of lesser contingencies the armed forces must retain the capability to swiftly defeat adversaries in two overlapping military campaigns additionally when the president calls for an enduring result in one of the two the force must have the capability and capacity to win decisively48 accordingly the

driver for future aerial refueling needs is the number and type of nearly simultaneous major operations50 as such the task force examined 2003 opera tions in iraq as basis for informing requirements

to be built from the outset with reinforced floors necessary for carrying either passengers or cargo in the fuselage cargo door size d to facilitate loading and offloading and defensive systems

important relative to the first three criteri on lastly the air force regarded factors 1 2 3 and 5 when combined to be signif icantly more important than factor 477 rfp analysis there was considerable comment in the media questioning whether the draft december 2006 of the kcx request for pr oposal rfp was biased toward the capabilities apparent in boeings kc767 close review of this rfp was partially the result of the c ontroversy surrounding the 2001 tanker lease proposal it is important to note within th is context that the primary consideration in dods overall weapon acquis ition system is designed to be meeting warfighter requirements not what is most profita ble to company x or company northrop grumman and airbus reportedly complained that the original kcx rfp did not adequately address how the air for ce would evaluate the candidate aircrafts airlift capability reportedly they feared that the air force might not weight the score of kc30s airlift cap abilities in favorable manner in the absence of detailed airlift eval uation information however airbus could have offered smaller aircraft such as its a300a310 class which it might believe corresponded more closely to air force requirements78 similarly if boeinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34398crs20 78 continued class aircraft airbus could have taken st eps to keep the line available for production 79 key

variant of the boeing 767 design reduced demand for defenseunique systems and the resulting consolidation of the defense industrial base has frequently reduced the num ber of companies available to provide given defense article which can adversely affect competition therefore often some compromise between warfighters perfect world requirements and real world industria l capabilities is unavoidable however substantially modifying warfighter requirements or key performance parameters kpps79 to jibe with what industry wants to ffer may appear to some to reflect an imbalance between requirements and capabilities as dod refined its final requirement most observers saw nothing obvious in the kcx rfp that would inherently bias th contract award in favor of any platform that could be offered by the competitors the rfp made clear however that the aircrafts primary mission is refueling dod and allied aircraft with the flying boom mechanism any passenger or cargo carrying capability was deemed secondary mission additionally at the beginning st ages of its recapitalization program the air force potentially has great flexibility in pursing the best kcx match now as requirements for planned programs such as kcy and kcz can later be adapted to best complement the kcx selection comparing the competitors according to many defense analysts both competitors proposals offered key impr ovements over the kc135 by including receiver inflight refueling capability defensive systems advanced booms capable of refueling both boom and drogue receivers on the same mission improved airlift

air fo rces acquisition deputy lt gen donald hoffman expressed concern that fy2008 dollars could be put at risk by protest however congress could potentially remedy this situation by shifting the money to the air forces tanker transfer fund an account congress established that essentially allows the air force flexibility to later designate the year and account for kcx expenditures117 former air force chief of staff gen t michael moseley publically voiced his concern with possibl protest stating look whats happened to us with the csarx helicopter we lost 800 million in this protest and lost over year and half of operational time because of not being able to field an airplane118 however defense contractors have statutory right to protest contract decisions to many this right provides both transparency and fairness to the governments acquisition process why did the gao stain the protest on june 18 2008 the gao announced that it had completed its examination of dods decision to award northrop grumma n the kcx contract for 80 aircraft and found that boeings complaint had merit119 gaos managing associate general counsel for procurement law michael r golden stated our review of the record led us to conclude that the air force made number of significant errors that could have affected the outcome of what was close competition between boeing and nort hrop grumman we therefore sustain boeings protest we also denied numbe r of boeings challenges to the award to northrop grumman because we found that the record did not provide us with the basis to conclude that the agency had violated the legal requirements with respect to those challenges the gao recommended that discussions between the government and the bidders be resumed that bidders be given the opportunity to sub mit revised proposals and that the air force make new decision based on this additional inputhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34398crs28 120 gao also recommended that the air force consider amending its proposal

if boeings proposal is ultimately selectedthe air force is not statutorily obliged to heed gaos recommendations but must respond to them within 60 days august 17 2008120 the gao made clear that it was not pa ssing judgement on the relative merits of the proposed aircraft instead the gao assessed whether the air force complied with statutory and regulatory requirements in evaluating the competing bids gao cited seven specific reasons fo r sustaining portions of the boeing protest which are summarized below 1 the air force evaluation did not follow the prioritization of technical requirements specified in its own solic itation nor did it give credit to the boeing proposal for satisfying th greater number of nonmandatory technical criteria though the solic itation expressly requested this 2 the air force used the degree to which the northrop grumman bid exceeded specific key performance objective as an important discriminator between proposals despite the solicitations provision stating that this would not be the case 3 solicitation required that pr oposed tankers be able to refuel all fixedwing tankercompatible air force aircraft using existing air force procedures the protest record did not support the air forces determination that the northrop grumman proposal did so 4 air force discussions with each of the bidding companies were unequal and misleading boeing was told that it had fully satisfied key operational utility parameter yet the air force later determined that the boeing proposal only partially met the requi rement the air force continued its discussion with northrop grumman on the same key parameter without informing boeing that its assessment had changed 5 northrop grumman refused to agree to specific solicitation requirement regarding the development of air force maintenance capability within specified period the air force unr easonably assessed this to be an administrative oversight and awarded the contract improperly in light of this exception to material solicitation requirement 6 the air force unreasonably evaluated the military construction hangers runways parking aprons etc requi red to sustain each of the proposed aircraft

costeffectiveness so there is reason to exclude priori an airbusboeing mixed buy on costeffectiveness grounds123 others including 66 members of congress have indicated they believe that the ai r forces winner take all kcx competition remains the most costeffective approach to initiating modernization of the tanker fleet124 further some have suggested that the idea of split buy was promoted by

clinton administration dr gansler has termed his proposal as com petitive dual sourcing concept that would have boeing and northrop gru mman compete annuallyperiodically as often as dod were to reopen bidding fo r portions of the kcx acquisition dr gansler believes that compe titive dual sourcing is particularly good fit for the kcx program as both competing aircraft already have established worldwide logistics networks dr ganslers analysis is based on comparisons of the cost growth for ten dod aircraft programs developed without production competition to the cost of seven commercial aircraft produced in competitive environment he found the ten singlesource dod acquisition programs had an average cost increase of 46 percent while the average of the seven competitively produced commercial airliners had an average cost decrease of 16 over the life of the program when analyzing potential savings for the kcx program dr gansler assumed purchase of 100 new tankers with ba price of 125 million dollars and 7525 split favoring the bestvalue candidate127 based on these assumptions he found competitively sourced tanker acquisition would potentially generate 77 billion in cost savings compared to single sour ce tanker program provided the cost growth averages of the singlesource and competitively sourced aircraft programs examined earlier in his study were repeated in the kcx program128 some may counter that dr ganslers study does not definitively conclude dualsourcing will garner savings or that the magnitude of potential savi ngs would outweigh operational costs thus resulting in lower lifecycle cost for dod however proponents may counter that the quantity of the air forces projected kcx purchase 179 aircraft compared to 100 aircraft in dr ganslers study could potentially yield greater savings than those found in the study arguments against split buy129 opponents have expressed opposition to split buy acquisition strategy for variety of reasons secretary of

recapitalizing th kc135 fleet from lifecycle cost perspective view widely shared among defense analysts however this course of action is also capital intensive in the nearterm when compared with other potential courses of action considering other budget pressures faced by dod it might be infeasible to purchase 500 new tanke r aircraft at least three options could be pursued to augment the kcx

although with distinct caveats that purchasing used aircraft may merit add itional study rands aoa found that purchasing used aircraft as tankers is generally not as co st effective as purchasing new aircraft but close enough in timated cost to not exclude it from competition136 some have suggested that surplus dc 10 aircraft in particular might offer attractive means of acquiring air refueling capabilities for less money up front137 those that hold this view point out the air force already operates the similar kc10 commercial derivative that retains 88 percent systems commonality with the

worthy of future consideration both of these options would seem to assuag air force concerns of adding additional aircraft types to the air refueling fleet while it is unlikely that large portion of the air forces air refueling fleet could be recapitalized with used commercial aircraft proponents of this alternative may believe that even sm all number of used aircraft could potentially free scarce budget dollars for other dod priorities some have questioned the feasibility of this approach 2004 government accountability office gao study pointed out that there can be wide variance in the amount of use the air force could exp ect from used commercial aircraft some are relatively new with low flying hours wh ile others are older with high flying hours139 the gao also questioned whether owne rs would be willing to sell the air force available suitable aircraft140 further each potential used aircraft may require unique cost analysis based on airframe service life remaining and the cost of equipping the aircraft to match likemodel airplanes already operating in the air forces fleet additionally given air force opposition to splitbuy proposals it is unlikely the air force would support brin ging additional aircraft types into its inventory due to the associated costs for maintenance spare parts and crew training factor of potential significance that s arisen subsequent to most of the independent studies cited in this report is the rising operating costs due to increased jet fuel prices this is of particular importance with older less fuelefficient aircraft according to the international air transpor t association the average cost of barrel of jet fuel rose from 3470 in 2003 to 8190 in 2006141 as result northwest airlines the last major us passenger airline to operate the dc10 announced it would accelerate retirement of its dc10 fleet142 in january 2007 northwest removed the dc10 from scheduled service replacing it with new airliners expected to provide fuel savings of 35 percent143 since the northwest retired its last dc10 jet fuel prices have risen 62 to 11600 per barrel in february 2008144 thus some may question the economic mer its of converting

modernization costs rands aoa did not rule out re engining some kc135es however the aoa determined conversion would only bolster overall fleet effectiven ess by about 2 percent the study also found that re engining models was not favorable return on investment unless operated into late 2030s148 air force leadership believes that dollars necessary to modernize the models are better spent on kcx

keep training pipe lines open refuel homel and defense aircraft or facilitate deploy ment across transoceanic air bridges all missions organic tankers would need to perform during wartime but missions that would not likely expose civilians to combat craf part ners often receive portion of dods contract airlift business in exchange for their participation in the program further craf partners remain active in the commercial marketplace in the same way ffs ar contractor may desire to configure the fuselage of their tankers to carry cargo thus giving ffs ar the ability to pursue both government and commercial contracts ffs ar examples currently omega air refueling services operates two converted boeing 707s as ffs ar carrier servicing the us navy omega also expects to add converted dc10 in 2008161 reportedly omega would like to perform ffs ar for the air force as well162 the united kingdoms royal air for ce raf recently signed 26 million 27year contract with air tanker to meet its

as transports in commercial markets166 however obtaining financing for the fsta program was problem atic service entry is now expected in 2011 for the first of 14 leased aircraft167 crewing of the planes has also been viewed by some as controversial plans call for flying the planes with core group of raf pilots while supplementing those crews with air tanker pilots that will be required to maintain reserve status with the raf this arrangement is expected to provide sufficient raf aircrew to fill normal p eacetime requirements as well as group of pilots that can fly in either civilian or military status as requirements dictate168 legislative action the 2008 national defens authorization act ndaa directs the air force to conduct pilot progra m of at least five years to evaluate the feasibility of ffs ar pl 110181 the ev aluation requires the air force to assess ffs ar across broad range of mission sets to include testing support training support to receiver aircraft homeland

the air force to submit an annual report to c ongressional defense committees highlighting key operational metrics and assessing the impact of ffs ar on the air forces flying hour program and aircrew

issues for congress coordinated by christopher bolkcomappendix previous issue for congress one issue of significant interest to earlier sessions of congress involved the controversy that surrounded earlier dod attempts to replace some kc135s using proposed lease program modernization controversy modernizing or replacing the air fo rce tanker fleet has been point of contention for more than decade in 1996 the general accounting office gao asserted that the longterm viability of the kc135 fleet was questionable and advocated expeditiously studying replacem ent options dod countered that kc135 airframe hours were low and that the air fo rce could sustain the fleet for another 35 years171 in 2001 the air force reported th at the kc135 fleet would incur significant cost increases between 2001 nd 2040 but economic crisis is on the horizonthere appears to be runaway costgrowth and the fleet is structurally viable to 2040172 at that time the air force position on tanker modernization was to conduct an analysis of alternatives aoa to determine the optimal replacement option for kc135s it would begin recap italization in the 2012 time frame to meet kc135 retirement by 2040 when the air for ce expects the kc135 to reach the end of its service life section 8159 of the fy2002 national fense appropriations act pl 107117 authorized the air force to lease 100 boeing kc767 aircraft to replace some of the oldest and least capable kc135s the emode ls this proposal proved controversial because section 8159 appeared to depart from traditional acquisition processes and weaken cong ressional oversight the government accountability office also concluded that l ease would cost more than procuring the aircraft173 further many found air force arguments in favor of the lease to contradict its position of just year prio r congress debated the proposed lease in four hearings culminating with pair of senate hearings in september 2003174 subsequently alleged and ad mitted ethical violations by government and industry representatives involved in the leas proposal added to the controversy the fy2004 defense authorization act pl 108136 sec135 forged compromise between opponents and proponents of the kc767 by giving the air force permission to lease 20 tanker aircraft and purchase an additional 80 aircraft section 134 of this act prohibited the ai r force

action until the completion of the dsb report and an internal investig ation by the dod inspector general ig on potential improprieties by boeing company executives and whether these activities negatively effected the tanker lease program on april 20 2004 darleen druyan the former lead air force negotiator on the tanker lease program pleaded guilty to one charge of criminal conspiracy ms druyan admitted to secretly negotiating an executive job with the boeing company while still overseeing the 23 billion deal between the air force and boeing175 lease supporters argued that ms druyan was single bad apple and that her actions did not negate the kc767s mer its reportedly in february 2005 however the dod ig found that air fo rce secretary james roche misused his office when he lobbied the office of management and b udget omb to support the lease concept176 the igs final report found that four ot her senior dod officials were guilty of evading omb and dod acquisition regulations that are designed to demonstrate best business practices and to provide acc ountability the dod ig found that senior dod officials knowingly misrepresented th state of the kc135 fleet and
