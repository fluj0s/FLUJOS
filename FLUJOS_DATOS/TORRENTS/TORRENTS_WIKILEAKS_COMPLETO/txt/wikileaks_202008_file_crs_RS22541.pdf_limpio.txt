removed as beneficiary developing country if the country is determined to be sufficiently competitive or developed 19 usc 2462e for example in 2008 the republic of trinidad and tobago graduated from the gsp program when it was determined to have become high income count ry also countries that formally enter into bilateral trading relationship with another veloped country may also become ineligible as happened in 2007 for bulgaria and romania when they joined the european unionunder the program4 this follows an oversight hearing by the committee which was conducted in june 2008 and fo cused on ways to reform trade preference programs including the gsp according to committee staff that hearing was considered first step toward possible bill seeking to reform trade preference programs5 amendments to the gsp in 2006 followed extensive debate about the program during the 109th congress specifically some in congress questioned the inclusion of certain more advanced veloping countries bdcs6 as beneficiaries under the gsp and also commented that certain bdcs had contributed to the ongoing impasse in multilateral trade talks in the wto doha development agenda7 in response to these concerns congress amended the program in 2006 by tightening the rules on competitive need limits cnl8 waivers that allow imports from bene ficiary countries in excess of gsp statutory thresholds for some products pl 109432 historically there have been few cnl waivers to the gsp for agricultural produc ts and it is unlikely that these program changes will greatly affect us agricu ltural imports under the program in 2006 congress had also renewed the gsp for two years through 2008 in addition the trade policy staff committee tpsc an advisory committee chaired by the us trade representative has instituted series of investigations to evaluate possible changes to the gsp9 in its 2006 review the tpsc announced that the more than 80 previously granted cnl wa ivers would be individually evaluated in addition to the standard practice of examining petitions for new cnl waivers the tpsc said that it would also examine the eligibility status of several middle income economies10 among the countries identified for po ssible removal as beneficiaries under the program were argentina brazil india the philippines thailand and turkey these countries account for over 60 of the valu of us agricultural products imported dutyfree under the program although none of the countries cited lost their overall gsp eligibility as result of these reviews several previously granted cnl waivers from these countries were revoked for agricultural impor ts under the gsp the côte divoire losthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22541crs5 cnl waivers for fresh or dried shelled kola nuts hts 08029094 as part of the 2006 review argentina lost cnl waivers for cooked shelled fresh or dried peanuts hts 12022040 as part of the 2007 review thes waivers had allowed for these products to be imported from the côte divoire nd argentina dutyfree under gsp despite the statutory import thresholds other countries lost cnl waiv ers for some nonagricultural products but not for agricultural products the 2006 review included decisions on other country and pr oduct petitions involving agricultural products but these changes are unlikely to greatly affect us ag ricultural imports under the

changes however could affect us agri cultural imports under the gsp including additional limits on cnl waivers from certa in countries or graduation of some beneficiary countries countries that account for the majo rity of us agricultural imports under the gsp are thailand brazil argentin india the philippines and turkey comments submitted to ustr on its 2006 proposal from us agricultural industry groups are mixed12 the american farm bureau federation afbf expressed its general opposition to the gsp program stating th at products imported dutyfree under the program compete with usproduced goods without granting commensurate level of opportunity for us producers in foreign ma rkets afbf further supported withdrawal of cnl waivers for the philippines argentina and colombia the grocery manufacturers association g ma expressed support for th current gsp program and identified certain agricultural products of importance to gma under the program including sugar confections spices and cer tain processed foods and inputs from brazil india and argentina gmas position was generally supported by comments from the american spice trade associ ation the national confecti oners association and the chocolate manufacturers association what remains unclear is whether dutyfree access for most agricultural imports under the gsp greatly influences countrys willin gness to export these products to the united states in most cases costs associated with import tariffs are borne by the importer these costs may be passed on to the bdcs in term s of lower import prices however import tariffs to the united states for most of these products tend to be low as calculated by crs ad valorem equivalent tariffs range from 3 4 for sugar 210 for cocoa containing products 512 for confectionery 12 for most processed meats about 2 for olive oil less than 1 for mineral water and about 5 for agriculturebased organic chemicals13 in general any additional costs that might be incurred by the bdcs as result of the proposed changes could be mo re than offset by the generally higher us prices for most products compared to prices in other world markets nevertheless the imposition of even relatively low import tariffs could represent an increase in input costs to some us food processors and industria l users these costs could be passed on to consumers through higher prices for these nd other finished agricultural or manufactured products as shown in table 1 about onehalf of gsp agricultural imports are intermediate goods and inputs such as raw sugar miscellaneous processed foods preparations and byproducts and agri culturebased organic chemicals
