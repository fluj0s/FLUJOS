strategic plan some regional and local authorities became concerned about fe mas new requirement that they provide local data and maps as di gital files to aid in dfir m production at the time fema made this condition for remaining in the nfip and retaining fe deral flood insurance coverage however by 1999 fema realized that it would need to provide grants to some statetribal govern ments and

developing the fmmi and that they will be key to ensuring that there are regularly updated flood zard maps for the nation femas earlier projected costs to implement fmmi and requirements imposed on nfip communities have prompted local government authorities to question what resources communities can reasonably be expected to provide to the agency although fema has historically enjoyed free access to much of communitylevel proprietary data and maps compiled by flood map part ners leveraging the expenses associated with fmmi has required thus far that 20 of federal funding and the value of grants extended to implement fmmi be matched by states however fema has accepted inkind services from local mapping partners including human resources to assist in conducting fhss for dfirms cost

resources for the most part have been available at little if any cost to the agency also because fema requires fhs and subseque ntly digital flood insurance risk map dfirm be produced before community

were to be affected and if fema were to revoke eligibility for it after dig ital flood map revisions were made see example of economic impact of fmmi city of san mateo california below early opponents

fiscal resources although some private surveying and mapping enterpri ses stood at the ready to provide digital flood maprelated assistance to local aut horities few if any contracts were awarded37 fema officials tried to convince potentially affected parties that the new digital mapping requirements were not intended as financial bur den for local governments or individual citizens but meant to ensure the public safety nd limit financial losses in areas vulnerable to potential flooding hazards as an incentive to gain public acceptance of fmmi fema flood mapping pa rtners urged the agencys heads to seek federal funding for nonreimbursable gran ts to states and channel direct funding to more economically challenged communities38 in that way communities could be availed of private sector digital mapping services and assist with local dfirm development fema had reported from the outset that the fmmi would be capitalintensive venture initially not only because of the cost s associated with building an operational infrastructure for producing and managing df irms but also because of having to retain professional digital mapping expertise to provide fema the capacity to convert its remaining pape r firm inventory to digital one in its may 2001 fmmi progress report fema announced that private s ector contractors would perform new flood hazard studies fhss and manage other flood

technological developments which fema now routinely employs to identify and designate flood hazard risk areas on dfirms these include 1 automated t ools for geographical and environmental analysis 2

the process of setting federal flood insurance premiums in the nearfuture perhaps as soon as the next five years69 shortly after the fmmi was launched fema encountered economic barriers in

cost in the longrun they say that by providing incentives for greater participati on of all levels of government in the fmmi the federal government s payoff will be gaining access to local digital

goals of the fmmi will depend upon expanding nd reinvigorating cooperating technical partnerships however because of uncerta inty surrounding femas fate as federal agency including whether it will remain within the dhs and continue its same function be reestablished as an independent agency have its component programs divested and reassigned to other federal agencies or cease to exist some are concerned that implementati on of fmmi could be threatened there are concerns that state tribal and local governments might retreat from contributing to robust sustained federal digital flood map program fema states that the effectiveness of the recently intr oduced mu ltiyear flood hazard identification plan mhip that schedules future flood map updates is premised on bala ncing critical priorities71 these include updating outofdate flood ma ps performing fhss in unmapped areas in immediate danger of flooding and ensuri ng that fmmi resources are distributed equitably among present and potential nfip communities completion of the fmmi meaning the dig ital conversion of th entire inventory of fema flood maps seemingly is linke d to retaining momentum regardless of whether the program emerges in fema or whatever other entity that might administer it in the future proponents of the mapping program ma intain that it will lead to cost savings for the federal flood insurance program in the future in any event most observers assert that effective management of fmmi will require continued collaboration and c oordination within dhs and with its local stakeholders it should be noted that wholesale di gital map conversion and meeting the required fiveyear cycle for updating df irms are separate goals for fema although digital conversion of older paper flood maps is now anticipated to be completed by 2008 the process of dfirm revision updates w ill be ongoing and requires longterm collaboration with state tribal and local government authorities and private sector partnershi ps to obtain the necessary digital contributions for fema or whatever entity might administer the flood insurance map program in the future the need to perform flood haza rd studies and revise dfirms in timely manner will be critical especially as ne w flood hazard risks in potentially flood prone areas across the nation are disc overed and after flood disasters occur femas goal is

although at half the amount requested for fy2003 presidents request in justification of his request for 300 million for fmmi the presidents fy2003 budget stated that focusing flood reduction efforts
