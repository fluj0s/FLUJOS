from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk tom wigley wigleycgducaredu subject re crowley date wed jul 20 165840 2005 cc pjonesueaacuk hi tom as followup to keiths email it might be quite likely that one of the series you plot is replaced by the instrumental record after 1960 because the file from crowley and lowery that is available at the wdcpaleoclimate contains such record the header states crowley and lowery 2000 ambio 29 51 northern hemisphere temperature reconstruction modified as published in crowley 2000 science v289 p270 14 july 2000 data from fig 1 crowley 2000 decadally smoothed time series of crowleylowery reconstruction spliced into smoothed jones et instrumental record after 1860 labeled cl2jns11 and slight modification labeled cl2 of the original crowley and lowery reconstruction to 1965 the url of this file is 1ftpftpncdcnoaagovpubdatapaleogcmoutputcrowley2000crowley_lowery2000_nhttxt and it is listed here 2httpwwwncdcnoaagovpaleoreconshtml cheers tim at 1222 18072005 keith briffa wrote as first quick response the crowley numbers came from his paper with lowery i seem to remember that there were 2 versions of the composite that he produced certainly we used the data that did not include sargasso and michigan site data i presume the other from the cru web site were the data used by phil and mike mann that they got from him where exactly did you pick then up fromand could be the other data set with those sites included it seems odd that the values are so high in the recent period of this series and could conceivably be instrumental data but would have to check the scaling of the data we used to produce the crowley curve that formed one of the lines in our spaghetti diagram that we put on the web site under my name and made available to ngdc was based on taking the unscaled composite he sent and recalibrating against april sept average for land north of 20 degrees lat and repeating his somewhat bazaar calibration procedure which deliberately omitted the data between 19001920 that did not fit with the instrumental data remember his data are also decadal smoothed values in fact as we were using summer data we calibrated over 18811900 avoiding the high early decades that i still believe are biased in summer and 1920 1960 whereas he used 18561880 and 19201965 of the precise details might differ but the crux of the matter is that i suspect one of the figures you show may have instrumental data in the recent period but not ours if you say exactly where these series came from i can ask tim who will have done the calibrations to check as for the second question the qr data are averaged ring widths from relatively few site chronologies in the high north mostly neurasia scandinaviayamaltaimyr though with few other site data added in as stated the 2001 data are the mxd data from near 400 sites and provide the best interannual to multidecadal indication of summer temps for land areas north of 20 degrees than any of the true proxy ie not including instrumental data idea what the correlation over the common 600 year period is but i have never said that the ring width is anything other than summer temps for the area it covers keith at 2038 15072005 you wrote keith look at the attached can you explain to why these plots differ particularly after 1880 could you also explain why the briffa data in qr 2000 are so poorly correlated with the briffa 2001 data i think i know the answers but i want an independent and spontaneous answer from you thanks tom professor keith briffa climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk phone 441603593909 fax 441603507784 3httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa references 1 ftpftpncdcnoaagovpubdatapaleogcmoutputcrowley2000crowley_lowery2000_nhttxt 2 httpwwwncdcnoaagovpaleoreconshtml 3 httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa
