running the gpm lecture given on 2 may 1963 thank you well here we are at the what audience voices second of may weve arrived at the 2nd of may geewhiz we got through another may day 1963 ad 13 we celebrated last wednesday the 2nd anniversary of the saint hill special briefing course and the course is into its 3rd year as of now and we turn out better auditors all the time turn out better auditors all the time even you and our successes areof the past arent even comparable to the successes that were going to have up the line here now today im going to talk to you severely ordinarily i jolly you along you know and everybody looks well i hate to be this severe but you are on the edges of the great adventure and this separates the sheep from the goats man and separates the children from the characters who can do it and you are adventured upon period of auditing which requires far more precision auditor presence and trs than any auditing we have ever had theres certain ways to do this right and theres certain ways to do it wrong the number of ways to do it wrong far exceed the ways to do it right any time you have somebody in training he can always invent some new ways to do it wrong but its very very funny that he never invents almost neversome way to do it right because the odds are very bad the truth of the matter is that the auditing which you are embarked upon is in actual fact simpler than you would believe and simpler than you will believe for some time and the main thing you are doing with it is far too much complication thats all just the complexities youre adding into it are defeating you and youre taking too much time to accomplish what youre accomplishing and the only difficult thing that you must learn and i can assure you this is not easily learnedis with total excellent arc totally control the pc in session now that is asking lot because the pc is walkingyou know these the hunha kapunah unah unahs had thats tribe that were bred by the hunahs after they were defeated by the punahs and they used to walk across live coals and other tricks like this but man this pc he isnt just walking across live bed of coals see hes walking across eternity and he feels it and the leastthe least rancor upset unsmoothness on the part of the auditor records itself very heavily on the pc during routine 3 and you say well well be good fellow and we will just audit permissively and go along with what the pc says see thats one answer to not making the pc upset youve got several answers you know and one of them is just to sit there you know and be agreeable and that is the worst answer because the pc will dig himself into and get more ideas about digging himself into and get himself dug into more trouble if you follow his advice exclusively than you can easily repair i assure you of this if he tells you that you ought to relist some item and if heif you do that thats all right youvery often you have to take histhe statement of what item it is thats bothering him you see but you do this and he gets dissatisfied and he says its some other item and then he says its some other item and then you follow through and you do this you see and then you say some other item and so forth and all of sudden you notice the pc is in state of total collapse well what put him there the pc its just the failure of the auditor to exercise session control good blaming the pc and saying well he dug himself in i dont know thisyou sit comfortably under the palm tree on the bank of the stream you see and he swims through this river full of alligators and you didnt tell him to go upstream or downstream and he goes upstream and gets et and you say well he did it youre there to tell him how to get across the river see if the pc digs himself in its the auditors fault and its nobody elses fault theres nobody else to blame in the session if the auditor fails to take the pcs advice and gets into trouble thereby it is the auditors fault if the auditor does take the pcs advice and gets into trouble it is the auditors fault if the pc gives good advice its the auditors credit but its his fault understand and when you look at session dont look at it as dual activity of mutually shared responsibility in the great togetherness of all us wogs you see i mean thats wogishness see if you want to know what is responsibility on this planet it is enough people in the same place and that makes responsibility i mean its as weak as that you see they elect lousy president in the united states and they say well therefore the whole population took responsibility for electing the president so therefore its nobodys fault i think its somebodys fault see but you wouldnt get any conviction in this particular line you see so if you have five people together immediately there can be responsibility you see except the group responsibility of all five well you have to get out of that way of thinking it isnt an auditing group of two with mutually shared responsibility it isnt man there happen to be two bodies there but theres only one responsible factor and thats the auditor and the pc isnt responsible for living thing not one thing you go around and say well hes bad pc or hes nattery pc or hes this pc or hes that pc its very strange that if you straighten out the points on the case that ought to be straightened out he ceases to be nattery pc i think its quite remarkable all right now if hes nattery pc or good pc maybe give him the credit for being good pc dont you see you can go that far but actually you cant give him the credit for being nattery pc because as far as the session is concerned why the pc runs as the auditor says the auditor never has the out of the pc something or other the only time the auditor has an out is when pc does something out of session that he ought to be brained for i had pc come to session once i had the pc running beautifully the pc came into session all caved in been all right during the last session but was all caved in when he arrived at this session well the pc had taken ithad taken this interesting action had decided that something was it and had listed it so happened that it was listed backwards and advises on this you see pc had advises and had listed about 10 or 12 pages backwards on an item you see and thought just little more listing now and itll be all right but of course you start listing one backwards little more listing makes it that much wronger and i didnt halfclobber that pc see you chuckleheaded idiot you know i mean this was the general course of my existence the pc didnt do it again but what was i doing i was exerting then auditor control out of session for auditing being done out of session and the only way i could do it is if you do this just one more time you know blank blank blank blank blank see the only way i could do you see was to impress the pc that this must not be done did we never had any more trouble of that particular kind but it wasnt the auditors fault if pc gets themselves wrapped around telegraph pole between session by some selfauditing action except to this degree in this case the auditor had not been expressive enough to meet that eventuality and had not smelled the fact that the pc was going to do it now you say thats prettythats pretty far well actually it is pretty far afield that is stretching it just little bit auditor responsibility is just being stretched little bit but the next time it didnt happen because auditor responsibility at that point asserted itself and so this pc is doing things out of session that are interfering with the session therefore we must lower the boom andtook responsibility and lowered the boom now this lowering of the boom can actually also consist of if you have just one more fight with your wife if you talk to your wife just once more about your goal im going to give you the wrong top oppterm and list you on it for hours you understand so come off of this because i wont stand for it thats asserted auditor responsibility dont you see youre perfectly within your rights to assert your responsibility that way you arent responsible for the pc having walked back into the third or fourth session you gave him all spun in because they went home and told the wife my goal is and the wife said soandso and so forth you cant be held responsible for suddenly realizing that he was liable to go home and tell his wife his goal and his wife was liable to invalidate his goal and et cetera thats asking just little bit too much you see but it is within your zone of responsibility that you find out hes doing such things to lower the boom see give him hearttoheart talk you dont give him these hearttoheart talks in session by the way you end the session and when youve given him the hearttoheart talk you start the session again but the point ithen they can never accuse you of having broken the auditors code but this will go quite distance this will go quite distance you find out that somebody is doing something outside of session that is upsetting your auditing well it isnt up to somebody else to tell him its up to you now you can tell them persuasively or any other way dont you see but youve got to make it stick thats lacking responsibility for the pc in extremisanymoreevery monday you come in here every monday you come in here walking on both sides of the room whats going on what do you do weekends all right ill pull few of those withholds were not in session see this is not session im pulling few of these withholds and just soandso all right okay so thats what you do and thats why all right now listen ill let you in on something youre not going to do it again you hear and make it stick because theyre getting in your hair as an auditor now you have perfect right to do that sort of thing but how do you do it so that the pc doesnt hate your guts forevermore this is where diplomacy comes in so many people have died from itthats all casualties of the last two world wars now these points of outofsessionness and so forth well take them up with almost any rancor that you want to but the truth of the matter is you start controlling pc misemotionally while he is running routine 3 and this is horse of another hue you can just start looking mean during session and youll practically spin him he cant cope with the bank and it comes back to the old original thesis those rules and laws in the original thesis auditor plus pc greater than pcs bank you see but auditor plus pcs bank versus pc you see auditor plus pcs bank is greater than the pc and you cave him in so its an interesting point how do you control pc without enturbulating the pc or pushing the pc underneath the bounding billows how do you do this well its very smooth level of control its extremely smooth control that is required and there is type of control that works in it which doesnt q and and yet which doesnt leave the pc sitting out on limb either you follow the formula of acknowledging completely everything the pc says you understand it and you acknowledge it then you say to the effect that although what he is saying undoubtedly contains great validity it happens at the moment that it is necessary to take this other course but that if anything needs to be done which he said you will take care of it afterwards or at some later time you got the idea now actually that isnt just casual series of phrases i have strung together it has very hardbound formula back of it pc says doesnt matter what the pc says pc says there is goaltheres whole bank between the bank we are running and the last bank we ran and you say all right you can see it huh yeah oh yeah yessir yessir whole bank in there and weve just missed it clean cold and its it and were now running the next bank below that and we shouldnt be there now if you adjudicate this on the basis of should you do what the pc says or shouldnt you do what the pc says or the reason why you mustnt do things is because the pc said to do them youll make as many mistakes you see as in following the pcs advice what you must do is treat anything the pc gives you as data and that is all it is it is never an order it is never an invitation its never this or never that its just data and its quite valuable data make mention of it on the auditors report the pc says theres bank between these two banks now the only reason pc is going to become upset with you is not if you dont immediately find that intermediate goal and run it instead of the bank youre running but if the pc thinks you have missed the information now you can underscore that if the pc thinks you have missed the information you now get into very heavily arc broke situation pc says but i told you there is bank whole bank sitting there and he starts asserting the existence of the bank and hell start keying it in well the wrong way to handle it is to just say all right yes all right i knowi knowi know well go on and answer the question which we are doing right now yes he says but theres bank ive just seen it its you know its between here and so on and the whole thing is caving in on and its terrible and you say yes well thank you thank you good all right now just go on and answer the question which i am asking you know and the pc now he says but i doorrraapaarrreh bow see well you say well why is he so upset well hes so upset because you have evidently missed the information hes not sure youve got this information so yourjust your ordinary tossoff yes okay fine thank you that isnt going to work because itll create what is in essence missed withhold and the pc explodes accordingly and he explodes banksized missed withhold see now the way to handle that is to look at what i told you in the first place you see oh oh all right i all right i got that whole bank okay all right let make note of that put it on the auditors report because it might be very interesting and you might not go on auditing him for long period of time draw square around it you know so that it stands out plain say all right i got that information any more about that yes soandso and soandso i could even tell you its goal thats very interesting all right says the goal is to catch catfish all right good all right good now this is possibly an approach but i myself would not use it so im giving it to you as where you could again perhaps fail you say well is it all right with you if we keep on running the command which we are running now and ive heard so many of you use that that im injecting it as anis it all right if we do that t i never ask the pc if its all right he sat down on the other side of the auditing table from i just assume that at that moment he has said that its all right if i do anything i do from there on in that session see i just assume if hell sit down there to be auditedthe only pcs i have any trouble with is that wont be audited and wont sit down you see i assume if hes sitting there its all right so i never ask him is it all right if we go on doing what we are doing and do something with that later see i dont go into that gambit at all i say all right tell you what it so happens weve got our hands on tell him the truth see it so happens weve got our paws on this goal and were this far into this bank if we leave this at this particular time itd have to be the truth or i wouldnt tell him this if we leave it at this particular time why were so many in i dont think the other goal would fire so ill tell you what this is probably going to be very uncomfortable we know the other bank is there and so forth and when we finish running this one well get that one all right pc will say thats fine hell go on with the chest mass falling all over him and having an awful time but hell go ahead and run that bank for you you understand its on basis of truth and you treat anything the pc says as valid data that is the secret of it all anything the pc says as valid data because hes the one who is observing it the pc is right far about the data the pc is right about the data far more often than you suspect right about the data and about what to do with it is hundred and not just hundred but hundred and ten percent wrong see so you learn to differentiate you learn to differentiate between an order to do something and just data and you always be very happy to get the pcs data and you pat him on the back about his orders the diplomacy all comes in under the heading of orders not about data if you handle the data this way you never have to have any diplomacy and actually you wont get into orders he only gets into orders when hes sure that youre not going to do anything about it now you better know this trick well because youre about to embark upon somethingand ive prefaced this lecture on routine 3 with this diplomatic approach to auditing learning the lesson of controlling with steel paw in velvet glove learn that lesson well because the only real troubles youre going to get into is feeling so insecure about what youre doing that the pc says to do something and you do it and hes not hundred percent wrong but hundred and ten remember his data is always right see he tells you that theres an item glumpsluks and its in foreign tongue and it lies immediately on the southwest corner of the item youre running thats data good fine now its just question now of do you need this datum or dont you need this datum thats the only thing and what you do with the datum is your business but just make sure you get the datum now if youif you let athis can go too far if you let pc start describing all the still pictures that are turning up you will also wish you hadnt because one of the ways of getting the pc in an engram is having described the largest object it was the rule of the last largest object what was the last large object you saw in that engram hell tell you and hes right back in the engram again dont you see well you dont want him in an engram so hes giving you data that its there id be more likely to turn it off something like this well now well go on running this and you tell if it changes be sure and tell if youif it changes any and he promptly forgets about it i dont go on and ask him for details in those stuck pictures dont you see hes liable to give all sorts of data about the lineup of the bank and how many items weve missed and how we should goandbut heres where it goes im very happy to hear that weve missed pattern of four items that are lying someplace there they are he sees them theyre black everything else is gray and he sees this patch of black and he says theres three or four items there im very happy to learn about that im liable to make little notation on the line plot pc says theres four items here see four untouched items here im liable to make that and where i get in trouble where id get in trouble and where you would drown is just right here go back and get them take his order we had better get these now because this is whats causing the arc break that ive been having oh cut your throat man its much easier existence in the next few hours just mopping up little blood you differentiate the difference here pc says weve missed four items theyre right there he can see them fine cheers and his next following remark is we had better get them because thats why i am so arc broke cut your throat man if you take that order youve had it not because of the mechanics that it throws him in control of the session and on selfaudit but its just because its not the thing to do you see ityou mustnt do that now if younow hereslisten to this if you fail to take proper note of the data and understand it it will almost always be followed by an order to do something about it because your failure to acknowledge the pc has thrown the pc on selfaudit and that is possibly what you havent seen in the mechanics of this you understand that your failure to take that data down or into account or pay attention to it or acknowledge it makes him feel that youre not in control of it so he takes the session control out of your hands and orders you to do something about those items see so when youve failed on receiving the pcs data and paying attention to what the pc is telling youyou will then get your barrage of orders and any time pc starts giving you orders you must realize that you have failed to take into account some data and one of the ways to shut off the order flow since the orders are oh man lets take somebody in the middle of tar pit with the tar all over him dont you see and have him direct the redecoration of the louvre see itll be just that silly he isnt even there he can see but what he sees were not too sure of that but we can take that because theres nobody else looking dont you see were not any skulllooking there lets take the other thing of however hes in state to audit oh uhuh he sure isnt and the way to cure him of giving you orders is to find out what data you didnt receive and youre liable to get wildly it hes been very mildly ordering you to do thingsyoure liable to get wildly vituperative number of things which he has been unable to communicate to you see youve got your missed withholds straighten it out youll find out theres some vital data connected with it this isthis is one way of taking pcs grabcontrol of the session back off of the pc see thats one way of returning session control to the auditor this is find out what he hasnt found out about of course you do this mechanically by just mechanically pulling missed withholds off the pc but you should appreciate that you also have well just what have you tried to communicate to you see that i didnt understand or what data here havent i paid attention to and he usually starts in atits very interesting to see normally mild pc say well you silly idiot you see and here he goes what hes doing is relinquishing session control he gets it off squared up all of sudden why hes brighter so smoothness of auditing is how do you control the pc without arc breaking the pc or chopping the pc and it also includes then doesnt it getting control back from the pc if youve lost it and actually thats the whole story of getting control back from the pc find out what the pc wasnt able to point out to you that he then has to do something about because his doing something about it is all wrong he will never do the right thing with it i assure you see you could give himyou could give him the next five items and say all right all right justjust add them up and move the charge down down the bank with these five items and if you check up what hes doing he will have opposed half of them backwards and forgotten the other half you see hes just not in shape to audit thats all i wouldnt even point this out to the pc the question of his auditing would never come up but if i found pc giving orders as an auditor then i would simply try to find out what the pc has not succeeded in communicating to i could do that with the meter i could do it with persuasion it might have happened in earlier sessions but i would square that up right now now although the pc may be in an arc break from other causes and reasons i am likely to take that as the first step because the data connected up with this arc break might be of great value i would also do an arc break assessment routine 3 to find out what i had missed but that is purely technical although it cures arc breaks this other how do you get control back from pc will very often form considerable problem to you auditing in routine 3 pc is telling you youve got to do this youve got to do that youve got to and weve really got to run into later bank because this early bank that we are doing now is too much for and we should run it later on the track and we should do this and ive already told you that ive cognited on my goal in present time and you should take this goal in present time and the top oppterms of it are catfish and catfishnocatfish and weve got all that and so forth so you really ought to be kind of running that now because after all ive told you and told you and youll notice that all of his orders have got ive told you and told you running through them one way or the other see all of his orders have well all right if his orders have got ive told you and ive told you lets find out what he told he very often wasnt articulate while he was doing the tolding and youll finally find out that he actually is heading for thefor the early bank because he hasnt been able to communicate to you he thought because your tr 2 might have been poor at the moment or you didnt make note of it or something of the sort that theres whole slab of the material you have been doing he is in great doubt of he just doesnt believe it something like that and hes gotten desperate about ever understanding it so hes made decision there that hed better get an early bank that he can understand and of course to do that would be utterly fatal but the datum there that he hasnt understood it might come as brandnew datum to the auditor oh yeah well i told you the hell he did man he never said word about it he was sitting there going on just as nice as you please you see oh yes yes yes absolutely catfish yes hes going on about it you know oh yes 1 oh yes yes i understand yes yes yes eager catfish oh yeah i understand that you know oh yeah now he tells you he hasnt understood single one of them not only that but he tells you that hes told you he didnt understand single one of them all right so your reality is betrayed remember hes running in the least reality hes running in the exact hurricane middle of the reactive bank there is nothing goofier than where he is at it isnt that he isis or isnt goofy but the area where he is at the moment hobnobbing is spin corner man crazy avenue goes up in one direction and dementia praecox boulevard runs in the other youre going to take this guys orders huh hehhehheh this is silly his data always his orders never very important for you to realize that and the orders come when you havent taken the data now we realize that banks are hard to run go ahead and realize it all you want to and treat them with respect and so forth but theres one thing you mustnt do now youre going to misinterpret this and everybodys going to misinterpret this and get it all wrong itll be the source of argument here for years i can see that unless i make myself absolutely plain on this subject nownow the wording of this is very carefully worked out so dont write it down or quote it carelessly never rerun partially run bank never rerun partially run gpm and that first word was never and i point your attention to partially now lets get this real straight because i dont want this datum to go in anybodys head goofywise because it could be interpreted as never rerun gpm or that theres something bad about rerunning gpm there is nothing bad about rerunning gpm there is everything deadly about rerunning partially run gpm that one you mustnt do dont rerun partially run gpm if youve got your paws on it fur claws and all and you can continue it in the run you continue running it right straight on through to the bitter end whats the bitter end the goal as an ri at the bottom of the bank listed fifty items beyond the last rr and rs and when youve gotten that far you can consider that the bank can now be rerun you dont have to null that list to make the bank rerunnable you understand what i mean now only then is it safe to rerun gpm now this means great deal it means lot more than you thinkyou think of at the first matter means great deal you say what if its wrong what if the pcs arc breaking i dont know what if spring comes what if the law of gravity works sure pc will arc break so what theyll spin if you run itrerun it uhhh youre going to get in nothing like the trouble you get into by running wrong upsidedown backedup mixedup items as rerunning whole area to get the items right because that makes the bank more charged than it was and its then much harder on the pc charge in bank runs from the top of the bank to the bottom of the bank in consecutive order and any time you take an area that youve rerun without running the rest of the bankyou take an area that you have run and rerun that area good bad or indifferent right or wrong or anything else any time you rerun that area you just stack up stiffening of the missed withholds theyre good and missed now but theres charge factor involved here because the charge runs from the top of the bank to the bottom of the bank when you back up anything beyond pair of itemsquite allowable pair of items because youre always working on pair of itemsyou go any further back than that and start rerunning something and not entirely understood by at this moment im simply telling you the empirical finding this is not theoretical finding at all this is learned the hard way you know any time you go back few items and decide to rerun that little span again without running clear to the bottom of the bank you sort of let the water back in the battery you know something weird happens just let put it that way rather than try to give you theoretical explanation that might not be right just something weird happens the bank gets stiffer sort of like puttingyou wash this shirt see and you wash this shirt and you look at it and by golly the collars still dirty well in ordinary washing this wouldnt happen but you wash it again and now its too stiff to wear its very curious curious its phenomena its as though the second wash water always adds couple of gallons of starch the bank beefs up i can give you lots of explanations for this but just take this as an empirical datum the bank will beef up the pressures will become greater on the pc the stresses will become greater on the pc the actual physical might of the bank apparently increases just take it as datum lets runlets run from the top oppterm down to the goal ill give you an example see these are very concrete examples we go from thefrom the top oppterm down to the goal i dont know something matter of fifth of the bank or something like this see now weve gotten the goal as an oppterm and were going to go ahead through the rest of the bank and all of suddennow these other remarks get very very pertinent because we get hard sell is liable to go on herethe pcsthis is visual gets visual to the pc he sort of looks up the bank and he says weve got uh weve got uh want catching catfish and thats wrong thats wrong that should be that should be wantably catch catfish oh look thats why i was arc broke yeah yeah look i that thatyeah thatthats wrong so that makes theno the uhthats wrong and uhoh and theres couple above that couple aoh wonder i was so arc broke looka there you got about five items missing there right in row you know and uhyou must have given the wrong item uhcause there it is and so forth and if you sit there casually listening to all this and apparently dont take it down any and dont do anything about it then the pcs going to start giving you orders about it and the pc will say well we should go back up therego back up there to eagerly caught catfish and we should smooth that out and pass the charge down to where we are because if we keep going like this why itll just for sure mean additional arc breaks and you say all right thank you very much well were going on now and so forth and you see that wasyouve been practicing die plomacy not diplomacy and youre going to about get it right in about two seconds see and you say well fine thats it thank you and well go on now and well go on down the rest of the bank and pc will say but look im trying to tell youim trying to tell you theres this wantablewantable caught catfish and thats wrong because actually there are about five items in that area and thats why i arc broke in that area yeah well thank you very much well well go on with this of course his brains start spattering all over and he says youve got to go back now ill tell you what you do you go back andyou go back and you catch that now the next stage is when you dont follow those orders is he will go back and say see if this reads now wantably caught catfish wantably caught justjust look at your meter get your eyes on your meter see what your inevitable cycle is he not only gives you the orders but he starts carrying them out and thats because somewhere along the line you havent handled any of this now im actually giving you two data which go hand in glove but they could form entirely separate lectures thedont rerun partially run bank there are other reasons why you mustnt follow the pcs orders but this is amongst the chiefest of them did you ever run an engram or withhold they behave the same wayon somebody that wouldnt discharge and seemed like the more you ran it the stiffer it got why actually the answer is in book one and youll find the answers in the withhold system you aint got basic on the chain thats why the funny part of it is the more you go over it the worse the pcs going to get with it you get this pc telling you about this withhold see he stole this car see and my god every auditor hes had has had this withhold and its apparently getting up to beyou know hes getting this withhold off its getting to be total obsession its whats knownit has technical name its the recurrent withhold he gives it to every auditor and it comes up every third session see its recurrent withhold he just keeps giving that withhold now if you were to look at that withhold very critically youd find out the pc is getting more and more obsessed with this withhold that withhold is beefing up because hitting it causes all of the earlier withholds to be missed it excites and activates the whole chain of stealing cars and the more you try to get this particular car without getting the first car stolen the more you activate those lower ones and get missed withholds therefore actually prepchecking or sec checking can be done in total ignorance of the withhold system you just cant do it because on any given pcof course the keyout factors anything keys out usually within three to ten days but where person is being consistently audited on the same item same item same withhold same engram same this oh i in the old days we used to have certain engrams the pc would always come along with the engrams the same engram see it just wasnt the basic engram on the chain thats all basic was still on there its enough to get out just the basic engram on that chain you dont have to get the basicbasic engram of the case off dont you see well because of the repetitive nature of the bank in goal to game you would have the word game being repeated the length and breadth of the bank to catch catfish my god catfish are all over this bank well oddly enough you can get away withand get some success on discharging withhold or an engram on onepass you know you can always ask the auditing command once you know you can always actually you can always ask it couple of times but you can always ask it once you can always pull the withhold once see you can always do it once and the pcll feel better see oh you canyou could get this one freudian analysis poor devils they must run into this constantly because they dig and evaluate in these things you know this guy would all of suddenwhich wasgave them their thing ofall of sudden remember that his mother used to sing tipperary in the bathroom ah and he remembers this and it cheers him up see feels great feels great you know haremembers this what thewhat do you know oh wow gee terrific its all right man this freudian analysis really works now the analyst says now what significance can you read into this about that and you give few more data and give some of your dreams so that we can integrate them with this tipperary so that this tipperary we can make some sense out of this see now and all that gain goes just like that its gone right now see its out never to return its the wildest phenomenon you ever cared to do im just talking about empirical actions now that you can do as an auditor you say well whats the earliest recollection you have in your childhood see something like this and the person says oh thats pretty good graduating from college and you say well now all right thats thats thats fine thats fine what was particularly notable about that i was embarrassed when the dean gave the diploma haha come to think about it i was well what do you know i feel better fellow auditors leave it alone let it drop with soundless thud at that point you see this is so late the fact that he got any gain or send out of it at all is miraculous but just tapping it bled little charge off of it dont you see but to hit it again will reactivate it and then itll hit all this chain of embarrassment and you could go back into this incident and sometimes when it doesnt have chain you could run it as little engram or as lock you see and itd clean up beautifully and most of them dont have chains so therefore you would get the idea eventually that you could run almost anything you see as an engram but lets say its that unlucky chance that this one has chain embarrassment goes all the way back to freud see and youyoure going to hit this one see the dean gave him his diploma and there it was and hes going to run that and this ones got real beefy chain on it you see right along side of it you could have caught oh incident after incident that you could have run dont you see because theyre not in chains and you get this one and you run it and he sees less to it now run it again it seems more sticky seems more difficult to get to he does it again and he starts worrying more about this now and he does it again and he finds some more in it but if you ask him about mass or if he knew about mass youd find the mass was beefing up why youre hitting too late on the chain in other words you could hit it for moment you could bleed the charge off of it and you could get out of there and youre okay we know this from long time auditing experience on anything which has long chain similar actions you see repeated repeated repeated repeated if you dont get the basic on that chain the chain will not blow and trying to work later than the basic on it will cause beefup for lack of better word strengthening of the mass increase of pressure an increase of energy masses connected with it you can run one of these things till everything gets threedimensional man now its only to basic you dont have to have the basicbasic for the whole case to dispel this illusion you only need the basic on that chain which is embarrassment let us say in this lifetime the first time you were ever embarrassed you get that the whole thing will tear up but if you keep hanging around with this late incident of embarrassment that chain is not going to tear up that is going to get beefier now i dont say that we are dealing with exactly the same phenomena when we deal with the gpm that would be too great conclusion ill merely tell you the same phenomenon is present in the gpm but you can knock the charge out of items b c d f g h i j k l m n p in consecutive order you can find the item you see you can list for the item everything is going to go along just very nice and so forth you can get the random items off of them you see and blow the rocket read off the thing and move down to the next one and so forth and if you go back and you go back over b7 c d7 f g h i j k or you just go back over glets adjust g lets go back and get the pc shadowboxing trying to find the right g when weve already got q see you find this pc start to get desperate after while and if you did this very consistently you would find that there was greater mass on his case now you would increase the amount of apparent mass actually you havent increased the amount of mass there isnt any increase in the mass youve simply made him more aware of the mass that was there for instance if it made him slightly deaf going over b c d f g h 1 j k l m n 0 p1 know my alphabet anywaymade him slightly deaf you know to go over those now you go back over g you know h 1 j he getsstarts getting heavier ear ring see you got away with it before but now its kind of rrrrrrrr and you go over these things again you adjust them out now you will feel that this isnt true because occasionally you over rerun little section and straighten it up and bring the charge down and you apparently will get away with it because the pc was arc broke because it was missed see actually you wont have gotten away with it at all that area has increased because youve reactivated the bottom of the bank thats where the apparent greater charge comes from you see you start hitting and you hit it again and you hit it again well if you were just coming along taking the charge off as you went on down it doesnt have chance to get activated see but by hitting this area getting stuck in the quicksand in other words of this area you keep hitting that and not taking any charge off the lower and hitting it and not taking any charge off the lower then all that lower charge is getting into restimulation and just about blows the pcs head off so you never rerun partially run bank you just dont do it matter what persuasions there are you can go back and adjust couple of items you very often have to adjust couple of items youre already adjusting one at any given time while youre running you canyou sometimes find you have to adjust the item just before that it just wont discharge it just keeps on sporadically rocket reading or something like that it wasnt right in the first place and thats why you cant get your next item you keep trying to get this next item and trying to get this next item you cant get the next item then we get bright and read the item just back of it and find out the things rocket reading its very embarrassing extend that list and adjust that and then take her from there and youre all right thats perfectly normal action providing you dont take more than two thousand hours to get the right item just back of you thats said in sarcasm theres yourthere is yourthe essence of the situation go back block of six six ris oh brother cut your throat the same thing because none of these ris are ready to run at time are you ever running an ri that is ready to run theyre never ready to run theyre supposed to be there forever see theyve lasted this long and so forth well the funny part of it is is you can discharge the basic of the bank now this means then that theres only one direction that you can run in gpm it also forces you to run in this direction and that is from top to bottom you cannot run from bottom to top you think youre running from bottom to top sometimes and then find out youre running from top to bottom anyway oh hes getting the items all backwards but try to run the pattern in reverse sometime if you want picnic youve got all of these words now in sequence and theyre in the proper sequence so keep feeding them to the pc and try to move up in the bank hethe pc starts going aaaahuuuhh what are you doing you see youre moving away from basic see the fundamental ri on the bank of course is the goal at the bottom of the bank and thats holding everything in place in order to get it discharged youve got to discharge the rest of the bank well thats done with the onceover lightly dont you see you discharge every item in rotation as fast as you can and as well as you can and on to the next item and discharge that and as fast and as well as you can and on to the next item and youll win the whole way charge will be blowing off and the pc feels fine thats necessary charge to remove now all of sudden you go back you move back lets go back dozen items and youre going to correct the bank because now you have found correctness is necessary youve had it you start moving down that channel now yes they will all fire again you ought to consider thats mysterious we were all over these things once and theyre all firing again its because the basic charge on the bank hasnt been drawn of course theyll fire again only where are they getting that charge thats leaking up from the bottom so here we go next thing you know the pcs sort of looking very haggard and the eye circles getfirst they come down to here and then they come down to here and then hes justdoesnt have face any more he just has one large eye pouch all that comes from rerunning now the one thing therefore that i have to teach you on the thing is in handling auditing to be very adroit and dont get yourself into situation where you have whole bunch of missed bypassed items and this and that and the other thing and so forth and bunch of arc breaks you can become technically accurate enough so that you dont do that but even if you did bypass some items and run into an arc break so that you can handle the situation well enough as an auditor telling the pc oh well yes oh oh all right all right thats wrong huh okay let make note here pc says its wrong and all right you say theres five more items up above want all right letspc says these items need to be corrected all right the next time we run this bank down from the top well correct them hows that huh pc says all right okay okay all right fine fine right on dont try to overwhelm him with the fact that youre now going to go on over his dead body dont you see teach you those things it becomes necessary that you know them well there are many reasons why you should know them but the principal amongst those reasons happens to be this fact about you cant rerun partially run gpm cant be done you get into trouble pc go upset oh yeah you can get the right items oh yeah you can get it all corrected oh yeah uuuuhhh of course itll all come off and the consequences of having done so will all straighten out when you get to the bottom of the bank and so forth but youll have very rough and uncomfortable time of it for while you cant get the top opptermsyouve got pair of items well you can fool around quite while with that pair of items you can fool around quite while but if you cant get anything to fire after about five hours man youd better cut in with the goal as an ri opposeas oppterm you know the goal as an oppterm cut in and cut the bottom of the bank off of it tell the pc this is going to be very uncomfortable the mass is probably going to follow you all the way down weve missed all of those items i think theres about fifty of them above where were operating and weve missed all of them im sorry but there isnt anything else we can do and when we come back and get this why youll get your top oppterm easily but let us suppose we just took the goal as an oppterm area out and then so weve taken enough charge off the bank now were going to go back and find the top oppterm ohhhhh oh that comes under the heading of rerunning partially run bank you must always run bank down if you start at any point you must go south there is north running for instance if you cut it in as the goal as an oppterm its uncomfortable fine run it all the way down on the pattern but get it right on down to finding his next doing his ri oppgoal as an ri opposed but dont null it because hell get the next goal and hell be interested and other things will happen that are catastrophic now ive triedive tried all versions of stopping short of doing just that and the only step thati give you this very seriouslythe only step that can be omitted is nulling that final list to find the next goal below or earlier than the goal youre running that can be omitted if the list is complete the pc will not arc break and allyou run the risk of his cognitecogniting on the goal because practically all hes got to do is look over his shoulder and he can tell what it is but the pc will tell you what the goal is and if youre plum foolish you wont take enough note of it and wont make enoughyou knowreceive it hard enough make note of it and all that that youve got that thats fine and the pc will then assert that hes got to run it and then if you still dont receive that well enough according to the pc hell run it hell start giving you the top oppterms its all under the heading of assert and youve got the top of your bankof the one you just left isnt run now you want it and everythings going to haha thank you youve got to go back up and finish the top of that off and pass your charge on down the bank and get that well discharged that of course is not as good program as starting at the proper top and going all the way to the end but is preferable to spending seventy five hours trying to find two top oppterms because that soon gets into position of rerunning bank itll activate those lower ris and itll get more and more uncomfortable the absolute time limit on it is something like about five hours and if you cant find it in then you have other choice youve got to cut from under and get lower and go south and then come back and get that top cut the top off even though you have to pass the charge on down to the bottom again its better plan to do it and you willtakes you less time to do it that way yes its uncomfortable to run pc with fifth of the bank unrun above him yes its uncomfortable its far more comfortable than to rerun and rerun and rerun and try and fffzzz got to teach you one thing is to overcome the sales tactics of the pc and his orders so that you wont make the errors which he himself is bound to make thats definite professional liability because he sounds so reasonable teach you the mechanics of that and weve got to teach you also that the bank itself must be run not fooled with when you start running it run it when you get your hands on bank go man go keep going now there are some here whose cases i have used to see whether or not these laws were generally holding true and so forth that is i wasnt restraining them from going but its followed through consistently they would have been better off in any case to have cut into that bank anywhere they would have been better off just to have run series of locks off the top of the bank than to have fooled around for the top oppterm well whats the top item for this bank well ive got one here thats someone whowho coughswhowho coughs yes someone who coughs yeah thats part of the goal to catch catfish all right thats fine now is that terminal or an oppterm all right well thats terminal someone who coughs very good now what who or what would someone who coughs oppose oh well lets see theres dreamy days all right thats fine that rrs im not kidding you im not kidding you itd be better to go through the bank in that fashion of course thats terrible to go through the bank that way because youll get strays and youll skip youll all of sudden find items like steam locomotive you know there are many ways you could run bank but the way you mustnt run one is to partially run one and then rerun it dont ever rerun partially run bank dont ever try to repair partially run bank only repair and run wholly done banks dont spend any time finding top opptermsif it seems impossible cut in and run something ive got to teach you that when you get your hands on bank you run the thing you go you know dont stand around man you go ive had lot of lot of cases and done lot of work on this and adjudication on this ive got subjectiveobjective cases like mad and thats the conclusion i have finally arrived atfinally arrived at one that the auditor has to be sufficient diplomat as to not find himself in positionhes got to be able to handle situation then even though it is wrong and keep going you see becomes requisite see tell the pc all right yeah iwellall right okay i got it all right these areweve missed those withholds all right we missed all those items all right well well get them on the way back is that all right with you settle the arc break that way you see you know learn to handle it withoutwithout having to redo it and the other thing is once you get your paws on bank go dont stand around man dont do it go get the next item and the next item and the next item and the next itemoh so he cant start in at the top of the bank and find the item and the next item all right man skip the top of the bank get in there and go youits something like walking across crust ice see you must not linger and the pc will just shine if you do it rapidly and fast and he will bog to the degree that you redo it accuracy is absolutely imperative so long as you run but accuracy only and without item after item after item being found in good orderout pc arc broke bah the pcll just go into complete apathy the pc is getting loses the pc feels upset the pc isnt up to getting in there and pitching now the pcs enthusiasm is gone the pc doesnt have the lift necessary to rise superior to this bank because hes being crushed by the fact that hes not getting anyplace see you mustnt just stand around and mill find place you can go and go and do it right when you come back through you understand you get the right rocket reading items of course your pcyoull have trouble with your pc at all youve got the pattern of those items now and that patterns getting more exact every day in fact i even know the exact words isnt that horrible and its getting so theres nothing left its wantably and wantable ever hear of those words i never did anyhow theyre in the bank probably the character and the hightoned character of the bank and its parts of speech is what keeps modern language as what it is anyway well there it is i hope you can learn those things but it but take them to heart theyre the essence of running gpm thank you very much
