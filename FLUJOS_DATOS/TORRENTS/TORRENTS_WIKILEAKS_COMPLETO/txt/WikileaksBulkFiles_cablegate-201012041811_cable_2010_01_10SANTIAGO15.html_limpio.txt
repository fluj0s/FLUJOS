emphasized the need to understand the nuances of latin americas leaders and their countries rather than lumping them into populist and prowestern camps during january 12 lunch with as valenzuela bachelet was relatively upbeat on bolivia reserving particular praise for foreign minister choquehuanca and highlighting the many politically moderate bolivians she frankly described the challenges facing argentina from its weak institutions and lack of robust democracy to its unsteady president bachelet holds lula in high esteem and feels that brazils leading presidential candidates are less impressive than their current leader end summary 2 u president bachelet hosted small lunch for as valenzuela at the moneda presidential palace on january 12 foreign minister mariano fernandez under secretary angel flisfisch foreign affairs director general roberto ibarra chilean ambassador to the us jose goni and presidential advisors francisco diaz and marcos robledo accompanied president bachelet while as valenzuela was joined by the ambassador dcm and poloff notetaker bolivia more moderate than many realize 3 c consolidating the worldwide sense of hope inspired by president obama will be the uss big challenge going forward president bachelet told as valenzuela some leaders including bolivias evo morales get caught in trap of opposing individual us officials and agencies similarly there are many moderates in bolivia she said implying that some in the us dont realize this bachelet cautioned against lumping all of latin americas populistleaning leaders together emphasizing that morales was very different from venezuelas hugo chavez and that morales had been fairly elected foreign minister fernandez and deputy foreign minister flisfisch added that morales mas party was likely to do well in aprils local elections further consolidating morales power 4 c bachelet had high praise for bolivian foreign minister david choquehuanca who she said is more sophisticated than some other bolivian leaders and is serene and capable cultural differences are important in understanding bolivia and its leaders bachelet emphasized saying that while she had discussed economic growth with choquehuanca he has different mindset and is more focused on quality of life than economic development for its own sake argentina challenged country with an unsteady president 5 c bachelet was frank about her view of argentina saying that chiles neighbor has problems with credibility as country its democracy is not robust and its institutions are not strong flisfisch added that argentinas unusual federal system and peronist ideologywhich can lead to political paranoiaare additional obstacles to political and economic stability argentines tend to live from crisis to crisis the president added rather than pursuing stable longterm policies 6 c president cristina fernandez kirchner is emblematic of argentinas problems the chileans agreed kirchner is not antius by nature bachelet asserted but is convinced that the 2007 maletinazo incident was plot against her and will not listen to contradictory evidence note maletinazo refers to an incident in which venezuelan officials found nearly us 800000 in cash the suitcase of us citizen at buenos aires airport santiago 00000015 002 of 002 us assistant attorney alleged that the money was illegal contributions for kirchners campaign end note in general kirchner is prone to believing rumors and scurrilous press articles and has tendency to make unfortunate public comments bachelet noted recalling kirchners negative comments after as valenzuelas recent trip to that country 7 c president bachelet highlighted that chile had achieved very positive relationship with argentina despite the challenging political situation there and kirchners shortcomings chile and argentina have number of bilateral agreements in place and during kirchners october visit to santiago the two presidents shared the nowfamous maipu hug after recalling the historic friendship and heroism of both countries brazil presidential candidates cant hold candle to lula 8 c describing lula as political fox president bachelet asserted that brazil does not play major role in most regional issues despite press reports that consistently portray the country as an important regional mediator bachelet views brazil as more interested in playing on the world stage on issues including climate change and nuclear nonproliferation on the other hand brazil has consistently been good ally to chile she asserted describing president lula as intelligent and charming bachelet also offered her opinion of the leading brazilian presidential candidates neither of whom she believes share lulas outstanding qualities she described opposition candidate jose serra as arrogant and lulas favorite cabinet chief dilma roussef as distant and formal chiles presidential election worries about pinera presidency and press bias 9 c turning to chiles fastapproaching presidential election bachelet proffered the widelyheld belief that there is general agreement about policy among the leading candidates and so the candidates behavior and personalities are more important than policy differences nonetheless she said that she was worried about potential pinera presidency particularly because it would create tremendous concentration of power note pinera is wealthy businessman and number of his key advisors will likely come from the business community end note 10 c bachelet expressed frustration over the chilean press sensationalism and anticoncertacion bias every time the frei campaign raises questions about conflict of interest questions surrounding pineras very large stock portfolio the effort is painted as dirty war by the largely rightleaning press which tends to ignore the rights missteps 11 u the assistant secretary cleared this cable simons
