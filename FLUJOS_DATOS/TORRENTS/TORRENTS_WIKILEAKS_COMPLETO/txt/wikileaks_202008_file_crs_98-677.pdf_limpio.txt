timor drew criticism from us human rights groups and members of congress who accused the military of vi olating the human rights of the people of east timor the carter administration on the other hand sought to deal with the issues of east timor and political prisone rs through dialogue with the indonesian government and military from these episodes until the present the executive branch has believed that good relations with the indonesian military ar necessary to promote us strategic interests especially us naval access to the indonesian straits connecting the pacific and indian oceans

guinea and the newly formed federation of malaysia defended by us allies great britain and australia president sukarno also built political alliance with the indonesian communist party pki by 1965 the pki was the largest communist party outside of communist countries with three million members and 20 million in front organizations1 the indonesian military known by its indonesian acronym abri acted as sukarnos instrument in his aggre ssive actions but its relations with the pki appeared to be cool the kennedy administration and congre ss disagreed over whether to continue military aid to indonesia congress cut military aid and economic aid to indonesia in 1963 citing sukarnos grow ing radicalism and aggre ssive acts the kennedy administration opposed this action2 after the military

proposed indonesian rules rega rding foreign naval passage8 the importance to the pentagon of us naval passage through the indonesian straits grew after the soviet invasion of afghanistan and the islamic revolution in iran at the end of the 1970s as result the pentagon formulated strategy to enable the united states to fight two wars simultaneously in the persian gulf and the western pacific predicated on the ability to shift us forces between the indian ocean and the western pacific9 these events also created new factor influencing indonesian attitudes toward us naval acce ss the willingness of indonesia as predominantly muslim state to tolerate us security policy in the persian gulf region in the 1988 oil tanker flagging cris is in the persian gulf and during the 1990 1991 persian gulf conflict majority of the us warships deployed to the gulf traversed the indonesian straits into the indian ocean10 in march 1996 one of the two us aircraft carrier battle groups that the

navy deployed the aircraft carrier the uss independence from japan through indonesian waters to the persian gulf11 2 the political role of the abri executive branch officials and many academic experts on indonesia have argued th at the indonesian military is the arbiter of indonesias political system only th abri it is argued can either affect political change or can thwart change thus this argument goes the united states needs close contacts with the military leader ship in order to influence indonesias political evolution and ensure that any significant political change does not affect us interests adversely the kennedy and johnson administrations argued these points during the tumultuous 19621965 period in defending continued us military aid to indonesia they viewed the abri as the best defense against the pki and sukarnos radicalism12 officials of the carter administration and the state department preferred stra tegy of negotiation with the abri over the issues

counterweight to the emergence of islamic radicalism in indonesia14 views of the military relationship by executive branch critics the critics of cooperative us relationship with the abri include human rights organizations some academics and some members of congress they do not dispute the executive branchs view of th political power of the indonesian military their criticism stresses the power and authority of the abri in east timor aceh province and other situati ons where violations of human rights occur or reportedly occur the executive director of asia watch referred to the unchecked power of the military in east timor15 the critics argue that the united states should base its policy toward the abri on the day to da actions and conduct of the military rather than on future scenarios of the abris role in political crisis they also contend that the executive branch gives too much weight to strategic considerations and inadequate priority to the abris tr eatment of east t imorese and indonesian civilians16 thus the critics of us military aid in the early 1960s viewed the abri as an instrument of sukarnos radicalism and aggression ag ainst indonesias neighbors congress cut military and ec onomic aid to indonesia in 196317 after indonesias invasion of east timor in 1975 the critics accused the ford and carter administrations of allowing the abri to use us weapons in east timor which indonesia had r eceived under us military aid pr ograms in the 1990s critics extended these accusations to the abris actions toward indonesian political and labor

the abri have argued that because of its unique political role the united states must exert direct pressure on it in order to bring about change in its behavior indirect influence through coope rative

that the death toll was at least 50 it concluded that military units though provoked had used excessive force the commissi on called for the prosecution of people who violated the law president
