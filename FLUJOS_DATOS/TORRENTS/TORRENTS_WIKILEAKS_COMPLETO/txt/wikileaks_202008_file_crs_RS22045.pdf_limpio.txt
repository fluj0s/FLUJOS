project baseline of revenues and outlays under current law over the next 10 years arguably better guess of the probable path of the federal budget under current policy might be achieved by modifying three assumptions in the cbo baseline first that discretionary spending will remain constant as share of gdp rather than growing at the rate of inﬂation second that recent tax reductions will be extended rather than allowed to expire third that the alternative minimum tax amt relief will be extended rather than allowing the amt to take back the reductions in regular income tax modifying these baseline assumptions and accounting for the additional debt service required to ﬁnance these policies yield an estimate that the federal budget deﬁcit is likely to be 5 trillion more over the fy2007 through fy2016 period than that shown by the baseline projection the eﬀects of the alternative assumptions grow over time by 2016 the alternative baseline deﬁcit is 861 billion compared to an oﬃcial

budget based on simple rules prescribed by law statute requires cbo to project baseline of revenues and outlays under current law over the next 10 ears arguably better guess of the probable path of the federal budget under curre nt policy might be achieved by modifying three assumptions in the cbo baseline first that discretionary spending will remain constant as share of gdp rather than gr

2016 the alternative baseline deficit is 861 billion compared to an official baseline surplus of 67 billion this report will be updated periodically the congressional budget office cbo pr oduces baseline projections of the budget semiannually so that policym akers have common starting point from which to debate policy changes1 the purpose of the baseline is to project revenues and outlays under current law over the next 10 years it does not include legislative changes even if congress is actively considering them th cbo defines the baseline projection

are contained in the budget enforcement act bea as amended 3 there are other issues surrounding the accuracy of baselines that are not included in this report including the accuracy of economic projections and the treatment of unfunded liabilities for discussion of these issu see crs report rl31414 baseline budget projections discussion of issues by marc labontea benchmark for measuring the budgetary effects of proposed changes in federal revenues or spending by statute cbos baseline projections must estimate the future paths of federal spending and revenues under current law and policies the baseline is therefore not intended to be prediction of future budgetary outcomes instead it is meant to serve as neutral benchmark that lawmakers can use to measure the effects of proposed changes to spending and taxes so for that reason and others actual budgetary outcomes are almost certain to differ from cbos baseline projections2 the cbo baseline tends to be misunderst ood and hence misused headlines such as cbo predicts that the national debt w ill be paid off by 2008 or changes in the baseline projections prove policy change was unaffordable are examples that reflect misunderstanding of the baseline as implie d in the cbo quote the base line is not best guess of future policy outcomes cbo baseline projections rarely provide good indication of the realized path of federal spending and re venues critics have argued that using the cbo baseline as predictor of future budgetary outcomes is in appropriate because veral of the underlying assumptions or rules followed by cbo in ma king the budget baseline are not as realistic as they could be applying alternative ssumptions to the baseline they say could significantly change the projected path of the federal budget th cbo baseline treatment of discretionary spending expiring tax provisions and the alternative minimum tax amt are three assumptions that have been cited as reasons not to use the baseline to forecast future budgetary outcomes3 discretionary spending discretionary spending presents speci problem for budget estimates unlike entitlements there are few legal determinants of its levels instead it is determined annually at the discretion of legislators in its baselin projections cbo is required to assume that overall discretionary spending will stay constant in inflationadjusted terms this has two implications first although di scretionary spending is assumed to keep up with inflation there is adjustment for ex pected population growth under the baseline therefore future discretiona ry spending can buy the same amount of roads or military equipment or government services but there will be fewer of them per person second since the economy as measured by gross domestic product gdp is assumed to grow in real terms over the next 10 years but real discretionary spending is assumed to remain cons tant discretionary spending woul d fall as percentage of gdp this implies that as society becomes wealthier it will not want to spend any of its additional wealth on governme ntprovided discretionary g oods and services although there are undoubtedly some governmentprovi ded goods and services on which peoplehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22045crs3 4 see crs report rs21992 extending the 2001 2003 and 2004 tax cuts by gregg esenweinmay not wish to spend their dditional wealth it is not obvious why this would be true of total discretionary spending as implied by the baseline does recent history suggest what growth rate is most realistic for discretionary spending at least for nondefense discretionary spending assuming spending would stay constant as percentage of gdp is the only assumption that would not consistently underpredict spending levels historically the baseline assumption that discretionary spending will stay constant in inflationadjusted terms would reduce total discretionary spending as share of gdp to its west level in the modern budget era since 1962 nondefense discretionary spendi ng has fluctuated between 32 and 56 of gdp and has been increasing faster than gdp since 1999 defense spending fell as share of gdp after the cold war but has been rising since 2001 if as is likely based on historical standards discretionary spending increases at the growth rate of gdp in other words stays constant as percentage of gdp then total federal outlays will be significantly higher than those levels contai ned in the baseline cbo estimates that under this policy alternative disc retionary outlays will be 14 tr illion larger than the baseline outlays over the fy2007 through fy2016 peri od and the divergence grows over time absent other policy changes higher discreti onary spending would be deficit financed which would increase future interest paym ents on the national debt by 234 billion over the next 10 years extending expiring tax provisions on the revenue side there are also assump tions made in the baseline projection that arguably do not reflect what most observers c onsider to be current policy for example some federal tax provisions pecially many tax credits ve expiration dates cbo is required to assume in its baseline projection that all tax measures unless earmarked to trust fund will expire as sc heduled since that represents current policy according to the law but most of these expiring provisi ons have proven very durable having been routinely extended some examples of ex piring tax provisions include credits or deductions for cleanfuel vehicles qualif ied zone academy bonds welfaretowork medical savings accounts research and ex perimentation and ec onomic development empowerment zones in addition the tax reductions contained in the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act egtrra pl 10716 and the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act jgtrra pl 10827 are scheduled to expire after 20104 the reduction in taxes on capital gains and divi dend income from jgtrra is scheduled to expire after 2008 however it was not the inte ntion of the tax cuts authors that they be temporary and there has been strong congressional and admin istration support for making these tax cuts permanent or at least extending them the cbo baseline projections do not include the revenue effect s of extending or making these tax cuts permanent these omissions greatly inflate the revenue take of the government in the out years cbo estimates that extending the egtrra and jgtrra tax cuts excluding anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22045crs4 5 see crs report rl30149 the alternative minimu m tax for individuals by gregg esenwein 6 see crs report rs21817 the alternative minimum tax amt incomeentry points and take back effects by gregg esenweinextension of expiring alternative minimum tax reform would re duce federal revenues by 16 trillion over the fy2007 through fy 2016 period mostly after 2010 extending the expiring tax provisions such as the deduction for medical savings accounts and welfaretowork tax credit would reduce federal revenues by another 406 billion over the same period the total reduction of 2 tr illion would also engender increased debt service expenditures of 324 b illion hence extending the expiring tax cuts and tax provisions would add 23 trillion to th deficit over the next 10 years the alternative minimum tax and this figure does not take into account the revenue loss associated with extending relief from the alternative minimum tax amt for individuals that expired at the end of 20055 the amt was originally enacted in 1969 to make sure that certain highincome taxpayers were not able to escape their fair share of the federal income tax through the use of special deductions exemptions and credits however because of the recent reductions in the regular income tax and the fact that the amt is not indexed for inflation there will be significant increase in the number of middle to uppermiddle income taxpayers aff ected by the amt in the near future in 1999 about 1 million taxpayers were affected by the amt but estimates indicate that by 2013 if the major tax reductions contained in the egtrra are made permanent then 41 million taxpayers will be subject to the amt to counteract the effects of the amt c ongress increased the amt basic exemption and allowed certain personal tax credits to offset amt tax liability however to minimize the revenue loss these changes have been enacted for one or two years at time and expired at the end of 2005 allowing th amt exemption increas to expire at the end of 2005 means that in the out years th amt will take back much of the regular income tax relief provided by extendi ng the other expiring provisions6 because the revenue estimates of extending the other expiring tax provisions are based on the amt exemption increase expiring after 2005 the out year revenue estimates of these extensions include the amt take back effect as result they significantly understate the actual cost of providing the full amount of projected reductions in the regular income tax if the increase in th amt exemption is not extended throughout the forecast period then the number of taxp ayers subject to the amt will increase dramatically if congress decides to provide taxpayers w ith the full amount of regular income tax relief from the expiring tax provisions the am t would need to be held harmless this means that the amt would not be allowed to take back the tax reductions provided by the extensions of the other expiring middle class tax relie f provisions to hold the amt harmless would require at the least that the amt exemption increase be extended over the same time period as the other middleclass tax reductions ie through the 10year baseline projection peri od fy2007 through fy2016httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22045crs5 cbo estimates that extending and indexing the higher amt exemption which expired at the end of 2005 so that it does not take back the reductions in the regular income tax would reduce revenues by 865 billion over the fy2007 through fy2016 period assuming extension of th other tax reductions in addition debt servicing costs would add 182 billion in additional interest costs to the deficit effects of alternative ssumptions on the baseline cbo estimates baseline based on simple rules prescribed by law arguably better guess of the probabl path of the federal budget under current policy might be achieved by modifying three assumptions in the cbo baseline first that discretionary spending will remain constant as share of gdp rather than growing at the rate of inflation second that recent tax reductions will be extended rath er than allowed to expire third that the amt relief will be extended rather than allowing the amt to take back the reductions in regular income tax the table below shows the effects of these probable policy initiatives on the federal budget deficit over the 10year budget proj ection period modifying these baseline assumptions and accounting for the additional debt service require d to finance these policies means that the federal budget deficit is likely to be 5 trillion higher over the next 10 years than that shown by the baseline pr ojection the effects of the alternative assumptions grow over time by 2016 the alte rnative baseline deficit would be 895 billion compared to an official baseline rplus of 67 billion rather than return to surplus as in the official baseline the deficit would get bigger each year if alternative assumptions are made cbos baseline projection is benchmark and it does not and is not intended to predict the probable path of the federal budget therefore critics say projection that includes alternative assumptions that are likely to occur can provide better starting point for
