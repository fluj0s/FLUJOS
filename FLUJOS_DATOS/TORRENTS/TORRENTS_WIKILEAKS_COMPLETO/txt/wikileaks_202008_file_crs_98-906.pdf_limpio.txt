overview of the immigrationrelated provisions of the international religious freedom act which passed as hr 2431 and became law as public law 105292 the act s general purpose is to promote religious freedom worldwide to this end the act requires new ongoing studies of religious freedom abroad and calls for targeted respons to findings of religious persecution at the same time knowledge obtaine d about religious persecution abroad also is to be integrated into the asylum and refugee proce sses in addition to providing more detailed information about religious persecution the ac t attempts to identif and overcome certain other potential obstacles to timely and accura determinations on refugee and asylum applications separately the act bars certain participants in religious persecution from entry into the united states new training and guidelines the act establishes new administrative offices to review religious freedom abroad on an ongoing basis the secretary of state is to draw on this review and other sources to sub mit an annual report on in ternational religious freedom among other information the annual report is to describe and assess the statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98906crs2 of religious freedom in each foreign country the act expressly requires that the annual report together with other relevant documentation serve as resource for officers who determine asylum and refugee cla ims based on religious persecution aliens abroad potentially may be admitted into the us as refugees if they face persecution in their homelands the act sets new training requirements for us officers who screen aliens for potential admission as refugees and includes training on religious persecution among these new requirements training in refugee law and religious persecution also is now required for new us consular officers more generally the act calls for new guidelines to address potentia l biases in foreign personnel who serve in positions that may affect the determination of refugee claims and uniform procedures are to be established for governmentdesignated refugee processing entities that assist in preparing refugee case files the act further requires the administration to incorporate certain information on religious persecution into the refugee consultation process which addresses which groups of refugees are to be admitted however unlike earlier versions of religious persecution bills considered by the house the act does not give members of persecuted religious minorities refugee admission priority at least as high as that given to members of other persecuted groups aliens in the united st ates who face persecution abroad may apply for asylum with an asylum officer of the immigration and naturalization service or if they are in removal proceedings with an immigration judge the act requires increased training on religious persecution for both asylum officers and immigration judges it also requires new guidelines to assure that individuals with potential biases against asylum applicants are not used as interp reters during the asylum process studies of expedited removal two laws enacted in 1996 required new procedures for quickly expelling aliens who arrive without proper documents except for those aliens who can show on arrival that they have credible fear of being persecuted abroad because this expedited removal pr ocess demands expediti ous screening of new arrivals there has been concern that some aliens may not have an adequate opportunity to show that they deserve more thorough c onsideration of their persecution claims the act directs the comptroller general to study the expedited removal process and its affects on potential asylum applicants additionally the newly created commission on international religious freedom is authorized to designate experts on refugee and asylum law and invite them to submit their own report on the expedited removal process either together with the comptroller general or separately unlike some earlier religious persecution bills the act does not expressly call for the possible involvement of the high co mmissioner on refugees in expedited removal studies nor like some earlier versions does the act set forth separate standard for assessing credible f ear claims based on religious grounds exclusion of religious persecutors the act sets forth new separate ground for barring aliens from admission into the ited states under this new ground an alien is inadmissible if the alien while serving as foreign government official carried out or was responsible for particul arly severe violation of religious freedom during the previous 24 months such an aliens spouse and children are also inadmissible
