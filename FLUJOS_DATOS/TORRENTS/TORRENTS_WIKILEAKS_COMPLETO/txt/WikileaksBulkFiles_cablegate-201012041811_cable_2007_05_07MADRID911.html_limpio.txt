fata eo 12958 decl 05142017 tags prel marr sp subject scenesetter for usspain high level defense talks classified by ambassador eduardo aguirre for reasons 14 b d 1 cnf dan welcome back to spain i appreciate your patience and efforts to finally resolve the ncisosi issue and im glad that youve made this highlevel defense committee hldc meeting priority now that the permanent committee is back on track handling routine issues at the staff level we can use the hldc forum to share views and set strategic direction on key international policy issues like afghanistan kosovo the couso case missile defense the nato summit in 2008 and future us use of moron and rota military bases as weve discussed before spain can at times be difficult partner but never more so than when it feels ignored this meeting along with secretary rices visit in few weeks should reassure the gos that we take it seriously but while reminding mod that we have high expectations of such important partners us use of spanish bases 2 cnf the dcm the embassys politicalmilitary team and i travel regularly to rota and moron the spanish bases where nearly 3000 us troops and dependents live and work with each successive visit i am more impressed by the important activities and outstanding workinglevel cooperation at the bases the czech deputy prime minister planning for the possibility of us missile defense installations in his country recently visited rota in order to understand how the us military behaves as tenant perhaps on your next trip youll be able to travel to southern spain to get better idea of the key role that the bases play in us efforts in iraq afghanistan and other operations as you know it is taking mod longer than we expected to implement its new interagency process for reviewing proposed naval criminal investigative service and usaf office of special investigations activities we continue to press them to speed the process so that we can begin to implement the agreement and our investigators can get back to work afghanistan 3 cnf despite the limitations imposed by spanish domestic politics which are foremost in every ministers mind due to nationwide localregional elections in two weeks and national elections within the year spain remains stalwart ally in afghanistan though not currently in position to increase the 690soldier troop ceiling that parliament set the gos insists that it is committed to maintain current levels for the long haul your primary interlocutor mod secretary general for policy luis cuesta recently spent week in kabul and herat with his counterpart from mfa they both returned relatively optimistic that natoisaf is making progress but understanding more clearly than ever that nato wont be able to leave anytime soon top mod leaders have also told us privately that chod general sanz has initiated discussions in brussels regarding the possibility that spain would staff the core of the isaf hq in summer 2008 after spanish elections we continue to press the gos to increase its public diplomacy efforts and to consider doing more when it is able 4 cnf while the gos has lately complained about the lack of coordination between isaf and operation enduring freedom specifically the airstrikes in herat province that killed civilians as well as taliban spain remains active on the security and reconstruction fronts the spanish provincial reconstruction team prt is well regarded for involving local afghanis in its efforts to provide basic services and critical infrastructure to the people of badghis province but mfa officials note that there is sign of the central government or national security forces in the province while carefully complying with its caveat spanish troops supported natoisafs operation achilles earlier this spring by sealing the southern border of their zone regarding its sevilla ministerial commitments mod sources say that two spanish military training teams omlts will arrive in afghanistan in early june to begin training afghan national army troops they have told us that that these 3050 soldiers will be in addition to the 690 troops that are already deployed the spanish army is also proceeding with its purchase of tactical uavs and expects to have them in the field later this year kosovo 5 cnf in the balkans where its troops have served for more than 15 years spain has shown its ability to maintain troops for the longterm right now however we need keep madrid 00000911 002 of 003 making our case to keep troops in kosovo for domestic political reasons and fear of provoking russia spain is ambivalent about the current direction of kosovo policy so long as there is resolution authorizing the ahtissari plan spain will maintain its troops in kfor if the fails to agree on new resolution spain has said that it would have to seriously consider pulling its troops out but has emphasized that it would do this only in extremis and only in careful consultation with allies we need to keep the pressure on reminding spain that nato has critical role and that we cant let the russians drive wedge between the us and europe on issues like this missile defense 6 cnf though initially tentative about the us missile defense md plan spain listened carefully to the missile defense agency deputy director bg oreillys presentation in march asked some tough questions and has taken the position that so long as the us attends to russian and is willing to discuss the issue in nato it wont stand in the way mod said that it will soon announce support for the development of nato study on the issue mod has asked to see simulation of how well the proposed md system would cover spain though it says that it doesnt currently see particular threat from iran and is willing to support the uss plan primarily as show of solidarity among allies while we need to continue to inform and engage mod on this issue we dont see spain causing problems on missile defense nato 7 cnf on 2008 nato summit issues of enlargement and partnership spain believes that nato should keep an open door to european applicants who can qualify mod says that the balkans should be treated as single unit despite their different stages of development because it will be important to future balkans stability to eventually get them all around the nato table regarding ukraine and georgia spain is not opposed to the idea that they would eventually join nato but says that the best thing at the moment is to wait and see what direction they choose to go spain is big fan of nato partnerships especially the mediterranean dialogue which it believes should be strengthened for the sake of fighting terrorism in north africa and supporting the current governments and militaries against extremists mod says that the med dialogue countries know that they arent going to someday join nato but that they should be invited to observe exercises included in training and given other opportunities to deepen ties and cooperate with nato critical sidebar issues 8 cnf couple of other key issues will be in the air if not actually on the agenda for our side it will be important to continue to raise the couso case in which three us servicemen face charges related to the 2003 death of spanish cameraman jose couso during the battle for baghdad xxxxxxxxxxxx i raised this issue with vice president vega on april 30 she was supportive but uncertain that direct gos involvement would be productive dcm spoke late last week with the deputy justice minister and we continue to prod the gos to appeal we were informed monday morning that the chief prosecutor of spains national court has indeed filed an appeal which will go to the same court which originally dismissed the case in 2006 on procedural grounds the deputy digenpol in mod told the embassy last week that mod completely supports the us position and said that he would raise with his superiors the possibility of making statement to the court or otherwise demonstrating support the deputy justice minister also said the gos strongly opposes case brought against former secretary rumsfeld and will work to get it dismissed the sipdis judge involved in that case has told us he has already started the process of dismissing the case 9 cnf an issue that mod may raise with you is their perception of imbalance in the defense industrial relationship the hldc is not the most appropriate forum for discussion of this issue especially since volkman director of international cooperation for acquisitions will be in madrid at the same time as you precisely for the longscheduled 17th usspain defense industrial cooperation committee meeting and the 4th usspain declaration of madrid 00000911 003 of 003 principles meeting nonetheless spanish defense ministry officials have seen you with secretary gates and may raise the issue with you in hopes of getting it toplevel attention defense minister alonso has raised the issue in public speeches and his people have raised it in meetings they point to spanish purchases like 24 tomahawk missiles and us aegis combat systems for its f100 frigates and s80 subs which the gos made over the protests of european allies like france and germany and say that while mod plans to continue strong relationship with the us defense industry and knows that it is getting the best when it buys us it would appreciate gesture from the us so that it can show domestic audiences that spain gets something out of the relationship while we continue to push spain to buy into the joint strike fighter program we know that spain is very anxious to learn whether spanish company eadscasa will get the joint cargo aircraft contract we try to remind mod that while there may be dollar imbalance in the defense relationship spain benefits from the relationship in other ways not only getting the best technology for its military but also being able to sell products that include us technology to third countries 10 cnf we want to use the hldc to further strengthen the permanent committee and are pleased that eucom will propose the joint working group as means to increase eucom involvement on spanish military issues direct and ongoing communication between mod and eucom at the staff level can only help us to avoid minor problems that have the potential to escalate like ncisosi aguirre
