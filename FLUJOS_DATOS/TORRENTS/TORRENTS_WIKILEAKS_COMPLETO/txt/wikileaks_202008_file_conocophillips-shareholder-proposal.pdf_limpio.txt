the us securities and exchange commission commission held that registrant involvement with states that have sponsored terrorism is legitimate concern of reasonable investors in making decisions to invest in company and whereas since 1988 company has repeatedly failed to fully disclose all company involvement with the great socialist peoples libyan arab jarnahiriya libya and the islamic republic of iran iran both states that the us department of state has identified as having sponsored terrorism resolved the board of directors 1 shall establish committee special committee of nonemployee

complies with all commission rules and regulations for review by investors before september 1 12008 shareholder statement since 1988 the company has been involved with states that have sponsored terrorism that has resulted in the killing or maiming of tens of thousands of innocent people using the companys political influence with the administrators of the federal agencies responsible for enforcing antiterrorism laws company officers have gained the benefits of these agencies turning blindeye to company involvement with these rogue states in exchange company officers extended promises of company involvement including the transfer of financial and technological assets as bait for surreptitious involvement that the federal agencies use as cover for conducting espionage against these states the failure of the board of directors to disclose the liabilities accruing to the companys reputation and assets that arise from this surreptitious entanglement of the interests of politically motivated bureaucrats and shareholders is fraud against shareholders see httdiranconocoaffairus since 1995 when the public learned that the company had used its foreign subsidiaries to conceal company involvements with iran the company began to enter into partnerships with foreign business entities that were willing to act as intermediaries or surrogates for continuing company involvement with iran the company continues to use this scheme to transfer shareholder assets including financial and technical assets into iran through the malasian exhibit government controlled petronas more recently the company opened new channel for involvement in iran by buying large stake in the socalled privatized russian controlled lukoil in 2003 company officers successfully derailed similar proposal that was submitted by office of the comptroller of the city of new york in his letter on february 32004 executive vice president and chief financial officer john carrig asserted to the office of the comptroller of the city of new york that conocophillips will not approve business activities in sensitive countries unless it is convinced that it can do so legally and within the spirit of us law i hope this satisfies your inquiry and will permit the office of the comptroller to withdraw its shareholder proposal and notify the sec that it has done so despite mr carrigs assurances the company continued its involvement with iran through petronas or lukoil this proposal will assure that what the board of directors and shareholders are apprised of all company involvement with states that have sponsored terrorism and the liabilities that are accruing through these surreptitious activities roger k parsons urges you to vote for this resolution what vote is required to approve this proposal

relationships with all third parties with which we conduct business to ensure such relationships and transactions in which we participate are conducted in compliance with applicable laws with regard to our investment in lukoil conocophillips initiated its strategic equity investment in lukoil primarily to gain exposure to russias oil and natural gas resource potential where lukoil has significant positions in proved oil and natural gas reserves and production likewise conocophillips has notified lukoil of our commitment to be in compliance with us economic sanctions in the contexts of the secondment of conocophillips employees to lukoil and of our representative serving on the lukoil board of directors in 2005 following the lifting of us economic sanctions in libya we announced our
