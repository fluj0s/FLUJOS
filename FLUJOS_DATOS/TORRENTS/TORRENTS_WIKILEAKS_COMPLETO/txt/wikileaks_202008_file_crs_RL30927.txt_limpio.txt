domestic social policy division the federal minimum wage the issue of indexation summary periodically congress has considered proposals to index the federal minimum wage indexation would result in regular automatic adjustments in the minimum wage using changes in an economic measure such as consumer prices the cost of living hourly labor costs or hourly wages if indexation were implemented the approach adopted could well depend on congress view of the rationale for having statutory minimum wage several arguments have been made in support of minimum wage these arguments include providing living wage and ensuring that fair wage is paid in labor markets that do not fit the model of perfect competition these reasons do not prescribe the level at which the minimum wage should be set but they do suggest what kind of economic measure could be used for indexation living wage can be defined in either real or relative terms maintaining the real value of the minimum wage would maintain its constant purchasing power to maintain real value of the minimum wage the wage could be indexed to changes in the cost of living or alternatively to changes in the price of consumption goods maintaining relative value of the minimum wage would maintain its value compared to other wages to maintain relative value of the minimum wage the wage could be indexed to measure of hourly labor costs or hourly earnings the standard of living tends to rise over time because of improvements in labor productivity and advances in technology that result in new or improved products therefore maintaining the relative value of the minimum wage would likely increase its real value over time both the real and relative values of the minimum wage have varied noticeably over time therefore the future value of the minimum wage if indexed would depend importantly on the initial value or base period selected the initial value could be the real or relative value of the minimum wage at the time indexation is adopted or as congress has done with other federal programs some future or past value could be used using six different economic measures calculations show that if the minimum wage were indexed using its highest or median past real or relative value as the base period the minimum wage in september 2006 or the end of 2005 depending on the measure would have been higher than 515 for four of the six measures the minimum wage reached its peak real value in february 1968 the other two measures were not available in 1968 depending on the measure used if the 160 minimum wage of february 1968 had been indexed the minimum wage in september 2006 would have been between 776 and 946 an hour on the other hand three of the six measures show that if indexation were to use the base period when the minimum wage was at its lowest real value the minimum wage in september 2006 would have been less than 515 this report will only be updated occasionally contents introduction 1

to 725 an hour1 periodically congress has also considered the issue of indexation which would result in regular automatic adjustments in the minimum wage using changes in an economic measure such as consumer prices the cost of living labor costs or hourly wages2 this report examines several aspects of the issue of indexing the basic federal minimum wage if indexation were implemented the approach adopted could well depend on congress view of the rationale for having minimum wage therefore the report discusses the major arguments that have been made in support of minimum wage some economic measures that could be used for indexation appear to be more consistent than others with the major arguments for minimum wage therefore the report also examines several economic measures that could be used for indexation finally if indexation were adopted the future value of the minimum wage would depend not only on the economic measure used but also on the base period selected ie initial value of the minimum wage using different economic measures and base periods the report illustrates what the minimum wage would have been in september 2006 or the end of 2005 depending on the measure if it had been indexed the report does not discuss the employment income training or other effects of the minimum wage3 additionally the paper does not examine how an increase in the minimum wage compares to other policy options for achieving the same objectives 1 for description of minimum wage legislation in the 110th congress see crs report rl33754 minimum wage in the 110th congress by william g

act of 1938 flsa pl 75718 fixed in law basic federal minimum wage of 025 an hour for covered workers since it was enacted in 1938 the minimum wage has been raised 19 times currently january 2007 the basic minimum wage is 515 an hour with lower wage for tipped employees certain new hires under the age of 20 handicapped workers and fulltime students who work parttime4 since 1938 congress has also expanded coverage of the minimum wage5 but the flsa also includes number of exceptions and exemptions to the minimum wage an estimated twothirds of wage and salary workers are covered and subject to the minimum wage the largest group of workers exempt from the minimum wage are executive administrative and professional employees6 most workers subject to the minimum wage earn more than the basic rate in 2005 an estimated 19 million workers were paid the federal minimum wage of 515 or less this represented 25 of workers who were paid on an hourly basis among workers paid the minimum wage or less 26 were between the ages of 16 and 19 27 were between 20 and 24 and 47 were 25 or older majority 66 of minimum wage workers were women most 82 were white while 11 were black and 15 were of hispanic origin majority of minimum wage earners worked parttime 607 between legislated increases the minimum wage has tended to erode in real value and decline relative to average hourly wages the minimum wage erodes in real value because of inflation ie economywide increases in prices it declines relative to average hourly wages because of inflation and wage increases due to 4 the minimum wage

2006 and it shows the minimum wage as percentage of the average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers from 1964 through september of 20068 the peaks in each graph coincide with years when the minimum wage was raised figure 1 value of the federal minimum wage reasons for minimum wage if indexation were implemented the approach adopted would likely depend on congress view of the reasons for having minimum wage several reasons have been offered to justify statutory minimum wage these reasons include to provide living wage to improve the likelihood that fair wage will be paid in labor markets that do not fit the model of perfect competition and to increase aggregate demand9 these reasons do not prescribe the level at which the minimum wage should be set but they do suggest what kind of economic measures could be used for indexation 8 production or nonsupervisory workers include production workers in goodsproducing industries eg manufacturing construction and mining and nonsupervisory workers in serviceproducing industries eg education health and social services food services hotels and motels financial services and professional and business services 9 discussion of the different economic arguments made by members of congress to justify federal minimum wage can be found in crs report 89568 the fair labor standards act analysis of economic issues in the debates of 19371938 by william g whittaker this report is not active but is available from the author upon request crs4 living wage common argument made in support of statutory minimum wage is that worker should be paid less than living wage living wage can be defined in either real terms or relative to the wages of other workers whether defined in real or relative terms living wage could be adjusted periodically through separate legislative acts alternatively the real or relative value of living wage could be adjusted regularly through indexation in real terms living wage can be defined as wage that provides given standard of living this standard of living can be represented by basket of consumer goods consisting of food shelter clothing and other goods and services the size of the basket of goods could provide subsistence or higher standard of living indexing the minimum wage to maintain its real or constant value would maintain the ability of minimum wage earners working given number of hours to purchase this basket of goods10 living wage can also be defined relative to the wages of other workers or more specifically relative to the wages of given category of workers indexing the minimum wage to preserve its relative value would maintain the position of minimum wage workers relative to other workers real wages tend to rise as productivity increases therefore maintaining the relative value of the minimum wage would likely raise the standard of living of minimum wage workers as productivity increased the minimum wage would purchase an expanding basket of goods economic efficiency second argument made in support of statutory minimum wage is that the opportunities for employment are not the same for all individuals and that minimum wage is one way to ensure fair wage for all workers employed in jobs that require limited skills the economic argument for fair wage is that the labor markets for lowwage work may not fit the economic model of perfect competition and that minimum wage is one way to improve economic efficiency fair wage is defined here as the wage paid in labor markets that fit the model of perfect competition the following are the main features of perfectly competitive labor market 1 there are many employers buyers and many workers sellers therefore individual employer or employee is able to influence wages or employment ie employer or employee has market power 2 an employer does not prefer one worker over another equally qualified worker ie equally qualified workers are perfect substitutes11 likewise worker does not prefer one employer over another employer who pays the same wage for the same kind of work 3 employers and employees including potential employees have equal access to 10 in this report the term goods refers to both goods and services 11 under perfect competition economists say that sellers in this case individuals who are selling their labor services are selling relatively homogeneous good crs5 labor market information eg about job vacancies and wage rates which is available at little or cost ie there is perfect information 4 investors in order to maximize profits are free to invest where they will earn the greatest return individuals in order to maximize their total satisfaction or utility are free to move in and out of the labor force and from one job to another12 according to standard economic analysis perfect competition results in the most efficient allocation of resources ie capital labor and natural resources in turn an efficient allocation of resources provides the greatest amount of output and consumer satisfaction from given supply of inputs13 if labor markets for lowwage jobs do not fit the model of perfect competition standard economic analysis indicates that governments could it they choose intervene to improve economic efficiency it is sometimes argued that labor markets for lowwage jobs may not fit the model of perfect competition14 for instance employers and workers in lowwage labor markets may have unequal market power employers and workers may have unequal access to labor market information or some employers may not treat equally qualified workers as perfect substitutes an example of where an employer is able to influence wages is labor market characterized by single large employer called monopsonist in this kind of labor market an employer is able to pay lower wages than would exist in competitive labor market15 an example of where employers and workers may have unequal access to information is labor market where some workers lack the means or ability to communicate effectively with employers or employment agencies eg because of language differences or where lack of adequate transportation limits the ability of workers to find and compare job vacancies an example of where an employer may not treat equally qualified workers as perfect substitutes is where an employer or employees for whatever reason discriminate against certain group or groups of persons if it is believed that workers in lowwage labor markets are at disadvantage in obtaining information about jobs or in bargaining over wages with employers one of the ways that governments can attempt to improve economic efficiency is to enact statutory minimum wage see are there other policy options below 12 lloyd g reynolds stanley h masters and colletta h moser labor economics and labor relations 10th ed englewood cliffs nj prenticehall 1991 pp 1631 hereafter cited as reynolds et labor economics and labor relations 13 an efficient allocation of resources may nevertheless result in socially unacceptable distribution of income leading many citizens to favor public policies that result in more equal distribution of income 14 for discussion of departures from the model of perfect competition sometimes called market failures see joseph stiglitz economics of the public sector 2nd ed new york ww norton co 1988 pp 7181 15 monopsonist also tends to higher fewer workers than would an otherwise identical firm in competitive labor market walter nicholson microeconomic theory 4th ed chicago dryden press 1989 pp 63033 639 crs6 increase aggregate demand one of the reasons given to justify minimum wage when it was first enacted in 1938 was that it would increase the purchasing power of lowwage workers and therefore increase aggregate demand and reduce unemployment in the 1930s the united states was in period of prolonged high unemployment indexation would probably be inconsistent however with policy of using the minimum wage to manage shortterm aggregate demand first when economic growth is slowing or the economy is contracting fiscal and monetary policy can put more money in the hands of consumers eg through tax cuts increased government spending or lower interest rates using the minimum wage for this purpose would imply that the minimum wage should be raised only when unemployment is rising or at least that increases should be greater when unemployment is rising than when it is falling indexation on the other hand would result in regular adjustments in the minimum wage whether unemployment is rising or falling second indexation could raise the minimum wage less or even reduce it when unemployment is rising than when it is falling wages and prices often rise more rapidly when the economy is expanding and unemployment is falling conversely wages and prices often rise more slowly and may even fall when the economy is contracting and unemployment is rising thus although the effect may not be large indexation could result in larger increases in the minimum wage during an economic expansion when unemployment is falling than during an economic slowdown or contraction when unemployment is rising legislation to index the minimum wage could however include mechanism to accelerate the increase in the wage rate when unemployment is rising and slow the increase when unemployment is falling16 indexing the minimum wage developing legislation to index the minimum wage would involve two basic decisions 1 choosing an economic measure to be used for indexation and 2 selecting the initial value of the minimum wage implementation would involve additional decisions such as how often to adjust the minimum wage and how actually to calculate the adjustment in the minimum wage from the economic measure chosen eg whether to use annual changes in the index septembertoseptember changes or some other approach 16 an overall consensus has not been reached on the employment effects of raising the minimum wage if the minimum wage is raised more when unemployment is rising than when it is falling the effect on job loss may be greater when the shortterm objective is to reduce unemployment from this perspective indexation may be less harmful to employment than policy of enacting larger increases in the minimum wage when unemployment is rising the effect of an increase in the minimum wage on the aggregate earnings of minimum wage workers depends on the elasticity of demand for minimum wage labor aggregate earnings will increase if the percentage decrease in minimum wage employment is less than the percentage increase in the minimum wage ie if demand for minimum wage workers is inelastic most studies have found that the demand for lowwage workers is inelastic paul samuelson and william d nordhaus microeconomics 16th ed new york mcgrawhill 1998 p 76 crs7 this section discusses the choice of an economic measure for indexation and the selection of base period using different economic measures and initial values of the minimum wage the section concludes with illustrations of what the minimum wage would have been in september 2006 or the end of 2005 depending on the measure if it had been indexed at some point in the past selecting an economic measure although the reasons commonly given for having minimum wage do not prescribe the level at which the minimum wage should be set they do suggest what kind of economic measures could be used for indexation this section discusses several such measures some of the measures have been produced for decades while others are relatively new some are produced monthly while others are produced quarterly maintaining the real value of the minimum wage if the main reason for minimum wage is to maintain the real standard of living of minimum wage workers the wage could be indexed to changes in the cost of living or changes in the price of consumption goods consumer price index in its simplest form price index measures the change in the cost of given basket of goods between two time periods eg from one month to the next or from one year to the next the consumer price index cpi is probably the most widely known price index the cpi is published by the bureau of labor statistics bls of the us department of labor prices are collected in urban areas across the united states from various retail establishments including grocery stores department stores gas stations hospitals and others17 bls measures consumer price changes for two population groups 1 urban wage earners and clerical workers and 2 all urban consumers the cpi for urban wage earners and clerical workers the cpiw is based on the buying patterns of households that earn over half of their income from wage or clerical occupations this group represents about 32 of the us population the cpi for all urban consumers the cpiu is based on the spending patterns of all urban households and covers approximately 87 of the population18 the cpi is used in the administration of several federal programs the cpiw is used to adjust social security benefits and to convert into constant dollars the average hourly earnings data that bls collects from survey of employers the cpi u is used to adjust benefits under the food stamp program and to adjust the 17 for more information on the cps see crs report rl30074 the consumer price index brief overview by brian w cashell hereafter cited as crs report rl30074 the consumer price index brief overview 18 the major expenditure categories included in the cpi are food and beverages housing including fuels utilities and furnishings apparel transportation medical care recreation education and other goods and services crs report rl30074 the consumer price index brief overview us department of labor bureau of labor statistics the consumer price index bls handbook of methods at httpwwwblsgovopubhompdf homch17pdf pp 12 hereafter cited as bls the consumer price index crs8 individual income tax brackets19 one advantage of using the cpi for indexation is that unlike most other economic measures the published index is rarely revised the method for producing the index is revised however20 cost of living index strictly speaking the cpi is not cost of living index cost of living index measures changes in the price of basket of goods that maintains constant standard of living or wellbeing21 the composition of this basket of goods is not fixed but changes over time for example the relative prices of goods may change causing consumers to spend more on goods whose prices have fallen relative to the prices of other goods similarly consumer tastes may change or new or improved products may be introduced the cpi may not immediately capture changes in consumer spending patterns thus when consumers switch to goods that have fallen in price relative to the prices of other goods the cpi does not automatically take into account the increased consumption of the lowerpriced goods accordingly whether the cpi rises or falls many believe that changes in the index may overstate changes in the cost of living22 the bureau of economic analysis bea of the us department of commerce produces price indexes that are closer to cost of living index than price index that does not take into account changes in consumer spending habits these indexes are called chaintype price indexes the chaintype price index for personal consumption expenditures pce combines price index for consumption expenditures based on spending patterns for previous time period with price index based on spending patterns for current time period23 this index allows for changes in consumer spending habits over time24 19 crs report 9859 food stamps background and funding by joe richardson crs report rl30007 individual income tax rates

many price indexes several of which would be continued crs9 maintaining the relative value of the minimum wage if the main reason for minimum wage is to maintain the value of the minimum wage relative to the wages of other workers the wage could be indexed to measure of hourly labor costs or of hourly earnings indexing the minimum wage to price or cost of living index would maintain the constant value of the minimum wage however the overall standard of living tends to improve over time because of increases in labor productivity and because of advances in technology that result in new or improved products25 therefore maintaining the relative value of the minimum wage would likely increase its real value over time an index of labor costs or measure of hourly wages may reflect increases in labor productivity perhaps not completely accordingly indexing the minimum wage to such measure would tend to raise the real purchasing power of minimum wage workers26 during some periods maintaining the relative value of the minimum wage could lower the standard of living of minimum wage workers27 this could happen if wages or labor costs increase more slowly than inflation however legislation to index the minimum wage could prohibit reduction in the real value of the wage in addition the real value of the minimum wage would differ if it is indexed to 24 continued inconsistent with the commonly stated purposes of the minimum wage for example bea prepares two indexes that are based on economywide changes in prices these indexes are the gross national product gnp deflator and the gross domestic product gdp deflator gnp includes the sum of personal consumption private investment government spending and net exports gdp is the sum of domestic expenditures for consumption investment and government goods thus while both these indexes capture changes in the prices of consumption goods they also capture changes in prices of investment goods eg buildings and machinery and government spending eg military equipment to maintain its real or constant value the minimum wage could be indexed to changes in measure of constant poverty level of income the federal government publishes official poverty thresholds for families of different size and composition these poverty thresholds are used in estimating the number of poor in the united states the poverty income guidelines used to administer several federal programs are developed from the official poverty thresholds the thresholds are adjusted each year using changes in the cpiu thus indexing the minimum wage to changes in the official poverty thresholds would yield the same results as indexing the minimum wage to the cpiu 25 in the long term labor productivity may increase because of increases in physical capital eg equipment per worker and human capital eg education and training per worker as well as advances in technology shorter term changes in labor productivity may occur because of changes in the utilization of resources over the business cycle or because of changes in the composition of the workforce eg labor productivity may change if the average age of the workforce increases or decreases 26 reynolds et labor economics and labor relations p 256 27 from about the mid1970s to the mid1990s real average hourly wages fell for production workers in manufacturing and for production workers in the private nonfarm sector the timing and magnitude of changes depend on which price index and which measure of hourly wages are used crs10 measure of cash wages or measure of total compensation ie wages plus fringe benefits labor cost index perhaps the governments broadest measure of hourly labor costs is the employment cost index eci the eci is produced by bls and is measure of the change in the hourly cost of labor to employers the eci provides data for the private nonfarm economy excluding private households and the public sector excluding the federal government data are collected quarterly from approximately 11000 establishments in the private nonfarm economy and 800 establishments in state and local government the eci is produced in several different forms including separate series for wages and salaries excluding overtime pay total compensation ie wages and salaries plus overtime pay and fringe benefits civilian workers nonfarm private industry plus state and local government and nonfarm private industry workers28 the eci is used to adjust the pay of members of congress and of federal white collar employees the ethics reform act of 1989 pl 101194 called for annual adjustments in the pay of members of congress using changes in the eci for wage and salary workers in nonfarm private industry less onehalf percentage point however congress denied the annual increases for 1994 through 1997 and for 1999 annual adjustments were accepted for 1998 and 2000 through 200629 the federal employees pay comparability act pl 101509 called for the same adjustments in the base pay of federal whitecollar employees but the provision has not been implemented as enacted30 average hourly earnings bls publishes data on average hourly earnings for several categories of workers the data are collected each month from sample of approximately 400000 nonfarm establishments31 the largest category of workers for which average hourly earnings data are available consists of production or nonsupervisory workers in the private nonfarm sector production or nonsupervisory workers are subset of total private nonfarm employees therefore compared with the eci which covers most private nonfarm workers measure of the average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers covers smaller portion of the workforce according to preliminary estimates in 2006 production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls accounted for an estimated 686 of total 28 us department of labor bureau of labor statistics employment cost index september 2006 available at

production workers in manufacturing represented approximately 110 of all production or nonsupervisory workers32 improving the efficiency of labor markets if the main reason for minimum wage is to improve the efficiency of lowwage labor markets the wage could be indexed to measure of hourly labor costs hourly earnings or combination of price changes and labor productivity on the other hand indexation may not address inefficiencies due to incomplete labor market information or other factors economic measures used for illustrations the illustrations section below shows what the value of the basic federal minimum wage would have been in september 2006 or the end of 2005 if it had been indexed using the six economic measures listed below the measures were selected because they are consistent with the reasons commonly given for having minimum wage in general the first three indexes would maintain the real value of the minimum wage while the last three would maintain the relative value of the minimum wage 1 the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers cpi w33 the cpiw is available on monthly basis since before 1938 when the federal minimum wage was first adopted compared with the cpiu the cpiw may be better reflection of the spending habits of wage earners on the other hand the cpiw may exclude many parttime workers who represent significant share of lowwage workers34 2 the consumer price index for all urban consumers research series35 over the years bls has introduced number of changes in the way it measures changes in prices each improvement is intended to make the cpiu more accurate but the historical cpiu is not adjusted to take the improvements into account the cpi urs adjusts the historical cpiu beginning with december 1977 to take into 32 based on preliminary estimates in 2006 there were an estimated 1354 million total employees on nonfarm payrolls an estimated 928 million production or nonsupervisory workers on

allows for changes in consumer spending patterns this index is closer than the cpiw to cost of living index 4 the employment cost index eci for wages and salaries of workers in the civilian nonfarm

percentage changes in the economic measures used in this report as can be seen the pattern in the yeartoyear changes is similar for each of the economic measures however depending on the time period examined there may or may not be significant differences in the annual rates of change in these six indexes table 1 compares the annual rates of change in the above economic measures over two different time periods the 25year period from 1981 to 2006 and the 15year period from 1991 to 2006 comparison of columns 2 and 3 shows that prices and wages increased more in the 1980s than in the following years also the eci and the two measures of hourly earnings generally increased more than the pce or either cpi index the eci and the measures of hourly earnings likely reflect increases in wages due to increased labor productivity although differences in the indexes in the annual rates of change are not large small differences can mean large difference in annual earnings for persons

value of the minimum wage if the minimum wage were indexed its future value would depend not only on the economic measure used for indexation but also on the initial value or base period selected the main reasons given to justify minimum wage do not prescribe the initial real or relative value that should be used for indexation ie they do not prescribe the size of the initial basket of goods for instance single nationwide minimum wage may not provide the same real or relative standard of living in all circumstances families differ in size the number of workers and their hourly wage rates the total number of hours worked and the amount of nonwage income therefore living wage for single parent of teenage or daughter may not be 43 on an sic basis data on average hourly earnings of production workers are available on an annual basis only from 1947 to 1963 and on monthly basis from january 1964 through april 2003 crs14 the same as living wage for dependent teenager in addition the cost of living varies from one city or state to another however for the federal government single nationwide minimum wage may be easier to administer than several subnational minimum wage rates states and cities can also adopt minimum wage rates that are higher than the federal minimum wage44 if labor markets are not perfectly competitive minimum wage could improve economic efficiency for instance in the case of monopsony minimum wage could raise wages and increase employment45 however determining the appropriate wage may be difficult if the wage is set at too high level monopsonist may hire fewer rather than more workers46 similarly if labor markets do not meet the model of perfect competition because of imperfect information or discrimination the federal government can enact minimum wage for workers who are at disadvantaged in obtaining information about jobs or in negotiating fair wage but again it may be difficult to determine what the appropriate minimum wage rate should be here too single nationwide minimum wage may not be the wage that corrects instances of imperfect competition in all labor markets although the main reasons given to justify minimum wage do not prescribe the value at which the minimum wage should be set with indexation the future value of the minimum wage would depend importantly on the initial value selected the initial value of the minimum wage used for indexation could be the current january 2007 value of 515 an hour alternatively as congress has done occasionally with other federal programs the base period could be some future or past value of the wage indexation could begin in the year that legislation is enacted or in some future year the minimum wage could be raised and indexation could begin at some time in the future past value of the minimum wage could also be used as the base period 44 at the beginning of 2007 over half the states and the district of columbia have minimum wage rates that are higher than the basic federal minimum wage crs report rl33754 minimum wage in the 110th congress several cities and counties have also adopted living wage laws these laws typically apply to employers that receive city contracts or tax benefits and sometimes to the city itself the laws generally require wage that would provide an employee working full time with at least povertylevel of income the poverty level is based on either local or federal standards and is often defined according to the poverty level for family of four living wage is often defined to include health insurance 45 in economic terms firm will hire an additional worker if the extra revenue is greater than or equal to the workers wage ie marginal revenue is greater than or equal to marginal cost unlike firm in competitive labor market however monopsonist is able to influence wages for monopsonist the cost of hiring an additional worker is equal to that workers wage plus the higher wage that must be paid to current workers ie marginal cost is greater than average cost mandated minimum wage can raise the average wage paid by monopsonist if the minimum wage is higher than the average wage that monopsonist would otherwise pay minimum wage can result in an increase in employment because it can lower the additional cost of hiring an extra worker ie marginal cost may equal average cost it is the lower marginal cost that induces monopsonist to hire more workers ronald g ehrenberg and robert s smith modern labor economics theory and public policy new york addisonwesley 2000 pp 7984 46 ibid p 85 crs15 two components of the individual income tax system illustrate how congress has chosen different years for indexation the personal exemptions and the individual income tax brackets are indexed for inflation the tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 used the value of the personal exemption in future year as the base year for indexation the act raised the personal exemptions in three steps from 1080 for 1986 to 2000 for 1989 under the 1986 act indexation began in 1990 using 1989 as the base year47 the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 added two new marginal income tax rates effective for 1993 indexation of these two tax brackets began in 1995 using 1993 as the base year48 base periods used for illustrations using different economic measures it is not possible to project what the minimum wage would be in the future without projecting what the economic measures themselves would be for instance if the minimum wage were increased it would not be possible to project what the minimum wage would be in five or ten years without projecting what the economic measure used for indexation would be however it is possible to calculate what the minimum wage would be today if it had been indexed at some point in the past the illustrations below use three historical values for the minimum wage when the minimum wage was at its highest real or relative level when it was at its lowest real or relative level and when it was at its median historical value49 depending on the price index or wage measure in the illustrations below the base period that defines when the minimum wage reached its highest or lowest levels may be month calendar quarter or calendar year also only two of the measures have been available since 1938 therefore the base periods selected are affected not only by differences in the economic measures but also by the availability of data the method used to select the base periods is explained in more detail in appendix illustrations tables 2 through 7 show what the federal minimum wage would have been in september 2006 if it had been indexed using the six economic measures and the three base periods described above the illustrations use economic measures that are consistent with the reasons for having minimum wage however because of differences in the initial values of the minimum wage and in the availability of data the illustrations should not be used to compare how the different economic measures would affect the minimum wage rate under indexation the results shown in table 2 are based on calculations using the cpiw the first row shows that if the minimum wage were indexed from the point when it reached its highest real value february 1968 the minimum wage in september 47 crs issue brief ib86133 tax reform act of 1986 pl 99514 by stacey m kean

ranked from its lowest to highest historical values the median real wage is the wage where half the values are larger and half the values are smaller crs16 2006 would have been 925 instead of 515 on the other hand if the base period was the point when the minimum wage was at is lowest real value the minimum wage in september 2006 would have been 323 if the minimum wage were indexed from the point when it was at its median historical value the minimum wage in september 2006 would have been 614 the results shown in table 3 are based on calculations using the cpiurs this measure is available for the years 1977 through 2005 the first row shows that if the minimum wage were indexed from the point when it reached its highest real value the minimum wage at the end of 2005 would have been 765 if the base period was the point when the minimum wage was at is lowest real value the minimum wage at the end of 2005 would have been 496 if the minimum wage were indexed from the point when it was at its median historical value the minimum wage at the end of 2005 would have been 578 the price index used in the calculations in table 4 is the chaintype price index for personal consumption expenditures the first row shows that if the minimum wage were indexed at the point when it was at its highest real value the first quarter of 1968 the minimum wage in september 2006 would have been 776 if indexation began from the point when the minimum wage was at its lowest real value the minimum wage in september 2006 would have been 271 if the base period was the point when the minimum wage was at its median historical value the minimum wage in september 2006 would have been 580 tables 5 through 7 use economic measures that would maintain the relative value of the minimum wage each of these measures was developed after 1938 when the federal minimum wage was first enacted for these measures selecting the highest and lowest values of the minimum wage depends on the availability of data each of the measures shows that the real minimum wage in september 2006 or the end of 2005 for the eci was at its lowest value in september 2006 the minimum wage of 515 was equal to 321 of average hourly earnings of production workers in manufacturing and 305 of average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers both measures of average hourly earnings show that the minimum wage reached its peak real value in february 1968 in that month the 160 minimum wage was equal to 590 of the average hourly earnings of production workers in manufacturing and 542 of average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers if the february 1968 minimum wage had been indexed to average hourly earnings in manufacturing it would have been 946 in september 2006 if it had been indexed to the average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers the minimum wage in september 2006 would have been 916 crs17 summary of illustrations in short for each of the economic measures used in tables 2 through 7 if the base period used for indexation was the point when the minimum wage was at its highest historical value the minimum wage in september 2006 or the end of 2005 would have been more than 515 four of the six measures show that the minimum wage reached its peak real value in february 1968 or the first quarter of 1968 for the pce if the 160 minimum wage of february 1968 had been indexed to the average hourly earnings of production workers in manufacturing the minimum wage in september 2006 would have been 946 for three of the six measures if the minimum wage had been indexed from the historical point where it reached its lowest real value it would have been less than 515 in september 2006 finally all six measures show that if the minimum wage had been indexed from the point where it was at its median historical value it would have been between 578 and 663 in september 2006 table 2 real value of the minimum wage in september 2006 if it had been

there other policy options this paper does not examine how the minimum wage or an increase in the minimum wage compares to alternative policy options for achieving the same objectives however some policymakers argue that minimum wage is not the only or best way to address the issues of living wage or of labor market efficiency other ways of providing family with living wage include policies to increase worker productivity examples of these kinds of policies include investment in incomeproducing human capital eg education and training increased saving for investment in plant and equipment to increase the amount of physical capital and output per worker and advances in technology to improve productivity workers skills or both for most families wages are not the only source of income other ways of providing family with minimum level of income include income redistribution policies examples of income redistribution policies include transfer payments such as those made under the temporary assistance to needy families tanf program and refundable tax credits like the earned income tax credit eitc and child tax credit ctc the wages of lessskilled workers could also be raised with policies that increase their bargaining power examples of these kinds of policies include legislation to expand unionization or to improve employment opportunities for minority workers crs20 appendix method used for selecting the base periods to illustrate the effects of indexing the minimum wage given statutory minimum wage this report does not address the issue of the level at which the minimum wage is set instead for each of the six economic measures considered the illustrations of what the minimum wage would have been in september 2006 or the end of 2005 depending on the measure if it had been indexed use three different base periods or initial values of the minimum wage 1 when the minimum wage was at its highest real or relative level 2 when the minimum wage was at its lowest real or relative level and 3 when the minimum wage was at its median real or relative value to explain the method used in selecting the three base periods consider table 2 to select the months when the minimum wage was at its highest and lowest real values the actual minimum wage for each month from october 1938 through august 2006 was inflated to september 2006 dollars using the monthly cpiw in other words the october 1938 minimum wage of 025 was inflated to september 2006 dollars using the increase in the cpiw from october 1938 to september 2006 likewise the november 1938 minimum wage of 025 was inflated to september 2006 dollars using the change in the cpiw from november 1938 to september 2006 following this approach the actual minimum wage for each month from october 1938 through august 2006 was inflated to september 2006 dollars the highest and lowest real values of the minimum wage along with the median value were selected from these results in september 2006 dollars the highest real value of the minimum wage was the 160 wage that was in effect in february 1968 in september 2006 dollars the february 1968 wage of 160 was equal to 925 the procedure used to identify the highest and lowest values of the minimum wage for table 2 was repeated for tables 3 through 7 the base periods are affected however by the availability of data of the six economic measures used only the cpiw is available on monthly basis from october 1938 through september 2006 the other measures are either produced on quarterly basis available on an annual basis for earlier years or were not developed until after 1938 if congress were to index the minimum wage the actual implementation would likely follow different procedure than that used here to identify the highest lowest and median historical values of the minimum wage for example if the minimum wage were adjusted each january the adjustment might be based on the annual changes in an economic measure where each 12month period ends with the prior september crs21 appendix b comparison of economic measures figures 2 and 3 show the annual percentage changes in the price indexes used in the illustrations in this report figure 2
