voluntarily the supreme c ourts decision to uphold the beef checkoff is considered significant for the future of the other programs although the court left open the possibility of additional challenges checkoff programs particularly at the st ate and regional levels have existed for many decades interest in more federally mandated programs has increased over the past several decades as commodity groups have sought new ways to support their products such groups view the programs as economica lly beneficial farmer selfhelp activities requiring minimal federal fundi ng usdas

and reform act of 1996 pl 104 127 gave usda broadbased au thority to establish nati onal generic promotion and research programs for virtually any commod ity either at its own initiative or upon the request of an industry group without waiting fo r specific legislative authority prior to the 1996 law checkoff necessitated passage of specific authority for an individual commodity route that some producer groups still follow for example the hass avocado promotion research and information act of 2000 si gned into law on october 23 2000 explicitly authorized the progra m that took effect september 9 2002 rationale many billions of dollars are spent annually on branded us food advertising and promotion where one producer pits its name brand against the names of others offering similar or substitute product perdue chicken and tropi cana orange juice commercials are examples of branded advertising gene ric ads on the other hand have connection to the name of specific producer becau producers of basic agricultural product cannot easily convince consumers to choose particular egg or potato over another generic advertising can help to expand to tal demand for the product it is argued generic advertising uses tele vision radio and other media to reach consumers the beef its whats for dinner and pork the other white meat ads have been examples the programs also seek to expand foreign markets and to fund research and education such as development of new or improved products or surv eys of consumer behavior such activities are generally directed by the producer boa rds and approved by ams producers can and have organized voluntary checkoffs but they account for only small share of all funding for generic fforts since the prototype florida citrus advertising tax was instituted in 1935 hundreds of mandatory farm commodity promotion programs have been legislated by states or the federal government nine out of ten us farmers were cont ributing to one or more of these efforts by the mid1990s3 many commodity groups prefer mandatory checkoffs as way to address the so called free rider problem nonpaying producers who benef it economically from programs that others have funded requests to cong ress or usda to authorize mandatory checkoffs have been prompted by various factors incl uding the search for new ways to stimulate product demand particularly as farm markets have globalized and us producers face more foreign co mpetition domestically and overseashttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95353crs3 4 glickman v wileman bros elliot inc 521 us 457 477 1997 5 united

their revenue to nonpromotional activities such as research into mushrooms health and nutritional attributeslegal challenges some producers have vigor ously challenged mandatory checkoff programs some have asked usda to change or abolish orde rs it has issued on behalf of the commodity boards or petitioned the depa rtment to hold producer re ferendum on whether check off should continue some produ cers also have filed lawsuits in federal courts their key contention has been that the checkoff is tax to fund dvertising and other activities they would not pay for voluntarily three cases have reached the us supreme court in the first glickman v wileman brothers and elliot inc california peach and nectarine handlers had challenged the us da marketing order which is not only promotion program but also sets quality standards and other marketing rules for those fruits see footnote 1 the 9th circuit court of appeals had held that the order mandating the assessments violated the affected parties first amendment rights and therefore was unconstitutional the circuit court stated that such generic advertising had not been proven necessary or more successful than i ndividual advertising and also in effect violated the free speech of growers who would prefer to use their money to advertise in other ways the government appealed the case to the supreme court which on june 25 1997 reversed by 54 vote the lower court s ruling it found that the program should enjoy the same strong presumption of validity that we accord to other policy judgments made by congress the mere fact that one or more producers do not wish to foster generic advertising of their product is not sufficient reas on for overriding the judgment of the majority of market participants bur eaucrats and legislator s who have concluded that such programs are beneficial4 in the second case the supreme court on june 25 2001 ruled 63 that mandatory assessments for the mushroom checkoff were violation of the first amendment because they force producers to pay for comme rcial speech upholding decision by the 6th circuit court of appeals th supreme court reasoned in united states v united foods inc that the program authorized by the mushroom promotion act differs fundamentally from that under glickman the court said that the mushroom checkoff is standalone program that is not part of broader regulatory scheme as was the peachnectarine marketing order and for all practical purposes the advertising itself far from being ancillary is the princi pal object of the re gulatory scheme5 the supreme court issued its thir d decision on may 23 2005 the case johanns v livestock marketing association stems from ruling on june 21 2002 by us district court in south dakota that the national beef checkoff violates the first amendment by forcing producers to pay in part for speech to which the plaintiffs object the district court fu rther ruled in the case that th generic advertising conducted under the beef promotion and research act and the ensuing beef order is not government speech the 8th circuit court of appeals announced that it would not reconsider the district courts ruling

including sources and argument s presented is based in part on archived crs report rl32957 farm product checkoff programs constitutional analysis by stephen r viña that report contains an extensiv discussion of these cases and their potential implicationsgovernment argued point that the justices had not considered in the mushroom case that checkoff messages constitu government speech and so are not susceptible to first amendment challenge th supreme court in 63 d ecision ruled in favor of the government upholding the program the court stated in part the message set out in the beef promotions is from beginning to end the message established by the federal government congress had directed the implementation of coordinated program of promotion including paid advertising to advance the image and desirability of beef and beef products congress and the secretary have also specified in general terms what the promotional campaigns shall contain thus congress and the secretary have set out the overarching message and some of its elements and they have left the devel opment of the remaining details to an entity whose members are answerable to the secret ary and in some cases appointed by him as well6 the supreme court majority also reject ed checkoff opponents argument that the program does not qualify as government speech because it is funded by targeted assessment rather than by general revenues eg taxes citizens may challenge compelled support of private speech but ve first amendment right not to fund government speech and that is less tr ue when the funding is achieved through targeted assessments devoted exclusively to the program to which the assessed citizens object the court concluded in may 23 2005 press release then secret ary of agriculture johanns said that he was pleased with the decision the house agriculture committee chairman the national cattlemens beef asso ciation the national pork produ cers council the american farm bureau federation and the national milk producers federation were among the groups that also reacted favorably to the supreme courts decision the national farmers union joined the livestock marketing associati on in expressing disappointment with the decision subsequent settle ment filed by defe ndants and plaintiffs included check off funded survey of producers views toward the program outlook and issues since the johanns decision several other closely wa tched legal challenges of the programs have been stalled or even ended including othe rs on beef and on dairy pork watermelons and cotton johanns also is widely expected to be used to defend future first amendment challenges7 however it is possible that checkoff oppone nts could continue to challenge other legal aspects of the programs in the cour ts for example the supreme court did not address the question of whether or not checkoff might be unconstitutional if it werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95353crs5 8 this paragraph is based on gary w williams and oral capps jr measuring the effectiveness of checkoff programs choices magazine 2nd quarter 2006 accesse d online at http www choicesmagazineorgfound that the advertisements are attributable to individuals who disagree with funded message as the supreme court noted congress retain s final oversight and statutory authority it remains to be seen whether checkoff advocates or opponents will continue to examine the need for and seek any statutory changes nonetheless the johanns decision could inform any new legislation creating or amending checkoff programs among the other issues are the following are checkoffs effective all of the federal checko ff programs and many state ones are required by law to periodically evaluate their effectiveness the ultimate measure has been whether thos who contribute to the programs gain economically more to the point do the economic benefits outweig h the costs of assessments researchers examine variety of indicator s such as changes in product sales producer prices market share industry profits and consumer awaren ess of the products or product attributes examining past and projected market and re lated industry data is one method for making such determinations another method is industry and consumer surveys however these approaches encounter difficulties in trying to isolate the impacts of program promotion dollars from other variables such as the relative prices and availability of competing products eg poultry vs beef andor pork milk vs juice or soft drinks changes in consumer income demographics s hopping preferences and so forth economists try to account for these vari ables through the use of increasingly sophisticated economic models most of the studies including those based on the models typically have found positive ratio s of benefits compared w ith costs ranging from 21 benefits over costs to as high at 101 however even these analyses can be widely interpreted and may not answer such questi ons as whether higher ratio necessarily signals more effective program whether all types of contributors share equally in the benefits whether others such as cons umers and processors who do not directly contribute gain or lose economically or wh ether investing the funds in some other way like buying stocks might yield higher returns8 what types of activities are appropriate funds collected can be used by the boards which meet regularly and submit their plans to usdaams for review for wide variety of activities with the common objective of nhancing product demand virtually all checkoff laws include language prohibiting the use of funds for any type of activity to influence government policies or actions however some critics have regarded the line between advertising and advocacy as blurry one for example at least one group once periodically used its funds for dvertisements in washington dcbased publications that promoted the image of the i ndustry as whole this question is further complicated if checkoff program staff is hous ed in or near the same offices as that commoditys trade association or if the association contracts to carry out some permitted activitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95353crs6 9 source for status of the challenge ams legi slative affairs office personal communication october 20 2008in another disputed use of funds the u s environmental protection agency epa agreed to limited and conditional release of liability for past and ongoing violations of air pollution laws by animal feeding operations afos that participate in national study of air emissions and that among other thin gs pay 2500 per farm to help fund it the national pork board agreed to commit 6 million in checkoff funds to cover the 2500 fees from the more than 1800 hog farms w ith approved agreements coalition of groups called the campaign for family farms challenged this commitment in october 2006 usda administrative law judge ruled that the pork board spending was contrary to public policy and not in accordance with law ama pprcia docket 050001 however in december 2006 the judge denied the petitioners motion for an injunction against the boards spending pending resolu tion of an appeal that appeal was still pending in october 2008 and the board spent the checkoff funds as planned9 industry governance and representation when congress approves checkoff it generally does not begin until an industry group proposes and ams issues an order following federal rulemaking procedures ofte n but not always referendum among affected parties is re quired before it takes effect once an order is underway periodic referenda may be held to assess support for its continuation most checkoff laws provide guidance often specific on the ma keup and establishment of the industry governing boards that oversee program staff and set policy and priorities which are subject to usda review and approval on concern is how to ensure that all contributors are chosen and re presented fairly with regard to geography operation size importer or domestic and so forth such questions have become more prominent among those groups which allege that major struct ural changes in their industry have enabled what they believe to be more powerful economic interests to dominate checkoff efforts some believe that the johanns decision might spur congress for instance to consider exempting certain categories of producers who disagree with generic advertising from paying mandatory assessments under commodity promotion law similar to the exemption that congress established in th 2002 farm bill pl 107171 for persons that produce and market solely 100 organic products congress might also seek to further define or expand current provisions in comm odity promotion laws that already require councils and projects to take into account similarities and differe nces between certain products and producers congress may also be asked to r eexamine its position on requiring the advertisements to show that they are in fact speech by the government since this was major criticism in the dissent and all circuit courts f ound insufficient governmental control as mentioned by justice ginsburg in her concurring opinion in johanns and by some experts clear indication of who the sp eaker is may be important to reconcile the message in checkoff programs with other speech that is overtly sponsored by the government particularly th nutritional and dietary guid elines eg food pyramid the most recent federal dietary guidelines for example encourage greater consumption of fruits vegetables whole grains and low fat dairy within balanced lowercalorie intake diet while some checkoff programs generally encourage more consumption of both lowfat and highfat beef pork and dairy products
