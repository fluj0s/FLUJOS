and trade summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21819 the world bank has taken an increasingly active role in providing postconflict aid this assistance provides both shortterm humanitarian relief and longterm economic support for countries emerging from conflict although this aid is sanctioned by the world banks mandate it raises questions that may be appropriate for congressional oversight these include how extensive is the world banks understanding of postconflict aids effects on recipient countries and how well world bank aid is coordinated with other donors this report will be updated as needed introduction and background postconflict societies are major us foreign policy concern the postconflict environment often perpetuates economic strife and poverty such as in cambodia and can lead to regional instability such as conflict in many central african countries that has been ongoing since the 1990s postconflict societies may also provide potential haven to terrorist groups such as the talibans sheltering of qaeda in afghanistan in order to help improve the quality and quantity of postconflict assistance the us government has actively supported world bank involvement in postconflict aid growing component of world bank activity in 1998 world bank study showed that the volume of world bank lending to postconflict countries has increased by 800 since 1980 and that 16 of the world banks 1998 lending was to postconflict countries1 more recent estimates set the amount of postconflict assistance at between 20 and 25 of total current lending in 2003 the world bank lent 185 billion the increase in world bank lending to postconflict countries can most easily be attributed to an increase in conflicts during the 1990s the end of the cold war and the collapse of the soviet union has manifested itself in numerous conflicts especially in 1 the world banks experience with postconflict reconstruction operations evaluation department world bank 1998 congressional

the world bank to fund its aid programs3 in july 2002 world bank donor countries agreed on the thirteenth replenishment of the international development authority ida the concessional lending facility of the world bank4 the new replenishment dubbed ida13 authorized 228 billion in new aid for 20032005 the united states committed 255 billion to ida13 850 million for each year fy2003fy2005 in addition to 300 million pledged in incentive contributions if the world bank meets certain performance targets for fy2005 the president is requesting 105 billion for the third of three scheduled payments under ida13 850 million base payment and 200 million of the 300 million incentive pledge in addition the president is requesting 113 million to pay portion of us arrears to ida in fy2006 the president may also request congress to authorize and appropriate funds for ida14 currently under negotiation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21819 defining postconflict aid postconflict reconstruction aid is unique form of development assistance with two goals 1 addressing shortterm challenges which may include humanitarian assistance and other forms of relief and postemergency assistance and 2 repairing and in some cases creating the infrastructure both physical and institutional necessary to support longterm economic development while these goals of relief and development are not inherently incompatible effectively distributing resources that balance these short and longterm goals is potentially the most difficult challenge for postconflict aid world bank postconflict aid at the world bank nine countries are currently eligible for postconflict assistance afghanistan angola burundi congo republic democratic republic of congo ivory coast eritrea sierra leone and east timor operations in nonsovereign regions such as the west bank and gaza or iraq are funded out of world bank netincome or through multidonor trust funds the regional development banks such as the african development bank afdb and the asian development bank asdb as well as the international monetary fund imf are active in postconflict assistance and often coordinate and partner with the world bank to provide

grants its capital base needs to be replenished on periodic basis crs3 process is designed to help country transition from conflict to the normal world bank relationship with borrower countries the first stage is called watching brief and involves monitoring the evolving socioeconomic situation on the ground during conflict this allows the world bank to begin preparations for its involvement once fighting ends the second stage is the creation of needs assessment once the physical safety of world bank staff can be guaranteed the bank usually along with the united nations will send in teams of analysts to research and prepare this report this document presents the banks analysis of countrys reconstruction needs and estimates of their cost it is normally prepared prior to an international donor conference where countries may pledge funds and draw up the framework for multidonor trust fund the needs assessment also plays fundamental role in the third stage the creation of transitional support strategy tss short to mediumterm assistance plan that often acts as bridge between shortterm recovery assistance and longterm development objectives once recipient country successfully emerges from conflict and is eligible for lending country assistance strategy cas will be prepared by the world bank the cas is the primary lending framework for world bank assistance usually prepared every three years the cas identifies key areas where world bank assistance would be most effective and proposes lending projects to accomplish these goals httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21819 world bank grants the world bank is increasingly providing aid in the form of grants rather than loans grants accounted for 17 of all ida assistance in 2003 under the ida13 agreement postconflict countries are eligible to receive up to 40 of their ida allocation in grants negotiations for ida14 began in february 2004 and the administration has stated it will seek to increase the percentage of ida resources allocated as grants5 grant usage for 2004 is planned to be about 226 ida also sets aside 500 million per year for temporary increases for postconflict country allocations the world bank has created separate entity the postconflict fund pcf to provide grants for physical and social reconstruction in 2003 the pcf allocated 118 million through sixteen newly approved grants and disbursed 13 million across its total portfolio since the pcf was established in 1997 615 million has been approved for 120 separate grants and 469 million has been disbursed7 world bank watching briefs and needs assessments are often funded by the pcf world bank trust funds aid recipients often are not member of the world bank it might owe arrears to the bank or there might be effective government for the world bank to deal with in these cases trust funds either administered solely by the world bank or by the world bank in conjunction with other international institutions have coordinated and disbursed postconflict aid there is rationale for bilateral donors to provide postconflict aid through multilateral donors such as the world bank since the world banks charter abhors any 5 john b taylor under secretary of the treasury remarks on the millennium challenge corporation selection criteria mar 10 2004 6 treasury international programs justification for appropriations fy2005 budget request the department of the treasury 7 postconflict fund annual report 2003 world bank crs4 political involvement many agree that it is more proficient as well as more credible provider of information about postconflict countries study has also shown that bilateral foreign aid is often heavily determined by donor foreign policy interests rather the economic needs of the recipient country8 moreover since the world bank has some degree of autonomy from its donor members it may be easier for the bank to secure policy reforms in recipient countries than by individual donors it is also argued that governments provide aid multilaterally when their publics are more skeptical about the benefits of providing the foreign aid sending foreign assistance through an institution such as the world bank can also help donor government reassure its citizens that its foreign aid funded by tax revenue is being spent appropriately9 some analysts contend that the united states loses too much control over the provision of its aid with multilateral approach first they argue it is very difficult for donors to earmark funds when they are contributed multilaterally if other donors are not in broad support of the us aid agenda the united states might be able to achieve its foreign policy objectives more directly by providing bilateral aid through the us agency for international development or some other us agency second since the united states does not have veto power on world bank lending the bank sometimes provides httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21819 assistance to countries despite strong us opposition for example the world bank approved 180 million in earthquake recovery in 2003 for iran state department determined supporter of international terrorism purely bilateral approach might ensure that us funds are used to support aid programs that run counter to us foreign policy oversight issues for congress although aid is highly context specific some general questions may be raised as congress exercises its oversight role and considers appropriations for the world bank and other international financial institutions involved in postconflict assistance most importantly postconflict operations are major component of the current ida14 negotiations these negotiations are expected to be concluded by the end of 2004 with the president seeking appropriations and authorization during the upcoming 109th congress how extensive is world bank research into how aid impacts post conflict countries some argue that the world bank often rushes in to provide assistance during postconflict transitions without full understanding of the implications of how postconflict aid affects the recipient country critics have noted that on some occasions world bank interventions could serve to recreate the political or economic conditions that led to conflict in the first place10 increased conflict analysis and research 8 alesina alberto and dollar david who gives foreign aid to whom and why nber

conditions for war bretton woods project feb 2004 crs5 into the roots of civil violence could help to ensure that civil violence is not systemically repeated does the postconflict country have the institutional infrastructure to effectively utilize donor assistance studies have found that although post conflict countries absorptive capacity is low during roughly the first three years after the end of violence it tends to double by the end of the first decade11 this research suggests that it may be best not to create an aid surge in the immediate years after the cessation of violence but rather phase in assistance over the first decade however postconflict countries often receive the highest levels of foreign aid early on and such assistance often tapers off over the ensuing years what is the appropriate sequencing of reforms although there is often low initial aid absorptive capacity early policy decisions can greatly affect longterm economic growth potential one world bank study found that social policies such as monitoring poverty and establishing safety nets for marginalized members of society are very important in the immediate postconflict environment but that such policy choices have been insufficiently incorporated into the design of postconflict aid evidence shows httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21819 that donors often make monetary and fiscal policy and debt management their first priority once they commit postconflict aid12 is there clear and welldefined objective before aid is given although each recipient has both short and longterm assistance needs an aid program can only be successful if these needs are clearly defined the bank has been very successful in conducting needs assessment reports that have served as guides for post conflict assistance since many other actors are involved in the postconflict environment such as the us agency for international development development program various international nongovernmental organizations clear wellcoordinated objective is imperative for successful transition out of conflict how does the world bank ensure that shortterm policies enacted do not compromise longterm objectives expansionary economic policies such as price controls or rapid expansion of government employees may create needed shortterm economic stimulus but they can complicate countrys longterm economic viability for example immediately following the introduction of aid flows to the west bank and gaza public expenditures dramatically increased along with proliferation of government ministries13 once aid levels come down it is much harder to restrain fiscal spending consistency among short and longterm economic policy plans is essential is there clear and well defined exit strategy major objective of any postconflict assistance must be the encouragement of local capacitybuilding to make governing decisions and ensure that local populations are active participants in the 11 collier paul and hoeffler anke aid policy and growth in postconflict societies world bank working paper oct 2002 12 ibid 13 schiavocampo s financing and aid arrangements in postconflict situations world bank working paper may 2003 p 10 crs6 reconstruction process domestic institutions must be built that can eventually take over the reconstruction process recent study has shown that in some cases countries can become recurrent users of international financial assistance these countries often lack the incentive and ability to make necessary reforms14 is the world banks role appropriately coordinated with the united nations and other donors since the world banks mandate forbids its involvement in security and military related activities the plays vital and important role in establishing physical security and often takes responsibility for many political matters outside of the world banks mandate in some cases such as east timor the has served as the facto government of the postconflict region in addition to providing security or its governance function the also has an external development role in helping the world bank coordinate donor assistance functional conflicts of interest could occur if the is helping coordinate the distribution of aid and at the same time is serving as facto government and is recipient of aid flows how extensive is the monitoring and evaluation of postconflict aid major objective of the us government and other donors is to reinforce the world httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21819 banks efforts to increase the use of measurable results and performance based allocation in the world banks lending international attention often fades as one international crises segues into the next because postconflict assistance is often most valuable years after the end of violence further monitoring and evaluation of postconflict aid efforts may be prudent to ensure that the bank is administering such aid effectively and adhering to us policy objectives this would also be in line with the administrations results measurements objectives additional issues active world bank postconflict activity raises many other questions including how do donor countries foreign policy objectives interact or interface with the world banks mandate to avoid political activity what are the lessons learned from earlier interventions and how successful have the interventions been is the world bank the best international actor to coordinate development assistance has previous donor coordination been successful or has there been overlap between national agencies activities and the other development banks should postconflict aid be provided in the form of grants or loans definitive answers are not available for many of these questions but greater understanding of postconflict aid and its impacts would likely increase its effectiveness 14 independent evaluation office of the international monetary fund evaluation of the prolonged use of fund resources sept 25 2002
