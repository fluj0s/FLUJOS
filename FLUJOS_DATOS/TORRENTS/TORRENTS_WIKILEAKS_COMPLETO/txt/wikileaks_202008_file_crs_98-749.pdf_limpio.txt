changes the relationship between the hi ghway trust fund and the federal budget process spending for highway programs is now linked direc tly to annual revenue collections for the highway trust fund core highway and mass transit program funding has been given special status in the discretionary tion of the federal budget by virtue of the creation of two ne w budget categories as result highway and transit programs become similar to entitlement programs during the period fy2000 through fy2003 from the perspective of the authors of tea21 the act creates virtual firewall around highway and mass transportation spending programs that is the levels of funding enuncia ted in the act are descri bed as transportation discretionary spending guarantee the f unding guarantees are set up in way that makes it difficult for funding levels to be altered as part of the annual budgetappropriati ons process the budget system initiated by tea21 coul d be viewed as an experiment in federal budgeting the outcome of the ex periment will obviously play an important role in determining how federal transportation programs will operate in the future the change in budget treatment of the highway trust fund s implications for spending not only on highways and mass tran sit but may have an effect on the availability of annua l funding for other transpor tation and discretionary budget programs tea21s

congress congressional research service transportation trust funds and the budget by john w fischer crs report 9863 3for the purposes of this report the highway program refers to spending for all activities funded through the highway account of the high way trust fund this includes monies for highways highway safety and wide range of other activities transit refers to federal mass transportation programs which includes aid to bus systems subway systems etcetera the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 and the federal budget the transportation equity act for the 21st century pl 105178tea21 is the provisional end point of decade long congressional debate about the relationship between the highway trust f und and federal spending for highway highway safety and transit programs1 the act adopts the perspective of those who believe that the existence of the highway trust fund should give federal highway and transit program spending special status within the federa l budget tea21 does not take the trust fund offbudget as many of the supporters of th is position had sought during the last few years2 rather the act creates two new categories within the federal discretionary budget new highway category provides sp ending for core highway programs at level dictated by revenue accruing to th highway account of the fund the authors of tea21 assert that this arrangement cr eates socalled firewall around the core highway program new transit category also provides firewall for core transit programs but unlike core highway programs these funds are not subject to annual adjustment based on revenue accruing to the mass transit account of the fund while firewalls are the term of art used in the discussion of the tea21 budget provisions it is important to recognize that th is is not budget term per net effect of linking tr ust fund revenues to spending for the highway highway safety and transit programs is dramatic increase in spending for these programs tea21 authorizes funding at level of almost 2180 billion for the period fy1998 through fy2003 of this total 177 billion is provided for broad range of highway and highway safety programs and just under 410 billion is provided for transit programs3 the total tea21 authorization is bout 40 more than what had been provided in the previous 6year progra m authorization istea intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1991 pl 102240 of the total tea21 authorization 1980 billion is guaranteed th at is these funds are not subject to reduction as part of the nnual budgetappropr iations

congress congressional research service transportation fuel taxes legislative issues and the transportation equity act crs report 98555e by bernard gelb background highway trust fund origins the highway trust fund consists of two separate accounts hi ghway and transit which are sometimes mistakenl referred to as separate trust funds in practice the highway account and the transit account are discussed as though they were separate entities with the highway trust fund being synonymous with the highway account the highway trust fund is the oldest and largest of the transportation trust funds the fund was created by separate revenue title in the federalaid highway act of 1956 1956 act pl 84627 the 1956 act provided funding for construction of the now virtually complete dwight d eise nhower system of inte rstate and defense highways in addition the 1956 act pr ovided some funding for other federal highway programs over the last 40 plus years the highwa trust fund and the federal programs it supports have been changed numerous times4 in almost every instance congress has chosen to expand the scope of the federal highway program at various times over the same period congress has also chosen concomitantly to increase the revenue stream into the trust fund by raising fede ral excise taxes on motor fuels the most recent change in the structure of the fe deral highway program is tea21 tea21 also reauthorizes the trust fund revenue system through fy2005 the transit account was created by th surface transportation assistance act of 1982 pl 97424 the transit account gave the transit industry consistent federal funding source for capital spending on new and rehabilita ted infrastructure and for other purposes such as operatin g assistance funding tea21 in line with recent year appropriations gislation eliminates operating assistance for all urban areas with populations of 200000 or more and refocuses these funds on capital related activities the highway trust fund is financed by sales taxes on tires trucks buses and trailers as well as truck usage taxes but approximately 90 of trust fund revenue comes from excise taxes on motor fuels5 the majority of the motor fuel revenue dedicated to the trust fund is derived from an 184 cents per gallon tax on gasoline of which 183 cents is dedicated directly to the highway trust fund the highway account receives an allocation equivalent to 1544 cents of the tax and the transit account receives the revenue ge nerated by 286 cents of the tax the remaining 01 cents goes into the leaking underg round storage tank lust trust fundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98749crs3 transportation budget terminology transportation budgeting uses confusin g lexicon for those unfamiliar with the process of budget authority and contract authority the latter form of budget authority contract authority provides oblig ational authority for the funding of trust fund financed programs such as the fede ralaid highway program prior to tea21 changes in spending in the annual tr ansportation budget component had been achieved in the appropriati ons process by combining changes in budgetcontract authority and placing limitations on obligations the principal function of the limitation on obligations is to control ou tlays in manner that corresponds to congressional budget agreements contract authority is tantamount to but does not actually involve entering into contract to pay for project at some future date under this arrangement specified in title 23 usc which tea21 amends au thorized funds are automatically made available to the states at the beginning of each fiscal year and may be obligated without appropriations legisl ation appropriations are re quired to make outlays at some future date to cover these obligations as will be discussed tea21 greatly limits the role of the appropriations process in core highway and transit programs because the act sets the limitation on ob ligations level for the period fy1999 through fy2003 highway and transit grant programs work on reimbursable basi s states pay for projects up front and federal payments are made to them only when work is completed and vouchers are pr esented perhaps months or even years after the project has begun work in progress is represente d in the trust fund as obligated funds and although they are considered used nd remain as commitments against the trust fund balances they are not subtracted from balances trust fund balances therefore appear high in part because funds suffi cient to cover actual and expected future commitments must remain available both the highway and transit accounts have substantial short and longterm commitments these include payments that will be made in the current fiscal year as projects are completed and to much greater extent outstanding obligations to be made at some unspecified future date additionally there are unobligated amounts that are still dedicated to highwa and transit projects but have not been committed to specific projects two terms are associated with the distribu tion of contract authority funds to the states and to particular programs the fi rst of these apportionments refers to funds distributed to the states for formula driven programs for example all national highway system nhs funds are apportione d to the states allocated funds are funds distributed on an administrative ba sis typically to programs under direct federal control for example federal nds highway program monies are allocated the allocation can be to another federal agency to state to an indian tribe or to some other governmental entity these terms do not refer to the federal budget process but often provide frame of reference for high way program recipients who may assume albeit incorrectly that state apportionment is part of the federal budget per httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98749crs4 6for detailed discussion of the appropriations process see us library of congress congressional research service the congressional appropriations process an introduction crs report 97684 gov by sandy streetertea21 budget provisions discretionary spending guarantees firewalls and limitations on obligations transportation is function 400 in the annual unified congressional budget it is also considered part of the discretiona ry budget highway and transit funding are the largest components of th is budget category and can account for 60 70 of total federal transportation spending in an given year as mentioned previously most highway and the majority of tr ansit programs are funded with contract authority this is very significant fro m budgeting standpoint contract authority can be thought of as preexisting budget authority where most federal programs require new budget authority as part of the annual appr opriations process transportation appropriators are faced w ith the opposite situation that is the authority to spend already exists and the mechanism to obligate is also in place transportation appropriations provide mech anism to expend these funds what this has meant in the past for transportation appropriations subcommittees is that budget goals set in congressional budget resolu tions could only be met by limiting actual outlays the mechanism used to accomplish this is the limitation on obligations authority to set limitation on obligations for contract authority programs gave appropriators considerable leeway in llocating funds between the various federal transportation activities in f unction 400 which includes agencies such as the coast guard and the federal aviation administra tion in addition the inclusion of the highway and transit programs and their tr ust fund generated reve nue streams in the discretionary budget and provi ded appropriators with so additional flexibility as part of the annual process by which ava ilable funds were allocated amongst the 13 standing appropriations subcommittees in the house and the senate6 tea21 changes this procedure in two ways first by creating new budget categories and second by setting statut ory limitations on obligations the act amends the balanced budget and emerge ncy deficit control act of 1985 to create two new budget categories highway and mass transit the act further amends the budget process by creating statutory vel for the limitation on obligations in each fiscal year from fy1999 to fy2003 in addition tea21 provides mechanism to adjust these amounts in the highwa account but not the transit account to correspond with increased or decreased r eceipts in highway generated revenues the net effect of the creation of these budg et categories is predetermined level of funding for core highway and trans it programs referred to in tea21 as discretionary spending guarantee these categories are separated from the rest of the discretionary budget in way that preven ts the use of funds assigned to these categories for any other purpose these so called firewalls are viewed in the tea21 context as guaranteed andor min imum levels of funding for highway andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98749crs5 7the transportation equity act for the 21st century an analysis by the american road transportation builders association american road transportation builders association july 1998 p 2transit programs additional funds above the fire wall level can be ma available for highway and transit programs through th annual appropriations process tea21 in fact provides additional authorizations of approxima tely 15 billion in highway money and 5 billion in transit money above the firewall level revenue aligned budget authority tea21 provides link between the highwa generated revenue s that flow into the highway account and highway spending this relationship has long been sought by advocates of increased highway spendi ng who have contended that highway user fees should be available only for highway programs the act requires that the secretary of transportation make an annual evaluation of revenues into the highway account during the previous fiscal year visavis spending authorized within the highway fire wall for the new fiscal year if revenues go up program spending is increased conve rsely spending can go down if revenues go down the act uses formula to dete rmine the direction and amount of highway funding adjustment this mechanism is employed beginning in fy2000 and an annual computation is required on october 15th of each successive fiscal year through the life of the act if funding adjustment is required an apportionment is made to the core highway programs in each state in ddition apportionments are made to other federal aid highway and high way safety programs fina lly funds are reserved on proportional basis for progra ms allocated by the federal highway administration fhwa such as the federa l lands highway program both the congressional budget office cbo and the office of management and budget omb predict that revenues to the highway account will grow at level that exceeds the highway authorization provided within the highway firewall the omb estimates are for somewhat more growth than those projected by cbo by one analysis looking at best case scenario best case from th perspective of an analysis that favors additional spending the revenue alignment provisions of the bill could provide as much as 35 billion in additiona l contract authority for core highway programs during the life of the legislation7 enforcement guarantee the authors of tea21 were concerned th at some members of congress might at some future time try to reduce highwa and transit spending tea21 therefore includes provision in section 8101 that amends rule xxi of the house of representatives to allow point of order challenge to any legislation of any type that might seek to reduce the limitation on obligations for highways and transit during the life of the act as will be disc ussed later in this report point of order language also seems to extend to indivi dual programs and proj ects based on househttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98749crs6 8the act also includes provisions that increas certain other veterans benefits for

discussion of the title xx program see us library of congress congressional research service social services block grants by karen spar crs report 94953 epwconsideration of fy1999 trans portation appropriati ons legislation the existence of the point of order will make it very difficult for any member to seek reduction in highway and transit spending in the house regardless of reason it should be pointed out however that the house does waive its rules from time to time there are provisions in the act ffecting senate rules offsets the house version of what becam tea21 hr 2400 included provision that required that the final act identify specific spending offsets to comply with the balanced budget act of 1997 the act dopts this provision and after considerable debate congress ttled on two basic sources for budget offsets the primary source of these is provision that eliminates veterans benefits for smoking related illness this source provides appr oximately 154 billion in offsetting budget authority there was considerable controversy associ ated with this offset because it was opposed by veterans groups and because the dollar amount of the offset is an estimate based on the unknown cost of bene fit that had not yet been adjudicated8 the second significant offset is reduc tion in title xx social services block grants 42 usc 1397bc this offs et provides approximately 26 billion by reducing authorizations for this program in fy2001 fy2002 and fy2003 this offset is also controversial and was opposed by supporters of the block grant program9 the offset provisions in tea21 provide the necessary funds to meet the budget agreement for highway and transit pr ograms within the firewalls tea21 as mentioned earlier provides 15 billion in au thorizations for highways and 5 billion for transit that are above the firewa ll limits any spending of these funds accomplished in the annual appropriations process must be accompanied by an additional offset in the discretionary budget category during final consideration of tea21 it was suggested in many quarters that this need for further offsets will make appropriation of these funds difficult highway trust fund operations tea21 made basic changes in the opera tion of the trust fund primary among these is provision that precludes the paym ent of interest on an unexpended balance in the trust fund effective september 30 1998 the payment of interest was always controversial element of the trust fund pr ocess since the interest payments were made by the treasury on funds held by the treasury they were viewed by many as nothing more than an intergovernmental f und transfer interest has for many years been significant source of income for the trust fund and according to somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98749crs7 10the byrd amendment to the federalaid hi ghway act of 1956 as amended restricts the growth of new funding commitments to level which is not to exceed the current years unexpended balance plus projected income to the highway account for the following two fiscal years the byrd amendment is an automatic device that requires additional congressional action to implement as resu lt of tea21 the transit account is now subject to the same processestimates was principal reason for the continued large unexpended balance in the fund as can be seen in the appendix the highway and transit accounts received interest of 144 billion in fy1997 alone another major change is the elimination of much of the unexpended balance in the highway account referred to by some in accurately as the surplus effective september 30 1998 the balance in the account is reduced to 80 billion the unexpended balance above th is amount reverts to the treasurys general fund account the 8 billion amount is the sum that allows the trust fund to meet its byrd amendment mandated level of fiduciary responsibility10 and provide small additional cushion for future as yet unknown emergencies that might otherwise drain the fund highway trust fund balances the changes made by tea21 do not eliminate the potential for growth in the unexpended balances the previously stated core principal of tea21 is the concept that trust fund revenues should drive spending for couple of reasons this link is likely to lead to new growth in the unexpended balance highway and transit programs are slow spending programs what this means is that actual outlays for project may not occur until some time after the contract authority for the project was made available this lag can be period of years for some complex projects this lag by itself will cause growth in the unexpended balance exclusive of the annual adjustme nts required by the revenue aligned budget authority provisions in addition the author s of tea21 sought to reduce the need for offsets by spreading outlays for some pr ograms like the high priority projects over the life of the bill this built in lag will also contribute to growth in the unexpended balance the unexpended balance in the transit account is not subject to any immediate reduction the existing unexpended balance in the fund is crucial to the higher spending levels for transit found in the ac t in most years tea21 authorizes more transit spending than the transit account annual revenue str eam could accommodate this increased spending therefore is accommodated by the existing unexpended balance and by funding significant tion of the transit program from treasury general funds httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98749crs8 11this section provides

authority minimum guarantee most of the funding for this ac tivity and national corridor planning and border infrastructure new program ll of these programs are subject to apportionment on an annual basis there is second category of core high way funding within the firewalls this so called exempt category consists of two elements an additional annual authorization of minimum guarantee f unding 639 million per fiscal year and emergency relief 100 million per fiscal year these funds are not subject to the annual limitation on obligations minimum guarantee during the reauthorization debate leading to enactment of tea21 major issue of contention was th socalled equity debate the debate focused on the fact that some states know n as donor states contributed far more in taxes to the trust fund than they received back in federal aid highway assistance tea21 like istea before it takes compromise position on this issue state revenue returns are increased from istea levels tea21 includes minimum guarantee of 905 of states revenue c ontribution to the highway account of the highway trust fund for some donor states this guarantee will result in percentage funding increases well above those that would be provided one by the overall 40 increase in spending realized by tea21 over istea in reality this 905 return is unlikely to be an absolute on yeartoyear basis there are several reasons for this first there are significant concerns about the internal revenue service data that is used to determine the annual state revenue contribution these data were not previous ly envisioned as basis for the formula distribution of federal funds some states have already indi cated that they believe the data underc ounts their cont ribution to the highway account second there are administrative take downs for certain items such as fhwa operating costs that are part of the total limitation on obligations that will be unavailable during the state apportionment process third many obser vers are likely to note the relative total surface transportation funding di sparities between states that will exist because of the distribution of mass transit funds some of which may be tran sferred to highway activities this will occur regardless of th fact that trust fund revenues directed to the mass transit account are not part of the minimum guarantee finally the act requires the use of the most recent data in its annual program formula distributions many of these variables will change during the life of the act especially after the year 2000 census the 905 process set up in the act uses current data as program distribution changes the role of the minimum allocation process is likely to grow in relative importance the minimum guarantee computation is obviously complicated and likely to engender some criticism any criticism is likely to be directed at the fhwa which is the only organization that has access to all the data required for the formula and minimum allocation distributions the tea21 funding calculation is made first for apportioned programs using all the formula variables associated with each programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98749crs10 the state shares derived from this process are then adjusted up or down to reach the 905 guarantee level which equates at this point in the calculation to comparable percentage guarantee of appor tionments rather then of actual dollar revenue contributions to the highway account highway safety and other highway category programs the highway firewalls also include number of highway and highway safety contract authority programs that are normally viewed as being separate from the core federal aid highway program included in this category are highway safety programs administered by the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa motor carrier programs administered by fhwa intelligent transportation systems its programs and several different research activitie s while each of these programs receives only small amount of funding visavis fe deral aid highway programs such as the national highway system they are nonetheless significant highway safety activities will for example r eceive 17 billion over the life of tea21 transit the total authorization for transit in the act is 41 billion the firewall however only guarantees 362 billion in addition the transit firewall does not guarantee entire programs as is the case in the highway firewall for example the two largest transit programs urbanized area formula grants and transit capital investment grants have significant leve ls of authorization that are outside the firewall another distinction between the highway and transit firewalls is the source of program funding significant portion of the transit guarantee 665 billion is provided not by the mass transit account but by us treasury general funds this distribution appears to respond first to the historical role general funds have played in financing this program and second to realization that revenues to the mass transit account would be insufficient to fund the enlarged tea21 transit program transportation budget process issues fy1999 and future appropriations for highway and transit programs tea21 changes the role of the house nd senate appropria tions and budget committees in determining annua l spending levels for high way and transit programs as mentioned earlier the appropriati ons committees are precluded from their former role of setting an nnual level of obligations in addition it appears that the appropriations committee at least in the house are precluded at least in part from exercising what some members view as their traditional option of changing spending levels for any program or pr oject within the firewalls

appropriators making as the fy1999 transportation appropriations bill works its way through congress there has been criticism of the new process from appropr iators particularly in the house12 the committee has done the best it can considering the new firewalls however the committee is concerned that this new legislation skews transportation priorities inappropriately by providing banquet of increases to highway and transit spending while leaving safetyrel ated agencies such as the coast guard and faa to scramble for remaining crumbs the committee has also been unable to consider increases above guaranteed levels for highways and transit programs because it would have required even further reductions in critical faa and coast guard programs13 throughout the process that led to tea21 similar sentiment s were expressed by individual members of the committees on appropriations in both the house and the senate14 this sentiment is also shared by individual members of the budget committees in both bodies who view the new budget categories as potential balkanization of the unified budget process15 it should be pointed out however that other members of the appr opriationsbudget committees voted for and support the tea21 budget process members of the authorizing committees take counter and for the moment majority view from their perspectiv the new budget structure provides the necessary discipline to insure that transportation fuel taxes are spent for their intended purpose as result highway and transit program funding levels have been virtually removed from the ove rall debate about the disc retionary budget and instead tied to revenues the fact is that tea21 made more funds available for remaining discretionary programs if certain nonfirewall transportation programs remain underfunded the cause is not tea21 but rather decisi ons by the appropriators to spend money elsewhere16 the appropriators can s till appropriate tea 21 funds authorized outside the firewalls as can be seen in table 1 thes funds are relatively small portion of the total tea21 authorization however whether there is any incentive for the appropriators to appr opriate these funds is

firewalls the situation could change in the years ahead the consideration of the fy1999 transpor tation appropriations bill on the house floor raised number of issues visavis what appropriations can

played major role in pushing for the changed budget treatment of the highway trust fund they are wary of possible attempts to breach the firewalls and are already warning their memberships to be vigilant in lobbying for the firewall system20 other groups such as the concord co alition have long opposed giving the highway trust fund special budget treatment21 from the perspective of these groups creating special categories within the fede ral budget distorts the overall view of how andor whether the budget is in surplus or deficit while groups such as the concord coalition have not yet taken specific position on the repeal of the firewall system it is possible that some as of yet unfor seen budget conditions ie return to deficit could cause more activity on their part future appropriations for nontea21 transportation programs chairman shuster and other member s of the house transportation and infrastructure committee have the stated pos ition that all transportation trust fund programs should be outside the discretionary budget22 the other transportation trust funds had been part of proposed offbudg et legislation considered in the 105th congress during consideration of the legislation that became tea21 these trust funds were removed from the bill appare ntly because including them furtherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98749crs13 complicated the already controversial budget provisions of the bill and because they funded activities not seen as germane to the programs authorized by tea21 it is widely believed that the budget tr eatment of the airport and airway trust fund aviation trust fund will become an issue in the 106th congress the congressional supporters of bu ilding firewalls around the av iation trust fund are often essentially the same members that actively supporte d the change for the highway trust fund there is also possibility that federal aviation administration reauthorization legislation will be required in the 106th congress thereby providing legislative vehicle for possible change in addition the aviation trust fund is expected to have large unobligated balances in the years ahead unless spending from the fund is increased this situation combined with the belief in some quarters that faa spending is constrained by the tea21 firewalls in th appropriations process may heighten interest in providing some sort of firewall protection for aviation supporters of the coast guard are also concerned about the new transportation appropriations environment the coast guard is not funded by trust fund and hence cannot claim user fee base to support an argument for its own budget firewalls the coast guard has unique status within the transportation budget category because of its wartime role in na tional defense it is not unusual for the coast guard to receive some funds fro m military appropriations during the annual appropriations process it is possible that the coast guard will seek additional funding from the military side of the budget in the years ahead if additional funds for transportation do not become available other dot agencies funded within the transportation component of the budget also operate without trust fund monies as result they too will be affected by the new tea21 driven appropriations proce ss and may see their respective budgets constrained unless overall funding for the budget transportation component is increased the firewall system initiated by tea21 could be viewed as an experiment in federal budgeting the outcome of the ex periment will obviously play an important role in determining how federal transportation programs will operate in the future in addition the firewall system could have implications for the funding of other federal transportation and nontransportation programs tea21s budget provisions expire at the end of fy2003 as result congress will be dealing with transportation budget issues again in the not too distant future
