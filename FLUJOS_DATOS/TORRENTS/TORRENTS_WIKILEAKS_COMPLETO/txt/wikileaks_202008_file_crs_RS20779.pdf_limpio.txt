legislative attorney american law division on january 9 2001 the supreme court handed down the latest in its series of recent decisions relating to the balance between federal and state power in our dual system of government in solid waste agency of northern cook county swancc v us army corps of engineers the court ruled that the long controversial migratory bird rule used by the corps of engineers to interpret its authority over isolated wetlands exceeded the agencys authority under the clean water act cwa background of the case swancc consortium of chicago cities and villages sought to develop landfill for baled nonhazardous solid waste on 533 acre parcel in illinois the parcel had been used for sand and gravel mining until about 1960 since then the excavation trenches had evolved into ponds up to several acres in size swancc obtained the needed local and state permits but the corps denied federal wetlands permit required under cwa section 404a1 for wetlands within that provisions reach at issue here is the corps assertion that 404a covered the swancc site notwithstanding that the ponds on the site were only isolated wetlands those not abutting navigable waters of the united states or their tributaries long ago the supreme court upheld the corps authority under section 404 to regulate wetlands actually abutting navigable waterway2 the corps in swancc was asserting jurisdiction over wetlands not so abutting as corps regulations have provided for since 1977 the corps jurisdiction claim involved three steps first section 404 applies by its terms to navigable waters defined expansively by the cwa to mean the waters of the united states3 second the corps regulation interpreting waters of the united states includes waters such as intrastate lakes wetlands wet meadows or natural ponds the use degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate commerce third the corps migratory bird rule 1986 attempt to clarify the intrastate watershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20779crs2 4 gibbs v babbitt 214 f3d 483 4th cir 2000 petition for cert filed 69 uslw 3383 nov 22 2000 00844covered by the regulation says that such waters include those which are or would be used as habitat by migratory birds that cross state lines migratory birds had been observed on several occasions using the ponds on the swancc site the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit found that congress has the authority under the commerce clause of the constitution to regulate isolated wetlands and that congress in enacting section 404 intended to reach such wetlands the supreme court reversed the supreme court decision as with many other supreme court decisions involving the line between federal and state power the swancc ruling saw the court divide along 54 lines the fivejustice majority opinion concluded that the migratory bird rule is not supported by the cwa it was unnecessary therefore for it to reach the second issue whether had the migratory rule been authorized under the cwa it exceeded congress power under the commerce clause the majority opinion held that congress in enacting 1977 amendments to the cwa had not implicitly approved the corps broad definition of navigable water adopted that year in regulations quoted above under the original 1972enacted cwa for example congress failure to pass bill in 1977 containing narrow definition of navigable waters had not been shown by the corps said the majority to constitute congressional approval of the corps broad definition the majority then declined to afford the corps the customary deference granted agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes for one thing it said section 404 is not ambiguous at all and even if it were deference is not appropriate where an agency interpretation of statute invokes the outer limits of congress power reference to the courts milestone decisions in recent years involving the reach of the commerce clause this concern is particularly strong it said where the agency interpretation permits encroachment on traditional state power here that over land and water use implications of the decision the swancc decision continues the efforts of the five justices generally regarded as conservative to limit federal regulatory power in 1985 and 2000 these same five justices found that congress had exceeded commerce clause limits in enacting legislation dealing with possession of guns in school zones and violence against women while swancc did not reach the constitutional question its analysis of the cwa has as noted an explicit undercurrent of constitutional and federalism concerns the next event to watch will be the courts decision whether to grant the petition for certiorari in commerce clause challenge to the endangered species act4 swancc s implications for the scope of the federal wetlands permitting program are not fully clear the holding in swancc is limited to invalidating the migratory bird rule and thus appears to be narrower than the rationale supporting it as result the degree of program contraction may depend on which of these the government decides to apply in either event continuing program coverage is certain for the majority of wetland acreage that which is adjacent to navigable waters or their tributaries and possible as well for wetlands adjacent to some large intrastate waterbodies
