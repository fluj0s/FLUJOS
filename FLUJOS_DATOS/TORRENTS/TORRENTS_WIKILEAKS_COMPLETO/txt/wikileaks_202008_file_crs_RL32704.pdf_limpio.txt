for the 109th congress issues of continuity and change in foreign security and trade policy francis t miko specialist in international relations 77670 robert l goldich specialis t in national defense 77633 the 109th congress will face early funding nd oversight issues under pressure of tight fiscal conditions in 2005 challeng are likely to include providing the necessary resources to secure stability democracy and reconstruction in afghanistan and iraq continue the global fight against terrorism dissuade iran north korea and perhaps other countries from pursuing nuc lear weapons and adequately fund number of other high priority programs in february the administration is expected to ask for supplemental appropriations for defense iraq and afghanistan many experts believe that longterm pr ogress in the war on terrorism may rest on the ability of the united states and other western democracies to win the global battle for hearts and minds especially in the islamic world from which the muslim terrorists seek to draw recruits and suppor t opinion polls show increasingly negative perceptions of us actions intentions and motives in many countries possibly suggesting the need to develop and expa nd programs to counter these trends key instrument in the fight to win hearts and minds is public diplomacy the 109th congress may address in the authorization and appropriations process steps to strengthen the state departments capabilities in public diplomacy as well as programs designed to improve americas image abroad such as cultural exchanges education programs international broadcasting and democracy initiatives particularly targeted to muslim countries success in iraq and afghanistan might do much to help the us image if the united states is able to seize the opening created by the death of yasir arafat to help move the israelipalestinian peace process forward that too could help strengthen us credibility abroad attention is also likely to be given to policie s and programs to address some of the conditions that terrorists are able to exploit such as re gional conflicts brutal and corrupt regimes failing states and extreme poverty in many parts of the world other countries can and do provide assi stance in some of these areas the congress might take up the question of how to increase multilate ral cooperation and burdensharing as well as how to reduce tensions with some key us allies resulting from differences over the iraq war there is likely to be continuing debate over the evolution of us alliances some see benefits in relying more on adhoc coalitions of the willing to respond to specific cris thus eliminating the constraints on us action that formal lliance mechanis ms entail others argue that us alliances arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32704crs2 more important than ever for us security and world stability even with current disparities in military capabilities they maintain that growing number of problems can longer be solved by individual nations acting alone and that only us leadership can bring international consensus on difficult problems the 109th congress is likely to continue to take lead in pressing for reform especially with regard to issues of effectiveness wast and fraud members have been outspoken in their disappoin tment over recent performance of the in several international crises some have even suggested that the united states should review the utility of its continue d participation in the body congress will likely weigh foreign aid priorities as it debates appropriations levels for major initiatives such as the millennium challeng account for developing countries that meet specific performance criteria and programs to fight hivaids and other communicable diseases considerable res ources have been promised and provided for these programs sustaining these levels while providing for other contingencies and initiatives might prove challenging as the 109th congress opens it is facing defe nse issues whose proponents and directions may be pulling in two notably different directions over the past 18 months the organization structure doctr ine and personnel po licies of the armed forces especially the army and marine corps have been reoriented toward supporting the sustained military campa igns against isla mic fundamentalist insurgencies in iraq and afghanistan the congress has been in the forefront of this effort approving large supplemental ppropriations to finance the wars and conducting often pointed oversight of th eir prosecution congress has often over administration objections directed increases in military compensation and benefits to ensure that both overall military manpower levels and troop strength in the theaters of war can be maintained after much congressional prodding the administration has finally agreed to increasing active duty army strength funds have been directed toward iraqafghanistanspeci fic programs such as the uparmored vehicles much in the news recently or toward refurbishi ng and resetting the equipment of units which return from both theaters of war knowin g that in another year they will almost certainly return complex restructuring of army major combat units arguably the most fundamental since the early stages of world war ii 19411945 designed to create more deployable units and thus shorter tours of duty in combat zone as well as more tacti cal flexibility is under way at the same time secretary of defense rumsfeld has continued to emphasize the transformation of the armed forces process driven mostly by information technology advances and asso ciated changes in doctrine and concepts as first propounded transformati on tended to emphasize light ness mobility technological sophistication and hardware over firepower sustainability and the size of the force although the administration s made some adjustments to deal with the immediate situation it appears to have decided to continue fighting major war in iraq continue the transformation process and maintain th existing level of effort in the global war on terrorism gwot centered for now in and around afghanistan all without major increases in the size of the active duty armed forces thus the administrations defense programs continue to include large efforts in ballistic missile defense and new generations of high ly sophisticated tac tical aircraft and major naval combatant vessels these however are frequently criticized in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32704crs3 congress as misallocation of resources given that the counterinsurgency campaigns in afghanistan and iraq require large numbers of infantrymen and entail intimate contact with civilians in way that emphasizes human more than technological factors and expertise in particular many congressional critics suggest that whatever advantages can be realized from improvements in the existing force structure the active duty military particularly the ar my is simply t oo small to support existing combat operations while being ready to meet potential threats elsewhere in the world the administration however not that even lowintensity conflicts are greatly benefitting from sophisticated tec hnology particularly in the interrelated areas of command control co mmunications and intelligence and argues that the high expense of military personnel increases would not necessarily be cost effective it appears therefore that the 109th congress will be exercising its defenserelated responsibilities in an environment marked by competing perspectives on the extent to which the current conflicts in iraq and afghanistan are valid models for longterm defense policy trade issues will also be prominent in 109th congress early in 2005 president bush is expected to request that his au thority to negotiate trade agreements under expedited congressional appr oval trade promotion aut hority be extended for two years beyond its june 30 2005 expiration date the extension would happen automatically unless either chamber passes resolution of disapproval in addition the president is expected to send congress legislation to implement the us free trade agreement with bahrain early in the first session and may also send legislation to implement the fta with five central american count ries cafta and possibly the dominican republic if dispute over recent tax placed on highfructose syrup drinks can be resolved the bush administration will likely complete fta negotiations with seve ral other countries and launch ne gotiations with still others this year before the end of its first session the 109th congress will have to decide whether to introduce and act on joint resolution to disapprove continued us participation in the wto furthermore the 109th congress may consider whether to comply with wto dispute resolution ag ainst the continued dumping and subsidy offset act cdsoa also know n as the byrd amendment after its chief sponsor senator robert byrd anxiety about j ob losses from foreign competition and the growing us trade deficit is also likely to focus considerable congressional attention on chinas trading practices in

in both iraq and afghanistan but are meeting far more resistance from antius fighters in iraq than in afghanistan afghanistan appears to be moving steadily if slowly toward stability and economic reconstruction in contrast iraqs planned elections in january 2005 are in jeopardy and economic reconstruction is proceeding slowly situation in iraq kenneth katzman specialist in middle eastern affairs 77612 operation iraqi freedom oif accomplished the us objective of overthrowing saddam hussein but replacing his regime with stable moderate democratic political structure has run into significant difficulty that outcome would contribute to the goal of preventing iraq from becoming sanctuary for terrorists key recommendation of the 911 commission report issued in july 2004 to implement us programs to stabilize and reconstruct iraq 209 billion in assistance has been provided for iraq through two s upplemental spending bills of which only 116 billion 55 had been obligated as of november 23 and 36 billion 17 expended this rate of spending suggests that at least in the first half of 2005 congress may not need to address furthe r appropriations for iraq reconstruction congress will likely seek to continue close oversight of current aid programs for iraq these appropriations include funds to train and equip iraqs various security forces in 2002 and 2003 president george w bush characterized iraq as gathering potential threat to the united states because of its refusal to abandon its weapons of mass destruction wmd prog rams and its potential to transfer wmd to terrorist groups the administration stressed that regime change through usled military action would yield benefits beyond di sarmament and reduction of support for terrorism such as liberation of the ir aqi people from an oppressive regime and promotion of democracy throughout th middle east oif began march 19 2003 and the regime fell on april 9 2003 lthough the overthro w of saddam initially appeared to be welcomed by broad range of iraqis resistance to the usled post saddam occupation escalated throughout 2003 and 2004 complicating us efforts to build democracy and to establish gitimate and effectiv iraqi political and security bodies partly in an effort to sa tisfy iraqi demands for an end to occupation the united states decided to accelerate the hand over of sovereignty an interim government was named on june 1 2004 and the handover took place on june 28 2004 current plans are for elections for transitional nationa l assembly which will choose an interim government on january 30 2005 with votes on permanent constitution by october 31 2005 and for pe rmanent government to take place by december 15 2005 virtually all of these d eadlines are to some degree in question because of the persistent insurgency which is particularly strong in the areas of central and northern iraq inhabited by sunni arabs who were dominant in the regime of saddam hussein but now see themselves likely to be displaced by the majority shiite arabs the insurgency threat will likely remain key challenge in 2005 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32704crs5 usinternational m ilitary operations steve bowman

countries and officers from nato are training iraqi military paramilitary and police forces however these forces have generally performed poorly when challenged by insurgents the bush administration asserts that us policy in iraq will ultimately succeed as us trainers and the interim ir aqi government build the new iraqi forces some believe the united states should dd troops to the current level to better combat insurgents in areas mainly thos inhabited by sunni arabs in which the insurgents are strong others believe th united states needs to take new steps to recruit major international force contributors and yet some others believe that the united states should pull out of iraq entirely these options as well as bush administration assessments of the progress of stabilizing iraq are likely to be discussed at hearings of several oversight committees in the 109th congress and during consideration of the fy2005 suppl emental to fund iraqi operations economic reconstruction curt

request for additional funding to cover the cost of warrela ted operations in iraq and afghanistan and enhanced security for fense installations for the rest of fy2005 this supplemental f unding request would be in addition to the 25 billion that congress already provided in title ix of the regular fy2005 depa rtment of defense dod appropriations to cover those costs for the first few months of the fiscal year potential size of suppl emental and previous funding according to press accounts dod may request an add itional 65 billion to 80 billion more for fy2005 in its february request including the 25 billion already appropriated would bring total funding for military operations in iraq and afghanistan and enhanced security between 90 bi llion and 105 billion in fy2005 level that would be substantially higher than the 652 billion provided to dod in the fy2004 emergency supplemental pl 108106 although the 25 billion already provided for fy2005 war costs is likely to run out by january dod can use its fy2005 peacetime appropriations to finance or cash flow war operations for several additional months nonetheless congress is likely to face pressure to enact supplemental appropriations quickly such supplemental funds support over 300000 military personnel who are dedicated to opera tions in iraq afghanistan and enhanced security including both those deployed and those supporting these missions since the september 11 attacks cong ress has appropriate d about 203 billion for iraq afghanistan and enhanced secur ity for dod installations including the 25 billion for fy2005 as of the end of fy2004 dod had allocated about 178 billion to the three missions about 105 billion for the cost of iraq about 50 billion for afghanistan and about 23 billion for enha nced security for defense installations by the third year since the september 11 attacks and the talibans 2001 defeat operations in afghanistan cost about 10 b illion and enhanced security for defense installations about 36 billion annually spending levels th at are about half the size of those two years earlier with the recent rise in us military personnel in afghanistan to about 18000 costs may creep upwards but that could be offset by lower costs for enhanced security as dod reduces the number of reservists providing guard duty at bases in order to provide more reserve forces in iraq on the basis of recent experience dod may assume that the cost of afghanistan and enhanced security is about 140 billion in fy2005 funding for iraq the cost of operations in iraq however has proved to be higher than expected because of the upsur ge in attacks on us and iraqi forces in recent months obligations for military operations in iraq which are contractual costs grew from about 442 billion in fy2003 the year when the us invaded to an estimated 626 billion in fy2004 althoug h personnel costs could grow because of the recent decision to increase the number of us military personnel incountry to 150000 to cope with the increased intens ity of operations and to provide enhanced security before januarys elections that could be offset by the fact that fixed expenses eg for basing facilities may not need additional funding if dod assumes its fy2005 costs for operations for afghanistan and iraq and enhanced dod security will be similar to fy2004 then the administrations request for supplemental in february might be as w as 50 billion but most observers expect the request to be higher because the dod w ill ask for more funds to reset the forcehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32704crs9 resetting the force nd protecting troops current costs however reflect some but not all of the amounts n eeded to repair or replace damaged or destroyed equipment sometimes referred to as resetting the force costs that may prove to be substan tial although dod r eceived about 5 billion in each of the previous two supplementals to replace equi pment press reports suggest that the services may request substa ntially more in the fy2005 supplemental the army in particular could request several billions of dollars to modul arize or redesign combat and combatrelated units transformation initiative launched last year that initiative is intended both to increase the number of units available for deployment to reduce the strain on personnel and to increase the capability and responsiveness of these new units the army plans to pa for the cost of establishing these units entirely from supplementals which could be controversial the air force and the marine corps may also request funding to replace and repair equi pment repair that has been delayed because equipment rema in in theater if dod again expands its requirements the supplemental funding reque st could also include funding for force protection equipment eg uparmored humvee vehicles and body armor for troops beyond the nearly 2 billion alread appropriated as pa rt of the initial 25 billion in war funding and the substantia l funding from earlier supplementals dod may also request funds to replace those tr ansferred from other programs to pay for immediate force protection needs potential issues during consideration of the supplemental request congress is likely to debate the scope of the us commitment in iraq both the number of troops needed and potential longt erm costs that may include whether the size of the activeduty army needs to be expanded in order to meet requirements in iraq over the next several years nd prevent excessive stress on personnel from frequent deployments dod has argued th at it can accommodate these needs with temporary increase in the number of activeduty personnel and an ongoing restructuring initiative that would sh ift about 100000 military personnel from less to more critical skill specialties cong ress required that dod permanently increase military personnel endstreng th by 23000 in fy2005 congress may again debate whether benefits for military personnel need to be expanded in order to ensure that the army meets its recruitment and retention goals on the issue of costs congress may fo cus on both the near and longterm cost and the effect on the deficit accord ing to june 25 2004 cbo estimate the cost of the military operations in iraq and afgh anistan and enhanced dod security could total an additional 131 billion to 245 billion between fy2005 and fy2009 depending on the number of us troops needed and the pace of drawdown plan congress may also debate wh ether some or all funds s hould be provided in regular rather than supplemental appropri ations whether the armys proposed transformation and restructur ing should be entirely funded in the supplemental and whether troops force protection needs are adequately funded in the supplemental funding provided in emergency supplemen tal appropriation acts is not subject to limits set in annual budget resolutions anot her likely issue is the amount of funding flexibility to give dod and the type of oversight mechanisms that congress may require the fy2005 supplemental may also include funds for construction of the new us embassy in baghdadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32704crs10

north koreas nuclear w eapons program toward the us goal of verifiable dismantlement of the program there reportedly is general assumption within the us intelligence community that within the past year north korea has reprocessed 8000 nuclear fuel rods into weaponsgrade plutonium and may have produced up to six to eight atomic bombs the talks have been stalemated since they began in april 2003 since july 2004 north korea has refused to attend plenary session of the talks setting forth demands for us concessions under the heading of us abandonment of its hos tile policies toward north korea while the focus ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32704crs13 current diplomacy is on arranging another plenary session the stalemate in the talks has more serious factors nd ramifications most seri ous north koreas strategy since late july 2004 has weakened the bu sh administrations proposal of june 23 2004 as basis for future negotiations that proposal called for short freeze of north koreas nuclear program followed by relatively rapid dismantlement of the program north korea initially would r eceive oil from south korea and japan and provisional security guarantee from the participants in the talks including the united states once dismantlement was in process the united states would negotiate with north korea over reciprocal measures such as energy assistance to north korea and removal of north korea from the us list of terrorismsupporting countries north korea denounced the propos as sham proposal in foreign ministry statement of july 24 2004 pyongya ng may have been encouraged to adopt kill strategy toward the proposal by th lack of endorsements or support for the proposal by the other participants in the si xparty talks china south korea japan and russia by mid2004 too north korea had established its reward for freeze proposal emphasizing limited freeze of its plutonium program rather than dismantlement in strong position in the si xparty talks china russia and south korea were expressing support for elemen ts of the proposal and china and russia openly expressed skepticism toward the bush administrations claim that north korea operated secret uranium enrich ment program to produce uraniumbased atomic weapons north koreas successes in the sixparty talks are due to multifaceted strategy which pyongyang adopted after the august 2003 plenary session this strategy has been aimed at influencing the other governments participating in the talks and isolating the united states including threats to abandon ta lks and vociferously denying the us claim of secret uranium enrichment heu program in contrast the bush administrations approach in the talks has been relatively passive based on an assumption operating in 2003 that rth korea would alienate the other governments through provocative behavior the administration did not issue detailed proposal until june 23 2004 relying instead on demand that north korea agree to complete verifiable irreversible dismantlement cvid of its nuclear programs before the united states would ne gotiate even after it issued the june 23 proposal the administration launched diplomatic and public diplomacy campaign to promote it the administration also issued comprehensive critique of the reward for freeze proposal and has not bl unted the influence of north koreas denial strategy regarding heu on china russia and south korea the administration has claimed pub licly that the other participating governments support the us objective of cvid and it frequently praises chinas role however offthe record statements by administration officials and reportedly national security council memorandum of june 2004 express dissatisfaction with the state of the talks including chinas role the administration appears to face two basic issues in the sixparty talks one is how to move us agenda into dominant position in the talks including how to respond to recent chinese and south ko rean criticisms that the united states should present more flexible and deta iled settlement proposal second issue would be the type of us response if the talks remain stalemated here the options appear to be between allowing the talks and

tightened restrictions on family and educational travel and on the provision of private humanitarian assistance while there has been broad agreement in congress on the overall objective of us policy toward cuba to help bring democracy and respect for human rights to the island there have been several schools of thought on how best to achieve that objective some advocate maximum pressure on the cuban government until reforms are enacted while others argue for lifting some us sanctions that they believe are hurting the cuban people still others call for swift normalization of us cuban

guide national security policy defense strategy and military force planning during the bush administration strategy has been under extensive continuing and evolving review in september 2001 shortly after the attacks of september 11 the defense department released the congressionally manda ted quadrennial defense review qdr which laid out the premises of defense strategy in september 2002 the white house issued broader statement of the national security strategy of the united states which among other things asserted right to act preemptively to prevent unacceptable threats from arising in may 2004 the joint chiefs of staff completed formal statement of the national military strategy of the united states the next quadrennial defense review is required later than february 2006 and the defense department is already beginning preparations for military planners the main burden of the evolving strategic guidance from these and other reviews has been to expand the range of military capabilities that policymakers expect to have available administration officials have dismissed thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32704crs41 old requirement that forces be prepared for two major theater wars as much too limiting the 2001 qdr mandated that forces be prepared to defend the homeland to deter threats in four major regions while simultaneously engaging in smallerscale contingency operations to sw iftly defeat largerscale attacks in two regions and to win decisively in one area this is now called the 1421 strategy construct the warfighting requirement has since been refi ned to mandate the ability to deploy an adequate force to distant theater within 10 days defeat an enemy within 30 days and recover quickly enough to handle second conflict 30 days later subsequently other require ments have been added forces should be able to defeat challenges ranging from terrorism in ungoverned areas to irregular warfare including insurgencies to other asymmetric threats that do not directly challenge us strengths to disruptive threats from future competitors that would challenge us power in space or other realms and to pot entially catastrophic threats particularly from nonstate

is major focus of action in congress every year initially in debate over the annual cong ressional budget resolution and later when congress considers annual defense aut horization and appr opriations bills last year the administration requested 422 billion in f unding for national defense in regular fy2005 appropriations bills and later asked for an additional 25 billion in emergency funding for iraq and afghanista n for fy2006 last year s projection was for about 440 billion in regular defense f unding which is subject to change when the white house budget is submitted in fe bruary 2005 the

congress to be addressed early in the year in action on the budget resolution is how trends in defense fit with steps that may be needed to control federal budget deficits in the past dating back to

in several ears defense spending was an issue in action on the budget resolu tion when the senate rejected proposal to trim the administration s recommended total by 7 b illion with defense slated to grow by about 20 billion year for the next several ears in white house projections one issue in congress may be whether to limit future growth in defense even if congress does not decide to trim projected levels of defense spending some potentially controversia l tradeoffs within the defense budget may be on the agenda already several mbers of congress have object ed strongly to reported cut in the rate of shipbuilding in the fy2006 navy budget last year congress increased the statutory endstrength of the army by 20000 troops and of the marine corps by 3000 troops over pentagon objections for the present these increases are being paid for with supplemen tal appropriations one issue is whether such increases should be maintained in the future and if so how to pay for them the ongoing restructuring of the army also has equipm ent and operating costs that were not fully covered in earlier army budget plans and one issue is whether these costs should be covered by delaying army pr

transformational communications satellite funding for t hose and other very costly space programs may be on the agenda again this year there also remain questions about the overall affordability of

invasion of iraq in 2003 military personnel have participated in extended and hostile deployments to an extent unprecedented since the inception of the allvolunteer force in 1973 some analysts believe that these deployments are overtaxing ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32704crs48 military personnel and will lik ely have negative impact on military recruiting and retention this concern is most pronounced with respect to army personnel who have borne the brunt of the occupation of iraq active component military recruiting nd retention rates however have remained generally strong to date for example all of the services met their active duty enlisted recruit quantity and quality goals in fy2004 the services also met or exceeded nearly all their active duty enlis ted retention goals for fy2004 although the navy failed to meet its retention goal for sailors with fewer than six years of service by about 2 and the air force failed to meet its retention goal for airmen in their second enlistment by about 5 r ecruiting and retenti on rates for active component officers have also remained generally strong although there are some specialities for example certain types of pilots and medical personnel where lower than optimal retention rates sometimes over the c ourse of many years have produced officer shortages the reserve components have met most of their recr uiting and retention goals in fy2004 the army reserve naval rese rve marine corps reserve and air force reserve all exceeded their recruiting and retention goals for enlisted personnel in fy2004 however while the army na tional guard and the air national guard met their enlisted retention goals they failed to meet their recruiting goals the recruiting problem was most acute in the army guard which missed its recruit quantity goal by about 13 in fy2004 after having missed its fy2003 recruit quantity goal by similar margin the air national guard missed its recruit quantity goal by about 6 in fy2004 the army na tional guard also failed to meet two key benchmarks for recruit quality only 84 of its nonprior service enlistees had high school diplomas versus the dod standa rd of 90 and only 57 scored above average on the armed forces qualification test versus the dod standard of 60 with respect to officers some of the reserve components especially the army national guard and army reserve have had difficulties maintaining an adequate population of junior officers in recent years this may be par tially due to negative impacts created by the high operations tempo which the rese rve components have experienced over the past three years however some of the major causes of these shortfalls for example the high number of lieutenants who are separated from the army national guard and army reserve because they are not educationally qualified for promotion existed before september 11th in fy2005 the active army may encounter enlisted recruiting problems due to the small size of its delayed entry progra m dep the dep is made up of those individuals who have signed contract to join the military at future date but who have not yet shipped to basic training typically the army likes to have about 35 of the coming years recruit quota ready enrolled in the dep however because the army drew heavily on its dep in fy 2004 to meet its recruit quantity goal and because it fell short of its fy 2004 goal for new recruit contracts by 15 it started fy2005 with only about 18 of the 80000 individuals it hopes to send to basic training in the upcoming fiscal year this relatively low level of the dep may make it difficult for the army to achieve its quantity goal for fy2005 the armys plan to meet this challenge includes increasing the size of its recruiting force by nearly 20 and offering more generous enlistment incentives the army may alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32704crs49 face challenges in meeting its retention goal for fy2005 which is 14 higher than it was in fy2004 congress has number of options to address any recruiting and retention shortfalls that do occur the traditiona l policy levers used by congress and dod include increased funding for advertising increasing the size of the recruiting force and larger enlistment reen listment and critical skills re tention bonuses some have also argued that in order to prevent serious recruiting and retention problems from surfacing in the future the frequency and duration of military deployments needs to be decreased promptly to facilitate this they have dvocated increasing the size of the military reducing the number of us military personnel deploy ed or shortening the duration of rotations reserve benefits lawrence kapp specialist in national defense 77609 during the cold war era the reserve components were manpower pool that was rarely tapped from 1945 to 1989 reservists were involuntarily activated by the federal government only four times an average of less than once per decade since the end of the cold war and especially in the aftermath of the september 11th attacks the nation has relied much more heavily on the reserves since september 11 2001 the military has activated about 450000 re servists into federal service as the reserves have been transformed from force of last resort in the cold war era to an integrated part of the military servi ces in more recent years some have argued that compensation for reservists needs to be enhanced in order to maintain quality force and to ease the transition of reservists to and from active duty others have voiced concerns about the co sts associated with such proposals and the impact that improved reserve benefits will have on active component recruiting and retention patterns the major benefits improvements issues considered by the 108th congress were access to tricare the militarys health care system for nonactivated reservists and income protection for mobilized reservists the 108th congress approved several provisions that provided certain categories of nonactivated reservists with access to tricare however these provisions are not as expansive as some advocates desired both the h ouse and the senate approved measures to protect the income of some mobilized reservists in the 108th congress however neither of these provisions became law proposals to lower the age at which retired reservists begin
