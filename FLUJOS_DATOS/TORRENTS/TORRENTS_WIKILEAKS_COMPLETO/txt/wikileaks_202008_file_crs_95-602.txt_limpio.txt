duvalier family in 1986 the leaders of the coup faced stronger international sanctions than did previous coup leaders in haiti largely because democratic government was overthrown for more than three years the regime resisted international demands that president jeanbertrand aristide be restored to office us policy consisted of pressuring the facto haitian government to restore constitutional democracy to haiti measures included cutting off assistance to the haitian government imposing trade embargoes as called for by the organization of american states oas and the united nations supporting oas and diplomatic efforts and imposing sanctions targeted at the leadership blocking aristides return on september 18 1994 when it learned that us military intervention had been launched

resignation of the military leadership under the protection of some 20000 us troops president aristide returned to haiti on october 15 1994 calling for reconciliation and an end to violence on march 31 1995 having declared that secure and stable environment had been established the united states transferred responsibility for the mission to the during this period the main us foreign policy concern was the restoration of the democratic process to haiti closely related to this was the issue of haitians attempting to flee to the united states by boat congressional concerns focused on human

december 16 1990 in what is widely regarded as haitis first free and fair elections he was inaugurated on february 7 1991 raising hopes that haiti would leave behind its authoritarian past eight months later on september 30 1991 aristide was overthrown in violent military coup his ouster ushered in the seventh government since the downfall of the duvalier dictatorship in 1986 aristide was elected president with approximately 675 of the vote and was inaugurated on the fifth anniversary of the collapse of the 29year duvalier dictator ships to his supporters aristide was martyr willing to risk his life to defend the poor an advocate of liberation theology aristide spoke out against duvalier and the military rulers who followed him in september 1988 an armed group attacked and burned aristides church killing 13 and wounding 70 surrounded by his parishioners aristide escaped unharmed to his detractors aristide was potentially dangerous demagogue whose inflammatory oratory they maintained encouraged the rampages known as dechoukajes or uprooting in creole in which suspected tontons macoutes were attacked or killed by angry mobs aristide reportedly denies that his book 100 verses of dechoukaj condones violence nonetheless the salesian religious order expelled him for preaching politics from the pulpit including what the order called class struggle when aristide became candidate he toned down his revolutionary and anti us rhetoric 37yearold populist roman catholic priest he was the most controversial of 11 candidates ruled eligible to run by the independent provisional electoral council aristide previously opposed democratic elections in haiti arguing that free and fair elections were impossible as long as duvalierists still had hold on economic and political power nonetheless he joined the race in response to former tontons macoutes chief roger lafontants potential candidacy some observers believed that when first in office aristide helped to polarize the situation in haiti by refusing to condemn violent acts of retribution and holding out the threat of mob violence against those who disagreed with him for example aristide at that time refused to condemn the practice of pere lebrun or burning someone to death with tire necklace he reportedly said that the practice was not barred by the constitution and that although he would eventually like to see the practice discontinued its elimination was conditional on the eradication of corruption after the former head of the tontons macoutes was put on trial and sentenced to life in prison aristide gave speech in which he noted that without crs2 popular pressure and threat of pere lebrun in front of the courthouse the life sentence which is unconstitutional would not have been given12 in exile aristide condemned the practice of necklacing34 the coup began just four days after aristide addressed the united nations an event he said marked the end of haitis dark past of dictatorship when he returned to haiti aristide gave speech that observers viewed as threatening the bourgeoisie for not having helped his government enough some saw it as another factor leading to his overthrow days later and say that members of that elite financially supported the coup leaders there were at least 300 couprelated deaths according to the state department but over 1500 according to amnesty international president aristide was faced with some of the most serious and persistent social economic and political problems in the hemisphere after eight months in office aristide had received mixed reviews he was credited with curbing crime in the capital reducing the number of employees in bloated state enterprises and taking actions to bring the military under civilian control some observers questioned the governments commitment to democracy however neither aristide nor his prime minister belonged to political party and leaders of other political parties criticized him for not reaching out and establishing spirit of cooperation among the democratic elements many legislators including some from aristides own coalition protested the presidents appointment of supreme court judges and ambassadors without consulting the senate as required by the constitution aristide later agreed to consult the legislature but relations between the two branches remained strained president aristide was also criticized for his attitude toward the judicial system former tontons macoutes chief roger lafontant was tried in july for his role in the failed january 1991 coup attempt aristide called for life sentence which lafontant received though the constitution limited sentences to 15 years aristide declared the next day national holiday many observers expressed concern over the trial saying it differed little from trials under the duvaliers it lasted for over 20 consecutive hours important witnesses were not called and the court appointed five lawyer trainees to defend lafontant because even his own lawyer felt it too dangerous to defend him initially criticized for not having clear economic development plan by july the aristide government presented macroeconomic reform and

its troubled path toward democracy efforts to restore aristide the overthrow of haitis first democratically elected president in september 1991 propelled haiti into its worst crisis since protests brought down the 29year dictatorship of the duvalier family in 1986 the leaders of the coup faced stronger international sanctions than did previous coup leaders in haiti largely because democratic government was overthrown the united states france and canada haitis largest foreign aid donors suspended all aid to the haitian government as did venezuela and the european community ec most international aid to haiti had been only recently renewed having been cut off when the 1987 elections were thwarted within two days of the coup the organization of american states oas had demanded aristides immediate reinstatement after meeting resistance from several powerful haitian sectors the oas then imposed trade embargo in early october 1991 for more than three years the regime resisted international demands that aristide be restored to office week after sending president aristide into exile the military led by general cedras pressured the legislature into appointing figurehead president and prime minister the regime blocked february 1992 oassponsored agreement between haitian legislators and aristide that called for his eventual return and then proposed an alternative agreement that made mention of aristide in june 1992 the government installed marc bazin conservative economist and aristide rival as prime minister whereby the interim president stepped down leaving the presidency vacant and bazin to form government the oas became frustrated because neither the embargo nor diplomatic initiatives brought about return to constitutional rule the european community could not agree on an embargo and continued to ship goods to haiti sporadic oil shipments some at first linked to oas members then from europe kept the country fueled the embargo however did have significant effect on haitis already impoverished population according to one humanitarian assistance organization operating in haiti the situation after the coup deteriorated from extreme poverty to state of virtual famine in some parts of the country the oass frustration lead to the involvement of the united nations special envoy dante caputo representing both the and the oas began discussions in december 1991 these lead to the posting of an oasun civilian observer mission to oversee the restoration of order and monitor human rights conditions as the facto haitian government resisted the call for aristides return the international community responded with increased sanctions on november 24 crs4 1992 the general assembly adopted resolution urging member states to impose trade embargo on haiti as called for by the oas in october 1991 on june 4 1993 president clinton imposed new sanctions targeted at the haitian leadership and on june 23 the imposed worldwide oil and arms embargo these new sanctions coupled with the resignation of prime minister bazin on june 8 created the conditions for new round of talks in late june caputo held talks with both president aristide and military chief general cedras on governors island in new york although the two men did not meet face to face they signed an agreement which called for cedras resignation and aristides return by october 30 1993 see box below for details of agreement soon after sanctions were suspended small minority opposed to aristides return escalated their efforts to undermine the accord with politically motivated violence including the murders of prominent aristide supporter and his justice minister caputo and others blamed police chief michel francois for much of the renewed violations of human rights in october 1993the oas and united states reimposed sanctions many advocates of aristides return acknowledged concerns over aristides commitment to the democratic process but argued that the international community had an obligation to restore democratically elected head of state as matter of principle if aristide was found to be violating the constitution they said then the community should encourage haiti to address the problem through the democratic process including impeachment if necessary rather than through coup us policy after the coup following the september 1991 coup in haiti the main us foreign policy concern was the restoration of democracy closely related to this was the issue of haitians attempting to flee to the united states by boat important questions for us policymakers were whether the oas and would be able to promote an enduring solution in haiti and whether these measures would be able to forestall haitians attempting to flee to the united states as the expanded embargo and diplomatic efforts did not force the facto haitian regime to allow aristides return to office us policymakers had to consider whether to continue the embargo which many claimed was hurting haitis poor the most take stronger action such as military intervention or disengage from haiti when aristides return was arranged policymakers faced issues such as aristides personal security the possibility of violent popular backlash and whether aristide could govern effectively and democratically under the bush administration us policy aimed at pressuring the regime through trade embargo with the participation of other oas members the cutoff of us aid to the regime and support for diplomatic efforts through the oas many observers believed that president clinton intensified pressure on the haitian regime and helped advance negotiations to restore democracy to haiti but after the governors island accord collapsed pressure increased for change in policy the administration then took tougher stance toward the military regime imposing ever stiffer sanctions and ultimately ordering military intervention to remove them crs5 for further background on us policy considerations before president aristides return see crs report 94567 haitis political crisis us policy options international efforts to restore aristide immediately after aristides ouster in 1991 the george h w bush administration cut off aid to the government of haiti humanitarian assistance however continued through private and voluntary organizations pvos the united states followed through with the embargo and banned almost all trade with haiti at first the only embargo exceptions were for humanitarian aid such as medicine and food but in february 1992 the bush administration lifted the embargo for some assembly plants in may 1992 in response to the regimes refusal to cooperate with the oasbrokered agreement the oas voted to tighten its trade embargo against haiti by barring from all ports in the hemisphere ships from oas member countries that violated the embargo by running oil and other commercial goods to haiti the bush administration soon took action to comply with the tightening of the sanctions and prohibited ships that stopped in haiti from entering the united states without prior authorization in august 1992 the oas initiated new diplomatic efforts to try to resolve the political crisis delegation led by oas secretary general joao baena soares visited haiti to promote dialogue leading to the resumption of the haitian democratic process this led to talks between representatives of aristide and the facto regime which resulted in september 1992 agreement for an 18member subsequently reduced to 16 member oas civilian mission to be sent to haiti the civilian mission was supposed to have responsibility for monitoring the human rights situation the effects of the embargo the delivery of humanitarian aid and for evaluating prospects for negotiations for political settlement of the crisis after president clinton took office he reiterated us support for aristides return as president while also acknowledging that when in power aristide made statements that caused people in the military and others to have fear for their personal security in ways that are inconsistent with running democracy in early february 1993 secretary of state christopher sent warning to the haitian military and facto regime by stating that those who hold illegal power there should know that they are swimming against the tide of history and they will not prevail5 6 in december 1992 the had became involved in diplomatic efforts when the oas passed resolution authorizing the oas secretary general to explore with the secretary general ways to resolve peacefully haitis political situation as result special envoy dante caputo held meetings in haiti beginning in mid december after some vacillation the facto haitian regime agreed on february 9 1993 to accept an oasun observer mission the observers were to establish 5 preston julia haiti agrees to monitoring by oas washington post feb 10 1993 p a28 6 alexander watson assistant secretary of state for interamerican affairs at briefing for the house foreign affairs committee subcommittee on western hemisphere affairs oct 20 1993 crs6 monitoring posts throughout the country to observe the human rights situation and work at facilitating negotiations to bring about the eventual return of aristide the agreement was hailed by secretary of state warren christopher as breakthrough for mediation efforts the clinton administration pledged 2 million to support the mission it was hoped that the missions success might lead to decrease in repression and progress in negotiations and then to the gradual lifting of the embargo against haiti negotiations faltered in the spring some analysts said military leaders were emboldened to reject two proposals because they believed that international threats lacked credibility and were reluctant to give up the income many in the military were reportedly making from trafficking in drugs and contraband in march 1993 president clinton met with president aristide and committed the united states to contributing its fair portion of fiveyear 1 billion program to rebuild haitis economy president clinton also named lawrence pezzullo special adviser to haiti the clinton administration was criticized for not moving swiftly or strongly enough to ensure aristides return to office some members especially some members of the congressional black caucus expressed dismay that the administration did not respond with stronger measures when the haitian military rejected the plan that included amnesty in april 1993 the administration contended that there was still room for negotiations and that they were using slower carrot andstick approach combining pressure with offers of future aid on june 4 1993 however the clinton administration imposed further sanctions targeted at haitian leaders members of the military the civilian government and the private sector who supported the coup were prohibited entry into the united states and along with the central bank and other institutions had their us assets frozen the administration continually expanded the list of those subject to targeted sanctions for obstructing the restoration of democracy in haiti or contributing to its general climate of violence it also encouraged other countries to impose similar sanctions on june 6 1993 the oas called for reenforcement of its embargo by the and proposed suspending commercial flights to haiti on june 16 the security council voted unanimously to impose global oil and arms embargo on haiti and to freeze haitian government assets around the world the sanctions took effect june 23 these sanctions seemed to have their desired effect general cedras agreed to go to new york to discuss settlement to the crisis caputo mediated the agreement between cedras and aristide who did not meet face to face while at governors island crs7 the governors island agreement these are the steps for restoration of democracy in haiti agreed to by armed forces chief general raoul cedras and president jeanbertrand aristide on july 3 1993 1 representatives of all the political parties of parliament and members of aristides

office 4 once prime minister takes office economic sanctions against haiti are suspended by the united nations and the organization of american states 5 the international community launches program of technical assistance to promote development administrative and judicial reform the modernization of the haitian army and the creation of new police force with the help of personnel 6 aristide grants an amnesty for political crimes in relation to the september 1991 coup as allowed by article 147 of the haitian constitution 7 parliament adopts law establishing new police force aristide appoints new police commander 8 cedras accepts early retirement as army chief aristide appoints new military commanderinchief who in turn shall appoint members of the high command as per the constitution 9 aristide returns as president of haiti on october 30 1993 10 the united nations and organization of american states take responsibility for verifying compliance with the accord source miami herald july 4 1993 p 18a the agreement they signed on july 3 1993 outlined 10step process leading to aristides return to haiti as president on october 30 1993 cedras was to step down as head of the army accepting early retirement and aristide was to appoint new commanderinchief who would then appoint members of the high command aristide agreed to grant political amnesty to cedras and the coup leaders it would not shield them from individual criminal prosecution however once the reconstituted parliament confirmed robert malval as aristides prime minister in late august the oas and united states suspended their sanctions the international community was to begin its promised fiveyear 1 billion dollar development program whose economic and technical assistance included job creating programs administrative and judicial reform support modernization of the haitian army and security team to direct the development of new civilian controlled police force the us sanctions were suspended in august 1993 after the first steps of the governors island accord were taken once sanctions were lifted however violence increased and the military began to show signs of intransigence in september 1993 paramilitary forces known as attaches threatened malval several members of his new cabinet and oasun envoy caputo attacked an elected official trying to resume office and assassinated prominent aristide supporter antoine izmery on october 11 an angry mob of haitians refused to allow us crs8 ship to dock and threatened the top us official in haiti as haitian soldiers stood by the ship which the military had promised to allow to dock carried 200 us soldiers and 25 canadian military trainers who were to be part of 1300member military and police observing and training team agreed to under the governors island accord many analysts believe that the decision to pull that ship the uss harlan county out of haiti destroyed us credibility and emboldened the haitian regime to dig in its heels on october 14 1993 president aristides new minister of justice guy malary was assassinated by gunmen in what many viewed as defiance of president clintons warning less than two hours earlier that the united states would hold the haitian military responsible for the safety of the new civilian government appointed by aristide malary was writing the legislation to put the police under civilian not military control when he was killed the oas and withdrew their 250member international civilian mission stating that the observers did not have minimal guarantee of their personal security the oas and the united states reimposed their trade embargoes and the its oil and arms embargo which took effect october 18 saying the sanctions would not be canceled until aristide was restored to office international ships including six us warships began patrolling haitian waters to enforce the uns embargo president clinton reported to congress on october 20 1993 the deployment of the us navy ships according to the letter which the president indicated was consistent with the war powers resolution the us forces would remain prepared to protect us citizens in haiti and act in cooperation with the us coast guard to support the interdiction of haitian migrants as may be necessary the president further stated that the united states strongly supports the governors island agreement and restoration of democracy in haiti and that the measures to deploy us forces are consistent with united states goals and interests and constitute crucial support for the world communitys strategy to overcome the persistent refusal of haitian military and police authorities to fulfill their commitments under the governors island agreement meanwhile congress was debating the merits of possible us military intervention in haiti some members wished to prohibit such us involvement without specific approval from congress others while not necessarily in favor of us military intervention did not want to limit the presidents decisionmaking ability on october 21 1993 the us senate defeated by vote of 8119 an amendment introduced by senator helms to the department of defense appropriations bill hr 3116 that would have barred the us deployment of troops to haiti without prior congressional authorization unless us citizens were endangered or had to be evacuated instead the senate approved by vote of 982 an amendment offered by senator mitchell based on compromise with senator dole that urged president clinton to seek congressional authorization before committing us troops the united states france canada and venezuela gave haiti until january 15 1994 to meet the conditions of the governors island accord after which they said they would recommend that the security council consider increased sanctions including imposing global total trade embargo the deadline passed without the crs9 military meeting any of the conditions but rather than impose new sanctions the four friends of haiti instead called for aristide to first appoint new prime minister aristide rejected the plan reportedly saying the international community was acting in complicity with the military regime in delaying his return the agreement set date for the military to relinquish power to aristide and dropped the provision included in the earlier governors island accord that called for an international mission to oversee the professionalization of the haitian armed forces following harsh criticism of that strategy in may 1994 the white house shifted to policy of increasing pressure on the haitian military without asking aristide to make further compromises first the white house also shifted its immigration policy special envoy pezzullo resigned and was replaced by william gray former congressman who had once headed the congressional black caucus the white house orchestrated increased sanctions on may 6 1994 the security council voted unanimously to impose an almost total trade embargo on haiti the only exceptions were for food medicine and cooking fuel the resolution gave cedras his deputy gen philippe biamby and portauprince police chief lt col michel francois 15 days until may 21 to step down before the embargo went into effect other sanctions barred all military officers key civilian supporters and their families about 600 people from traveling outside haiti and prohibited private plane flights in and out of haiti the resolution urged worldwide freeze on the assets of military leaders and their allies stopping short of making it mandatory because the laws of some nations including britain precluded it the new sanctions were not to be lifted until the military leaders had left the army and police commands had been reformed the legislature had adopted political amnesty and aristide had returned to office falling under chapter vii of the charter the resolution allowed for enforcement by military action the dominican republics president joaquin balaguer had reportedly stationed 10000 soldiers along the border with haiti to help stave the massive smuggling which had made the oil embargo ineffective some observers were concerned that balaguer was cooperating on enforcing the embargo in hopes of reducing us calls for investigations of fraud charges in may 1994 elections which balaguer claimed to have won by small margin both governments denied any such accommodation had been made president clinton expanded us sanctions twice on june 12 1994 he barred most private financial transactions and effective june 25 commercial air travel between the two countries on june 21 he froze the us assets of all haitians still residing in haiti the administration also strengthened its rhetoric saying it could not rule out the use of force to oust the haitian military regime the haitian regime ordered the expulsion of the oasun human rights monitoring mission from haiti on july 11 1994 the monitors began leaving soon after that date on july 31 1994 the administration helped push through resolution authorizing member nations to form multinational forceand to use all necessary crs10 means to facilitate the departure from haiti of the military leadership and the prompt return of the elected president with participating countries bearing the cost of the operation about 20 countries initially agreed to join such force including argentina bangladesh belgium bolivia britain nine caribbean states the netherlands and panama jamaica barbados belize and trinidad and tobago agreed to contribute support personnel to the intervention force france and canada who worked with the united states in pressuring the haitian regime declined to participate in an invasion force deputy secretary of state strobe talbott and deputy defense secretary john deutch stated on august 31 that us troops were definitely going to haiti either to provide security for returned aristide government or if the military refused to step down to help remove them us officials gave deadline for the haitian military to step down at that time in the face of strong bipartisan sentiment against an invasion president clinton addressed the nation on september 15 1994 to encourage greater support for the planned invasion he told the haitian dictators leave now or we will force you from power he defined us interests in restoring the democratically elected government in haiti as to stop the brutal atrocities that threaten tens of thousands of haitians to secure our borders and to preserve stability and promote democracy in our hemisphere and to uphold the reliability of the commitments we make and the commitments others make to us the next day the president announced that delegation headed by former president jimmy carter was going to haiti in lastditch effort to avoid military intervention accompanying carter were senator sam nunn and general colin powell haitis military leadership finally agreed to step down voluntarily late on september 18 when they heard that the president had already given the order for an invasion to begin and us planes were on their way to haiti the new agreement called for cedras resignation by october and the immediate deployment of the us military mission to ensure transition to restoration of the democratically elected aristide government see box below for details of agreement crs11 september 18 1994 an agreement reached in

president should have sought congressional authorization before sending us forces to haiti the measure avoided approving or disapproving the deployment but said the troops should be withdrawn as soon as possible after us forces were criticized for standing by as haitian police beat pro american demonstrators and for saying us forces had role in halting haitian onhaitian violence us military leaders changed their policy and announced that troops were authorized to stop such violence the mission then shifted from one of working with the haitian army to one of bringing the army under control its most powerful unit was disarmed and disbanded the heavy weapons unit had been involved in the coup that overthrew aristide in september 1991 in their first months in haiti us troops also disarmed the headquarters of the violent paramilitary group the front for advancement and progress in haiti or fraph and conducted weapons buyback program under us security the haitian parliament met

according to reports by human rights groups and by the us department of state with aristide supporters members of grassroots organizations and journalists frequently targeted in august 1992 amnesty international reported that the security forces and the thousands of civilians acting in collusion with them carry out wide range of abuses with total impunity the old repressive structures crs13 which the deposed aristide government had partly succeeded in dismantling are back in place of particular concern was the paramilitary group the front for advancement and progress in haiti or fraph

in may 1994 revival of the tontons macoutes the duvaliers secret policetype organization was announced in 1994 human rights abuses by the military and its supporters increased and became particularly gruesome with wave of mutilations of victims of extrajudicial executions and politically motivated rapes in july 1994 the military regime ousted the unoass joint human rights monitoring mission which had reported widespread violations of human rights abuses since 1993 the ranking human rights official in haiti reportedly said we feel there is deliberate policy on the part of the army and its allies to eliminate aristide partisans to break the back of the prodemocracy movement and to terrorize the population78 in september 13 report the state department said the military and the facto government promote repression and terror sanctioning widespread assassination killing torture beating mutilation and rape910 for decades the haitian army had been responsible for widespread human rights violations under the militarydominated interim governments after the fall of the duvalier dictatorship in 1986 the army frequently impeded the democratic process since the departure of the last military dictator in march 1990 however some observers believed there had been transformation of the army to one supportive of democracy throughout the 1990 electoral process the 7000man army proved itself capable of establishing and maintaining order initially the army accepted aristides assertion of authority including his purge of the haitian army high command brig general raoul cedras who oversaw security for the december elections and was named commanderinchief by aristide was reportedly reluctant participant in the initial coup but as its spokesman he said aristide was ousted for meddling in army affairs and he led the military regime during its threeyear rule when it first took office the aristide government was expected to meet resistance from the army in its attempts to implement provisions of the haitian constitution that impose civilian authority over the military for example the constitution calls for the separation of the police from the army with the police under the command of the ministry of justice not the army the law also mandates that cases involving military abuses against civilians be tried in civilian courts not by the military the military had

reforms in the army and create civilian police force when he was overthrown these changes were to be attempted again under the governors island agreement many believe that it was resistance to reform as well as suppression of resistance that led to the upsurge in violence following the signing of the governors island accord and contributed to the armys opposition to aristides return haitian migration the us policy of interdicting haitian migrants on the sea was severely criticized after the september 1991 coup the interdiction policy was based on bilateral agreement negotiated between the reagan administration and the duvalier government in september 1981 that permitted the us coast guard to interdict boats on the high seas and to return undocumented passengers to haiti haiti was the only country with which the united states had such an agreement from september 1981 through october 1990 the coast guard interdicted 22651 haitians at sea during those nine years fewer than dozen haitians were allowed into the united states to apply for asylum the year 1990 saw the lowest level of interdictions in seven years and the coast guard reported that during some months of aristides 1991 term they did not encounter single haitian refugee boat both haitian and us officials reportedly attributed this to the new hope haitians had for improved conditions under the newly elected government after aristides ouster on september 30 1991 the exodus rose sharply during aristides exile 66954 haitians were interdicted by the us coast guard for the first six months after the coup the us coast guard took the haitians to the us naval facility in guantanamo bay cuba where the us immigration and naturalization service conducted prescreening interviews more than 10000 of those prescreened or about 30 were allowed to go to the united states to seek asylum on may 24 1992 however president bush ordered the interception and immediate return to haiti of all haitians in boats on the high seas without prescreening them to see if they might be eligible for asylum instead haitians could apply for refugee status at the us embassy president clinton who during the campaign said haitians would not be turned back without hearing continued the forced repatriation policy which the supreme court upheld in june 1993 debate over the interdiction policy centered on several issues the most important question was the cause of the haitians flight the george h w bush administration had argued that the majority were fleeing poverty and were therefore ineligible for political asylum refugee advocates argued that many were likely to face political persecution at home from the militarydominated government and that conducting inadequate or interviews resulted in returning many who might have had legitimate claims to refugee status according to human rights organizations the human rights situation deteriorated significantly following the coup another important question was whether those returned to haiti were facing persecution according to the department of states 1992 human rights report us officials monitored more than 3000 repatriates in 1992 without finding single crs15 credible claim of mistreatment or retribution against any haitian for having attempted to leave haiti the report also noted that repatriated haitian boat people do face of course the same harsh conditions and lawlessness facing haitians in general human rights groups maintained that it was extremely dangerous and difficult to investigate claims of persecution and contended that ins efforts to interview repatriates were deeply flawed they also argued that it was unsafe to apply for asylum in haiti in march 1993 navy deserter granted refugee status by the us embassy was arrested by the haitian military as he was escorted by us diplomats to usbound plane after the administration protested haitian authorities released the man some members of congress and others expressed concern that there was perceived element of racism in us refugee policy toward haiti very few haitians seeking asylum were granted it in contrast to the almost automatic granting of permanent residence to cubans due in large part to the cuban adjustment act of 1966 some critics argued that failure to give haiti the same designation of special humanitarian concern given cuba considering haitis decadeslong record of oppression was racist action in addition refugee advocates argued that the policy violated convention prohibiting all countries from sending back to country persons who have legitimate claims of political persecution as human rights violations grew worse in haiti president aristide apparently became increasingly uncomfortable with the forced repatriation policy in early april he called the policy racist and gave the six months notice needed to abrogate the migration agreement effective october 4 1994 the us coast guard continues to stop haitian boats however on the grounds of intercepting ships deemed unseaworthy in the months following aristides return to haiti in october 1994 the number of haitians intercepted at sea was deemed minuscule by the state department clinton administration migration policy reversing his campaign position president clinton continued the bush administrations policy of interdicting and immediately returning haitians found at sea during that time he increased the number of us officials in haiti in order to speed up the processing of asylum applications there he also supported oas and efforts to promote political settlement in haiti maintaining that these efforts would help eliminate the reasons for haitians fleeing the country as violence intensified in haiti however so did criticism of president clintons migration policy some members of the us congress were arrested protesting the forced repatriation policy outside the white house and activist randall robinson went on hunger strike until the policy was reversed on may 8 1994 the administration announced that it would set up immigration centers on ships anchored near haiti or in third countries so that haitians interdicted at sea could apply for asylum on july 5 the clinton administration shifted its policy again announcing that processing for refugee status would longer be conducted instead haitian migrants interdicted at sea would be taken to the us naval base at guantanamo bay cuba and then sent to other countries in the region providing temporary safe haven the flow of haitian migrants lessened after the new policy was announced and most crs16 interdicted haitians remained at guantanamo at its peak in late summer 1994 about 14300 haitians were living in safe haven camps at guantanamo bay two months after aristides return on december 29 1994 the administration called on haitians at safe haven camps at the us naval base at guantanamo bay cuba to return to haiti socioeconomic conditions even before the embargo haiti was one of the poorest countries in the world living conditions for the poor majority in haiti have not changed significantly in many decades national income per capita is 370 and about half the population is unemployed the vast majority of haitis 63 million people live in absolute poverty and about 47 of the adult population is illiterate only 43 of the population has access to safe water infectious disease is widespread among the poor more than half the population reportedly suffers from malnutrition the infant mortality rate is 95 per 1000 births life expectancy is about 54 years compared to 76 years in the united states only onethird of haitian soil is cultivable yet some 70 of the population depends on agriculture engaged in smallscale subsistence farming peasants with unclear titles to the land earn an average annual per capita income of 150 overpopulation and overcultivation of arable land have led to considerable deforestation and erosion process exacerbated by embargodriven fuel shortages disorder and labor strikes before and since duvaliers departure have led to significant economic deterioration and the collapse of the onceimportant tourism industry in the past foreign manufacturers successfully recruited and trained haitian work forces but the us and embargoes closed down most export assembly plants many reports indicate the oas and us embargoes had devastating economic and ecological impact on haiti an estimated 150000 jobs were initially lost in the assembly service and local industrial sectors fuel shortages led to power blackouts limited more costly public transportation and serious ecological damage as haitians cut trees for charcoal in an already eroded landscape medical care deteriorated under the embargoes with hospitals in portauprince suspending most major surgery because of the lack of anesthetics and other drugs there were also reports of outbreaks of measles and malaria which were once well controlled in haiti according to march 1994 aid report the nutritional status of children has worsened since march 1993 in every region except the south and severe malnutrition is at the highest level in several years with the exception of august 1993 although us assistance to the haitian government was suspended after the september 30 1991 coup humanitarian assistance in the form of food and development assistance continued after the coup with delivery through private voluntary organizations pvos for fy1993 approximately 108 million was obligated including 41 million in food aid 23 million in development assistance and 44 million in esf assistance obligations for fy1994 totaled 1056 million including almost 43 million in food aid 26 million in development assistance and 37 million in esf estimated obligations for fy1995 totaled almost 201 million and included 155 million in esf for peacekeeping shipments of humanitarian oil crs17 helped pvos to deliver food and services under the oil embargo although there were reports that many haitians had difficulty reaching those services with the reduced public transportation that resulted from the embargo drug trafficking according to the department of state haiti is significant transhipment point for the movement of illegal narcotics especially cocaine into the united states when president aristide first took office he said that combating drug trafficking was top priority of his government this was not true of the subsequent military current regime according to september 1992 state department report although haitian media and other sources have reported an upsurge in illicit drug traffic since late 1991 government counternarcotics efforts remain sporadic and focused on lower echelon traffickers the us aid cutoff suspended narcotics programs carried out with the haitian government the us and aristide government had signed an agreement providing for joint support of haitian counternarcotics projects but because of the coup this accord was not implemented wellinformed analysts say that some members at all levels of the military were involved in drug trafficking and that this involvement contributed to the militarys reluctance to give up power and allow aristides return despite these charges the us drug enforcement administration was reportedly providing the haitian military with intelligence on narcotics trafficking including information on drugs going into haiti to the haitian antinarcotics unit headed by army col antoine atouriste atouriste was among the 41 haitians whose us assets were frozen in 1993 for obstructing the restoration of democracy in haiti or contributing to its general climate of violence reportedly the antinarcotics unit had accounting system for seized drugs and us officials did not know what happened to drugs seized by the haitian military us official reportedly said that the us embassy regularly received reports of haitian military involvement in drug trafficking but that they had not been verified for
