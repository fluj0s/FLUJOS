that its import practices and the canadian wheat board cwb wheat export practices comply fully with international trade rules and its wto obligations and that canada does not subsidize its wheat exports in addition us millers nd pasta makers have expressed concern over potential trade restrictions that might limit their access to canadas highqua lity grain supplies us allegations against canadian wheat trading practices have led to series of investigations by us agriculture and trade authorities at various levels including both the us international tr ade commission itc and the world trade organization wto against wheat imports from canada as well as the trading practices of the cwb itc investigatory findings october 2003 resulted in an 114 punitive duty including both antidumping

issue definition the united states and canada are bot h important producers traders and consumers of major grains including wh eat the two countries are joined with mexico in the north american free trad agreement nafta which calls for essentially unrestricted dutyfree gr ain trade among the three nations although us wheat imports remain ve ry small relative to domestic supplies relatively large us imports of canadian durum and spring wheat since the early 1990s have been source of concern to us northerntier wh eat producers who claim that imports from canada are subsidized and have large negative impact on local grain prices this situation is ggravated by the operations of the canadian wheat board cwb which has been granted certain special market powers and financial guarantees by the canadian g overnment according to us grain producers and us trade officials and by certain canadian import practices that appear to disfavor imported over domes tic wheat canada maintains that canadian grain import practices and the cwb wheat export pr actices comply fully with international trade rules and its wto obligations concern over alleged unfair trade practi ces has led to numerous investigations and charges by us trade officials of the wheat trading practices of canada and the cwb the united states has pursued gal action on two fronts countervailing duty and antidumping investigati ons of hard red spring hrs and durum wheat imports from canada by the us international trade commission itc and dispute settlement case ds 276 at the world trade organization wto to review

hard wheat the other two classes being hard red winter hrw and hard white hw hard wheats are high in protein and glut content making them well suited for milling into bread flour hrs tends to have higher protein and gluten content than either hrw or hw as result hrs wheat is especially valued for blending with lowerprotein wheat to be milled into premium bread flour durum also qualifies as type of hard highprotein wheat but its end use separates it from other types of hard wheats durum is highly valued because it is the sole wheat class that can be milled into semolina coarse meal that can be processed into various pasta productshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32426crs2 1 usda online maps for major us and cana dian production regions for durum and hrs are available at httpwwwusdagovoce

however these two classes of wheat are also important to the us wheat s ector since 1996 these two classes have accounted for nearly 30 of us commerc ial wheat export volume 25 share for hrs and 4 share for durum and an even higher share of wheat producers market returns since they have significant price premiums over other wheat classes in most years2 us and canadian hrs exports are critically important to international wheat markets since together they represent the worlds primary source of high protein wheat key ingredient in the production of leavened bread us imports of wheat and wheat flour are historically small averaging about 3 of total us supplies each year and are generally related to specific enduse needs see figure 5 most us wheat imports are durum and hrs wheat from canada despite their small volume relative to to tal supply unexpected growth in us wheat imports in the early 1990s prima rily of spring and durum wheat from canada has been viewed as especially problematic by producers in us border states especially when us prices are low as during the 19982001 period see figure 6 us total wheat imports gr ew from about 611000 metric tons in 1989 to nearly 3 million

the united states and canada subseque ntly incorporated into nafta contributed to the expanded agricultural trade however not all of the change in uscanadian agricultural trade can be attributed to the fta or to any other single factor weather policy changes and world supply and demand conditions are some of the influential factors exchange rates are also important prevailing exchange rates

in which grain is marketed in the united states grain is marketed through vast network of producer cooperatives and small and large trading comp anies in contrast the role of grain marketing in canada is assumed entirely by the canadian wheat board cwb in accordance with canadian law the cwb has the exclusive right to purchase and sell western canadian wheat durum and nondurum and barley for domestic human consumption and for export while canadian farmers are free to choose the crops that they grow each year all canadian pr oducer sales of wheat and barley for food use or export must be to the cwb howeve r the use or sale of wheat or barley as livestock feed is permitted without re striction in canadian markets us allegations and canadian counterarguments despite the general success of the uscanada agricultural trading relationship several points of friction exist us tr ade officials and wheat producer groups have raised three general charges against the cwb and canadian wheat trading practices first cwb trading practices they contend that canadian wheat trading practices particularly the export practi ces of the cwb are inconsistent with canadas wto obligations nd disadvantage us wheat ex porters in canadian and international markets canadian officials claim that the cwb operates as valid state trading enterprise ste under wto rules article xvii of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt 1994 is the princi pal article dealing with stes and their operations3 it sets out that such enterprises in their purchase or sales involving either imports or exports are to act in accordance with the general principles of nondiscrimination and that co mmercial considerations only are to guide their decisions on imports and exports the cwb claims that it is marketing organization not government agency under 1998 amendment to the canadian wheat board act the cwb ceased to be crown corporation and farmers became re sponsible for the election of members of the board of directors with members from both government and the private sector4 however in 2001 an itc investigati on found that the cwb operates in all significant respects as an arm of the canadian government5 the cwb retains its monopsony single buyer and monopoly single seller power in the marketing of western canadian grains for food use or export the cwb receives government approval and backing of its borrowing and other financing which reduces its costs and insulates it from the commercial risks faced by us grain traders further the cwbs producer pool system by which cana dian

canadian government implemented remedies to bring them into compliance see continuedthe cwb special marketing flexibility producers receive governmentapproved and guaranteed initial payment early in the crop year with subsequent interim and final payments as the crop is harvested and sold on world markets subsequent payments are payable only to the extent that the cwb makes money on its sales if final market returns fail to cover the cost of the initial payments any losses are covered by the government not the cwb this occurred in the 200203 pool when losses of 658 million were cove red by the canadian government us producer groups claim that this equaled direct export subsidy of 204 cents per bushel on the 320 million bushels of canadian hrs export sales that year6 the cwb dismissed this criticism saying that this was the first deficit since the 199091 crop year and falls far short of the average 740 million in annual subsidies provided to us wheat producers7 critics of the cwb also argue that its monopsony power in canada gives the cwb extraordinary market power particularly in the north american markets for durum and hard spring wheat representativ of the us wheat industry as well as us agriculture and trade officials also complain that the cwbs monopoly control over canadas wheat trade permits it to practice discriminatory pricing in international markets and thereby gain unfair competitive advantage over other wheat exporters because the cwb does not public ly report the terms and conditions of individual sales these charges have been difficult to prove the cwb responds to this alleged lack of transparency by sayi ng that usbased private companies such as cargill or archer daniels midland also do not report the contractual details of their commercial transactions8 the canadian government has shown interest in negotiating mutually acceptable resolution to the dispute howe ver within canada an important producer group the western canadian wheat grow ers association wcwga has argued for ending the cwbs special monopoly powers and other special privileges9 the wcwga states that as long as the cwb continues to operate as legislated monopoly with government supports for its borrowings and bad debts it will continue to be subj ect of trade disputes second treatment of imported grain according to us trade officials although the cwb does not engage in wheat imports the canadian government has certain rules and regulations in place that discriminate against imported grains at grain elevators and within cana das rail transportation system10

united states in addition to charges against the cwb us northerntier wheat producers have long argued that canadian wheat entering the us market is being supported by various subsidies and that these wheat imports have had large negative impact on local grain prices see figure 6 as result of these trade violations us industry groups have argued that some form of trade re striction such as tariffrate quota should be placed on canadian wheat entering the ited states and that the cwb should lose its monopsony and monopoly privilege s over western canadian grain11 canada maintains that canadian impor t practices and the cwb wheat export practices comply fully with international trade rules and its wto obligations in addition the north american millers association nama12 has argued strongly against the imposition of any form of trade restraint on canadian grain exports to the united states13 they argue that continued open access to canadian highprotein wheat and durum is important to mainta in adequate milling s upplies particularly given the downward trend in us wheat and durum acreage that has occurred since the passage of the 1996 us farm act pl 10777 legal actions
