and prosperity the governments of indonesia and timorleste resolved to face the past between the two nations through the forum of the t ruth and friendship commission the commissions goals were to conduct shared inquiry with the aim of establishing the conclusive truth about the reported human rights violations and institutional responsibility and to make recommendations which can contribute to healing the wounds of the past and further promoting reconciliation and friendship and ensuring the nonrecurrence of similar events this report presents the results of the two and half years of work by the worlds first bilateral t ruth and friendship commission as such in itself the commission represents model for cooperation and the development of mechanisms for arriving at consensus on even the most difficult and challenging of issues this report is comprised of nine chapters chapters 13 set out the structure mandate and terms of reference of the commission and explain how the commission interpreted and applied them chapter 4 describes the historical background the institutional structures and political dynamics which formed the broader context of the violence in east timor in 1999 chapter 57 provides an analysis of all of the information and evidence gathered by the commission chapter 8 sets out the commissions findings on the basis of this analysis relates them to the broader context discussed in chapter 4 and arrives at final conclusions on the basis of these conclusions and the commissions reflections on what it has learned from its research analysis and deliberation chapter 9 sets out recommendations lessons learned and final reflections in accordance with the mandate this report will be submitted to the heads of state and governments of both nations who will make it available to the parliaments and the public the executive summary is comprehensive condensed version of the report that encompasses the core aspects of each chapter and focuses on the findings and recommendations of the commissionexecutive summaryxi mandate and implementation the commissions mandate began in 2005 and was extended until 2008 to complete the three main components of its work 1 inquiry consisting of document review factfinding and research 2 making findings on the perpetration of gross human rights violations and institutional responsibility and 3 arriving at recommendations and lessons learned the foundation of the commissions work was the process of establishing the conclusive truth about the events leading up to and immediately following the popular consultation in east timor in 1999 this historical inquiry was conducted in accordance with the research framework outlined in the commissions mandate which required document review and fact finding process that would be the basis on which the commission analyzed and determined the truth the commissions process to fulfill its mandate of establishing the conclusive truth about the violence in east timor in 1999 the commission collected and analyzed large body of evidence from variety of sources this evidence and analysis focused on the two central questions before the commission were gross human rights violations committed in east timor in 1999 and if so are there institutions that bear responsibility for those violations to answer these questions the commission conducted document review analyzing the results of previous trials and investigations these included the report of the commission of inquiry kpp ham appointed by the indonesian national human rights commission komnas ham the trials before the indonesian ad hoc human rights court in jakarta including the investigative dossiers baps of the attorney generals office the report of the commission of reception t ruth and reconciliaton of timorleste cavr and the trials and investigations conducted by the special panels for serious crimes and serious crimes unit scu in dili all of these bodies of documents have strengths and limitations for example the investigation of kpp ham and the process before the ad hoc court in jakarta did not encompass violations allegedly committed by proindependence groups the ad hoc court trials also did not address wide range of violations such as sexual violence nor did they focus on the alleged direct involvement of elements of the tni or other bodies in the perpetration of these violations in these trials there was also general failure to bring the available relevant evidence and witnesses before the court cavr and kpp ham were both nonjudicial bodies and this necessarily limited the nature and scope of their research or investigations the scu focused its resources on priority cases of murder committed by proautonomy militias and did not fully investigate or bring to trial cases involving other major categories of violations the scu was also unable to obtain the cooperation necessary to fully investigate or try cases involving alleged indonesian perpetrators while the cavr and kpp ham considered the larger context of the violence the trials in jakarta and dili focused largely upon individual cases as isolated events the limitations and shortcomings of these previous investigations and trials are analyzed in chapter 57 of the report and form the basis for recommendations for institutional reform in chapter 9 x in addition the commission engaged in an extensive fact finding process that included public hearings closed hearings statement taking interviews and written submissions as the commission is not judicial body with the power to compel testimony these hearings aimed to be inclusive and to allow all concerned parties to present their perspectives without interruption these presentations were followed by clarification in which all the commissioners could ask questions as an aid in establishing the truth the commission developed closed hearings as mechanism that would allow individuals to give testimony that they might be reluctant or afraid to provide in public through this process the commission was able to ensure that it heard wide range of perspectives on the 1999 violence from the testimony of witnesses who experienced the events of 1999 in many different roles one perspective missing from the fact finding process was that of the united nations despite repeated invitations by the commission the elected not to allow its personnel to appear and testify the commissions document review and fact finding methodologies should be seen as distinct but nonetheless complementary parts of one process aimed at establishing to the extent possible the conclusive truth about the 1999 violence both of these methodologies follow conceptual framework that elaborates in detail the criteria necessary for findings of gross human rights violations and institutional responsibility this framework is set out in chapters 3 and 57 of the report the commission was well aware of the criticisms made of its public hearings by members of civil society in both countries these public hearings however were only one of many sources of information and testimony that the commission employed all of these sources were subjected to careful analytical process that weighed the various sources of evidence against one another in order to arrive at sound findings and conclusions this analytical process showed for example how the document review because of the nature and depth of the evidence it provided provided solid foundation for evaluation of the various and often contradictory claims made by witnesses who appeared before the commission in the public and closed hearings the greater evidentiary depth of the evidence gathered and analyzed in the document review substantiated some of the claims made by witnesses in hearings and definitively contradicted others in turn it also demonstrated how the testimony of some witnesses could add further to or provide greater degree of corroboration to the conclusions reached in the document review in order to fulfill its mandate to inquire into the nature scope and causes of the violence in 1999 the commission conducted research into the historical background political dynamics and institutional structures that shaped events before and during 1999 chapter 4 this allowed the commission to inform its conclusions with broader understanding of the way in which the causes of the violence in 1999 were connected to previously established institutional structures and practices this understanding was particularly important in arriving at recommendations chapter 9 aimed at preventing future reoccurrence through institutional reform and other measures xii the conclusive truth conclusions about the context of the violence there were multiple causes of the conflict in 1999 which are complex and inter related some of these causes doubtless go back to at least 1974 and the events ensuing from the end of the portuguese colonial presence others arose from the more immediate political context of the events of 1998 in indonesia the underlying reasons for each aspect of the conflict in 1999 requires further specialized research in order to fully understand why the conflict happened in specific ways and how various institutions and individuals participated however through its research processes the commission has been able to identify some of the core causes of violence which are examined in detail in chapters 4 6 and 8 first the events of 1999 can not be understood in isolation from the longer period of conflict that occurred in east timor which displayed horizontal and vertical dynamics the nature of the violence that occurred in 1999 was shaped by previous patterns of conflict second the violence that occurred in east timor in 1999 also grew out of the unique political circumstances that were created by indonesias transition from an authoritarian to democratic state reformasi which began in 1998 on the issue of east timor the process of reformasi and democratization created new opportunity for indonesia to settle the issue in peaceful comprehensive and democratic manner as was also the longterm aspiration of the independence movement in east timor however there was effective mechanism for abandoning the previous repressive security enforcement strategies and replacing them with new methods of law enforcement in line with international human rights standards the pressures generated by the political impact of reformasi and by the prospect of popular consultation made it unlikely that the previous patterns of repressive security practices and policies could be easily reversed although orders were issued to prevent human rights violations in this complex transitional situation these orders were by themselves did not serve as an effective mechanism to prevent such violence from occurring further the rearrangement of the structures of authority particularly for the police visavis the military in 1999 meant that by the time of the popular referendum institutions had not yet had time to build the institutional capacity to exert independence within their new roles and authorities in the emerging democratic era third although in 1999 abri was intent on initiating internal reforms to transform itself by stages into professional military force with particular focus on the external defence function in early 1999 the political and social dynamics and security defence were still strongly influenced by the legacy of the past including the dwifungsi doctrine when abri was deeply involved in the social and political domains while simultaneously conducting internal military operations the combination of large military influence and weak control function in the form of the civilian administration implied low accountability in government policies and opened the way to perpetration of violence by involved institutionsx as result of this system specific political and legal culture evolved from the close ties between the security apparatus and the civilian government situation of active military operation in what was formally peacetime combined with weak rule of law made it difficult to hold authorities accountable for their actions one of the results of this lack of accountability was the creation of political culture which could not peacefully accommodate differences especially when those differences were openly expressed thus within this governing system in east timor threats intimidation and violence accompanied political differences without any certainty of legal consequences another area where the weaknesses in this structure of civilian governance was most apparent is the legacy of the sishankamrata system and its various interpretations which allowed paramilitary groups comprised of civilians to act as legal auxiliaries to the military and receive public funding in 1999 the existence of various civilian groups armed and nonarmed with close relations with various government agencies may be seen as spillovers of such past security arrangements that allowed overlap between the military and civilian government the consequence of this constellation of civil and military authorities and armed civilian groups was violence directed against civilians finally the institutional actions that led to violence in 1999 represent the culmination of the actions of those individuals taking part in the violence however determining individual responsibility is not the mandated task of this commission moreover individual perpetrators in the kind of organized politically motivated violence that took place in east timor in 1999 act in an institutional context as noted above the violence in 1999 was not random isolated or spontaneous its organized and coordinated nature indicates the way in which the acts of specific individuals must be seen in the larger institutional context in which they found themselves as the events of 1999 unfolded this context in turn forms the basis for an assessment of institutional responsibility conclusions about gross human rights violations and institutional responsibility part ii of the report analyzes the results of the document review chapter 5 and fact finding chapter 6 and concludes with combined analysis chapter 7 that provides the basis for specific factual findings as to gross human rights violations and institutional responsibility and the conclusions presented in chapter 8 through this analytical process the commission was able to provide the following answers to the two central questions mentioned above 1 the commission concluded that gross human rights violations in the form of crimes against humanity did occur in east timor in 1999 and that these violations included murder rape and other forms of sexual violence torture illegal detention and forcible transfer and deportation carried out against the civilian population 2 the commission concluded that there was institutional responsibility for these violations xv3 in regard to crimes committed in support of the proautonomy movement the commission concluded that proautonomy militia groups tni the indonesian civilian government and polri must all bear institutional responsibility for gross human rights violations targeted against civilians perceived as supporting the pro independence cause these crimes included murder rape and other forms of sexual violence torture illegal detention and forcible transfer and deportation 4 in regard to crimes committed in support of the proindependence movement the commission concluded that because of the lack of previous systematic judicial investigations of such violations the exact nature and extent of such violations could not be conclusively determined the commission also determined that it was nonetheless possible to conclude that proindependence groups were responsible for gross human rights violations in the form of illegal detentions that targeted civilians who were perceived as proautonomy supporters 5 the commission concluded that persistent patterns of organized institutional involvement in these gross human rights violations provide the basis for its conclusions about institutional responsibility it further concluded that because of the nature and scope of this involvement from moral and political perspective the respective states must accept state responsibility for the violations identified in the report as linked to their institutions how the commission arrived at these conclusions conclusions about gross human rights violations the commission received very large volume of documentary and live testimonial evidence that gross human rights violations occurred all of the four major bodies of documents examined in the document review agreed that gross human rights violatins were perpetrated in east timor in 1999 in chapters 57 the commission carefully analyzes all of this evidence and concludes that the evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that large number of attacks against civilian population of nature and scale to constitute gross human rights violations occurred in east timor 1999 the commissions next step was to identify who committed these gross human rights violations in the form of crimes against humanity and to determine how they were perpetrated in this regard the commission reviewed the evidence to ascertain patterns at the operational level at which the gross human rights violations were actually perpetrated the same standards to determine gross human rights violations were used for each event regardless of the identity or institutional affiliation of the perpetrator on the basis of its review of all of the evidence the commission identified specific cases of gross human rights violations and determined that there were in fact persistent patterns of organized systematic violations perpetrated by members or elements of proautonomy groups and indonesian governmental institutions these violations include murder torture rape and other forms of sexual violence forcible transfer and deportation and illegal detentions the commission also identified significant number of gross human rights violations in the form of illegal detention that appear highly likely to have been systematically perpetrated by proindependence groups xv on the basis of its analysis of these patterns of perpetration and organized systematic conduct chapters 57 and 83 the commission concluded that gross human rights violations were perpetrated by both sides directly or indirectly through material support planning encouragement etc including members of proautonomy militias tni polri and indonesian civilian government as well as members of proindependence groups although there is statistical basis for quantitative assessment the evidence analyzed in chapters 57 indicates that the great majority of reported violations were perpetrated against proindependence supporters b conclusions about institutional responsibility to find institutional responsibility the commission analyzed whether there was sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the patterns of widespread andor systematic violations manifested institutional involvement of sufficient scope and duration to justify conclusions of institutional responsibility on the part of several institutions that played role in the violence in 1999 the central question of institutional responsibility facing the commission was which organizations could be linked to these crimes sufficiently so as to justify conclusion that they bear institutional responsibility on the basis of its analysis the commission concluded that the evidence clearlyh proved that proautonomy militias were the primary direct perpetrators of gross human rights violations in east timor in 1999 the consistent patterns of direct perpetration by proautonomy militias in targeting proindependence supporters for violence that included murder systematic rape torture severe deprivation of physical liberty and deportation and forcible transfer were so clear that there could be doubt of their institutional responsibility for these crimes in analyzing the extent to which indonesian institutions also met the criteria for institutional responsibility the commission concluded that the evidence was sufficiently clear and abundant to justify such conclusions more specifically the commission found that tni personnel police and civilian authorities consistently and systematically cooperated with and supported the militias in number of significant ways that contributed to the perpetration of the crimes enumerated above the evidence also demonstrated that tni personnel sometimes directly participated in the operations that led to these crimes such participation included direct participation in the actual commission of the crimes by members of tni units and the direction of militia operations by tni officers who were present when the crimes were committed the commission found that the tni commanders in east timor controlled the supply distribution and use of weapons to militia groups and did so in an organized manner they also knew that these weapons would be used to further the proautonomy campaign and that gross human rights violations were occurring in the course of that campaign the tnis support for militias extended beyond the provision of weapons and included funding and other material resources the support of the tni also included planning and organization of joint operations that frequently included tni personnel and officers local tni headquarters were used as facilities for illegal detentions where severe forms of mistreatment of civilians including torture and sexual violence sometimes took place the commission xvfound that the patterns of coperpetration and support arose out of the structural interconnections between the tni and militia and other paramilitary groups that had developed over time the reliance of the tni on such armed civilian groups is structural weakness which is one of the sources of their institutional responsibility for human rights violations in 1999 the context in which the patterns of cooperation between militias and tni operated involves continuing practice going back to long before 1999 of collaboration between militias civilian defense groups and tni local garrisons whose membership often overlapped the patterns of cooperation involved not only planning and coperpetration in operations but also the provision of various kinds of material support developing out of the historical context of ongoing cooperation and close interrelations between these organizations in 1999 at the operational level these institutions all acted together in the pursuit of the common goal of defeating the proindependence movement the evidence showed unequivocally that these groups regularly employed violence to achieve their goals and that the violence resulted in the categories of gross human rights violations listed above their joint operations were often conducted under the direction of indonesian military or civilian authorities in other cases even where though indonesian officers or officials may not have planned or directed the operation the evidence shows that they knew of acquiesced in or approved of the operations civilian officials were on some occasions involved in the operations and in general provided material support for the militia groups that perpetrated them with knowledge that this support would lead to such violations when police were not involved in the operations themselves they were almost completely ineffective in preventing them and in providing security for the civilian population even after the may 5th agreement when it was their explicit responsibility to do so the commission also found that there was abundant evidence that showed the activities of militia groups were also supported by the civilian government in variety of ways the best documented of these forms of support is the systematic and sustained way in which the civilian government supplied funding to the militias even after they clearly were aware of gross human rights violations being perpetrated by these militia groups the commission concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the provision of funding and material support by military and governmental officials was an integral part of wellorganized and continuous cooperative relationship in the pursuit of common political goals aiming at promoting militia activities that would intimidate or prevent civilians from supporting the proindependence movement this forms one of the bases for concluding that the tni and civil government both have institutional responsibility for the gross human rights violations perpetrated against perceived proindependence supporters in 1999 the tnis domination of the civilian government as shown by the analysis of the larger context in chapter 4 reinforces the conclusion of institutional responsibility on its part viewed as whole the gross human rights violations committed against pro independence supporters in east timor in 1999 constitute an organized campaign of violence individuals from the militia police local civil administration and tni participated in various phases of this campaign of violence and political repression xvconducted against civilians they believed to be associated with the proindependence movement this campaign followed certain patterns often consisting of series of connected events involving intimidation threats and actual force in order to discourage support by the civilian population for the proindependence movement the campaign involved organized attacks on villages by militias and tni campaign of coordinated activity of this kind requires planning and logistical and financial support the commission concluded that the evidence demonstrated that tni and police personnel as well as civilian officials were at times involved in virtually every phase of these activities that resulted in gross human rights violations including murder rape torture illegal detention and other severe deprivations of physical liberty and forcible transfer and deportation this kind of sustained and coordinated activity involving many forms of support encouragement and co perpetration forms the basis forms the basis of the commissions conclusion that the tni polri and civilian government all bear institutional responsibility for these crimes the commission experienced greater difficulty in reaching definitive conclusions about institutional responsibility for gross human rights violations committed by proindependence groups on the one hand there is doubt that human rights violations including murder destruction of property and illegal detention were committed against civilian populations who opposed independence on the other hand because of the lack of systematic investigation by the scu and other bodies of the role of proindependence groups in the 1999 violence there is considerable difficulty analyzing the extent to which some of these crimes are part of larger context of organized violence as required for findings as to institutional responsibility because of this shortcoming and on account of its mandate to make findings as to the conclusive truth it is only in the case of illegal detentions where there is enough reliable evidence to conclude that there is institutional responsibility on the part of proindependence groups the commission also considered difficulty concerning the institutional responsibility of proautonomy militias and proindependence groups because of the achievement of independence by timor leste these groups longer exist for this reason conclusion about their institutional responsibility would have only symbolic value states have political and moral obligation to accept responsibility for gross human rights violations committed by groups to which they have an historical connection even when those institutions longer exist or have undergone significant transformation from forward looking perspective the commission concluded that the government of timorleste bears state responsibility for the illegal detentions constituting gross human rights violations that were perpetrated by proindependence groups this acceptance of state responsibility for these groups is not based on legal accountability but arises from the moral and political basis of institutional responsibility in regard to timorese proautonomy militias because of the commissions forward looking perspective in formulating its conclusions and the recommendations that are based upon them the commission concluded that indonesia also bears state xvresponsibility for those gross human rights violations that were committed by these militias with the support andor participation of indonesian institutions and their members iii the commissions recommendations the recommendations respond to the commissions mandate the lessons learned as well as to tangible problems that currently face each country as result of the violence in 1999 above all they are response to the needs of those whose lives were affected by the violence in 1999 the mandate authorizes the commission to make specific recommendations inter alia regarding amnesty and rehabilitation the mandate also asks the commission to make recommendations that include innovative ways to improve peopletopeople relationships in the two countries that are in congruence with local religious beliefs and customs and to solidify cooperative and reconciliatory processes at the state level in addressing these guidelines of its mandate the commission aimed to provide realistic and concrete recommendations that are inclusive forwardlooking based on principles of restorative justice and which would promote long term friendship reconciliation and the prevention of future conflicts and violence in addition in preparing its recommendations the commission took into account the institutional shortcomings and failures that it had identified chapters 48 as having contributed to the 1999 violence remedying systemic and institutional failures through institutional reform is necessary to prevent future reoccurences of violence and to ensure the foundation for peace and friendship between the two countries in fulfilling its mandate the commission followed two key principles in formulating recommendations the commission determined that in order to promote reconciliation recommendations must be inclusive and must not discriminate between parties particularly based on political affiliation the second principle informing the recommendation is that they all take the form of collective reparations requiring material and other forms of support from the relevant governments and institutions the commissions recommendations for urgent action may be summarized under several themes 1 recommendations focusing on accountability and institutional reform the commission does not recommend amnesty or rehabilitation for any persons key component of such institutional reforms is promoting culture of accountability in the instutitions whose responsibility it is to maintain peace and security and to prevent and punish violations of law and human rights based upon this principle and in accordance with its terms of reference and considerations of procedural justice the commission made recommendations for amnesty or rehabilitation of any individuals or groupsxx the commissions report identifies weak judicial institutions the lack of an effective committment to the rule of law and the lack of accountability in military and security forces as factors that contributed to the violence of 1999 on the basis of its reflections on these conclusions and the underlying events the commission recommended series of urgent institutional reform including 1 human rights training program focused specifically on the role of security forces and intelligence organizations in situations of political conflict mass demonstrations and civil unrest and emphasizing the obligation of the military and intelligence forces to remain neutral in political controversies and elections to refrain from using state resources in support of political parties or their goals and to operate solely within the limits of the law and under the direction of civilian leadership 2 human rights training program focused specifically on the role of particular civil institutions in planning for and working to prevent situations of civil and political conflict through mediation peaceful method sof conflict resolution and the inculcation of culture of understanding and toleration of political difference and

of its work the commission formally established on 11 august 2005 felt that it needed to interpret number of important elements in the terms of reference in order to achieve common understanding among the commissioners and in order establish more operational guideline for the commission to carry out its work in this section the commission will explain particular points that required interpretation and elaboration the commissions process will not lead to prosecution the commissions terms of reference stipulates that the ctf process will not lead to prosecution of individuals but instead and will

of the legal processes that have been held or are ongoing the commission also does not prejudice any legal processes pertaining to reported human rights violations in east timor in 1999 the definition of prejudice in this case is that the commissions work does not have any impact on any legal processes pertaining to reported gross human rights violations in east timor in 1999 the conclusive truth 3 pursuant to the terms of reference one of the goals of the commission is to establish the conclusive truth the commission determined that the term conclusive truth is not legal term in this regard conclusive truth is produced from findings based on review and analysis of all facts about the events background and the overall context of violence in 1999 this review and analysis encompasses the documents and evidence produced by the commission of inquiry on human rights violations in east timor in 1999 kpp ham the ad hoc human rights t ribunals in jakarta the special panel for serious crimesscu and the cavr in timorleste as well as those found during the fact finding process conducted by the commission the commissions understanding of the conclusive truth is consistent with its

terms of reference point 14c specify measures the commission may recommend to heal wounds of the past rehabilitate and restore human dignity point 14ci specifies that the commision may inter alia recommend amnesty for those involved in human rights violations who cooperate fully in revealing the truth regarding the clause about recommendations for amnesty the commission interprets this provision as providing an option that it can employ in the fulfillment of its mandate including for the purposes of promoting reconciliation and friendship in other words the amnesty clause in the terms of reference is not an obligation nor an absolute requirement the commission considers the two important issues stressed in the terms of reference in the point above are 1 the purpose of giving amnesty recommendations is related to the commissions goal of achieving reconciliation that is to heal wounds of the past and restore human dignity and 2 amnesty recommendations shall be considered only when the alleged perpetrators meet the criteria encompassed in the term full cooperation the commission determined in order to fulfill the criteria of full cooperation party must show willingness to come to public or closed hearing testify truthfully and fully about what the party personally heard knew and felt about gross human rights violations in east timor prior to and immediately after the popular consultation in east timor in 1999 testify truthfully about hisher involvement either directly or indirectly intentionally or unintentionally in the events in question express remorse about the violence that took place in general and specifically about those acts within hisher scope of responsibility expressions of remorse may include an apology assume forwardlooking stance to learn the lessons of the past and build friendship based on the spirit of reconciliation state commitment to not repeat similar acts in the future furthermore the commission considers that it can recommend amnesty only when the following criteria are met 1 the alleged perpetrator invited to public hearings meets the full cooperation standards above and 2 an amnesty recommendation will promote the goals of healing wounds of the past rehabilitating and restoring human dignity and contribute to reconciliation and 3 the amnesty provision will meet procedural justice requirements in that it is open to all relevant parties chapter ii mandate rehabilitation the terms of reference also provide for the commission to recommend rehabilitation measures for those wrongly accused of human rights violations the goal of rehabilitation in the terms of reference is to restore the reputation of those wrongly accused of committing human rights violations the aim of rehabilitation is to restore the dignity of the accused parties by clearing their names restoration of their previous positions if they were negatively affected as result of these accusations and their social status the term rehabilitation in the terms of reference is therefore not only limited to the legal context but also applies to social and political contexts this point encompasses two important matters namely 1 the goals of recommendations for rehabilitation are pertinent to reconciliation that is as way to heal wounds of the past and restore human dignity and 2 the basic criteria for rehabilitation is that the commision must prove that the accusations against the alleged perpetrator were unsubstantiated the commission considers that it can recommend rehabilitation only when 1 the underlying criteria for rehabilitation recommendation have been met and 2 the recommendation can support the objectives pertinent to the goal of reconciliation in other words the rehabilitation clause in the commissions terms of reference is not an obligation or an absolute requirement reconciliation point 12 of the terms of reference stipulates that the commission aims to establish the conclusive truth to further promoting reconciliation and friendship regarding reconciliation point 14ciii of the terms of reference stipulates that one aspect of the commissions mandate is to recommended ways to promote reconciliation between peoples based on customs and religious values as process reconciliation is an effort to reframe the present by combining an acknowledgment of past wrongdoing with visions or ideas for better future 5 the commission interprets reconciliation between the peoples of indonesia and timor leste as process that gives consideration to prevailing values in the two states point 13d of the terms of reference states that one of the working principles of the commission is further promoting friendship and cooperation between governments and peoples of the two countries and promoting intra and inter communal reconciliation to heal the wounds of the past point 14c of the terms of reference also articulates the need for appropriate measures to heal wounds of the past rehabilitate communities and individuals impacted by the violence and restore of human dignity with regard to these points the commission understands that reconciliation and healing wounds of the past are complementary and interdependent processes 5 john paul lederach building peace sustainable reconciliation in divided society washington usip 1997 26per memoriam ad spem the commission understands that the emphasis in the terms of reference points 13d and 14c encompasses all parties impacted by the violence that took place in east timor in 1999 even though the terms of reference do not explicitly refer to reparations because the commission works within general framework of restorative justice the commission will recommend restorative measures to overcome victims suffering to heal wounds of the past and to restore human dignity these measures do not fall within the legal context but are elements of restorative justice that are seen as necessary to promote reconciliation and friendship consistent with the commissions mandate to strengthen reconciliation and friendship these reparation measures shall be public and collective rather than individual in formulating reconciliation measures between the peoples of indonesia and timor leste regarding events in 1999 in east timor the following principles were followed principle of nondiscrimination b reconciliation although implemented among the peoples of the two nations needs to be supported by policies of the two governments both national and bilateral these government policies are needed as the basis for planning implementation and supervision of the reconciliation process c reconciliation needs to incorporate the lessons learned from the past based on the principle of honoring the independence sovereignty and history of the respective nations and the common history of the two nations this principle is also part of the process of healing wounds of the past friendship the commission considered the following points from the terms of reference in defining friendship 1 introduction to the terms of reference point 7 that the two governments are committed to resolve residual problems of the past and to deepen and expand bilateral relations both at the government and peopletopeople levels 2 terms of reference point 12 affirms that the establishment of conclusive truth about the violent events of 1999 is

reference it is affirmed that through this new and unique commission the two countries who share common history have agreed with courage and vision to look at the past as lesson and embrace the future with optimismchapter ii mandate lessons that can be learned are the conclusions reached by identifying and understanding specific mistakes or weaknesses in institutions or processes that allowed acts of violence to take place in east timor in 1999 learning lessons from the past is one way to begin to rectify past wrongs and to create change so similar events will not happen in the future either in indonesia or in timorleste the lessons learned touch upon multiple areas including systems of governance and law and social economic and cultural structures complexities of the 1999 transition period the introduction to point 5 of the terms of reference emphasizes that it is very important to understand the way in which political reforms in indonesia that were coming to peak in 1998 that had implications for the events in 1999 these implications arise because indonesia was undergoing complex and radical political transformation as the suharto regime was deposed and the new reformasi era began furthermore point 13b affirms that in the exercise of its mandate the ctf shall bear in mind the complexity of the transitional situation in 1999 aiming at further strengthening of reconciliation and friendship between the two countries and peoples the commission affirms that the conditions in indonesia in 1999 were still in critical transitional stage in overcoming the impact of the monetary and political crisis the transitional state of the government of indonesia is highly relevant to the decision to hold popular consultation in east timor and its implementation the transitional nature of indonesias polity is also highly relevant to the political and security excesses that were encompassed within the popular consultation process the commission has addressed the complexity of the transitional situation in various parts of its report with specific attention directed towards the topic in chapter 4 per memoriam ad spem chapter 3 mandate implementation the commisison began to implement its mandate on 11 august 2005 for period of one year this mandate was extended for one year according to the terms of reference on 10 august 2007 1 the commission then

countries for detailed explanation of the methods used for document review and fact finding see chapters 5 and 6 respectively for detailed explanation of the methods used to formulate recommendations

wounds of the past and promoting friendship and reconciliation chart of mandate implementation methodology of the commission appears in the appendices 32 conceptual framework standards of justice t wo standards of justice are relevant for confronting past human rights violations during transitional periods retributive justice and restorative justice retributive justice is based upon the idea that crimes create an imbalance in the social order that must be remedied by punishing the perpetrator of the crime the idea behind restorative justice on the other hand is that human rights violations may be remedied through comprehensively addressing the needs and relations of victims perpetrators and communities restorative justice in essence stresses systematic response to human rights violations through measures that contribute to healing the wounds of the victim the perpetrator and the community restorative justice thus aims to remedy the mental and physical harm suffered by victims and communities to reintegrate the perpetrator into the community and to restore damaged relationships through promoting deeper understanding and friendship the most important element of restorative justice is its prioritization of reconciliation rather than punishment 2 this spirit of reconciliation through restorative justice informs alternative mechanisms of conflict resolution and mediation and has also long been practiced in various systems of traditional justice found in many parts of the world the mandate of the commission excludes retributive justice and emphasizes restorative justice this is evident from its terms of reference especially its guiding principles in point 13 c stating that the commission is based on forward looking and reconciliatory approach and that its process will not lead to individual prosecutions but will focus on institutional responsibility point 13 also states that ctf does not prejudice ongoing legal processes in regard to the reported human rights violations in east timor in 1999 and also will not recommend the formation of new prosecutorial body 2 robert i rotberg and dennis thompson eds truth v justice the morality of truth commissions princeton princeton uni versity press 2000 79 per memoriam ad spem the emphasis on restorative justice is also evident in the terms of reference point 14 c which clearly stipulates that the commission is mandated to devise ways or recommend appropriate measures to heal old wounds and to rehabilitate and restore human dignity the commission understands these guidelines for recommendations to be based upon three principles that can promote restorative justice 1 recognition of full rights of individuals as citizens with dignity and honor as humans 2 civic trust that requires the restoration of peoples trust to the government legal system police and military and 3 social solidarity that demands an interest and willingness of the people to empathize with others and place themselves in the position of others 3 thus the governments of indonesia and timorleste have mandated the commission to promote restorative justice so as to strengthen friendship between the two nations and encourage reconciliation between divided communities in timor leste gross human rights violations the commission refers to the definition of human rights that has been universally accepted in the universal declaration of human rights udhr according to udhr article 1 human rights are inherent to every person all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights they are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in spirit of brotherhood respect for human rights is fundamental for the creation of more dignified and prosperous society based upon peace and security all human beings are entitled to the promotion fulfillment and protection of their human rights without discrimination on the basis of race sex language or religion the commission is of the view that violations of human rights cannot be tolerated violations of human rights can be committed both by state actors and nonstate actors this is consistent with article 1 6 of indonesian law 391999 regarding human rights 4 as well as untaet regulation 200110 regarding the formation of cavr 5 3 john rawls theory of justice the belknap press cambridge 2001 4798 4 article 1 6 law 391999 stipulates human rights violation is any act by person or group of individuals including the state apparatus either intentionally or not intentionally or any unlawful failure to undermine obstruct limit andor deprive the human rights of person or group of individuals as guaranteed by this law and failed to receive or there is concern that the person may fail to receive just and appropriate legal resolution based on applicable legal mechanisms from this statement it can be concluded that human rights violations can be committed by nonstate or state actors 5 untaet regulation 200110 article 1 c regarding the establishment of cavr contains the definition of human rights violation which includes violations by state or nonstate actors this understanding can be seen inter alia in section 3 objectives and functions of the commission in point 31 d where it is stated that the commissions goals include identifying practices and policies whether of state or nonstate actors which need to be addressed to prevent recurrences of human rights violations chapter iii mandate implementation the commission has considered previous accounts of human rights violations in east timor in 1999 all of these conclude that the violence in 1999 can best be categorized as crimes against humanity as defined in article 5 and article 7 of the rome statute 6 the commission has also studied the findings and conclusions from the ad hoc human rights t ribunal in jakarta cavr report and scuspsc and other documents based on these references the commission has decided to employ the conceptual framework of crimes against humanity as defined in the rome statute of the icc and the jurisprudence of the international tribunals in conducting its analysis of human rights violation that occurred in 1999 in east timor operational definition article 7 1 of the rome statute of the icc specifies that crimes against humanity include any one of series of specified offenses when committed as part of widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population with knowledge of the attack these specified offenses constituting crimes against humanity include 1 murder 2 extermination 3 deportation or forcible transfer of population 4 imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law 5 torture 6 rape sexual slavery enforced prostitution forced pregnancy enforced sterilization or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity 7 enforced disappearance of persons and 8 other inhumane acts of similar character intentionally causing great suffering or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health in carrying out its mandate to make findings on gross human rights violations the commission applies the definition of crimes against humanity in article 7 1 of the rome statuteicc based on article 7 1 of the rome statuteicc there are three requirements that constitute the chapeau elements of gross violations of human rights in the form of crimes against humanity namely an attack directed against any civilian population b the attack is committed in widespread or systematic manner c knowledge that the conduct of the accused is part of the attack according to article 7 2 the phrase attack directed against any civilian population means course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts referred to in paragraph 1 against any civilian population pursuant to or in furtherance of state or organizational policy to commit such attack 6 identical letters dated 31 january 2000 from the

widespread or systematic are disjunctive requirements 7 either one would be sufficient to prove the chapeau elements it is the widespread or systematic character of the attack as whole and not of the individual conduct of the accused that needs to be proven 8 in other words single act of murder torture or rape can constitute crime against humanity when the act is part of widespread or systematic attack against civilian population the term widespread refers to the character and scope of the attack and the number of people that were targeted whereas systematic refers to the character of the violence that is organized and the improbability that such violence occurred randomly 9 the pattern of crime in the sense of nonaccidental repetition of similar act of crime can serve as an indicator of systematic event to determine systematic character of an attack there is requirement of policy according to the jurisprudence of the icty and the ictr 10 factors that are indicative of systematic attack include geographic and temporal distribution and repetitive character of the way the attack was conducted b patterned activities c evidence of planning training and organization d commanders or leaders statement indicating purposive nature of an act of crime and how the act relates to the larger context of violence organized targeting with certain victim category for example name lists f organized logistical financial and ideological support the required mental element mens rea of crime against humanity is met if the perpetrator has the intention to commit the underlying offense of which he is accused and if he knows of the attack against civilian population and also knows that the underlying offense is part of the attack 11 concept implementation in order to reach finding about whether or not gross human rights violations took place in east timor in 1999 number of criteria or questions need to be met as elaborated in the operational definition about gross human rights violations above of the three requirements of the chapeau elements for gross human rights violations in the form of crimes against humanity two are of particular importance for fulfilling the commissions mandate namely 1 the attack is directed at civilian population and 2 the attack is widespread or systematic the mental element mens rea is primarily relevant for individual responsibility

ictr and icty appeals chamber has held that policy requirement does not exist under international customary law because the commission has focused its analysis on the operational level of the commission of gross human rights violations and because indonesia is not signatory to the rome t reaty the commission follows the definition adopted by the icty and ictr 11 icty kordic appeals 99 chapter iii mandate implementation to establish the element of an attack against civilian population three components need to be considered 1 attack 2 against 3 civilian population an attack does not require the use of armed force an attack can be understood as violence or mistreatment directed against civilian population the term against means that civilian population is the target of the attack and that it was not matter of civilians as victims of random acts the attack in such case was not indiscriminate but was directed against civilian population the definition of civilian population does not require the involvement of the entire population of country or region where the attack took place what is important to note is that the attack was not directed against limited number of randomly selected individuals but group of civilians whose number is sufficient to be called civilian population the element of widespread or systematic as stipulated in the operational definition section is disjunctive element if in the attack against civilian population either the widespread or systematic characteristics are established then this requirement is met in order to determine if an attack against civilian population can be categorized as widespread factors such as the extent of the attack the number of victims its geographic scope the multiplicity of incidents and its duration must be considered in order to ascertain whether the attack has been perpetrated systematically the factors that may be analyzed include 1 whether the attack was perpetrated in an organized manner or chaotically or randomly 2 whether there are underlying patterns or prior planning and 3 whether there is an explicit or implicit policy or an articulation of political or ideological goals linked to the attack to determine whether the attack has been done in an organized manner or chaotically and randomly factors to be considered include whether certain population group was targeted whether there was planning briefings orders or direction from officers or superiors whether the perpetrators received training equipment or logistical or financial support to determine if there was pattern in the attack or the violence that took place factors to be considered include whether there is an underlying similarity between the various incidents that took place or repetition of the types of attacks whether the various incidents constituting the attack all aimed to achieve certain ideological or political goals although the existence of policy is not required to establish the systematic element the presence of such policy can provide strong evidence about the systematic organized and planned character of the attack this policy may be official or unofficial written or unwritten formal or informal it may exist even though public official has ever stated that there is such policy the presence of such policy can be inferred from the facts of the case and particularly from the failure of officials to suppress violence against civilians carried out repeatedly and over an extended period of time the existence of policy can also be inferred from the degree of organizational support logistical or financial resources and coherence or consistent patterns manifested in the attack it can also be inferred from the statements remarks reports or memoranda from civil or military authorities0per memoriam ad spem institutional responsibility one of the most important working principles as specified in the terms of reference point 13 c is that based on the spirit of forward looking and reconciliatory approach the ctfs process will not lead to prosecution and will emphasize institutional responsibilities institutional responsibility is not concept derived from criminal law institutional responsibility is based upon the moral and political responsibility of states for the wrongdoing committed by individuals with sufficient connection to state institutions the criminal law only recognizes individual responsibility and pursues it through prosecution mindful of the commissions nonjudicial nature and its mandate the commission has limited its inquiry to institutional responsibility the commission understands that acceptance of state responsibility for gross human rights violations includes the following dimensions assuming moral and political responsibility for gross human rights violations vis avis the role and the authority inherent to the institution in question b healing wounds of the past to restore human honor and dignity c ensuring nonrecurrence of similar events in the future by the promotion and protection of human rights d continuing to promote reconciliation and friendship through series of recommendations by the commission to the two heads of state operational definition of institutional responsibility in implementing the commissions mandate the main idea behind institutional responsibility is that states must accept responsibility from the moral and political perspective for the gross human rights violations committed either directly or indirectly by state institutions or members of those institutions to establish institutional responsibility first requires finding that gross human rights violations occurred it must then be determined whether the connection between the perpetrators of these violations and state institutions is sufficient so as to ground finding of institutional responsibility such finding is based upon analysis of the factual circumstances according to criteria including the following 1 there was institutional participation inferred from the systematic and organized character of the operations resulting in gross violations of human rights that were carried out by its members or individuals or groups acting jointly with them or under their control the terms organized and systematic in this case refer to the definitions articulated above 2 there was institutional participation through the support encouragement planning organization or direction provided to the perpetrators of gross human rights violations even though those perpetrators may not have been members of the institutions responsible these forms of indirect participation must be substantial enough to justify finding of institutional responsibility factors to be chapter iii mandate implementation considered include the scope degree duration consistency and openness of such forms of indirect participation policies indicating such institutional participation may provide strong evidence indicating institutional responsibility and such policies may be inferred from the factual circumstances as described above 3 there is either explicit or implicit institutional approval of the violence this approval can be made implicitly when the violation committed by members of the institution has been reported to the institution but there was effective action taken by the institution to stop the act or prevent it from reoccurring b the violation was committed in wide scope over an extended period of time or systematically without effective actions taken by the institution to stop the action or prevent the action from continuing implementation of the concept of institutional responsibility to find institutional responsibility two questions need to be answered 1 at the operational level where the gross human rights violation occurred can coordinated pattern of activity of substantial temporal or geographic scope be inferred from the factual circumstances 2 at the operational level does the coordinated pattern of activity indicate which institutions took part in or contributed to the activity institutional participation can be seen in two forms namely the members of the institution participated directly or indirectly in the crimes b the institution provides regular and substantial support in terms of organization resources guidance training or planning to the perpetrator of the crime basically the answer to the first question can be found in applying the same criteria as used to establish the widespread or systematic element for crimes against humanity as articulated above all factors that determine widespread or systematic must first be reviewed to determine whether there was substantial evidence to support finding that there has been an organized and coordinated pattern of activity that demonstrates the involvement of certain institutions within certain timeframe this involvement can take either of the two forms described above 33 summary of commissions activities the commission began its work in august 2005 immediately after the inauguration of the commission members on 11 august 2005 in denpasar by the

social and political context the commissions mandate focuses on determining the nature of human rights violations in east timor in 1999 and on the corresponding institutional responsibility for those violations the mandate also tasks the commission with consideration of the context for these events chapter 4 addresses that context by briefly describing basic points of history and institutional structures most relevant to understanding the events of 1999 the commission does not intend that this presentation of the context represent complete history of the conflict indeed the events that occurred before 1999 are outside of the commissions mandate and not the subject of its research or factfinding rather the historical social and political factors discussed below were the most essential points of agreement in the commissions construction of framework for consideration of the issues to be the subject of its findings 41 19741999 historical background from 19751999 there was period of indonesian presence 1 in east timor which was supported by some who favored integration and opposed by others who desired independence the presence of these opposing political factions in east timor may be traced back to the differences in political asprirations dating to the beginning of the portuguese decolonization policy in 1974 1 the nature of the process by which east timor was integrated into indonesia has been the subject of controversy the two parties to the conflict have opposing intepretations of this process which it is difficult to reconcile it is not within the scope of the commissions mandate to make final determination of the legal status of the indonesian presence in east timorchapter iv historical social and political context 2 resolution ga15141960 had

conflict in east timor in 1999 15 november 1999 ctf archives in 1974 in the aftermath of the carnation revolution that deposed the former salazarist regime portugal enacted decolonization program for all its colonies based on the principle of selfdetermination 2 on 27 july 1975 portuguese law 71975 provided for holding an election in portuguese timor for peoples assembly in 1976 this peoples assembly would then form new government and portugal was to hand over its authority to new timorese state in october 1978 3 political party formation and internal conflict the decolonization process was greeted in portuguese timor by the formation of political parties each with its own aspirations the three most important political parties were união democrática timorense udt who wanted independence in stages through progressive autonomy under portugal frente revolucionária do timor leste independente fretilin who advocated immediate independence and associação popular democrática timor apodeti who desired an autonomous integration with the republic of indonesia smaller political parties were later established including klibur oan timor assuain kota and the partido trabalhista labor party in january 1975 udt and fretilin formed coalition based on the principle of independence rejection of integration with indonesia and the formation of transitional government consisting of representatives of both parties but this coalition failed to overcome the differences between the respective parties supporters and it broke apart in may the situation quickly deteriorated to the point that there was some open conflict between the supporters of both parties 4 on 11 august udt with the support of the portuguese timor police commander launched an armed movement and occupied number of government facilities and arrested and detained hundreds of fretilin leaders fretilin with support from timorese members of the colonial army launched counter attack against udt on 20 august 1975 with the attention of the central government of portugal focused elsewhere and in the face of deteriorating security situation on 26 august 1975 the governor of portuguese timor mário lemos pires moved to ataúro island with group of the remaining government officals in the aftermath of this armed conflict udt members sought refuge in indonesian territory in early september 1975 and fretilin remained in control of the territory the three other parties apodeti kota and t rabalhista followed udt in crossing the border they had with them thousands of people who entered atambua0per memoriam ad spem early indonesian contact with prointegration groups beginning in mid1974 indonesia initiated contact with east timorese pro integration supporters after the beginning of the armed conflict between udt and fretilin these contacts led to joint combat operations in east timor with members of apodeti and udt 5 from august through september 1975 there was period of horizontal conflict in east timor following october 1975 elements of vertical conflict increasingly emerged as the indonesian military became involved with timorese prointegration groups and established its presence in east timor future developments in east timor were also characterized by both horizontal and vertical dimensions to the conflict 6 declaration of independence by fretilin and integration declaration fretilin proclaimed unilateral declaration of independence on 28 november 1975 this declaration was not recognized by the portuguese government t wo days later four political parties udt apodeti kota and t rabalhista proclaimed their desire for integration of east timor into indonesia known as the balibo declaration portugal did not recognize both declarations because it still considered itself as the administering power and maintained that the problem of portuguese timor should be resolved through referendum involving all political parties 7 indonesias response indonesia officially stated that it did not hold any territorial ambitions over east timor and considered the socalled balibo declaration as the valid statement of popular political will the indonesian government regretted fretilins proclamation and stated it can appreciate the sympathies and profoundly understand the proclamation of udt apodeti kota and trabalhista parties who in the name of the people of portuguese timor declare integration into the state of the republic of indonesia 8 uns response the through the general assembly resolution 3153 of 1 december 1976 rejected integration and called for holding of an exercise of the right to self determination through internationally recognized means every year through 1981 the issued resolutions that affirmed the right of the people of east timor to selfdetermination in 1982 the general assembly requested the secretary general to initiate consultations with all relevant parties to achieve comprehensive resolution in all there were 10 resolutions

government pemerintah sementara timor timur pstt was formed consisting mostly of udt and apodeti organizers 10 the provisional government formed body called east timor popular assembly majelis rakyat timor timur mrtt consisting of individuals symbolically representing the people from all districts of east timor on 31 may 1976 the mrtt held meeting where they composed petition that was signed by arnaldo dos reis araújo as the head of pstt and guilherme gonçalves as the head of mrtt this petition requested that president soeharto officially include east timor as an indonesian province on 17 july president soeharto signed law 71976 which officially declared east timor as the 27th province of the republic of indonesia since this date the positive law of indonesia applied in east timor the governance of east timor 19761999 mindful of the fact that there was still resistance movement that did not accept indonesias presence in east timor indonesia resorted to several approaches in governing east timor the first was security approach through which the indonesian military actively conducted military operations against the resistance movement several members of the east timorese prointegration faction participated in these groups of civilian resistance wanra and t rained civilians ratih wanra and ratih were involved in military operations against the resistance movement some of these wanra and ratih groups formed at that time were also active during the conflict in 1999 and included halilintar tim alfa and tim saka from 1982 this security approach was formalized as part of the doctrine of the total defence and security system sishankamrata 11 the sishankamrata system was applied throughout indonesia at the time according to the perceived intensity of the threat based on indonesian law 201982 on basic provisions of national defense and security the second approach was welfarebased to win the hearts and minds of the east timorese by intensifying development projects in several sectors such as education and infrastructure 9 security council resolutions 384 1975 of 22 december 1975 and 389 1976 of 22 april 1976 general assembly resolutions 3485 of 12 december 1975

conscription per memoriam ad spem the security approach however was often the cause of excesses which resulted in civilian deaths and other human rights abuses the existence and strategies of indonesian institutions including the militiary in east timor strengthened the resolve of the proindependence supporters who continued their movement through various forms armed and unarmed until the vote for the popular referendum in 1999 the reforms and democratization taking place in indonesia and the end of the centralized government system of the new order were marked by the resignation of president soeharto in 1998 and by the decline of the authority of the security forces throughout indonesia meanwhile proindependence groups were able to conduct their activities more openly this phenomenon increased in solidity after the habibie administration offered east timor the special autonomy option in june 1998 the uncertainty of the government and the security forces in east timor about their authority and proper role at that time was not unique situation in the context of the reform era in indonesia similar situations of conflict were also occuring in ambon kalimantan and aceh

provinces of indonesia under law 51974 on principles of local administration as the juridical basis for local administrations in indonesia the province of east timor was governed by governor every district had head of district bupati under whom were number of subdistricts kecamatan led by camat the indonesian government formalized this structure all the way down to the rt neighborhood units

elected by the dprd regional secretary sekwilda the second most important executive position in the province was that of the regional secretary who was appointed as part of the civil service

sekwilda position except one was held by abri officers the peoples representative council the peoples representative council dpr was the legislative body operating at several tiers of the government structure throughout indonesia namely the central dpr provincial dprd tier i and district dprd tier ii levels the speaker of the dprd and the governor were vested with the highest powers at the

state development objectives at the village level spheres of governance as centralized governmental system the indonesian civil administration exercised formal control over various spheres of policy such as security economy public information education and culture however the inclusion of military officers within the civilian administraton in accordance with the dwifungsi system and the military presence in east timor allowed the interests of abri to dominate many policy structures and processes that operated at the local level 14 armindo soares mariano former speaker of dprd timortimur

position as an abri officer herman sedyonochapter iv historical social and political context civil administration dynamics the complexities of the civil administration system in east timor can be illustrated through several examples of the dynamics of governance in various governors administrations these examples will briefly show how the structures and systems described above functioned over time and how certain aspects of the conflict in 1999 are related to particular themes or problems of civil governance in earlier periods each governors administration demonstrates the governmental systems difficulties in meeting local needs while also satisfying the central governments and militarys policy interests the dynamics of the governors administrations also show the ways in which the civil government system lacked mechanisms to peacefully accommodate political differences which led to shifts in political alliances and increased tensions based on political identity over time finally the various administrations approaches to economic policy demonstrate the ways in which civil budgets could be dominated by security or military interests between 1976 and 1999 east timor was led by 4 different governors all of them east timorese the dynamics of the first two governors administrations reveal that the political system in east timor was not well equipped to deal with political difference the policies in general including economic development of the regional civil administration were planned and executed under the strong influence of the military and security policies of the central government deviations from or criticisms of the centralized view of policy objectives and strategies were not accepted by the government during these adminstrations the new order regime also politicized the civil government and this politicization was strongly evident in east timor where individuals with prointegration background were given preference this situation created opportunities for timorese involved in the civil administration to rethink their political loyalities from both sides namely the prointegration and the proindependence movement therefore when examining political alliances in 1999 one has to be careful to not assume that political loyalties remained constant throughout the period of the indonesian presence during the administration of the third governor president soeharto officially ended the period of regional closure which normalized the status of east timor and declared it open to the outside world although the militarys influence remained strong military control in east timor lessened the normalization of the territory and the civil administration provided the east timor independence movement with more opportunities to express its political aspirations through demonstrations however these more openly voiced aspirations of independence also to new conflicts including the unnecessary loss of life at the santa cruz cemetary on 12 november 1991 by 1999 with the approaching popular consultation the civil administration continued to be impacted significantly by security interests the dual function of abri had persisted and allowed for the civil administration including the office of the fourth and final governor to be strongly influenced by security considerations law 201982 governing the state defense and security system made provision for the concept of the total peoples defense and security system sishankamrata this system gave the civilian administrators role that in 1999 disposed them towards supporting security groups such as pam swakarsaper memoriam ad spem thus normalization of the civil government in 1992 did not introduce new mechanisms that were able to resolve the political problems and diferences which had confronted previous administrations the overlap between civil government and the security sector remained and became even more marked with regard to civilian security forces during the final governors administration 16 when opportunities emerged again for the lessening of the military presence and the open expression of political dissent in 1999 government structures and processes had not sufficiently changed to prevent violence an additional source of tension was the perception by some timorese that they were being excluded from full participation in governmental functions particularly senior positions in the civilian government by the end of 1998 and during 1999 the public service was politicized in such way over the issue of selfdetermination military structure in 1999 in 1999 the tni structure in east timor was organized in operational and territorial structures the territorial structure was the same as in other provinces of the unitary state of indonesia and it basically followed the form of the administrative governmental function because abri through its dwifungsi doctrine held the domestic security function while polri at the time was still part of abri based on this structure the province of east timor was included under the kodam ixudayana led by commanderinchief pangdam kodam ixudayana is located in bali and covers the provinces of bali nusa tenggara barat and nusa tenggara timur the highest territorial command at provincial level was the korem 164wiradharma headed by korem commander danrem 17 every district had military district command or kodim kodim 16271639 headed by kodim commander dandim every subdistrict had koramil headed by commander danramil in every village there was babinsa lead by sargeant t wo organic battalions were formed in east timor namely battalion 744 located in dili and battalion 745 located in lospalos 18 organic battalions means that both were under the direct command of the danrem in the case of battalions 744 and 745 their personnel were recruited from the timorese population the timorese personnel could be promoted to noncommissioned officers but most commissioned officers were nontimorese tni officers additionally there were also two strategic units outside the territorial line of command namely kostrad and kopassus the kostrad and kopassus strategic units were divided into two sectors 16 in accordance with indonesian law 201982 there were several auxiliary security groups some of which came under the military or police pamswakarsa was the security formation that fell under the civilian government 17 unlike other korems in indonesia korem 164wd tasks were not only limited to personnel and territorial development but was also conducting direct military operations this is evident from the fact that korem 164wd also oversaw two combat commands namely sector and sector b at times these two operational sectors would come under an operational command koops when it was considered that there was an intensive threat despite being under korem the commanders of these two sectors had the same rank as the commander of korem ie colonel in conducting military operations in east timor the two organic battalions were reinforced by other battalions coming from military commands outside east timor sektor and sektor b 18 battalions 744 and 745 were formed in january 1978 and september 1978 respectivelychapter iv historical social and political context namely sector comprising the eastern side of east timor and sector b comprising the western side both sectors were headed by colonel to support intelligence function at every level of the territorial structure the sgi or intelligence task force unit was formed and formally placed under the authority of the korem with posts throughout east timor although officially the sgi was under korem authority 19 this unit was controlled by kopassus officers who carried out the instructions of their original unit based in jakarta 20 the operational structure was formed according to regional needs in east timor the operational structure was consequence of the the military operations launched in response to the presence of falintil forces this structure could be doubled up by the lowest territorial structure at the korem level however it could also have new territorial structure as defence and security regional command kodahankam or operational command koopskam carrying the operational sector the operational structures function was to conduct and control military operations whereas the territorial structure in the form of territorial command functioned more in development function and mobilization of national resources to support the defence security effort in relation to this structure and as practical realization of the sishankamrata doctrine the territorial command also played the role of developing and organizing the peoples resistance wanra elements military operations were undertaken by deploying infantry battalions as the main players assisted by elements of kopassus units with tniad combat and administrative support these forms of assistance were also extended by the air force tniau and navy tnial the infantry battalions tasked at the time were composed of organic korem 164wiradharma east timor infantry battalions including battalions 744 and 745 and additional infantry battalions from military commands outside east timor in july 1998 under instructions from president habibie abris commander inchief ordered the withdrawal of combat troops deployed in east timor aceh and irian jaya the total withdrawal from east timor amounted to 1300 military personnel however shortly after new troops were sent to east timor which may have included rajawali vi troops from kostrad and the t ribuana viii task force from kopassus the dynamics of the military role in east timor throughout the new order the indonesian military embraced the doctrine of abri dwifungsi based on this doctrine abri carried out two functions respectively as security defence power and as social and political power as described above in the civil administration section the section below will briefly discuss the most relevant ways for 1999 in which the security apparatus carried out these two roles 19 see letter dated 28 may 1998 from the head of the intelligence section captain sarengat on behalf of the commander of the korem 164wd intelligence task force copy with ctf appendix to the expert advisors report to ctf 20 20 douglas kammen notes on the t ransformation of the east timor military

security role abris role in terms of undertaking its security defence function in 1999 was different from present conditions in 1999 the defense role was still united with the security function so that abris role was primarily understood as involving domestic security this interpretation of its role was reflected in the organization of the security apparatus which consisted of 1 functional department carrying out the security defense function and 2 polri as part of the abri structure these two security structures implemented the security defence functions in the following circumstances 1 the national defense function was unified with the internal security function 2 abri in this case the tni was the first and front element to respond to the whole spectrum of possible security disturbances 3 polri was tasked to act in practical supporting role almost indivisible from that of the tni 4 the law enforcement function as result was closely integrated into the military defense function in maintaining stability in the province of east timor the indonesian government considered at the time that there was an internal threat from the independence movement which was intent on separating itself from indonesia in the perception of the indonesian government since east timor officially became the 27th province of indonesia the armed resistance wing of fretilin stuggling for independence was separatist movement and as such it had to be completely destroyed therefore abri responded by conducting military operations in east timor after february 1979 when falintil defense bases fell abri refocused its military operations increasingly on control of the civilian population intelligence operations played an important role in these military operations and contributed to the creation of suspicion and division in timorese society in carrying out its defence and security duties in east timor in accordance to the doctrine of internal threats abri also conducted territorial development actions territorial development was intended to manage and develop the population to strengthen their unity and develop capacity to confront threats 21 territorial development was the responsibility of all levels of territorial commanders to cooperate with the local administration and the population 22 forms of territorial development were territorial operations planned to improve the physical and social infrastructure of east timor abri was involved in building roads schools hospitals government buildings agricultural infrastructure locals houses and places of worship

some of the armed civilian groups such as tim alfa and tim sera were also active proautonomy parties of the conflict in 1999 law 201982 had not been implemented fully in indonesia which at times created confusion and shifting roles amongst the various auxiliary security groups members of hansip were often used as combat support personnel role that is usually performed by wanra in other parts of indonesia the difference between hansip and wanra in east timor was not always clear this is because the military often used hansip in the capacity of wanra both played role that was essentially the same 26 social political role in addition to security defence role and in terms of its dual function abri also had social and political role the abri social political role was based on the concept of kekaryaan temporary dutycooption where an active abri officer was appointed to fill nondefence security positions 0per memoriam ad spem in addition to the provincial level abris involvement was carried out also at district levels where several abri middle officers became bupatis the role of the military commander was to become actively involved in the formulation of regional policies structurally standardized through the muspida just as was the case everywhere else in indonesia abri also placed representatives at the east timor provincial dprd and at the dprd of every district as noted above abri received seat allocation of 20 percent in the provincial dprd and district dprd by appointment the military also played prominent role in policy implementation bodies such as the tppp

internal reforms to transform itself by stages into professional military force with particular focus on the defence function in early 1999 the political and social dynamics and security defence orientation were still strongly influenced by the legacy of the past when abri was deeply involved in its dwifungsi doctrine this doctrine gave abri legal authorization to exist not only as defense and security force but also as social and political force weak control from the civilian government in the form of the legislature and the executive branch gave abri an umbrella for its role the result was an institutional structure with weak boundaries between the realms of the civilian and military authorities in these circumstances abri became deeply involved in the social and political domains while simultaneously conducting military operations this situation combined the reality of large military influence that should only exist in situation of military emergency and war with the weak control function of the civilian administration this combintion implied low accountability for government policies and opened the way to the perpetration of violence by involved institutionsper

organizations in the early days of the indonesian military presence in east timor fretilin frente revolucionário do timor leste independênte was the only pro independence political organization through its military wing falintil forças armadas libertação nacional timor leste fretilin conducted its armed resistance against the presence of indonesia in east timor after the death of the fretilin leader and falintil commander in chief in 1978 and other members of the leadership in 1981 xanana gusmão took over the fretilin leadership without stopping the armed resistance xanana started to intensify political and diplomatic resistance efforts and incorporate all other proindependence political groups in east timor this shift in leadership in 1981 also led to new strategy of guerrila warfare launched by small scattered units throughout the region without permanent base fretilin attempted to build united front by embracing parties outside fretilin on the common ground of independence the conselho revolucioário da resistência nasional crrn the national resistance revolutionary council was formed for that purpose and in 1988 it changed its name to become the conselho nacional da resistência maubere cnrm the maubere national resistance council by forming this united front the resistance was longer led by fretilin but by crrn first and then by cnrm with xanana gusmão at its head fretilin was only one of the elements within the cnrm to ensure the resistance was of nonparty nature and could include all east timorese in 1987 falintil broke its political party ties with fretilin and the supreme leader of falintil xanana gusmão left fretilin hence falintil with affiliation to any political party became the military wing of the cnrm during the meeting at peniche portugal in april 1998 all proindependence factions from east timor agreed to change cnrm to become cnrt conselho nacional da resistencia timorense the term maubere was replaced with timorense because of the objection of some nonfretilin elements mainly udt on the use of the term maubere identifying it with fretilin these structural changes in the organization of proindependence groups were also related to general change in their political strategy the resistance leaders reached the conclusion that independence could only be achieved through unsponsored referendum within the east timor was still classified as non selfgoverning country and as such it was maintained on its decolonization agenda the resistance leaders shifted their focus to the with the prime objective of sponsored

significant areas of diplomatic action was through the human rights commission the clandestine strategy depended on the activities of underground groups clandestines formed by civilians in rural and urban settings these groups operated independently from each other but were connected to falintil units and provided logistics and information support additionally clandestine groups were engaged in the political arena by organizing proindependence demonstrations and gathering information on the political situation and human rights violations in east timor in order to channel them to east timorese resistance organs outside indonesia during the 1980s an internal commission formed to coordinate clandestines actions as its role in the resistance movement became increasingly important 41

head of staff in the jungle of east timor given that the supreme commander was imprisoned in indonesia since the party secession with fretilin in 1987 falintil had been made up of people without official political party alignments the jurisdiction and supervisory commission was tasked with supervising the other three organs and as such it maintained an independent stance visàvis all three in

department of defence and security 51 all these changes had as their objective two essential reforms within the tni namely 1 to concentrate the tnis role on national defence and 2 to rescind the tnis

implications of the may 5th agreement in tasking polri as the party primarily responsible for upholding law and order in east timor in 1999 was that this was essentially the first major task where polri operated independently of the tni to ensure tnipolri neutrality on 15th june 1999 the commander in chief of tni issued written directive that stressed shift in the mission criteria for tnipolri units deployed in east timor the objective changed from finding and arresting the largest number of gpk in east timor to maintaining neutral posture and providing situation of security and safety 60 the stated goal of these missions was to ensure smooth peaceful and fair public consultation process without any pressure from any parties the aseessment team tasked to visit east timor to prepare the unamet mission addressed concerns about the capabilities of polri for maintaining security prior to the popular consultation in light of the fact that previously the tni had exercised the dominant security role 61 the assessment team reported that although there were positive assurances from polri regarding security nonetheless there were credible reports given to the that that the security personnel including police were not effectively handling the armed proauotnomy groups in east timor 62 the results of the popular consultation were announced on 4 september 1999 this announcement was brought foward from the initial plan to announce the results on 7 september 1999 on the 4 september 1999 the secretary general announced that 785 percent of the 450000 voters refused the offer of widespread autonomy 63 the door was opened for east timors independence following the announcement of the results of the popular consultation despite the directive of president habibie to tni and polri maintain law and order violence of an alarming intensity began 64 increasing international concern over this violence had been previously expressed by the secretary general kofi annan 65per

sjahnakri to major general peter cosgrove as the commander of the interfet forces on 27 september 1999 46 summary in the discussion above various historical social and political factors were highlighted that were most relevant to the development and dynamics of the events that occurred in east timor in 1999 and could be agreed on by both countries the reader is once again reminded that this chapter is not meant to convey final conclusions about the period of history prior to 1999 the focus of the commissions mandate is understanding the events of 1999 and their implications for institutional responsibility and to devise appropriate ways and recommendations for healing the wounds of the past and to secure human dignity through promoting reconciliation and friendship the historical and contextual points that the commission found most applicable to fulfilling their mandate can be summarized as follows decolonization process and political divisions the lack of an effective decolonization process from the period of portuguese rule to independence resulted in various types of political divisions in east timor different interpretations of the best strategies to achieve selfgovernance resulted in multiple internal political parties including fretilin udt and apodeti that were not able to resolve their differences through peaceful means an armed conflict occurred between timorese political parties meanwhile the indonesian military had initiated contact with the proindonesian sources within east timor the nature of the process by which east timor was integrated into indonesia has been the subject of controversy the two parties to the conflict have opposing intepretations of this process which it is difficult to reconcile it is not within the scope of the commissions mandate to make final determination of the legal status of the indonesian presence in east timor on 17 july 1976 the president of indonesia approved law 71976 that officially made this territory province of indonesia this integration was not acknowledged by the with ga resolution 3153 december 1976 the issue of east timor continued to be on the decolonization agenda until after the holding of popular consultation in august 1999 both the civil war in 1974 and the period of contested indonesian presence are related to these internal and external political differences and the incomplete decolonization process the impact of these political differences on the period encompassed in the commissions mandate is connected to an enduring and complex situation of conflict in east timor vertical conflict existed due to the organized struggle for independence which included military actions taken by falintil and indonesian security forces which viewed the independence movement as threat to national chapter iv historical social and political context unity and security disturbance there were also remaining aspects of horizontal conflict between groups with different political aspirations within east timor both the horizontal and the vertical conflicts could not be accommodated in the political system of indonesia at that time so as to resolve the political problems by peaceful means and to avoid violence in fact the structure of the governmental system which allowed strong military control over civilian administration and which privileged proautonomy leaders exacerbated both the horizontal and vertical conflicts systems of governance in east timor 19751999 the structures and organization of the indonesian government in east timor in 1999 contributed to the conditions that produced various acts of violence in east timor in 1999 particularly due to the influence of the military and to the authoritarian nature of the government the centralized structure of the indonesian government during the new order era had become an effective mechanism for supporting the security apparatus in its effort to implement the indonesian governments security policies this structure immediately became liability when the authoritarian and centralized government structure had to be changed into democratic and transparent one after the fall of the suharto regime furthermore based on indonesian law no201982 on basic provisions of national defense and security the armed forces including the national police had the authority to conduct security related functions with wide ranging authority to manage and employ national resources one implication of these powers was that the civilian government could also play role in the pembinaan development of various nonmilitary organizations in security and defense functions the civilian governments role in security included working with auxilliary military groups such as pengamanan swakarsa or pamswakarsa in the context of 1999 this led to the involvement of the civilian government in the support of armed militia groups through the organizational mechanism of pam swakarsa both the military and police institutions in east timor historically also had ties to groups such as ratih and wanra under the sishankamrata system the existence of various preintergration civilian armed and nonarmed groups in east timor in 1999 including militias with close relations with various government agencies may be seen as spillover of such past arrangements until 1999 the civil law enforcement agency polri was also subordinate to the defense and security policies of the military and state in april 1999 the police underwent process of reform that allowed greater independence from the military apparatus however the police still remained under the ultimate authority of the department of security and defense the restructuring of the police institution may have resulted in lack of confidence in the institution due to the previous structure of polri as part of abri thus in all aspects of governance in east timor from 1975 until 1999 defense and security were the primary objectives every institution within the government was dominated by the militarys primary function in achieving these objectives based per memoriam ad spem on the indonesian states view of the conflict the conduct of military operations against the independence movement inside east timor took place outside of the legal and constitutional framework of military employment in peacetime these military operations took place in the context of what was popularly known as the military operations zone dom these factors made military operations in east timor different than in other parts of indonesia conversely the coordinated struggle for independence also affected all aspects of governance in east timor the clandestine movement which was able to infiltrate all organs of the government in east timor and the fact that there were some figures who worked for both political camps at times affected administration and allocation of resources to help the struggle for independence the armed struggle for independence relied on doctrine of guerilla warfare which also required the support of civilian resources and logistics in other words both the sishankamrata system of abri and the independence movements strategy of guerilla warfare depended on the use of the resources of civilians this situation placed civilians in vulnerable position so that they could become subjects fought over by either of the two parties to the conflict and become targets for manipulation by political power holders political transition in 1999 the condition of political transition in indonesia reformasi had practical implications on all aspects of national and state life and governance especially those pertaining to the situation in east timor this democratization process in indonesia in 1999 paved the way for the appearance of various popular aspirations and the weakening of state authority throughout indonesia in east timor this situation allowed the independence movement to progress further and to expand its political strategies including the implementation of the popular consultation the rise of reformasi also corresponded to growing awareness about human rights issues indonesian institutions experienced increased pressure to uphold human rights and to abandon repressive mechanisms that were previously used by the security apparatus particularly in east timor political changes in indonesia allowed the independence movement in east timor to operate more openly to demand referendum and independence the independence movement organization that previously operated underground came out and was present down to villages here and there there were clashes between civilian groups from the independence movement with proautonomy militias whereas falintil that was the armed wing of the independence movement went into cantonment the rapid pace of reformasi however may not have allowed sufficient time to build capacity and competence in new human rights approach to security issues so that by the time of the popular consultation the security forces could effectively fulfill their obligations there was not an effective mechanism for abandoning repressive security enforcement strategies that were previously allowed in indonesia and replacing them with new methods of law enforcement this period of transition between approaches and attitudes towards security enforcement may have led to ambiguity at the operational level in east timor in 1999 and prevented security forces members from responding to violence appropriatelychapter iv historical social and political context furthermore the structural security sector reforms that occurred as part of the political transition in indonesia further weakened the capacity of the security forces to fulfill their role in providing security to the civilian population the rearrangement of the structures of authority particularly for the police vis vis the military in 1999 meant that by the time of the popular referendum institutions had not yet had time to build the institutional capacity to exert independence within their new roles and authorities in the emerging reformasi era implications of the 5th may 1999 agreement the relatively short time span between the signing of the 5 may 1999 agreement and the holding of the popular consultation on 30 august 1999 may have caused rush in planning and preparation for the referendum there may have not been adequate time to put in place sufficient physical infrastructure furthermore there was not enough time to make effective political and sociocultural preparations among the populace because polarized political and armed groups were part of the social environment at the local level in east timor before may 1999 more time may have been needed to adequately incorporate each groups concerns in the referendum and disarmament processes greater time commitment to such initiatives could have helped prevent perceptions by proautonomy groups of mistreatment or bias which resulted in violent responses throughout the referendum process giving the security responsibility for the popular consultation process to the government of indonesia was an extremely risky measure giving over security arrangements to indonesian security forces who were wellknown to be closely tied to prointegration armed and unarmed timorese groups as part of the sishankamrata system was very likely to lead to conflicts of interest although the may 5th agreement and its related modalities required the neutrality of the security forces given the historical precedents and organizational structures of the security forces this was difficult and unrealistic assignment of duties in summary the violence that occurred in east timor occurred in complicated political economic and social environment there was single cause of the violence and there was not one single actor responsible in the following chapters the commission will turn to examining the types of violations that occurred and what implications contextual factors may have had on both the patterns of violations and on institutional responsibility per memoriam ad spem chapter 5 document review analysis of evidence of previous trials and reports 51 the document review process the mandate of the commission provides for review of four bodies of documents in reference to the determination of the conclusive truth concerning gross human rights violations and institutional responsibility the kpp ham report the twelve east timor trials before the jakarta ad hoc human rights court the cavr final report and the serious crimes process in east timor special panels for serious crimesserious crimes unit these four categories encompass the following bodies of documents that were reviewed 1 kpp ham kpp ham report kpp ham databases of documents and testimony 2 jakarta ad hoc human rights court process t rial documents and final judgments from the twelve east timor cases investigation dossiers baps of the indonesian attorney generals office for the twelve east timor cases and documents attached to the baps 3 cavr cavr final report 1 cavr community profiles 4 serious crimes process special panels for serious crimes indictments and judgments for trials involving charges of crimes against humanity serious crimes unit files including the socalled wiranto case file 1 the report by prof geoffrey robinson popularly referred to as the robinson report was also included in the document review because it was adopted by the cavr as an annex to their final report and played an influential role in the formula tion of their reports analysischapter v document review analysis of evidence of previous trials and reports methodology the commission conducted its own review of these documents but also obtained the assistance of independent experts in this task an international research team under the supervision of the commissions expert advisor prepared two lengthy reports analyzing the four bodies of documents the second report took the form of an addendum to the first because its mandate was to within the same analytical framework address some issues that had not been researched in the first report these reports are included in the appendices to this report 2 each of these four bodies of documents was evaluated by means of the following questions what conclusions do they each reach regarding the occurrence of gross human rights violations or crimes against humanity in east timor in 1999 what conclusions do they each reach regarding institutional responsibility for those crimes are those conclusions supported by the evidence they had available to them what are the strengths and weaknesses of each of the four bodies of documents what are the common conclusions regarding gross human rights violations and institutional responsibility that were reached on the basis of the evidence contained in these four bodies of documents to answer these questions the commission adopted an analytical framework for the evaluation of evidence and conclusions pertaining to the occurrence of gross human rights violations in the form of crimes against humanity and to institutional responsibility for such violations that did occur following the decision of the commission this framework was derived from international humanitarian law as reflected in the statutes and jurisprudence of the international criminal court icc the international criminal t ribunal for the former yugoslavia the international criminal t ribunal for rwanda and in the guidelines elements of crimes gross human rights violations and command responsibility of the supreme court of the republic of indonesia according to this analytical framework gross human rights violation in the form of crime against humanity may be found to have occurred when credible evidence compellingly demonstrates the existence of the following elements these elements are based upon the chapeau elements required for proving case of crimes against humanity 3 for each of these elements there are analytical questions that may be asked to guide weighing the evidence to determine whether the element is met the answers to these questions provide indications on the basis of which conclusions may be reached the framework is constituted of the following 2 these two reports by the expert advisor are cited in chapters 5 and 6 as report to the ctf and addendum to report to the ctf 3 chapeau elements refers to the elements that must be proven in all crimes against humanity cases in addition to the specific elements of the individual crimes against humanity enumerated offenses such as murder torture or persecution proof of the chapeau elements requires establishing that the specific crime against humanity acts of murder torture rape etc was committed as part of widespread or systematic attack against civilian population and that the perpetrator was aware of the connection of his or her individual act to that larger context of violence0per memoriam ad spem 1 an attack against civilian population occurred such an attack may be found to have taken place when evidence shows that there were substantial number of civilians who were victims of coercion violence or criminal conduct the violence however must have been sufficient to qualify as an attack against civilian population in order to establish this it must first be shown that there was an attack an attack for purposes of this element may be defined as course of conduct involving the commission of acts of violence for purposes of crimes against humanity the attack may consist of any mistreatment of the civilian population an attack does not require the use of armed force an attack does not have to include or coincide with an armed conflict that is an attack may be found to have occurred when there were incidents involving violence against or mistreatment of civilians for example campaign by government that attempted to deter the members of an opposition party from voting particular way and used coercive or violent tactics such as threats to communities and families illegal detention and mistreatment or torture of leaders or their supporters or relatives retaliation in the form of destruction of crops or houses forced disappearances and so on would be sufficient to constitute an attack against civilian population even though it did not take the form of military attack and did not include the entire population of the country or region 2 in order to meet the criteria for gross human rights violations and crimes against humanity however the attack must be directed against civilians that is were civilians the primary object of the attack in order to determine whether civilians were the primary object of the attack the following kinds of evidence must be analyzed and weighed in reaching conclusion i were the civilians only accidental or incidental victims ii did the violence occur during military operation aimed at enemy armed forces or at gathering or community primarily containing civilians iii what were the means and methods used in the attack for example did it involve an attack on military base using heavy weapons and infantry assault tactics or was it roadblock sweeping operation search of civilian houses forcible removal of persons from their homes etc iv what was the status of the victims for example were they armed combatants unarmed combatants prisoners of war civilians women and children v what was the number of victims in each category were the victims primarily civilians or armed combatants vi was the attack discriminatory that is was it just directed at random individuals or did it target specific groups because of their political affiliation or their ethnic or religious identity who were the targets and what was the aim of attacking them vii what kinds of crimes were committed during the course of the operations or activities constituting the attack for example were these the kinds of crimes that are typical of purely military operations directed against military opponents eg massacre of prisoners of war or were these the kinds of crimes that are associated with the victimization of chapter v document review analysis of evidence of previous trials and reports civilians eg sexual violence forcible transfer illegal detention torture forced disappearance etc viii did the victims use armed force to resist the attacks 3 in order for an attack directed against civilians to qualify as encompassing gross human rights violations or crimes against humanity the attack cannot be directed solely against individual civilians but against civilian population the term civilian population does not mean the entire population of the country or territory where the attack occurs there is minimum number necessary rather than quantitative test the decisive issues are whether the attack was aimed at few limited randomly selected individuals or group of civilians sufficient to be civilian population for example single incident of drunken soldiers who randomly shoot some civilians from their vehicle would not meet this test or the targeted assassination of small number of political opponents would not meet the test it is also important to note that the presence of members of armed groups within civilian population does not deprive that population of its civilian character if the population includes some armed members of resistance groups or combatants who have laid down their arms it is still civilian population if the group attacked comprises large majority of soldiers on duty and not on leave with much smaller number of civilians among them this might not be civilian population in analyzing the four bodies of documents reviewed the basic method used to evaluate evidence and conclusions on this element was to determine if there is credible evidence of mistreatment or the use of force or violence against substantial numbers of civilians or on the other hand does the evidence indicate that the violence was 1 directed merely against few isolated civilian individuals or 2 directed primarily against legitimate military opponents but few civilians were killed in random isolated incidents 4 if the evidence is sufficient to establish that an attack directed against civilian population occurred it is necessary to also find that the attack was either widespread or systematic the term widespread encompasses the quantitative dimensions scope and character of the attack the term systematic involves primarily qualitative aspects of the attack in analyzing the evidence in the four bodies of documents on this point the basic question asked was whether the alleged attack involved small number of random isolated unrelated individual acts of violence or either 1 multiple related acts of violence or mistreatment of civilians or 2 violence that indicates organization planning coordination or patterned activity if either of these characteristics is present then the element of widespread or systematic is satisfied in analyzing the evidence and conclusions on the widespread characteristics of the violence the commission analyzed and weighed the evidence on the following kinds of issues i were there largescale attacks or acts of violence mistreatment or coercion ii were the incidents small in number and in scale iii how many victims were targeted iv how many incidents of mistreatment were thereper memoriam ad spem v was the violence confined to one locale or did it occur in various places vi what was the duration of the violent activity vii was there relation between the perpetrators of different acts of violence eg political affiliation membership in the same or related organizations personnel of the same armed forces in analyzing the evidence on these questions if the number of incidents and their scale are very small then the attack was not widespread on the other hand if there were multiple incidents of mistreatment or violence against civilians or if only few incidents occurred but they were of significant scale large numbers of perpetrators and targeted civilians then the elements of widespread would be fulfilled in analyzing the evidence and conclusions in the four bodies of documents on the systematic quality of the violence the commission considered whether the violence was conducted in an organized manner or was spontaneous random or chaotic in this analysis of the systematic element the evidence on the following kinds of issues were examined i were specific population groups geographical areas or victims targeted ii did the perpetrators attack anyone they encountered or specific individuals or groups iii was there any planning briefings orders or disciplined leadership had the perpetrators received training was there chain of command did the perpetrators have ranks and were they respected does there appear to have been any thought behind how to carry out the operation iv did perpetrators act in military style units or in random groups how many perpetrators were there v what logistical support did the perpetrators receive did they obtain arms uniforms transportation ammunition petrol food or financial support how and from whom vi did the violence take the form of military or security operation for example were there roadblocks lists of names sweeps or search operations what tactics were employed who led the operation did the perpetrators wear uniforms and follow orders vii were victims transported from one place to another how and by whom viii were government officials or military officers present when the acts of violence were committed ix were victims detained by whom for how long where how were they released x what were the kinds of crimes committed were there any patterns in the commission of the violence the question of whether there was pattern underlying the attacks or incidents of violence was important not just for the systematic quality of the attack but also in the commissions judgment for establishing whether there was institutional responsibility the commission defined pattern in this context as nonaccidental repetition of similar criminal conduct on regular basis in evaluating the existence of patterns the commission evaluated the evidence on the following kinds of issueschapter v document review analysis of evidence of previous trials and reports i were there similarities between different incidents of violence ii was there repetition of certain kinds of operations or kinds of mistreatment iii did the incidents occur over prolonged period of time or in single day or week iv do the incidents all appear to be the result of accidental circumstances do the victims appear to be randomly chosen as in the wrong place at the wrong time v do the incidents appear to be related by political ideology or political goals vi were there any statements by civilian military or political leaders or by leaders officials or commanders at the local operational level indicating that conduct was purposive in nature for analyzing the systematic quality of an attack it is important to note that there is not requirement that there be governmental policy the jurisprudence of the international tribunals is unanimous and conclusive on this point although it is not required that such policy be established if such policy exists this may provide good evidence of the planned organized and hence systematic nature of an attack such policy may be official or unofficial written or unwritten formal or informal the existence of such policy may be inferred from the kind of organization resources and coherence manifested in the attacks as well as from the utterances reports or memoranda of civilian or military officials in other words it is not necessary for finding of the systematic nature of an attack to establish that there is policy as noted above the commissions method in reviewing the four bodies of documents was following the mandate to inquire first as to the evidence and conclusions about whether or not gross human rights violations occurred next the commission considered the evidence and conclusions in the four bodies of documents related to institutional responsibility for such violations since institutional responsibility is not legal doctrine but is based upon political moral and ethical factors the basis of the inquiry was to apply an analytical framework for evaluating evidence that identified institutions that from political and moral perspective should be seen as bearing responsibility for the violence perpetrated against civilians in east timor in 1999 it is also the case that because institutional responsibility is not legal doctrine most of the bodies of documents do not directly address this issue as principle basis for their findings instead most of them are judicial or quasijudicial documents focused upon individual responsibility in such cases the method employed in the analysis was to first identify and evaluate conclusions that did focus upon institutional responsibility second where there were such direct conclusions the analysis focused upon the evidence contained in the documents that was relevant to findings that could be made concerning institutional responsibility as noted above institutional responsibility is not based upon formal legal elements as is the case with gross human rights violations the commissions analysis of institutional responsibility was accordingly based upon two central analytical questions in order to support findings of institutional responsibility analysis of the available evidence in the four bodies of documents would have to address two central questions both of these questions would have to be answered affirmatively to support finding of institutional responsibilityper memoriam ad spem 1 at the operational level at which the crimes against humanity were actually perpetrated does the evidence indicate patterns of coordinated activity over time and in multiple locations 2 do those patterns of coordinated activity reveal which institutions participated in enabling those activities to occur that participation can take two forms institutions whose members or personnel participated directly in perpetration of these crimes b institutions that provided regular and substantial support organization resources direction training or planning for the perpetrators of these crimes in essence the answer to the first question builds upon the same criteria used to make finding on the element of widespread and systematic discussed above that is all of the factors for both the widespread and systematic characteristics of the crimes must be reviewed to determine if there is substantial evidence that supports finding that there were organized and coordinated patterns of activity that reveal the involvement of specific institutions in the perpetration of crimes over the period of time under question that involvement may take either form described in point 2 in the preceding paragraph if there is only evidence to show institutional involvement in few incidents but not consistently over time and in different areas then there may be insufficient evidence to establish institutional responsibility if however there are persistent patterns of institutional involvement that are found in most or many of the types of crimes that occurred across east timor during 1999 then there would be strong case for findings of institutional responsibility access to documents and limitations the commission was able to review very large body of documents it received cooperation from komnas ham the office of the attorney general of indonesia the prosecutor general of timor leste and the cavr the commission with the assistance of its expert advisor and his research teams in dili and jakarta conducted an indepth analysis of these documents this analysis of the documents obtained from these four sources and contained in the two reports of the expert advisor 4 constitutes the basis for the analysis in this section of the commissions final report chapter 5 the analysis of such large body of documents however was inevitably limited by considerations of time resources and access all of the documents from the twelve jakarta trials were examined while the cavr report was fully analyzed in regard to the events of 1999 access was not granted to the actual witness statements on which the report is largely based due to the nature of cavrs confidentiality and access policies however the commission was allowed to access collection of community profiles at the cavr archives these community profiles consist of brief village histories as narrated by residents of each village which recount major human rights violations from 19741999 this collection includes histories from over 300 villages from every district and subdistrict of timor leste in regard to the serious crimes process because of the size of the archive it was not possible to examine all of the files and documents in the custody of the prosecutor general of timor leste 4 report to the ctfapril 2008 and addendum to report to the ctf november 2008chapter v document review analysis of evidence of previous trials and reports because of limitations of time staff and technical resources the following parts of the archive were prioritized judgments and indictments from the spsc trials involving charges of crimes against humanity the socalled wiranto case file that contains the evidence against the high ranking indonesian indictees the scu investigative files the audiovisual evidence compiled by the scu in vhs format 5 in addition to these materials the ctf also requested large number of documents from the tni apart from very small number 25 that were provided at late date this request for documents was not complied with and the commission had access to the tni documents requested 6 further the commission did not receive access to the collection of interfet documents which are now mostly located in australia 7 finally access was also not possible to the documents regarding the 1999 violence which are held by yayasan hak though some of these documents did become available at very late date there is doubt that access to these additional documents would have contributed significantly to the commissions efforts to establish the conclusive truth particularly in regard to tni daily reports and telegrams from field commanders in the districts of east timor the commission was nonetheless successful in obtaining very large body of evidence of sufficient quantity and quality to make it possible to reach solidly based findings the scope and depth of the analysis provided to the commission in the two reports of the expert advisor together comprising more than 600 pages of text and several hundred pages of appendices as well as extensive document indices indicates the significant extent of the documents that the commission succeeded in accessing overview following the mandate of the commission the two central questions for the document review focused on gross human rights violations and that of institutional responsibility in regard to the former the analysis of the evidence for and conclusions about gross human rights violations in the four documents is more straightforward because all of the documents reach the conclusion that gross human rights violationscrimes against humanity occurred for this reason it was not necessary to compare and explain different conclusions reached on this issue by different bodies in regard to institutional responsibility on the other hand the various bodies of documents approach the issue of responsibility in different ways that is some of them as noted above focus their conclusions on individual rather than institutional responsibility this is natural because the trials and prosecutions scuspsc ad hoc court necessarily aim at establishing individual criminal accountability while the investigative reports kpp ham cavr go beyond this and explicitly address 5 the document research conducted as part of this phase of research adhered to strict confidentiality and access guidelines in order to insure the integrity of the judicial process and the protection of witness identities all access and reporting of information gathered from the scu was monitored closely and carefully by both the research team and the office of the prosecutor general of timor leste so that neither witness nor perpetrator identities that were not already part of the public record could appear in any information reported to the commission investigative files were subject to special guidelines for access to protect confidentialitythe research team also conducted survey of database of documents relevant to 1999 that are housed at the museum of resistance in timor leste the documents at this museum are all accessible to the public but can only be viewed within the confines of the museum 6 for example the commission requested all of the daily and weekly reports from the various tni commanders in east timor from january to october 1999 only handful of these reports were provided by the tni to the commission 7 some of the documents seized by interfet are available at the scu archives but the commission received information that sizeable collection of other documents held by interfet remains in australiaper memoriam ad spem larger institutional dimensions some of the trial judgments do make explicit findings on institutional responsibility but many do not the document review evaluated not just the conclusions about institutional responsibility but also examined in great detail the findings and evidence on which such conclusions are based the analysis and conclusions in this summary of the process of document review are supported by the two extensive reports prepared by the commissions expert advisor and his research team these reports contain very detailed analysis of the evidence and conclusions in the four bodies of documents they also contain extensive appendices which provide further documentation and complete document index containing all of the evidence referenced in the reports these two reports will be attached as appendices to this report and may be consulted as representing the full basis of the document review the analysis of the four bodies of documents was made easier by the fact that there is fairly broad agreement between the conclusions of most of them on certain issues as noted above they all conclude that gross human rights violations occurred in 1999 secondly they for the most part agree that there was institutional responsibility for the violence in east timor in 1999 more specifically they all agree that east timorese prointegration militias bear responsibility for much of the violence that occurred in 1999 their conclusions on the whole also point to joint responsibility of timorese militias and indonesian institutions but there is variance among the different accounts as to which institutions were involved to what extent in what manner and at what levels the main exception is represented by the ad hoc court in jakarta where some of the judgments conclude that there was institutional responsibility of indonesian institutions and others do not the differences about the scope and level of institutional responsibility are due to several factors and it will be useful as preliminary matter to review these the most important of these differences arises from the difference in perspective between different bodies of documents the kpp ham report focused on responsibility from the bottom to the very highest level while the bap dossiers which formed the basis of the ad hoc trials are limited only to 18 specific individuals who were the subject of criminal investigation this was much smaller number of individuals than considered in the kpp ham report and recommended there for further investigation and prosecution the trials of these 18 individuals before the jakarta human rights court failed to consider much of the evidence uncovered by kpp ham and great deal of the evidence contained in the baps was also not introduced into evidence the east timor trials held in dili on the other hand dealt exclusively with low level perpetrators because these were the only individuals in custody many of the special panels for serious crimes spsc final judgments refer to extensive evidence that points to the direct and indirect involvement of indonesian individuals and institutions in the crimes charged but that evidence is often not fully explored or made the subject of specific findings because the indonesian defendants were not before the court the scu archive contains case files for indictments of highranking indonesian military officers these case files contain great deal of relevant evidence but that evidence was never tested in judicial proceedings the investigative files of the scu contain even more evidence that points to the systematic involvement of indonesian chapter v document review analysis of evidence of previous trials and reports military security and governmental institutions in the violence because many of these cases were not brought to indictment or to trial this evidence has never come before the court or the public some of these cases contain much better and more extensive evidence of indonesian involvement than do the spsc cases that were tried this evidence points to the systematic connections between the indonesian military security and governmental actors and the timorese militias indeed the evidence often shows the way in which at the operational level these groups all acted together following common goals often under the direction of indonesian officials they show how militia operations followed various operational patterns including some actions carried out by proautonomy militia without direct tni involvement but also number of operations at the instigation or orders of indonesian officers and joint operations carried out by tni or kopassus personnel together with militia members in many cases they also show how some militia members were also in the tni sometimes making the two organizations indistinguishable at the operational level evidence also reveals how militia members might wear tni uniforms or parts of uniforms while carrying out operations these cases did not come to trial because they were not prioritized by the scu in general the scu cases that did come to trial did not focus on tni involvement this was not priority of the prosecution since the defendants were not tni and was not deemed relevant by the judges who focused on the guilt or innocence of those who appeared before the court it is one of the weaknesses of the spsc judgments that they neglect the issue of indonesian involvement and often do not make specific factual findings on the evidence relevant to these issues it was hence necessary to look beyond the trial judgments to the evidence contained in the case files of indicted and nonindicted cases further weakness of the scu process was the lack of sufficient attention to crimes other than murder as well as crimes committed against pro autonomy individuals or groups in other words the focus of each body of documents determines and limits the nature of the conclusions reached both groups of trial documents east timor and jakarta are weak on establishing the details of the general context in which the violence occurred and the larger patterns of activity of which it was part both are also very incomplete as to crimes perpetrated by proindependence groups the scu case files contain massive amounts of evidence that could have been used to establish the context and the patterns of violence in 1999 the prosecutors and judges however with very few exceptions did not develop or analyze this evidence but relied instead upon the mere introduction into evidence of various human rights reports on the other hand kpp ham and cavr through the robinson report do provide an overall account of the violence and develop an institutional interpretation of its causes and of who was responsible this is consistent with their interpretation of their mandate the judges and prosecutors of the special panels serious crimes unit indonesian attorney generals office and jakarta ad hoc court proceeded differently they interpreted their mandate as considering the accountability of individuals not of institutions this is only natural in criminal trial as result however they tended to ignore the general context of the violence and focus narrowly upon the role of specific individuals in the specific incident involved in the case for this reason in order to assess conclusions and evidence as to institutional responsibility in these documents this section of chapter 5 examines specific findings and evidence on factual issues relevant to institutional questions per memoriam ad spem 52 the commission of inquiry for human rights violations in east timor kpp ham timtim kpp ham was mandated to complete the following tasks 8 gathering facts data and information on gross human rights violations committed in east timor after january 1999 until the issuance of the decree of the peoples consultative assembly that legalized the result of the popular consultation by focusing on gross human rights violations such as genocide massacre torture enforced displacement crimes against women and children and scorched earth policy to inquire into the involvement of state institutions and international actors in the gross human rights violations to formulate the results of the inquiry as the basis for further investigation and prosecution before the ad hoc human right court it should be noted that this mandate encompassed elements of both institutional and individual responsibility that is kpp ham was tasked with investigating the involvement of state institutions and also making specific findings that could serve as the basis for criminal prosecution of individuals in order to implement this mandate the kpp ham investigation included taking statements from victims summoning witnesses and parties allegedly to have been involved in the incidents collecting evidence on the allegations of violations examining the crime scenes and other buildings relevant to the investigation conducting exhumations of mass graves collecting documents and analyzing the facts kpp ham was given only three months to execute its mandate 9 this was an extremely short time frame in which to undertake such broad investigation encompassing wide spectrum of potential crimes committed over period of eleven months and in variety of locales despite this time limitation very extensive investigation was in fact accomplished including repeated visits to exhumation sites and evidence gathering in various parts of east and west timor it was unavoidable however that these time constraints would place limitations both on the amount of evidence that could be gathered and the amount of time in which it could be sorted classified and analyzed for purposes of the kpp ham report these limitations made themselves felt in the investigation of some of the specific offenses which the commission was mandated to cover including extermination torture forced displacement persecution murder and scorched earth policy and genderbased crimes it would have been impossible for even much larger investigative body with much greater resources in such short time to fully investigate all of these crimes individually and inquire as well into institutional and individual responsibility for their perpetration the result was that not all the elements of each of these crimes were subjected to complete investigation and analysis for example in regard to genderbased crimes kpp ham was assisted by the indonesian national commission for the prevention of violence against women komnas perempuan 8 komnas ham laporan akhir komisi penyelidik pelanggaran ham di timor timur kpp ham 2000 4 9 ibid 4 8chapter v document review analysis of evidence of previous trials and reports but the evidence presented by the komnas perempuan was largely second hand evidence derived primarily from data already collected by ngos or other individuals without an independent investigatory or verification process thus the evidence collected by kpp ham through komnas perempuan on these crimes was not as fully substantiated as was the case with other crimes where kpp ham itself collected significant numbers of victim testimonies and statements of alleged perpetrators 10 another limitation of the kpp ham report involved their decision not to inquire into the responsibility of other parties allegedly responsible for crimes occurring in east timor other than those related to the government of indonesia or indonesian army the kpp ham report does mention several incidents involving alleged attack against indonesian army or goi personnel or prointegration mass however these crimes were not fully investigated 11 one can speculate as to the reasons for this focus but whatever the reasons the fact is that the results of the kpp ham report were limited to recommendations for investigation and prosecution of members of indonesian military and governmental institutions and to prointegration timorese militia leaders as noted above the kpp ham mandate broadly encompasses individual criminal responsibility and the responsibility of institutions in regard to individual responsibility however there are many modes or forms of liability through which individuals can be held accountable for crimes against humanity or other serious violations of international law these include different forms of commission of crimes from direct perpetration to ordering inciting planning aiding and abetting and so on it also encompasses the theory of liability widely used in international prosecutions known as joint criminal enterprise which is considered form of committing crimes giving rise to individual responsibility in addition international criminal law provides for command responsibility superior responsibility under the icty and ictr statutes encompassing both civilian and military leaders this form of responsibility arises from the failure of military or civilian superior to prevent his or her subordinates from committing crimes or from failing to punish them afterwards 12 10 ibid 35 overall kpp ham interviewed 123 witnesses conducted 9 field visits including several crime scenes in east timor the kpp ham also opened secretariat in ntt to support its field work such as to prepare witnesses to be interviewed to prepare the exhumation of mass grave in alas village etc 11 ibid 27 see also the statement of adam damiri for kpp ham investigation 28 statement of yayat sudrajat for kpp ham investigation 71518 40

kpp ham investigation 33 55 statement of kiki sjahnakri in kpp ham investigation 6 testimony of timbul silaen in kpp ham investigation 13 testimony of glen kairupan kpp ham report 9 12 under the icc statute military commanders are held to higher standard than civilian superiors military commanders are accountable when they either knew or under the circumstances should have known that their subordinates were committing or were about to commit crimes the civilian superior on the other hand is only accountable when they knew or consciously disregarded information that clearly indicated that subordinates were committing or were about to commit crimes the icty and ictr statutes do not distinguish between military and civilian superiors and apply to both the standard that they may be held accountable when they knew or had reason to know that their subordinates were committing or were about to commit crimes for all three statutes the failure to prevent or punish after the superior is in the possession of such knowledge gives rise to their criminal responsibility0per memoriam ad spem when the kpp ham report makes its recommendations as to individuals who should be investigated by the attorney general for potential prosecution the recommendations did not provide an analysis or specific findings as to the form or responsibility for each of the persons named for example for general adam damiri kpp ham only stated that he was involved in supporting militia activities and did not prevent and punish tni members involved with militias these allegations are quite general and do not specify for example the nature of the support he was alleged to have provided as the basis presumably of charge of aiding and abetting as to failure to prevent or punish the report also does not specify which specific subordinates this applies to what specific offenses they committed or whether or not they were his subordinates as defined in international law 13 such questions were not addressed sufficiently by kpp ham and the vagueness as to the specific forms and factual basis of individual responsibility was even worse at the ad hoc court where the indictments and the prosecution largely limited themselves to vague allegations of failure to prevent or punish although the kpp ham report was not as detailed as might have been hoped in regard to specific forms and bases of individual responsibility there are other areas where it was much more thorough than the ad hoc trials or the trials before the special panels in dili most significantly the kpp ham report does address in depth the overall context of the crimes against humanity it finds to have been committed in east timor one of the greatest shortcomings of the ad hoc court process was the way in which the prosecution and most of the judgments treated each incident as isolated and discrete rather than as part of widepread or systematic attack against civilian population as required to establish case of crimes against humanity the kpp ham report on the other hand analyzes overarching patterns of violations and the institutional connections underlying these patterns for this reason the kpp ham report was repeatedly used by the serious crimes unit prosecution teams to establish the chapeau or contextual elements of crimes against humanity in the trials in dili in fact the kpp ham report was accepted into evidence in all of the crimes against humanity cases before the special panels and in many of these cases the judges made specific findings on the chapeau elements on the basis of the kpp ham report the kpp ham report thus does provide substantial evidentiary basis for its findings as to the nature and scope of the 1999 violence while these findings do involve investigation of various specific cases kpp ham moved beyond those cases to analyze in considerable detail the common patterns of conduct manifested in the different occurrences it is the analysis of these common patterns that forms the basis for the kpp ham reports conclusions about institutional responsibility this must be seen as one of the most important strengths of the report the following section considers the methodology on which such conclusions are based 13 to have been hisher subordinates for purposes of command responsibility the perpetrators would have to be shown to have been under hisher effective control to establish effective control the evidence must show that the commander in fact had the power facto not jure to prevent or punish the perpetratorschapter v document review analysis of evidence of previous trials and reports the process of inquiry as explained in the report the kpp ham inquiry process was initiated by gathering secondary and tertiary information from printed and electronic media as well as reports issued by institutions organizations and individuals on violations of human rights in the period of januaryoctober 1999 the information was then analyzed and verified through its own investigation which included the examination of physical documentary and forensic evidence exhumations of mass graves crime scene visits interviews and statement taking in the short period of its mandate kpp ham conducted nine field investigations in east timor three of these involved exhumations in nusa tenggara timur to exhume the bodies of victims of alleged mass murder in suai covalima kpp ham also took direct testimony from 123 individuals their statements were taken in dili suai liquiça maliana maubara kupang atambua and jakarta these witnesses included victims civilian officials military officers and prointegration militia members and leaders kpp ham also gathered extensive evidence in the form of documents decrees issued by the civilian government and the military transcription of radio conversations mass media coverage of the incidents as well as reports from other institutions in addition to its report kpp ham compiled all of its evidence and witness testimony into various documentary databases which served as appendices documenting and supporting the report these databases are quite extensive and cover catalogues of physical evidence and document index with more than 1000 entries these sources of evidence serve as the basis of the commissions analysis and consequently its conclusions findings as to gross human right violations in the form of crimes against humanity kpp ham concluded that crimes against humanity had occurred in east timor 1999 this conclusion was based upon findings of specific patterns in the various incidences of violence that the commission examined these patterns involved the identity of the perpetrators and victims the systematic nature of the methods of support and perpetration of the criminal conduct the extensive geographical and temporal range of the violence and the numbers of victims of the violence kpp ham analyzed these events occurring prior to and after the popular consultation and classified them by identifying certain types of crimes 1 murder kpp ham concluded that murder and attempted murder had occurred they also concluded that those murders were based on political motivations or other discriminatory grounds and that these murders were extrajudicial in several cases of the cases they examined the murders occurred in civilian residence churches refugee centers and in military or police headquarters an example of the latter category involved their conclusion that murder had taken place in the military district command headquarters in lautém on 11 september 1999 kpp ham found that the victims were first detained by team alfa militia on 7 september 1999 and taken there because they were suspected to be proindependence per memoriam ad spem 2 torture and persecution the kpp ham report does not specifically delineate the elements of torture and persecution and thus does not clearly distinguish the definitions of these crimes this confusion also occurred to an even greater extent at the ad hoc court kpp ham did conclude that various instances of both torture and persecution had been perpetrated against civilians for example for refusing to join pro integration militias or as acts of terror following the popular consultation the lack of analytical clarity as to the legal elements defining these two crimes is one of the weaknesses of this aspect of the report under international law torture and persecution are distinct crimes with completely distinct elements the reason for some of the confusion here and at the ad hoc court arises from the fact that crimes such as torture rape inhumane acts and so on may also constitute the crime against humanity of persecution if they are carried out with an intent to discriminate on the basis of religion ethnicity race or political affiliation thus someone may be convicted for example of both torture as crimes against humanity and persecution as crime against humanity on the basis of the same conduct the crimes however are distinct and must both be established on the basis of their respective elements 3 enforced disappearances kpp ham concluded that forced disappearances were perpetrated in the period after the announcement of the two options they found that the evidence indicated that these forced disappearances were committed by prointegration militia groups they also found that in some of these instances the militias were assisted by members of the indonesian security apparatus the disappearances sometimes took the form of abduction or sometimes of extrajudicial arrest and in some cases were followed by summary execution in other cases the fate of the victim remained unknown in terms of geographical spread kpp ham found that such disappearances occurred in several regions including dili bobonaro and liquiça 4 gender based violence as noted above kpp ham did not conduct its own systematic investigation of gender based violence it relied on the report prepared by komnas perempuan on that basis kpp ham concluded that gender based crimes included persecution sexual harassment in public by militias and tni forcing underage girls into sexual servitude for militias enforced prostitution and rape the weakness in regard to these conclusions has to do with the methodology on which the findings were based because kpp ham did not conduct its own investigation and because of the nature of the komnas perempuan report there was process of verification and crosschecking to support the allegations of these various kinds of sexual violence the kpp ham and komnas perempuan reports do provide specific and detailed examples of sexual violence from the various categories mentioned above it must be acknowledged however that these incidents did not then receive the same kind of investigation and corroboration as was the case with some other categories of crime such as murder as result while the allegations of these various forms of sexual violence need to be taken very seriously and while much of the testimony appears to be credible and uncontradicted the conclusions by kpp ham are not as fully substantiated as is the case in other areaschapter v document review analysis of evidence of previous trials and reports 5 forced displacement the kpp ham report finds that there were different motivations at work in the movement of population alleged to involve forced displacement they conclude that the evidence indicates that while some individuals migrated voluntarily some were moved through practices of forced displacement the report is careful in its analysis noting that the evidence is only preliminary in number of instances they find that forced movement occurred in two phases before and after the popular consultation they conclude that before the popular consultation thousands of refugees moved into suai town suai kota approximately 6000 people liquiça approximately 3000 people and dili approximately 1000 people they also find that the evidence indicates that many of these individuals were forced to move by the methods employed by prointegration militias these methods involved attacking their villages and burning their houses and farms many of these displaced persons they conclude collectively sought refuge in places such as the suai church the liquiça church and the house of manuel carascalao in dili after the popular consultation kpp ham identified six mass displacements in dili baucau and lautém to regions in eastern nusa tenggara ntt they found that the pattern of displacement in these instances involved militia attacks against villages whereby people were driven to leave their homes they were then herded into vehicles provided by the indonesian security forces and were later transferred to ntt the reports conclusions are based upon an analysis of the patterns of forced displacement in these two periods the commission based these findings on the analysis of considerable amount of evidence but acknowledged that this evidence was in many ways preliminary because of the scope of the transfers their broad geographical distribution and the number of potential victims much fuller investigation with much greater resources would have been required to reach firm conclusions as to the complete picture of displacements it is strength of the kpp ham approach however that they did not attempt to reach global conclusions but rather focused on specific incidents of forced displacement for which they were able to collect evidence it was the patterns in these relatively well documented incidents that grounds their conclusion that while some individuals left voluntarily others were forced to do so these crimes were analyzed in the kpp ham report as crimes against humanity the report builds upon its findings of patterns broad temporal and geographical scope and so on to conclude that the evidence provided sufficient indications that they fulfilled the elements of crimes against humanity enumerated by the report as widespread systematic attack against civilian population and perpetrated by parties with common identity more specifically kpp ham following standard international norms interpreted the massive and widespread nature of the crimes as represented by the extensive area where the crimes occurred and the large number of victims the report aims to document this element by focusing on 14 main cases occurring prior to and post popular consultation namely 14 14 op cit komnas ham 92149per memoriam ad spem the attack on the liquiça church 56 april 1999 b killings in cailaco bobonaro 12 april 1999 c the attack on manuel soares gama 12 april1999 d executions of civilians in bobonaro district 13 april 1999 the attack on manuel

by the mobile brigade g the attack on the dili diocese on 4 5 september 1999 h the attack on the residence of archbishop belo on 6 september 1999 i arson of residences in maliana on 4 september 1999 j the attack on the suai church on 6 september 1999 k the murder in polres maliana on 8 september 1999 l the murder of sander thoenes on 21 september 1999 m the murder of clergy in lospalos on 25 september 1999 n gender based violence 15 consisting of on 16 september 1999 in ainaro two women were brought to west timor and forced to live together with commander of mahidi in ntt 30 women were rumored to be detained in refugees in the area of raihenek kobalima subdistrict belu district ntt and were subjected to sexual violence by militias on june 6 1999 23 women were detained by bmp militias near gugleur maubara sub district liquiça district and the victims were forced to cook and wash for the militias and were subjected to sexual violence cases of gender based violence especially rape as reported by the thematic special rapporteur on 8 december 1999 while the documentation for few of these cases is less substantial than others for example the 30 women who were reported to have been detained in raihenek for many of the others kpp ham possessed substantial amounts of evidence uncovered in its investigation in terms of the quantitative dimension necessary to establish the element of widespread attack this number of cases if proven at trial would be sufficient to support finding that this element was fulfilled as to the systematic element it should be emphasized that to establish this chapeau element of crimes against humanity either widespread or systematic would suffice both are not required kpp ham however analyzed both elements and concluded that the systematic quality of the violence against civilians could be established on the basis of the patterns or modus operandi by which the alleged crimes were committed they especially focused on the planning of operations where the militias were involved with the police or tni in the jurisprudence of the international tribunals planning provides strong evidence of the systematic nature of the attacks so if the analysis of the evidence for these findings of planning is correct this would provide legitimate basis for such conclusion kpp ham focused its analysis on the involvement of state actors in the crimes that occurred this appears to be based on its view that gross human rights violations are the responsibility of the state and 15 ibid 144149 these were adopted directly from the national commission on the violence against women komnas perempuanchapter v document review analysis of evidence of previous trials and reports its institutions 16 thus to significant degree it focused its analysis of the systematic element of crimes against humanity on the involvement of state institutions thus it comprehensively examined the role of civilian and military actors of indonesian institutions in various incidences of violence that it found to indicate the existence of pattern of conduct aimed at winning the popular consultation and defending east timor as part of indonesia for example using analysis of witness testimony and other evidence kpp ham elaborated upon the role of the civilian government in supporting the militias by providing financing from official budgets they documented these findings for militia groups such as aitarak in dili they also analyzed evidence which they concluded indicated the active and passive involvement of tni officers and other officials in carrying out series of field operations they also pointed to other indications of the involvement of tni personnel in the perpetration of the violence kpp ham concluded that statements by highranking tni officers indicated an implicit acknowledgement and awareness of this involvement for example they relied upon statements that the soldiers were bearing psychological burden in regard to preventing the violence since they had connected together with the militias over long period of time 17 or to take another example they found that corroboration in the statement that the perpetrators were those who were disappointed with the result of the popular consultation 18 the kpp ham reports conclusions show the violence was implemented systematically in manner which can indicatee the existence of an implicit policy 19 their central point in their conclusions was that violence occurred as result of systematic patterns of conduct rather than merely spontaneous acts they documented this systematic quality through analysis of evidence that showed patterns and concomitant relation of the tni and the prointegration militias table 1 appended at the end of this section summarizes some of the evidence that kpp ham relied on in reaching this conclusion while kpp ham collected substantial amounts of evidence related to organization support and planning the evidence could have been analyzed in much greater detail in their report this applies for example to the details of funding of the militias and pam swakarsa or to the specifics of the kinds of firearms provided to militias their provenance the system for distributing and collecting them etc in reaching its conclusions as to institutional responsibility kpp ham thus relied upon the systematic nature of the violence and the associated patterns of cooperation between the military and militias in carrying out field operations their report concluded that the tni was involved in the training organization recruitment and operational direction of the militias 20 in the analysis to support the existence of these patterns kpp ham also evaluated the identity of the victims they found that the 16 ibid 57 17 tni brochures t uduhan dan temuan pelanggaran hukum tatatertib dan ham pasca jajak pendapat di timortimur published by puspen tni undated 18 t ranscript of wirantos examination by kpp ham 8 and 13 19 komnas ham op cit 3839 152 158159 20 report to the ctf part i chapter ii1 section iiiaiiid per memoriam ad spem evidence indicated that the victims were for the most part targeted because of their political identity particular groups that they found were identified as targets included school students university students and cnrt activists as well as the general group of those who supported independence without any formal political affiliation this analysis did not seek to differentiate among the different kinds of members of this general category 21 meanwhile the profile of the perpetrator is the party with conflicting interests to the victims namely pro integration militia that is supported or received officials support as elaborated in the table above they also reached conclusions about the systematic quality of the crimes by analyzing the patterns in the way in which crimes such as forcible transfer were perpetrated for example the report refers to evidence that they find shows how the alleged victims are first transferred to the local military or police offices or headquarters under the supervision of military officials militia and the police the supervision is ongoing until the refugees are relocated in the refugee camps located in west timor in analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the methodology and findings of the kpp ham report it is important to recall the function that it was intended to serve kpp ham was mandated to initiate the process of investigation and prosecution not to complete it that is kpp ham was not supposed to conduct an investigation sufficient to establish the legal guilt of individuals accused of crimes it was rather supposed to determine if there was enough evidence to suggest that gross human rights violations occurred and if so make recommendations as to who should be subject to further investigation and prosecution by office of the attorney general that is the standard of proof to support its recommendations would be lower than that to support verdict of guilty in the courtroom that is the establishment of the conclusive truth as to accountability for the violence was left to the ad hoc court what kpp ham aimed to do was to collect and analyze evidence sufficient to justify conclusion that the process should move forward from this perspective it appears that for the mandate of the commission on t ruth and friendship the kpp ham findings on the widespread and systematic nature of the violence the patterns of conduct through which it was perpetrated and the responsibility of state institutions are the most relevant and important as has been indicated above it is in regard to these areas that the evidence and analysis of the report are strongest the documentation and analysis of the roles and responsibility of particular individuals is less thorough but the reasons for this were noted above and in any event these conclusions are outside the scope of the mandate of the commission on t ruth and friendship while it is the case that the analysis of the evidence for some of the categories of crimes is less substantial than for some others the strength of the kpp hams conclusions are greatest in documenting that gross human rights violations did occur and that there was sufficient involvement of state institutions to suggest institutional responsibility 21 in this part kpp ham did not further analyze the profile of the victims from other testimonies for example linda pribadi marcal 20 and report letters in regard to the attack it seems that the perception of their particular political affiliation as pro independence victims have made them target the distinction between perceived and actual affiliation was not considered further by kpp hamchapter v document review analysis of evidence of previous trials and reports in regard to the strengths and weaknesses of the methodology it seems clear that the principle weakness was result of the limited time afforded by the mandate that is the methodology of investigation was very strong and it encompassed remarkable amount of investigative activity in very short timeframe the method extended to all of the various kinds of available evidence and to the comprehensive assembling of that evidence in various databases because of the very large size of this body of evidence it was perhaps inevitable that the kpp ham final report would not given limitations of time be able to analyze or refer to all of it the report instead relies on the support of the evidentiary database without always citing precisely all of the evidence that supports particular statements further limitation apparently produced by the commissions understanding of its mandate was too largely exclude from their investigation crimes committed by proindependence groups in sum for purposes of the document review of the commission for t ruth and friendship the threads of kpp hams conclusions that are most significant and sufficiently supported by evidence and analysis are its general conclusions that gross human rights violations in the form of crimes against humanity occurred in east timor in 1999 and that there are strong indications of institutional responsibility for those violations the conclusions as to institutional responsibility were supported by various kinds of evidence including the patterns of perpetration the patterns of cooperation between the indonesian institutions and timorese militias the provision of support for militias and other factors discussed above pattern

investigation initiated on the basis of the acceptance of the kpp ham report by the attorney general it should be noted however that the scope of the investigations undertaken by the attorney generals office was narrower in scope than the kpp ham investigation in important respects first although kpp ham recommended further investigation and prosecution for 22 persons the prosecutions before the ad hoc court only encompassed 18 of these individuals in 12 cases further none of the highest level tni commanders named in the kpp ham report were included in the investigations on which the trials were based thirdly the scope of crimes and modes of responsibility considered in the baps are much narrower encompassing murder assault and destruction of property overall only five major occurrences were explored in the attorney generals investigation 23 1 the attack against the liquiça church complex and the residence of fr rafael 6 april 1999 24 2 the attack against manuel carrascalãos residence 17

narrower it is unfortunate that when kpp ham forwarded its report to the attorney generals office prosecutors did not make use of the extensive databases included with the report on cdrom this failure to use or evaluate the evidence assembled by kpp ham was said to have occurred because prosecutors did not know how to operate the database software in regard to the two central questions to be addressed in the document review the investigative dossiers provide clear answer in regard to the issue of the commission of gross human rights violations and somewhat more ambiguous response to the question of institutional responsibility in regard to gross human rights violations all the dossiers agree that gross human rights violations occurred in east timor in 1999 indeed this is the foundation of the criminal prosecutions for crimes against humanity for which the dossiers assemble the evidence in regard to institutional responsibility the situation is somewhat different the investigative dossiers are of course part of criminal trial process based upon individual responsibility institutional responsibility is not legal doctrine on which individual liability may be predicated on the other hand the investigative dossiers of all 12 cases also involve the notion of institutional responsibility because they seek to establish the responsibility of commanders and civilian officials through the theory of command responsibility because the prosecutorial strategy in all of these cases was to obtain convictions upon the basis of command responsibility rather than forms of individual direct or indirect perpetration the evidence collected has potential implications for institutional acquiescence through the failure to prevent or punish however the baps do not directly analyze or make conclusions about institutional involvement but rather the roles of specific individuals this is natural because the focus of the investigations and prosecutions was on individual responsibility there is however substantial evidence in the baps that could be used to support findings of institutional responsibility at least at the local operational level the document review prepared for the commission by its expert advisor analyzes this evidence in detail 30 29 david cohen intended to fail the trials before the ad hoc human rights courts in jakarta new york international center for t ransitional justice 2003 47 30 report to the ctf part i chapter ii 2 and appendix to the report to the ctf chapter v document review analysis of evidence of previous trials and reports analysis of the dossiers reveals both strengths and weaknesses on the one hand the dossiers assemble substantial amount of evidence that supports their conclusion that gross human rights violations in the form of crimes against humanity occurred there is also considerable evidence to suggest institutional involvement for example through the provision of material support in the form of financial and logistical assistance arms and munitions transportation etc other evidence suggests that at the operational level there was at times direct participation of tni or police personnel in operations conducted by militia against presumed proindependence supporters at times acquiescence through tacit approval or through failure to prevent or punish 31 as will be seen however lack of understanding of the elements of the relevant offenses and doctrines led to much of this evidence not being used in the way it could have if the legal framework of the charges had been more coherently articulated on the other hand there are also major weaknesses in the approach of the investigative dossiers most fundamental perhaps is the failure in most of the dossiers to consider any form of liability other than failure to prevent the crimes treated in the dossiers as an omission only three of the twelve cases attempted to explore other forms of accountability the other nine of the twelve dossiers ignored all other forms of responsibility other than omission and not surprisingly this is what most of the indictments were finally based on this occurred despite the fact that the investigations had provided substantial evidence that might have been used to establish link at the operational level between the field perpetrators and military and civilian officials this evidence suggested other forms of potential liability based upon direct and indirect perpetration rather than mere omission other weaknesses reflect fundamental misunderstanding of the elements of command responsibility in particular this misunderstanding involves both the mental element 32 required for command responsibility and of the central requirement of the existence of superior subordinate relationship another weakness involves the failure to comprehend the larger context of the crimes and to relate that context to the chapeau elements required to prove crimes against humanity this resulted in the failure to collect adequate evidence to support the charges used to develop the indictments and in the failure to fully use the evidence that had been collected as to the issue of command responsibility the weaknesses noted above affected the case because only clear grasp of the required elements can provide the prosecution with the evidence that it needs to establish guilt at trial for example proof of command responsibility requires establishing the existence of superiorsubordinate relationship between the accused and those individuals who perpetrated the crime the investigative dossiers generally neglect to focus on the proof of that element which depends not upon the mere formal chain of command jure authority but upon the effective control facto authority exercised by the alleged commander over the particular individuals who committed the crimes in question 31 this evidence is discussed in report to the ctf part i chapter 3 sections iid1 and iid2 see also addendum to the report to ctf part ii sections 1 and 2 which analyze additional evidence from the dossiers and from the kpp ham databases 32 the term mental element refers to the requirement that the crime in question must be committed intentionally or knowingly or recklessly etc that is it refers to kind of mental state that is required in order for person to be found guilty of particular offenseper memoriam ad spem the investigative dossiers do not aim to provide evidence on this crucial question and do not focus on the identity of the perpetrators and their relationship to accused commander in order to establish the superiorsubordinate relationship it is necessary to clearly identify the institutional affiliation of the perpetrators in most cases the dossiers fail to focus on this they apparently consider that it is enough to show that the crimes were committed the dossiers also do not seek to provide evidence on whether or not the accused military commanders were able to exercise effective control over timorese militia members who perpetrated or in some cases coperpetrated the crimes there is evidence in the dossiers that might have been used to try to prove this connection but the absence of clear understanding of the required elements resulted in this evidence not being organized around the crucial issues another aspect concerns the mental element that must be established to prove command responsibility there was an apparent lack of clarity underlying the dossiers about the definition of the mental element and what kind of evidence was required to prove it commander may only be held accountable for the crimes committed by his subordinates if he is shown to have known that the crimes were occurring or to have had information that should have put him on notice that there was risk that they would occur proof of this element requires assembling evidence that shows what information was available to the accused what kind of reports he was receiving to what extent he was in position to see or hear things that would have indicated the risk and so on again although there was evidence for example about the presence of some of the accused field commanders at or near the scene of some of the crimes the significance of such evidence was not reflected in the way in which witnesses were questioned and the case was prepared the impact these misunderstandings about key elements had on the actual trials before the ad hoc court will be treated in the next section another area where misapprehensions about the required elements weakened the prosecution case involves the chapeau elements of crimes against humanity the crime charged is part of widespread or systematic attack against civilian population for example the dossiers proceed from the assumption that an official policy is required to prove the systematic nature of the attack against the civilian population 33 first of all there is requirement that the attack be both widespread and systematic these elements are disjunctive however failure to focus on the broader context of which the specific crime under investigation was part resulted in failure to focus the assembly of evidence on proving the widespread element further there is requirement for proof of crimes against humanity in international law that there be any policy 34 the dossiers on the other hand not only proceed from the assumption that policy is required but also define policy only as formal policy that is policy that is written and officially adopted by the governmental institutions as is well established in international jurisprudence however policies may provide evidence of the systematic nature of the crimes and such policies may 33 see page 5 above for an explanation of the fact that policy does not have be proven in order to establish the element of systematic attack 34 addendum to report to the ctf for citations chapter ii2 p 48chapter v document review analysis of evidence of previous trials and reports be unofficial implicit unwritten and even unspoken thus the existence of policy may be inferred from patterns of conduct and patterns of institutional support acquiescence and reaction such patterns may provide evidence of policy even when official government decision statement order or policy document has ever existed t wo further basic weaknesses in the dossiers limited the way in which the available evidence could have been used to establish institutional responsibility 1 while all twelve investigations concluded that crimes against humanity had been committed most of them failed to clearly explain how the accused had any substantive link with the crime alleged this was flaw that also had serious consequences when these cases went to trial 2 the failure in most of the cases to comprehend the whole context in which the crimes were committed also critically affected the prosecution and trial process apart from the adam damiri case the narrow casebased approach looked at each incident as isolated and as having relation to other incidents investigated in other case files this failure to locate the crimes charged in their larger context and to explore linkages between them had serious consequences for using the evidence available to establish the widespread or systematic occurrence of crimes against humanity as well as command responsibility or other forms of liability it should be noted that this kind of narrow casebase approach was not unique to the jakarta trials but was an issue in the trials before the special panels for serious crimes in dili and before other international tribunals in their early stages as well these kind of structural problems manifested themselves in other areas as well and especially in the lack of more effective legal framework to ensure cooperation and coordination between komnas ham and the attorney generals office while kpp ham adopted very broad institutional and contextual approach in its investigation and recommendations the attorney generals office largely ignored these central features of the kpp ham report and for the most part treated each case as an isolated event statutory framework that better regulated the cooperation of the attorney generals office and komnas ham might have prevented these failures another exception to this narrow approach was adopted in the case of the investigation of the attack on ave maria church in suai there the investigator concluded that the crimes involving the killing of those seeking protection inside the church met the element of widespread and should be looked at as part of widespread attack in east timor in the report the investigator concluded the kllng by means of attackng and shootng n the ave mara church complex that was commtted by members of the pro ntegraton laksaur and mahd aganst pro ndependence people really was part of wdespread attack throughout east tmor because at the same tme that of th september there also was the same attack aganst pro ndependence people who were at dl docese archbshop belos resdence and sua church whch also brought casualtes commtted by the pro ntegraton people 35 35 see conclusion of the investigation on herman sedyono et 53per memoriam ad spem further the investigators also point out that the attack in suai was preceded by the intimidation against targeted groups that of the pro independence supporters beginning on the 3rd september 1999 however it does not elaborate further this fact to demonstrate the systematic nature of the crime while the attempt to prove the widespread element in this manner may be considered narrow and simplistic out of the twelve dossiers it is only this investigative dossier that clearly points out the link of the attack to broader context of violence occurring in east timor 36 it is major weakness that in trying to prove case of crimes against humanity all the other dossiers fail to connect the specific crimes charged to the broader context of violence in east timor in 1999 in conclusion while the dossiers all agree on the existence of crimes against humanity and that these crimes against humanity involve targeting of proindependence groups they reach substantive conclusions about institutional responsibility although the dossiers are unanimous on the issue of the ocurrence of crimes against humanity on the whole their approach is conceptually flawed and they do not utilize much of the evidence they collected that is relevant to proof of the chapeau elements the dossiers however do contain substantial amounts of evidence that could have been the object of serious inquiry as to institutional responsibility this evidence indicates that at least at the local level there was considerable institutional support for the prointegration militias who were the primary perpetrators of the crimes against humanity in addition the dossiers include substantial amount of evidence that suggests the direct involvement of tni or polri personnel in the actual perpetration of the crimes in the form of coperpetration with the militias the dossiers except in three cases noted above systematically fail to explore this dimension of responsibility 54 the ad hoc court process trials before the ad hoc human rights court 37 the dossiers discussed in the previous section provided the evidentiary basis for the twelve trials before the jakarta ad hoc human rights court there were very few instances in which the judges themselves brought in evidence that was not contained in the dossiers so that overall the dossiers contain the majority of the evidence which was supplemented by incourt testimony that was available at trial key issue as will be seen was the failure of the prosecution to utilize that evidence in presenting their case to the court the preceding section analyzed the narrow and deficient legal framework of the dossiers as these deficiencies were carried over to the trial in shaping the indictments and the case of the prosecution they do not need to be analyzed again here the focus here will rather be upon the weaknesses in the way the prosecution presented its case at trial the way in which the judges dealt with these weaknesses and the impact of these deficiencies on the conclusions they reached 36 there were several baps compiled on the basis of charges of crimes against humanity however many of them tend to draw conclusions by only concluding from the fact that murders have been committed or the attack has been proven as seen in baps of endar priyanto 53 hulman gultom 70 tono suratman 129 noer muis 61 herman sedyono et 54 yayat sudrajat 49 asep kuswani et 42 eurico guterres 53 adam damiri 49 soedjarwo 61 37 the analysis in this section relies on report to the ctf part 1 chapter 4 as well as report to the ctf appendix 3 to part i see also david cohen intended to failchapter v document review analysis of evidence of previous trials and reports section 53 above explained some of the ways in which the limitations of the dossiers negatively influenced the trial process this analysis does not need to be repeated here as result of this and other factors the judgments of the ad hoc court gave diverse and often conflicting accounts as to what happened in east timor in april and september 1999 there were however important conclusions common to all of the judgments the most important of these was that gross human rights violations and crimes against humanity were committed in 1999 and that these crimes were largely perpetrated by prointegration groups who targeted proindependence civilians however different panels of the ad hoc court derived different conclusions as to the crucial questions of whether or not the proautonomy armed groups were assisted or supported by individuals from the tni police and the civilian government for this reason their conclusions are also divided as to the implications for institutional responsibility the judgments of the twelve panels present four versions of the relation between the timorese proautonomy groups and indonesian institutions 1 there was relation between the militias and the tni police and civilian government the militias planned and perpetrated the attack themselves and the tni and police tried to prevent the attacks but failed 38 2 the relation between the militias and tni police and civilian government is unknown because it is considered as irrelevant to the cases that involve only individual responsibility 39 3 some members of the tni were involved in the attacks but did so on their own volition without the approval or orders of their superiors 40 4 tni police and the civilian government supported the prointegration militias in perpetrating the attack by providing finance arms or through acquiescence or omission before during or after the attack 41 the discrepancies between these four versions were largely due to issues relating to witnesses and evidence presented by the prosecutor it was typical in all of the trials that the prosecution would present only 24 witnesses who were either victims or not institutionally related to the accused they also typically called 1520 witnesses who were either tni or civilian officials who were defendants in the other cases or were superiors or subordinates of the accused 42 more detailed examples of this will be provided below in the discussion of the adam damiri case the result of this pattern of presentation of the evidence by the prosecution was that the vast majority of the witnesses they called actually testified against the prosecution case and in favor of the 38 see judgement on herman sedyono 124127 and judgement on soejarwo 4458 39 see judgement on endar priyanto 48 the court rules that crimes against humanity were committed in the event of 17 april 1999 but as none of his subordinates were proven to have been committed the crimes therefore it is irrelevant to consider the element that the commander did not take appropriate and necessary actions within his jurisdiction to prevent or halt these violations or surrender the perpetrators for investigation and prosecution 48 see also judgement on asep kuswani et the court ruled that the crimes against humanity were proven to have been committed in the attack against the residence of fr rafael liquiça church complex by the bmp white and red iron group therefore the elements of command responsibilities as provided by article 42 of the act 262000 shall be stated legally and certainly unfulfilled 125126 40 judgement on timbul silaen 128 41 judgement on adam damiri 168169 on the act of ommission see judgement on noer muis 83 and 89 and judgement on soejarwo 52 42 one of the factors affecting victim witnesses willingness to testify had to do with the lack of effective witness protection this resulted in the intimidation of some witnesses who did travel from east timor to jakarta and also inhibited others from agreeing to do soper memoriam ad spem defendant this was perhaps to be expected since these witnesses were professionally related to the accused often his subordinates and many of them were either on trial themselves in the other cases or could have potentially incriminated themselves for future prosecutions these factors greatly undermined the credibility of many of the witnesses because their testimony was so blatantly selfserving the problem of the probative quality of incourt testimony was also undermined by another factor while many of the prosecution witnesses from the tni gave only very general testimony in favor of the defendant for example the unsupported opinion that they had always done their duty to protect civilians rather than specific factual instances of how they had done so some of them had at the pretrial stage provided investigators with important information that would tend to prove the guilt of the accused for example by confirming the participation of military personnel in an attack and the presence of the accused without exception all of these witnesses changed their testimony at trial and completely contradicted their previous sworn statements to investigators in their new testimony they provided testimony that attempted to demonstrate the innocence and integrity of the accused for example jehezkiel berek and sonik iskandar who testified for herman sedyono et case and damianus dava who testified for asep kuswani gave these kinds of statements 43 prosecutors typically did not question these witnesses as to why they had changed their testimony nor did they usually attempt to attack or impeach this testimony that had suddenly undermined their case in some cases the judges did strongly question the witnesses as to the dramatic reversal of their account of what had happened the witnesses then typically stated that they had been mistaken in their original testimony and now they were accurately remembering what had happened while every witness has the right to change his or her testimony in this case this was not matter of slight modifying the account that had been previously given indeed the complete reversal of previous testimony in this case was very striking especially when it occurred with multiple witnesses and all at the same time and in the same manner also significant was the fact these witnesses claimed faulty memory as the reason for their change in testimony whatever the reasons for this change in testimony it weakened the evidentiary base of the case by undermining the credibility of these witnesses whose memory was by their own admission so volatile the result of all of these factors was that the judges were confronted with two categories of witnesses victim witnesses and tnigovernment officials whose versions of events were conflicting with one another it is normal in criminal trial that prosecution and defense witnesses sharply disagree with one another over crucial 43 in the investigative dossier he testified that preventive measures failed to be taken due to huge numbers of people as well as the presence of tni personnel providing training to laksaur but he changed this statement before the trial asserting that there was tni personnel at the crime scene similarly sonik iskandar previously stated that he saw dead bodies taken away to be buried but before the court he refused this and stated that he saw casualities in this event see transcript of the witness examination proceeding on sonik iskandar elsam court monitoring record 23 april 2002 unpublished 1011 see also transcript of the witness examination proceeding on jehezkiel berek elsam court monitoring record 30 april 2002 8 transcript of the witness examination proceeding on damianus dava elsam court monitoring record 23 april 2002 unpublished 16 transcript of the testimony of soegito elsam court monitoring record 9 july 2002 32chapter v document review analysis of evidence of previous trials and reports facts in this case however these were all prosecution witnesses who were split into these two categories the judges had to choose which version to accept one would expect that this decision would be based upon careful analysis of the credibility of the witnesses and particularly their motivation in providing selfserving testimony in some cases however the judges decided to choose based on the quantity of the witnesses who supported particular version since the number of tni witnesses vastly outnumbered the few victimwitnesses called this inevitably meant that these panels of judges tended to find in favor of the accused and acquit 44 in other cases however the judges decided to determine the version to be adopted by determination of the credibility of the testimony in these cases the judges usually convicted the defendants because they analyzed the testimony of the different witnesses and found the testimony of the victim witnesses more credible the result of these different approaches was that the conclusions reached by different panels of judges in the various cases display different strengths and weaknesses in almost all of the cases there was dearth of victimwitnesses but in some of the cases the judges used rigorous examination of the witnesses in court and analysis of their credibility in the judgments to make their findings these cases usually resulted in convictions in the cases where the judges acquitted the defendants they often did not carefully analyze the credibility of the witnesses testimony or look beyond it to the full range of evidence in the dossier one must take into account here however that the fundamental failure was of the investigators and prosecutors in not ensuring that the available evidence came before the court thorough analysis shows that the conclusions reached in the twelve judgments of the ad hoc court were not based on all of the evidence available in the dossiers 45 this was because the prosecution did not introduce most of the evidence in the dossiers at trial for example the dossiers for the twelve trials contain fortyfive documents in support of their allegations only six of these documents were actually introduced into evidence it should also be recognized that much more evidence was available than is contained in the dossiers the dossiers themselves register documents and other evidence that was collected but not included in the dossier 46 at the same time two major sources of evidence available to the prosecution were not utilized at all the first of these is the kpp ham document database and other evidentiary databases referenced above in contrast to the 45 documents included in the dossiers the kpp ham document database includes more than 1000 documents the second major source of potential evidence was the serious crimes unit in dili despite repeated offers by the scu to provide documentary or physical evidence or to make witnesses available the prosecution did not obtain any evidence from this source 44 one reason for the small number of victimwitnesses was the lack of effective witness protection provided to the witnesses who did come from timor leste 45 for detailed analysis see report to ctf part i chapter 4 and david cohen intended to fail 46 the ctf was able to obtain substantial number of these documents from the attorney generals office and they are indeed highly relevant0per memoriam ad spem the failure to utilize these two sources had direct and serious impact on the trials to cite just one example at the trials of abilio soares govenor of east timor and of eurico gutteres crucial fact had to do with the contents of the speech given by aitarak militia commander eurico gutteres at the militia rally held on the grounds of the govenors mansion manuel carrascalão testified in court that he heard the live radio broadcast of the speech in which he alleged gutteres had directly and explicitly called for the killing of manuel carrascalão and his family this speech was followed shortly thereafter by militia attack on manuel carrascalãos house in which his was killed eurico gutteres denied that he had said these words and other witnesses gave conflicting testimony despite repeated requests by the judges the prosecutors failed to produce an audio or video recording of this speech that would have definitively resolved this matter both of these were available from the serious crimes unit in dili further the serious crimes unit had possession of tni telegram reporting on the rally and the speech the telegram gave detailed account of precisely that crucial part of the speech at issue and confirmed that eurico gutteres had indeed incited the killing of pro independence leaders in general and manuel carrascalão in particular this telegram was also available in the kpp ham document database doubt as to the exact contents of eurico gutteres speech was given by the judges as an important factor in their decision and particularly about sentencing the failure to obtain evidence that was readily available thus had direct impact upon the trial and upon the strength of the conclusions reached by the judges further way in which the lack of preparation by prosecutors undermined the evidentiary basis of the judgments was in the treatment of physical and forensic evidence when weapons or bloodstained clothing from mass graves was presented to the court it was done so in manner that completely negated its evidentiary value prosecutors were often unable to answer the judges questions about the origin or significance of this evidence in many cases it was not tagged or identified in any way and was presented in such condition that it could not be identified as having any connection to the crimes of which the defendant was accused it was also the case that the weapons introduced at court were not the ones that were listed in the dossier as having been confiscated by investigators for example when the dossier listed modern military assault rifles such as m16 or sks the prosecution brought into court wwii vintage boltaction weapons 47 the foregoing discussion has enumerated many of the weaknesses of the trial process it has revealed that the conclusions reached by the different trial panels differed on central issues and it has discussed how these differences are related to evidentiary problems produced by the way the case was prosecuted it has also discussed the way in which the trial panels differed in their evaluation of witness testimony these differences and the underlying evidentiary problems contributed to the different conclusions reached about the individual responsibility of commanders and civilian superiors in the various trials as noted above however all of the trial judgments agreed that crimes against humanity had been committed in east timor the 47 cohen intended to fail the appendix in the electronic version of the report available at wwwictjorg on disappearing evidence details the discrepancies between evidence in the baps and evidence introduced in three of the trialschapter v document review analysis of evidence of previous trials and reports differences had to do with whether or not specific individual commanders could be held liable for the perpetration of these crimes by their alleged subordinates this issue of individual responsibility is outside the scope of the commissions mandate of relevance here is only the significance of the courts conclusions for institutional responsibility as noted above most of the judgments do not make findings that bear upon institutional responsibility in the cases where tni commanders were convicted on the basis of command responsibility however the findings on this issue may have implications for institutional responsibility the adam damiri case illustrates this potential connection general adam damiri who operated at the udayana level was not accused of any direct connection to or participation in the crimes against humanity he was charged on the basis of his failure to prevent or punish his subordinates for their alleged roles in these crimes while there are many issues that can be raised about the treatment of command responsibility in this case we will focus only on examples of those most immediately relevant for institutional responsibility 48 the court appears to have based its conviction of damiri on at least two grounds first the court finds that it has been proven that the actors of the crime against humanity in the incidents were the prointegration it has been also proven that there had been involvements of tni members it bases this finding on the following 49 in liquiça church attacks members of the tni and polri who were standing by but did nothing members of tni who belonged to the kodim of liquiça participated in the attacks with besi merah putih that the pepetrators in this case departed from the front yard of kodim liquiça in the attacks at the house of manuel carrascalão danrem 164 wira dharma col tono suratman knew of the attacks but did nothing in the attacks on diocese of dili the tni failed to make the preventive actions and corrective measures as also happened in the attacks on the ave maria church suai and at the residence of bishop belo on this basis the court concludes that consderng that on the bass of these facts t has been proven that there was nvolvement actvely as well as passvely of the members of tni under hs effectve command and control therefore the panel of judges consder the defendant should be responsble for the crme aganst humanty as ndcted n ths case these factual findings by the court may support its general conclusion about the knowledge of some tni commanders that their subordinates were participating supporting or acquiescing in crimes against humanity 50 in reaching its conclusions 48 for detailed analysis of these issues see david cohen analysis of the adam damiri t rial and appeals judgments from the standpoint of international jurisprudence legal notes on the examination of jugment on adam damiri case elsam 2007 49 see judgement of the first instance court on adam damiri putusan 09pidhamadhoc2002phjktpst 166 169 50 there are deficiencies in the reasoning as to how some of these finding support the conclusion that adam damiri was liable as commander for example failure to make specific findings on elements such as the existence of superior subordinate relationship or about the information available to the accused but they are not relevant to the discussion of institutional responsibility based upon the involvement of tni officers and personnel at the operational level as indicated in these factual findingsper memoriam ad spem however the court appears to have considered that it was the failure to take adequate preventative measures and to investigate and punish after the accused learned of the crimes that is the most important basis of their conclusions 51 consderng that durng the proceedngs the ad hoc publc prosecutor presented some evdence n the form of offical reports ncludng about the condtons ncdents as well as the geographc locatons of the ncdents that resulted n many vctms that was known to the supervsor of the defendant whch was general wranto who even n hs testmony always stated that he contnually receved offical reports from hs subordnate the defendant so that general wranto as the abri commander was able to know and follow the latest stuaton n east tmor sufficent to prove that the defendant knew or should have known what happened emphass added these findings are also relevant for institutional responsibility in that the conclusions as to command responsibility are ultimately based upon institutional awareness of the gross human rights violations in east timor and failure to respond to these in manner that meets the requirements of international humanitarian law fuller discussion of this and other trials maybe found in the report to the ctf part i chapter 4 one further point deserves consideration the conviction of adam damiri was reversed upon appeal and he was acquitted of all charges this raises the question of whether this or other such decisions at the appellate level are relevant from the standpoint of conclusions reached by the ad hoc t rial court about gross human rights violations or institutional responsibility consideration of the appeals judgment in the damiri case reveals that this reversal of the verdict does not undermine conclusions on the issues of relevance for the document review conducted by the commission appeals to the ad hoc appellate court the judgment of the ad hoc appellate court in the damiri case is clearly inferior to the t rial judgment in terms of its quality in relation to international standards of judgment writing and jurisprudence the judgment of the ad hoc appellate court contains almost analysis only summary conclusions this represents deviation not only from the norms of international practice but also from the very essence of the task of appellate decision writing appellate decisions especially when they overturn the findings of the lower court by their very nature need to justify and explain the rationale behind rulings this involves careful legal analysis of the issues raised on appeal the appeals judgment in the damiri case almost entirely fails to do this further it is the task of the appellate courts to review the treatment of jurisprudential issues by the t rial court in this case the appellate court seems to be fundamentally unaware of the norms of international practice and jurisprudence that were relied upon by the t rial court should there be any doubt about the applicability of international norms and practice the ad hoc appellate court itself states clearly that it is indeed bound by such norms in setting out the basis of its conclusion that the conviction of the accused should be reversed it

year the relevant norms and principles of international humanitarian law emphass added the result is an appellate decision that is flawed in its understanding and application of the law and that fails to provide reasoned justification for its decision there are serious legal issues raised in this appeal and the ad hoc appeals court treats them so briefly and so cursorily that it reads more like summary of decision rather than the decision itself few examples will illustrate these points 1 the court enumerates the elements of the offense 53 consderng that on both counts the defendant was ndcted of havng commtted the criminal act n artcle law of 000 that has the followng core elements consderng that the ad hoc human rghts court of appeal s of the opnon that n relaton to element 1 and 2 of the crime the part of those elements that s most essental and crtcal n determnng whether or not the crme has been proven as stpulated n artcle of law of 00 namely that t has to be proven that there was personnel or subordnate of the defendant commttng gross human rghts volatons this passage appears to reflect fundamental misunderstanding command responsibility is not criminal act article 42 does not define crime the elements of command responsibility are not elements of the crime command responsibility is not crime but rather theory of liability that connects commander to the criminal acts of his subordinates and makes him or her liable for those crimes in this case murder as crime against humanity what is missing in the appeals judgment is therefore discussion of whether the subordinates committed crimes against humanity the court must analyze the elements of crimes against humanity in relation to the acts of the subordinate if they did not commit such crimes the rest of the analysis is irrelevant because the most basic element of command responsibility is missing the commission by the subordinates of crime within the jurisdiction of the court the appellate court enumerates this element in the very next paragraph 54 that n command responsblty the chan of command can be followed upwards by fulfillng the followng elements there has to be first that there were gross human rght volatons commtted by hs members f ths dd not occur there wll not be command responsblty it correctly states this element but seems to believe that command responsibility is also crime 53 ibid 19 54 ibid 1920per memoriam ad spem there are also important errors in these two sentences the first involves the phrase the chain of command can be followed upward in the jurisprudence of the international tribunals there does not have to be formal command structure or chain of command and it does not need to be followed upward as discussed above what matters for the purpose of establishing the superior subordinate relationship is facto authority in the form of effective control to make finding of effective control the court must inquire whether the alleged commander possessed the facto power to prevent these crimes or punish these specific subordinates would they have followed his order to desist had it been given whether the effective control is exercised through or outside of the chain of command is irrelevant if there is an intact formal command hierarchy this may serve as evidence to raise presumption of the power to prevent or punish the burden would then be on the defense to introduce evidence to show that the command hierarchy was not functioning properly in regard to these specific units at the time the crimes were committed or the commander became aware of them this is however only an evidentiary matter it is not part of the elements and not requirement for conviction for this reason military commander in national army may be held liable under command responsibility for crimes committed by paramilitary groups or death squads that are not manned by soldiers and are entirely outside of the army command structure regardless of this jure situation if these units consider the accused to be in position of authority such that he would have the power to prevent there is superiorsubordinate relationship sufficient to fulfill this element 2 when the court enumerates what it considers the remaining two elements it makes further mistakes of central significance 55 b the superor knows that the subordnate s commttng or about to commt crme c the superor fals to prevent or punsh the aforementoned subordnate n queston most seriously the court misstates the mental element their definition encompasses only actual knowledge what is missing is the element of had reason to know or should have known this is very serious omission because in this case the real issue should be whether because of the previous violence the accused was put on inquiry notice that crimes might be committed this crucial issue is entirely ignored by the appellate court it is also not sufficiently analyzed in the t rial judgment with high level commanders it is frequently the case that they are distant enough from the scene of the crime that they may not have actual knowledge that the crimes are being committed or are about to be committed in any event this may also be very difficult for the prosecution to prove the reason to know or should have known standards focus instead on other information available to the commander about factors like previous violence or criminal conduct the discipline of the troops in question potential provocations or tensions that might lead to violence etc if the prosecution can show that the commander had awareness of such factors in regard to the units that commit the crimes and that that awareness should have caused him to inquire further then 55 ibid 20chapter v document review analysis of evidence of previous trials and reports the mental element mens rea is fulfilled in such case to avoid liability the commander must take effective measure to prevent the crimes merely issuing orders and so on is insufficient he must implement steps to see that they are effectively carried out 3 even more serious is the appellate courts brief justification for rejecting the factual findings of the t rial court 56 consderng that based on the testmony of wtnesses leutenant general ret tni kk sahnakr major general tni zak anwar makarm names omtted t s not proven that there were subordnatetroops under the effectve control of the defendant who were nvolved n the clash between the proindependence group wth the pro integratonautonomy group t has not also been proven that there was herarchcal and effectve relaton between the defendant as the pangdam udayana at the tme wth those nvolved n the clash and therefore element and of the crmes ndcted aganst the defendant have not been fulfilled by the acts of the defendant this discussion is fundamentally unsatisfactory these few sentences represent the central basis for the rejection of the findings of the ad hoc t rial court there is discussion of the definition of the elements or how they should be applied to the facts of the case there is analysis of the testimony that is supposedly exculpatory and analysis of what evidence the trial chamber relied upon in reaching its conclusions their judgment gives reasons for the finding that subordinates of the accused were involved in the attack involved in what manner there has been discussion of the possible basis of liability of the subordinates that is the court has not considered if the conduct would fulfill the elements of crimes against humanity for example even if they were not involved as perpetrators they might have been aiding and abetting ordering or inciting what of the evidence that the attackers proceeded from the kodim or of the presence of tni commanders at the scene whether the appellate court accepts such evidence as sufficient it is nonetheless obliged by basic norms of appellate practice to analyze such evidence and explain why it is not sufficient to meet the requirement for liability one of the requirements of the trial courts finding that crimes against humanity were committed was that there was an attack against civilian population the appellate court does not even address this issue and simply refers to clash they do not discuss any of the evidence on this point or despite its crucial importance the reasons given by the trial court for its findings this again is failing in meeting the most basic and obvious requirements of appellate practice the court lists number of witnesses whose testimony it maintains supports its conclusion there is not single reference to specific testimony of these individuals let alone an analysis of their version of the facts even more significantly the court omits to even mention the witnesses whose testimony 56 ibid 2021per memoriam ad spem contradicts the tni witnesses they list there is absolutely discussion of credibility or of the standard of review for assessing decisions about credibility made by the trial chamber they fail to consider the obvious point that there is an apparent reason for bias in the testimony of all of the named individuals that might have in the judgment of the trial court undermined their credibility for example that many of them were defendants in other trails before the ad hoc court this is of course exactly what the trial chamber found but the appellate court does not even mention this vital holding let alone analyze its foundation the central issues that the ad hoc court of appeal never mentions or considers are what evidence the ad hoc t rial court relied on whether this reliance was reasonable and whether that evidence supports their conclusions of course it would also have been appropriate to articulate the standard of review they are applying to the determination of these issues by the trial court 4 in regard to the third element of command responsibility the ad hoc court of appeal concludes 57 that based on the explanaton of the wtnesses leutenant general ret tni kk sahnakr names omtted there s evdence that the defendant or the subordnate has commtted omsson n regard to the clash between the pro integratonautonomy group and the pro independence group it was just that the clash could not be overcome due to the expansve field of conflct and the lmted personnel and equpment ths proves that the defendant as the udayana mltary regon hgh commander at the tme had fully attempted to conduct hs functon as the tactcal command of commander structure wthn tni t wo points deserve to made here first where is the analysis to support this finding quite simply there is none there are specific references to any of the relevant testimony or to the findings and reasoning of the trial judgment when an appeals court makes factual findings different from those of the trial court its conclusions need to be based upon careful examination both of the evidence and the findings and conclusions of the lower court this is standard international practice except perhaps in the equally flawed appellate decisions of the court of appeal of the special panels for serious crimes second there is fundamental misunderstanding of how command responsibility works as theory of liability the basic reasoning of the appellate court is that there was omission on the part of the accused because the clash could not be controlled this completely misses the point the question of whether the accused had information on the basis of which he should have been on notice that such crimes might be committed if so then he is under an obligation to take effective measure to prevent the crimes from occurring the point is not whether they could have been controlled once they had occurred but whether they could have been prevented once the accused was aware of the risk that such events might occur based upon this account of the elements the ad hoc appellate court concludes that 58 57 ibid 21 58 ibid 2122chapter v document

context of ths omsson an admnstratve sancton can be mposed aganst hm t s unclear n the orgnal text where juwanas quote ends this passage from the judgment is conceptually incoherent there appears to be completely erroneous understanding of the meaning of the doctrine of command responsibility as theory of liability there also appears to be similar misapprehension of the applicable standard under the international jurisprudence that defines command responsibility from this perspective all of the talk of omissions and superiors of higher rank is totally irrelevant the only issue from the standpoint of command responsibility is whether there was culpable failure to prevent or punish crimes committed by subordinate what is needed here is careful analysis of the evidence as to the existence of the superiorsubordinate relationship the conduct of the subordinates the information available to the accused and the steps he took to either prevent or punish the subordinates what the judgment gives instead is single incoherent and uninformed sentence instead of analysis and legal reasoning concluding its discussion the ad hoc appellate court turns to an issue that seems completely out of place in the context and also betrays further shortcomings of the judgment 59 that accordng to elements of crme crmes aganst humanty of murder has to fulfill the element of delberate falure so defendant can be determned to have faled to prevent and securetalczed words appear n englsh n the orgnal this statement appears to confuse the command responsibility and crimes against humanity perhaps the underlying problem is the apparent belief by the court that command responsibility is crime with which the accused is being charged in any event deliberate failure is neither an element of crimes against humanity nor command responsibility the court has not even considered the elements of crimes against humanity which it should have done in conjunction with its findings on the first element again this part of the judgment appears to reflect lack of understanding of the basic legal doctrines the court is applying as well as failure to provide reasoned account of its conclusions in conclusion there appears to be sufficient grounds to view the judgment of the ad hoc appellate court as having undermined the factual findings of the ad hoc t rial court which relate to gross human rights violations and institutional responsibility above all this is the case because the appellate judgment contains virtually analysis of the evidence or of the reasoning of the trial court in reaching its conclusions 59 ibid 22per memoriam ad spem 55 common features of indonesian documents comparison of the findings and conclusions reached by the kpp ham report the investigative dossiers and the judgments of the ad hoc human rights court as to the occurrence of crimes against humanity and the issue of institutional responsibility for those crimes suggests that they have the following common features all three documents agree that in the period before and after the popular consultation in east timor in 1999 there were gross violations of human rights all three agree that the gross violations of human rights were widespread in terms of geographical areas and number of victims they also agree that this is one of the key elements in determining that gross human rights violations in the form of crimes against humanity were committed the three documents agree that these gross human rights violations involved attacks directed against civilian population and that this is another key element of crimes against humanity in terms of the underlying cause of the crimes the three documents agree that these crimes are the product of the conflicting political objectives during that period namely for east timor to remain part of indonesia or to be an independent state the three documents agree that the crimes were perpetrated with at least some extent of planning all three documents agree that the crimes against humanity were directly perpetrated by the prointegration militias the involvement of elements of indonesias armed forces in the attacks has been acknowledged in the kpp ham report and the investigative dossiers but there are different conclusions as to their involvement in the 12 judgments of the ad hoc court in the kpp ham and investigative dossiers as well as in some judgments there is also agreement that there was at the very least tacit support by indonesian institutions towards the perpetration of the crimes by way of omission namely not taking the necessary action to prevent or stop the perpetration of the crimes or not taking appropriate actions against those responsible for the crimes it can be concluded that the available evidence was adequate to support the findings of the three bodies of documents that gross violations of human rights in the form of crimes against humanity occurred from january to september 1999 in east timor it can also be concluded however that in the course of the judicial process of the ad hoc human right court there was an increasing narrowness and inadequacy in the attempt to find the truth and determine accountability for these crimes against humanity the following factors reflected or accounted for this trend 60 1 significant narrowing of the tempus and locus covered in each process from januaryseptember 1999 in regards to 16 main cases in kpp ham report until five incidents over the period of aprilseptember 1999 in the investigation and trials 60 see report to the ctf part i chapter
