damages spilling over from housing and financial markets to the broader economy including monetary policy which is the responsibility of the federal reserve and fiscal policy including tax cut in february 2008 of 150 billion and two extensions of unemployment compensation in june and november of 2008 over the past few months the government has also intervened in specific financial markets including financial assistance to troubled firms including legislation granting authority to the treasury department to purchase 700 billion in assets the broad intervention into the financial markets has been passed to avoid the spread of financial instability into the broader market but there are disadvantages including leaving the government holding large amounts of mortgage debt with the worsening performance of the economy congressional leaders and presidentelect obama have now proposed much larger stimulus packages ranging from 600 to 850 billion comprised of spending and tax cuts the package under discussion may contain some proposals considered but not adopted during the 2008 debate and could include infrastructure spending revenue sharing with the states middle class tax cuts business tax cuts unemployment benefits and food stamps the need for additional fiscal stimulus depends on the state of the economy the national bureau of economic research nber in december 2008 declared the economy in recession since december 2007 growth rates after two strong quarters were negative in the fourth quarter of 2007 positive in the first and second quarters of 2008 and negative 05 in the third quarter according to one data series employment fell in every month of 2008 the unemployment rate which rose slightly in the last half of 2007 declined in january and february of 2008 but began rising in march and in december stood at 72 some forecasters believe that the ongoing financial turmoil will result in recession that is deeper and longer than average fiscal policy temporarily stimulates the economy through an increase in spending which also if not offset by increases in revenue increases the budget deficit there is consensus that certain proposals ones that result in more spending can be implemented quickly and leave longterm effect on the budget deficit would increase the benefits and reduce the costs of fiscal stimulus relative to other proposals economists generally agree that spending proposals are somewhat more stimulative than tax cuts since part of tax cut may be saved by the recipients the most important determinant of the effect on the economy is the stimulus size the recent stimulus package increased the deficit by about 1 of gdp this report will be updated as warranted by legislative and economic events

economy in recession since december of 2007 with the worsening performance of the economy congressional leaders and presidentelect obama have now proposed major fiscal stimulus package ranging from 600 to 850 billion comprised of spending and tax cuts the proposal under discussion may contain some proposals considered but not adopted during the 2008 legislative debate and could include infrastructure spending revenue sharing with the states business and middle class tax cuts unemployment benefits and food stamps numerous actions have already been taken to contain damages spilling over from housing and financial markets to the broader economy these policies include traditional monetary and fiscal policy as well as federal interventions into the financial sector in february 2008 in response to weaker economic growth an economic stimulus package of approximately 150 billion was adopted provision that was considered but not enacted in the february stimulus bill was 26 week extension of unemployment benefits this extension was eventually enacted 1 second stimulus plan hr 7110 passed the house on september 26 but was not passed by the senate it included 369 billion on infrastructure 128 billion highway and bridge 75 billion water and sewer 5 billion corps of engineers 65 billion in extended unemployment compensation 145 billion in medicaid and 27 billion in food stamp and nutrition programs some of these provisions are likely to be included in the new stimulus package number of financial interventions have also been undertaken financial market conditions worsened significantly in september 2008 although the real production of goods and services has so far showed unexpected resilience since financial turmoil began in august of 2007 the ability of private borrowers to access credit markets remained restricted throughout the year evidence of credit crunch was seen in the persistence of wide spreads between the interest rates that private borrowers paid for credit and the yields on treasury securities of comparable maturity the federal reserve had already undertaken number of interventions and in october of 2008 legislation granting the treasury department authority to purchase up to 700 billion in assets through the troubled assets relief program tarp was adopted 2 this report first discusses the current state of the economy

than few months based on number of economic indicators with an emphasis on trends in employment and income4 but because recession is defined as lasting decline the nber typically does not declare recession until it is well under way the current recession was declared in late november of 2008 after two strong quarters economic growth fell by 02 in the fourth quarter of 2007 it then increased by 09 in the first quarter of 2008 and 28 in the second quarter of 2008 real gdp decreased by 05 in the third quarter however forecasters now predict that gdp will continue to contract until the second half of 2009 and the rate of decline will accelerate 5 if correct this recession would be the longest in the period since world war ii according to one data series employment fell in the first 11 months of 2008 the unemployment rate which was 48 in february 2008 rose to 61 in august remained there in september and rose again to 65 in october to 68 in november and to 72 in december 2008 after long and unprecedented housing boom the median price of existing homes fell by 18 in 2007possibly the first year of falling prices since the great depression according to one organization which compiles the data 6 and the decline continued in 2008 and appears to be worsening over time other housing data fell even furtherexisting home sales fell by 22 in the twelve months through december 2007 and reside ntial investment house building fell by 18 in the four quarters ending in the fourth quarter of 2007 the decline in residential investment has acted as drag on overall gdp growth while the other components of gdp grew at more healthy rates until the third quarter of 2008 many economists argued that the housing boom was not fully caused by improvements in economic fundamentals such as rising incomes and lower mortgage rates and instead represented housing bubble situation where prices were being pushed up by irrational exuberance 7 most economists believe that housing downturn alone would not be enough to singlehandedly cause recession8 but in august 2007 the housing downturn spilled over to widespread financial turmoil9 triggered by dramatic decline in the price of subprime mortgagebacked securities and collateralized debt obligations large losses and decline in liquidity spread throughout the financial system the federal reserve fed was forced to create unusually large amounts of liquidity to keep shortterm interest rates from rising in august 2007 and has since reduced interest rates significantly the fed has gradually reduced the federal funds target rate from 525 to range of 0 to 025 as of december 16 2008 in addition the fed has lent directly to financial institutions through an array of new facilities and the amounts of loans outstanding has at times exceeded trillion dollars 10 reduction in lending by financial institutions in response to uncertainty or financial losses is another channel through which the economy entered recession 4

announced at major financial institutions and responses outside traditional monetary policy have been undertaken in march the financial firm bear stearns encountered liquidity problems was provided emergency financing by jpmorgan chase and the federal reserve bank of new york and was purchased after plummet in stock value by jpmorgan chase then in july the government sponsored enterprises gses fannie mae and freddie mac experienced rapidly falling equity prices in response to concerns about the value of their mortgage backed securities assets in july congress authorized treasury to extend the gses an unlimite d credit line which has not been utilized to date in the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 pl 110289 because of concern that the failure of gse would cause systemic financial crisis the federal government took control of fannie mae and freddie mac in early sept ember in november 2008 treasury purchased 28 billion of senior preferred stock from freddie mac to prevent its net worth from becoming negative according to news reports in the fall of 2008 government officials decided not to intervene on behalf of lehman brothers and merrill lynch 11 on september 14 bank of america took over merrill lynch without federal intervention and on september 15 lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy the treasury and federal reserve were trying to engineer private bailout of the nations largest insurance company aig but on september 16 seized control with an 85 billion emergency loan 12 on september 18 administration and federal reserve officials with the bipartisan support of the congressional leadership announced massive intervention in the financial markets13 the proposal asked for authority to purchase up to 700 billion in assets over the next two years the treasury had also provided insurance for money market funds where withdrawals have been significant these proposals suggested that government economists see problems with the transmission of traditional monetary stimulus into the financial sector and ultimately into the broader economy where significant contraction of credit could significantly reduce aggregate demand although the legislation passed with some delay the stock market fell significantly the original proposal had discussed buying mortgage related assets particularly mortgagebacked securities but the treasury indicated it will spend the initial 250 billion on preferred stock in financial institutions the federal reserve has also announced purchases of commercial paper 200 billion of asset backed securities and 600 billion of mortgage related securities the government has also announced plan to assist citigroup at the same time the economy and financial sector had been grappling with the housing downturn energy prices had risen significantly from 48 per barrel in january 2007 to 115 dollars on april 30 2008 and 144 as of july 2 2008 after that oil prices began downward trend and had fallen below 70 by

stimulus proposal was discussed during 2008 and some unemployment benefits extensions were enacted but worsening economic news has led to proposals for much larger package in the range of 600 to 850 billion if so it would be significantly larger in size than the february 2008 proposal and the other proposals discussed during the 110 th congress the 2009 stimulus proposal could include extensions

taxable income with ceiling and floor child rebate for dependents eligible for the child credit and refundability for low income earners and social security recipients the legislation also included two business provisions the first was bonus depreciation allowing 50 of investment with life of less than 20 years which applies mostly to equipment to be deducted when purchased the second addressed provision that allowed small businesses to deduct all equipment investment when purchased by increasing the ceiling on eligible equipment and phasing out the benefit more slowly both of these provisions expired at the end of 2008 news reports on january 6 indicate that the package will include an extension of the two business provisions

but was largely targeted at the housing sector it included some regulatory and direct spending provisions in the latter case primarily 4 billion authorization for state and local governments to

billion over ten years the bill also included liberalization of taxexempt mortgage revenue bonds tax credit for buyers of homes in foreclosure temporary deduction for property taxes by homeowners who do not itemize capped at 500 for single and 1000 for couples and an election to refund certain corporate credits in li eu of other business provisions there were also some limited provisions for areas still recovering from hurricanes and from storms and tornados in kansas altogether the package would have cost 22 billion over ten years new reports on january 6 indicated that the package would include fiveyear carryback of net operating losses housing legislation was ultimately enacted in the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 hr 3221 pl 110289 it included credit for firsttime homebuyers to be repaid over 15 years as well as the property tax deduction but with lower caps of 350 and 700 along with some provisions affecting the lowincome housing credits and tax exempt bonds for housing the tax benefits were generally offset the net operating loss provision was not included in the final bill 17 16 see concurrent resolution of the budget for 2009 senate report to accompany

being considered by congressional leaders and president elect obama the 2009 package would likely build off of some of the proposals discussed for 2008 but would also include tax cuts on december 15 house speaker pelosi suggested 600 billion package with 400 billion of spending and 200 billion in tax cuts as starting point for discussion it is reported that the package would probably include infrastructure spending aid to the states unemployment compensation and food stamps earlier on december 11 finance committee chairman baucus suggested that half of an expected 700 billion plan might be in tax cuts he mentioned child tax credits state and local property tax deductions the rd tax credit the marriage penalty tax exempt bonds and energy incentives house republican leader boehner proposed tax package that included increases in the child tax credit suspending the capital gains tax on newly acquired assets increasing expensing extending bonus depreciation and raising the share of costs expensed from 50 to 75 extending net operating loss carrybacks to three years lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 to 25 and expanding energy subsidies reports on december 29 suggested president elect obama would propose package of 670 billion to 770 billion but that additions in congress might raise the total to 850 billion the package could include 100 billion in aid to the states to fund medicaid possibly with additional grants and at least 350 billion for public works alternative energy health care and school modernization and expanding unemployment insurance and food stamp benefits the package would also include middle class tax cuts while these cuts have not been specified congressional leaders have referred to the child credit state and local property taxes marriage penalties the rd tax credit and tax exempt bonds following meeting between president elect obama and congressional leaders on january 5 news reports indicated that the share of the package directed at tax cuts would increase to about 40 perhaps 300 billion president elect obama has suggested credit for working families of up to 1000 for couples and 500 for singles business provisions might include extensions of the bonus depreciation and small business expensing enacted in february 2008 that expired at the end of 2008 as well as an extended net operating loss carryback provision that was discussed but not enacted in 2008 also discussed was an expansion of the firsttime homebuyers credit adopted in the 2008 housing legislation and expanding renewable energy incentives payroll tax holiday has also been discussed news reports on january 9 indicated some re sistance of congressional lawmakers to two provisions in president elect obamas plan 3000 tax credit for employers who hire new workers and the working families credit which provides for credit of 62 of earnings up to ceiling of 500 for individuals and 1000 for married couples some are concerned that the employer tax credit will not benefit distressed firms and will be difficult to administer fiscal stimulus is only effective when policy options cause increases in aggregate demand many economists view fiscal policy as less effective than monetary policy in an open economy as mentioned earlier in this report however several monetary policy options have already been employed for several months

tax cuts may be less effective than spending because some of the tax cut may be saved which diminishes the effectiveness of the stimulus tax cuts that are tem porary that appear in lump sum rather than in withholding or that are aimed at higher income individuals are thought more likely to be saved for example some evidence suggests that two thirds of the 2001 tax rebate was spent the challenge to spending programs is that there may be lag time for planning and administration before the money is spent for that reason infrastructure spending is often discussed in the context of readytogo projects where all of the planning is in place and the only missing factor is funding some analysts ggest that aid to state and local governments may be more quickly spent because these governments are likely to cut back on spending in downturns due to balanced budget requirements and the aid may forestall these cuts18 concerns have also been expressed that the larger the package the greater the risk that the spending will not be effective especially for certain types of infrastructure some economists advocate quick enactment of smaller package followed by additional spending that can be more carefully considered19 these delays in spending are less of concern if the downturn appears likely to be protracted or the recovery slow

adopted stimulus package pl 110185 increas ed the budget deficit by about 1 of gross domestic product gdp in healthy year gdp gr ows about 3 in the moderate recessions that the us experienced in 19901991 and 2001 gdp contracted in some quarters by 05 to 3 the us economy has not experienced contraction in full calendar year since 1991 thus swing from expansion to recession would result in change in gdp growth equal to at least 35 percentage points stimulus package of 1 of gdp could be expected to increase total spending by about 1 21 to the extent that spending begets new spending there could be multiplier effect that makes the total increase in spending larger than the increase in the deficit offsetting the multiplier effect the increase in spending could be neutralized if it results in crowding out of investment spending larger trade deficit or high er inflation the extent to which the increase in spending would be offset by these three factor s depends on how quickly the economy is growing at the time of the stimulusan increase in the budget deficit would lead to less of an increase in spending if the economy were growing faster 18 see 92939 countercyclical job

for the economy to revive if on the other hand the economy has entered deeper prolonged recession as some economists believe to be likely then fiscal stimulus may not be powerful enough to avoid it since the current recession has already lasted longer than the historical average it may end before further fiscal stimulus can be enacted economic forecasts are notoriously inaccurate due to the highly complex and changing nature of the economy so it is difficult to accurately assess how deep the downturn will be and how much fiscal stimulus would be an appropriate response while the magnitude of the proposed stimulus package is yet to be determined current discussion of package being considered by president elect obama and congressional leadership suggest package about 5 to 6 of gdp some believe that circumstances warrant large stimulus and this is quite large by historical standards others have expressed reservations that at least with respect to spending it would be difficult to spend such large amounts without financing wasteful projects g4g138g151g144g561g143g152g155g561g157g145g142g561g4g158g140g148g561 in terms of firstorder effects any stimulus proposal that is deficit financed would increase total spending in the economy22 for secondorder effects different proposals could get modestly more bang for the buck than others if they result in mo re total spending if the goal of stimulus is to maximize the boost to total spending while minimizing the increase in the budget deficit in order to minimize the deleterious effects of crowding out then maximum bang for the buck would be desirable the primary way to achieve the most bang for the buck is by choosing policies that result in spending not saving 23 direct government spending on goods and services would therefore lead to the most bang for the buck since none of it would be saved the largest categories of direct federal spending are national defense health infrastructure public order and safety and natural resources 24 higher government transfer payments such as extended unemployment compensation benefits or increased food stamps or tax cuts could theoretically be spent or saved by their recipients25 while there is way to be certain how to target stimulus package toward recipients who would spend it many economists have reasoned that higher income recipients would save more than lower income recipients since us saving is hi ghly correlated with income for example two thirds of families in the bottom 20 of the income distribution did not save at all in 2004 whereas only onefifth of families in the top 10 of the income distribution did not save 26 presumably recipients in economic distress such as those receiving unemployment benefits would be even more likely to spend transfer or tax cut than typical family 22 there may be few proposals that would not increase spending for example increasing tax incentives to save would probably not increase spending significantly these examples are arguably exceptions that prove the rule 23 policies that result in more bang for the buck also result in more crowding out of investment spending which could reduce the longterm size of the economy unless the policy change increases public investment or induces private investment 24 for the purpose of this discussion government transfer payments such as entitlement benefits are not classified as government spending 25 food stamps cannot be directly saved since they can only be used on qualifying purchases but recipient could theoretically keep their overall consumption constant by increasing their other saving 26 brian bucks et recent changes in us family finances evidence from the 2001 and 2004 survey of consumer finances federal reserve

above tax cuts received by lower income individuals are more likely to be spent some economists have also argued that temporary individual tax cuts such as the 2001 and 2008 rebates are more likely to be saved however evidence on the 2001 tax rebate suggests most was eventually spent and debate continues on the effect of the 2008 rebate most evidence does not suggest that business tax cuts would provide significant shortterm stimulus investment incentives are attractive if they work because increasing investment does not trade off short term stimulus benefits for reduction in capital formation as do provisions stimulating consumption nevertheless most evidence does not suggest these provisions work very well to induce shortterm spending this lack of effectiveness may occur because of planning lags or because stimulus is generally provided during economic slowdowns when excess capacity ma already exist of business tax provisions investment subsidies are more effective than rate cuts but there is little evidence to support much stimulus effect temporary bonus depreciation is likely to be most effective in stimulating investment more effective than much costli er permanent investment incentive because it encourages the speedup of investment although th ere is some dispute most evidence on bonus depreciation enacted in 2002 nevertheless suggests that it had little effect in stimulating investment and that even if the effects were pronounced the benefit was too small to have an appreciable effect on the economy the likelihood of the remaining provisions having much of an incentive effect is even smaller firms may for example benefit from the small business expensing but it actually discourages investment in the expanded phase out range 27 net operating losses carrybacks do not increase incentives to spend but do target cash to troubled businesses mark zandi of moody s economycom has estimated multiplier effects for several different policy options as shown in table 1 28 the multiplier estimates the increase in total spending in the economy that would result from dollar spent on given policy option zandi does not explain how these multipliers were estimated other than to say that they were calculated using his firms macroeconomic model therefore it is difficult to offer thorough analysis of the estimates in general many of the assumptions that would be needed to calculate these estimates are widely disputed notably the difference in marginal propensity to consume among different recipients and the size of multipliers in general and macroeconomic model has highly successful track record predicting economic activity thus the range of values that other economists would assign to these estimates is probably large qualitativ ely most economists would likely agree with the general thrust of his estimates howeverspending provisions have higher multipliers because tax cuts are partially saved and some types of tax cuts are more likely to be saved by their recipients than others as discussed above noticeable increase in consumption spending has not yet accompanied the receipt of the rebates from the first stimulus package note however that these effects do not account for the possibility of extensive delay in direct spending taking place 27 for more information see crs report rs21136 government spending or tax

evaluated there are lags before policy change affects spending as result stimulus could be delivered after the economy has already entered recession or recession has already ended first there is legislative process lag that applies to all policy proposalsa stimulus package cannot take effect until bills are passed by the house and senate both chambers can reconcile differences between their bills and the president signs the bill many bi lls get delayed at some step in this process as seen in table 2 many past stimulus bills have not become law until recession was already underway or

bartlett maybe too litt always to late new york times jan 23 2 00 8 second there is an administrative delay between the enactment of legislation and the implementation of the policy change for example although the stimulus package was signed into law in february the first rebate checks were not sent out until the end of april and the last rebate checks were not sent out until july when the emergency unemployment compensation euc08 program began in july 2008 there was about three week lag between enactment and the first payments of the new euc08 benefit many economists have argued that new government spending on infrastructure could not be implemented quickly enough to stimulate the economy in time since infrastructure projects require significant planning others have argued that this problem has been exaggerated because existing plans or routine maintenance could be implemented more quickly others have argu ed that although federal spending cannot be implemented quickly enough fiscal transfers to state and local governments would be spent quickly because many states currently face budgetary shortfalls and fiscal transfers would allow them to avoid cutting spending 29 finally there is behavioral lag since time elapses before the recipient of transfer or tax cut increases their spending for example the initia l reaction to the receipt of rebate checks was large spike in the personal saving rate see above it is unclear how to target recipients that would spend most quickly although presumably liq uidityconstrained households ie those with limited access to credit would spend more quickly than others in this regard the advantage to direct government spending is that there is analogous lag although monetary policy changes have legislative or administrative lags research suggests they do face longer behavioral lags than fiscal policy changes because households and business generally respond more slowly to interest rate changes than tax or transfer changes g14g152g151g144g556g157g142g155g150g561g7g143g143g142g140g157g156g561 as discussed above while deficitfinanced policy change can stimulate shortterm spending it can also reduce the size of the economy in the long run through the crowding out effect on private 29 transfers to state and local governments could be less stimulative than direct federal spending because state and local governments could in theory increase their total spending by less than the amount of the transfer for example some of the money that would have been spent in the absence of the transfer could now be diverted to the states budget reserves but if states are facing budgetary shortfalls many would argue that in practice spending would increase by as much as the transfer

by lasting only temporarilyan increase in the budget deficit for one year would lead to significantly less crowding out over time than permanent increase in the deficit among policy options increases in public investment spending would minimize any negative effects on longrun gdp since decreases in the private capital stock would be offset by additions to the public capital stock also tax incentives to increase business investme nt would offset the crowding out effect since the spending increase was occurring via business investment

to date some economists have argued that as long as problems remain in these depressed sectors then generalized stimulus will only postpone the inevitable downturn as noted above separate legislation to support housing and financial markets was recently enacted for example goldman sachs predicted that by the fourth quarter of 2008 the effect of the rebates on gdp will have worn off at which point we foresee renewed stagnation in us output 30 other economists argue that if the current housing bust is being caused by the unwinding of bubble then it could be detrimental for the government to interfere with natural market adjustment which is bringing those markets back to equilibrium that in the long run is both necessary and unavoidable and some would argue that the best way to help troubled sector is by boosting overall demand g11g156g561g3g141g141g146g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g8g146g156g140g138g149g561g21g157g146g150g158g149g158g156g561g16g142g142g141g142g141g501g561 the economy naturally experiences boom and bust pattern called the business cycle recession can be characterized as situation where total spending in the economy aggregate demand is too low to match the economys potential output aggregate supply as result some of the economys labor and capital resources lay idle causing unemployment and low capacity utilization rate respectively recessions generally are shortterm in natureeventually markets adjust and bring spending and output back in line even in the absence of policy intervention31 policymakers may prefer to use stimulative policy to attempt to hasten that adjustment process in order to avoid the detrimental effects of cycl ical unemployment by definition stimulus proposal can be judged by its effectiveness at boosting total spending in the economy total spending includes personal consumption business investment in plant and equipment residential investment net exports exports less imports and government spending effective stimulus could boost spending in any of these categories fiscal stimulus can take the form of higher government spending direct spending or transfer payments or tax reductions but generally it can boost spending only through larger budget deficit deficitfinanced increase in government spending directly boosts spending by borrowing to finance higher government spending or transfer payments to households deficit financed tax cut indirectly boosts spending if the recipient uses the tax cut to increase his spending if an increase in spending or tax cut is financed through decrease in other spending 30

spending could be largely inflationarysince there would be idle resources to bring back into production when spending is boosted the boost would instead bid up the prices of those resources eventually causing all prices to rise because total spending can be boosted only temporarily stimulus has longterm benefits and may have longterm costs most notably the increase in the budget deficit crowds out private investment spending because both must be financed out of the same finite pool of national saving with the greater demand for saving pushing up interest rates 32 to the extent that private investment is crowded out by larger deficit it would reduce the future size of the economy since the economy would operate with smaller capital stock in the long run in recent years the us economy has become highly dependent on foreign capital to finance business investment and budget deficits33 since foreign capital can come to the united states only in the form of trade deficit higher budget deficit could result in higher trade deficit in which case the higher trade deficit could dissipate the boost in spending as consumers purchase imported goods indeed conventional economic theory predicts that fiscal policy has stimulative effect in an economy with perfectly mobile capital flows 34 some economists argue that these costs outweigh the benefits of fiscal stimulus main factor in another round of fiscal stimulus may be the size of the current budget deficit stimulus proposals for 2009 are relatively large and some observers believe the deficit will already exceed 1 trillion in 2009 deficits of this magnitude could set peacetime record relative to gdp although current government borrowing rates are extremely low because of the financial turmoil there is fear that deficit of this size could become burdensome to service when interest rates return to normal larger deficit could eventually crowd out private investment act as drag on economic growth and increase reliance on foreign borrowing which would result in larger trade deficit by doing so the deficit places burden on future generations and could further complicate the task of coping with longterm budgetary pressures caused by the aging of the population 35 in the highly unlikely worst case scenario if too much pressure is placed on the deficit through competing policy priorities then investors could lose faith in the governments ability to service the debt and borrowing rates could spike many of these issues could be avoided if the elements of the stimulus package are temporary although there is often later pressure to extend policies beyond their original expiration date in judging the need for an additional stimulus package policymakers might also consider that stimulus is being delivered from two other sources first the federal budget has automatic 32 crowding out is likely to be less of concern when the economy is in recession since recessions are typically characterized by falling business investment 33 if foreign borrowing prevents crowding out the future size of the economy will not decrease but capital income will accrue to foreigners instead of americans 34 for more

and thereby stimulate the economy during downturn in the absence of policy changes when the economy slows entitlement spending on programs such as unemployment compensation benefits automatically increases as program participation rates rise and the growth in tax revenues automatically declines as the recession causes the growth in taxable income to decline second any consideration for additional stimulus has to include the cost of that stimulus according to the congressional budget offi ce cbo the total deficit in fy2008 was 455 billion or 32 of gross domestic product sh arply higher than the fy2007 deficit of 162 billion in january 2008 cbo had projected that under current policy the budget deficit would increase by 56 billion in 2008 compared to 2007 when the cost of the february 2008 stimulus package and part of the cost of financial market intervention in the fall of 2008 is added the increase in the deficit for one year rose by nearly 300 billion 36 additional fiscal stimulus in 2009 could cause similar increases in year over year deficits from fy2008 to fy2009 third the federal reserve has already delivered large monetary stimulus by the end of april 2008 the fed had reduced overnight interest rates to 2 from 525 in september 200737 on december 16 the interest rate was lowered to targeted range of 0 to 025 typically lower interest rates stimulate the economy by increasing the demand for interestsensitive spending which includes investment spending residential housing and consumer durables such as automobiles yet the potential for stimulus caused by lower interest rates can be limited if tight credit markets constrain borrowing in addition lower interest rates can stimulate the economy by reducing the value of the dollar all else equal which would lead to higher exports and lower imports 38 one might take the view that the federal reserve has chosen monetary policy that it believes will best avoid recession given the actions already taken if it has chosen that policy correctly an argument can be made that an additional fisc stimulus is unnecessary since the economy is already receiving the correct boost in spending through lower interest rates and through the first stimulus package in this light additional fiscal policy would be useful only if monetary policy is unable to adequately boost spendingeither because the fed has chosen an incorrect policy or because the fed cannot boost spending enough through lower interest rates to avoid recession and direct intervention in financial markets is not adequate 39 finally some economists argue that if the root of the problem is concentrated in the housing and financial sectors the economy is unlikely to return to sustainable expansion until those problems 36 in march 2008 cbo projected the budget deficit for fy2008 compared to fy2007 to increase to 193 billion largely reflecting the stimulus package of 153 billion offset by some other small reductions note also that in january cbo estimated that if supplemental military spendi ng to maintain current troop levels overseas and an alternative minimum tax patch are enacted and expiring tax provisions are extended the 2008 deficit could increase by 98 billion in total compared to 2007 this projection was made in the absence of stimulus legislation and would increase the 56 billion deficit increase by 42 billion 37

financial legislation in 2008 as described above but it remains to be seen whether they have been solved if so fiscal stimulus may at most provide temporary boost as long as those problems are outstanding but cannot singlehandedly shift the economy to sustainable path of expansion for example the first stimulus package enacted in the first quarter of 2008 did not prevent the economy from deteriorating in the third quarter of 2008

interventions in the economy occurred in 2008 which could be seen as type of stimulus in part because of credit problems one indication of restricted credit despite stimulative federal reserve monetary policy was the failure of mortgage rates to fall significantly instead the spread between treasuries and government sponsored enterprise gse bonds remained elevated over the summer the newly created federal housing finance agency fhfa cited the persistence of this wide spread as major factor in its decision to place the gses in conservatorship in september during the week of september 1519 financial markets were further disturbed by the bankrupt cy of investment bank lehman brothers and federal reserve intervention on behalf of the insurer aig these actions eroded market confidence further resulting in sudden spike of the commercial paper rate spread from just under 90 basis points to 280 basis points spike that in times past might have been called panic if financial market confidence is not rest ored and private market spreads remain elevated the broader economy could slow more due to difficulties in financing consumer durables business investment college education and other big ticket items in september 2008 administration and federal reserve officials with the bipartisan support of the congressional leadership announced massive intervention in the financial markets requesting authority to purchase up to 700 billion in assets over the next two years the treasury had also provided insurance for money market funds where withdrawals have been significant congressional leaders and other members raised number of issues and made some additional proposals which included setting up an oversight mechanism restrictions on executive compensation of firms from which assets are purchased acquiring equity stakes in the participating firms and allowing judges to reduce mortgage debt in bankruptcies not included in the final act later in october 2008 legislation pl 110343 was enacted to allow an initial 250 billion of financing with an additional 100 billion upon cert ification of need with congress allowed 30 days to object to the final 350 billion the plan has oversight by an inspector general audit by the government accountability office setting standards of appropriate compensation and providing for equity positions in all participa ting companies the final package also added an expansion of deposit insurance coverage there remained however concerns about how to price acquired assets in way that balances protection of taxpayers with providing adequate assistance to firms the treasury had indicated use of reverse auction mechanism to purchase mortgage backed securities where companies will bid to sell their assets it is not clear how well such an auction would work with heterogeneous assets 40 40 see crs report rl34707 auction basics background for assessing proposed treasury purchases of mortgage backed securities by d

billion authorized to purchase preferred stock in financial institutions and has now indicated it will use subsequent funds for capital injections consumer credit such as auto loans student loans small business loans and credit cards and mortgage assistance41 congressional leaders urged treasury to provide 25 billion in aid to us auto manufacturers42 on november 10 restructuring of government assistance to aig was announced which increased the amount at risk from 1437 billion to 1734 billion extended the loan length and reduced the interest rate the federal reserve also announced on october 14 that it would begin purchasing commercial paper 43 news reports indicated the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic had plan supported by many congressional democrats to offer financial incentives to companies that agree to reduce monthly mortgage payments but that this pl an was opposed by the bush administration44 on november 23 the government announced plan to assist citicorp and on november 25 the federal reserve revealed plans to purchase 200 billion in asset backed securities through the term assetbacked securities loan facility talf these securities are based on auto credit card student and small business loans the federal reserve also announced plan to purchase 600 billion of mortgage related securities owned or guaranteed by the housing gses much of the intervention up to this point had been in the financial markets however the detroit three automakers gm ford and chrysler asked for 34 billion in loans to forestall bankruptcy after congress did not adopt an emergency loan of 14 billion in special postelection session in december 2008 the administration announced on december 19 that it would provide 174 billion from tarp 94 billion to gm and 4 million to chrysler an additional 4 billion would be made available for gm if the remaining 350 billion in tarp funds is approved on december 30 6 billion in tarp funds were provided for gmac the auto financing company among the issues of concern with financial interventions is whether an ad hoc casebycase intervention is likely to be successful strategy casebycase strategy can create uncertainty and also moral hazard causing firms to undertake too much risk if they expect to be rescued the creation of tarp represents shift to more broadbased approach the approach of broad based intervention could take the form of the purchase of troubled assets as originally proposed or the injection of capital such as the treasurys decision to purchase preferred stock 45 41 testimony of interim
