arrangement if the p ilot program receives further funding the data remain with the states in its report entitled creating trusted network for homeland security the markle foundations task fo rce on national security in the information age has suggested that unless consensus were found about the use of public and private sector data for criminal intelligence purposes efforts like matrix run the risk of being cut back or eliminated26 case in point would be the total information awareness tia program dod program th at generated controversy in 2002 when it became known that the defense advanced

used for processing analysis and collaboration tools for counterterrorism with foreign nexus28 some privacy advocates have compared matrix to the tia program29 while the matrix pilot project is on smaller scale than the tia program both programs are affected by many of the same laws and underlying privacy issues30 the fdle however maintains that matrix is not similar to tia31 matrix queries

by actual criminal investigations he argues that matrix is an investigative tool which will not be used indiscriminately to conduct surveillance on individuals and that the system is designed to guard against inappropriate or unauthorized use37 privacy concerns privacy advocates civil libertarians and others object to the matrix pilot project because it could give the government greater and easier access to vast amounts of both public and possibly privat sector data that are gathered oftentimes with expectations of privacy for purposes other than law enforcement they are also concerned with the quality of these data and the ability of individuals to correct faulty or invalid data about themselves prosp ect that would require some transparency in regard to the system and its data sources this would be especially important for any system that would be used to screen persons and may result in the denial of benefit the ability to travel or some other activity privacy advocates civil libertarians and others reportedly object to the possibility that the government could launch initiatives with the aid of computer programs algorithms that could be used to electronically search for or monitor patterns of suspicious behavi or of persons whom the g overnment previously had reason to suspect of criminal or terrorist activities38 in addition they are concerned about the characteristics such as life styl ethnicity religious faith or income status with which the government may choose to profile i ndividuals under certain circumstances with this

enforcement respons ibilities for example some state that such capabilities could be used to provide valuable leads for child abductions or to identify the whereabouts of known alqaed operatives while many may agree with these uses under certain circumst ances there may also be concern about mission creep39 as these same capabilities could be used to monitor the activities of social activists and

mining for counterterrorism purposes according to the markle foundation task force on national security in the information age in the past decade the quantity of personal data held by the private sector has exploded as computing and storage capabilities have rapidly advanced and associated costs have correspondingly diminished40 the same could be said of public data held by federal state and local governments much public and private sector data have been aggregated into data marts this information is often available commercially for sale from companies specializing in data aggregation
