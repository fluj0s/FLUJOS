person information included within this type of metadata there are special rules and procedures we must follow when acquiring processing accessing storing sharing and disseminating this information this metadata is highly sensitive which is why we have this specialized training tssinf in this course we discuss the metadata we collect how we collect it what we are permitted to do with it as well

perform sigint functions under various fisa authorities to include nsa fisa fbi fisa fisa amendments act faa section 702 704 and 705b while there are specific rules governing when and how these authorities may be applied each of these authorities has the potential to provide valuable and unique complement to our eo 12333 collection resources similarly the br and prtt bulk metadata programs provide analysts with another opportunity to gain unique collection on target by leveraging as many of these various collection authorities available to them as permitted analysts can fill existing knowledge gaps on their target tssinf one prime example of how an analyst leveraged several of these collection authorities to close crucial knowledge gaps on target occurred in fall 2009 when ct

prtt programs have in common then is that they both exclusively involve metadata and allow for queries of identifiers belonging to us persons tssinf unlike spcma however the br and prtt programs authorize the acquisition of unselected bulk metadata because of the sensitivity of this metadata it may only be queried with identifiers for which ras exists to believe that the identifier is
