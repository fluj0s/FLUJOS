levels of economic development from the least developed to the most highly developed economies the wto came into existence in january 1995 as part of the agreements reached by the signatories to the general agreement on tariffs and trade ga tt at the end of the uruguay round negotiations the wtos primary purpose is to administer the roughly 60 agreements and separate commitments made by its members as part of the ga tt for trade in goods the general agreement on trade in services ga tsfor trade in services and the agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips the membership in the gattwto has grown exponentially the gatt was originally founded in 1947 by 23 countries and the wto now has 151 members vietnam and tonga are the newest two members having joined on january 11 2007 and july 27 2007 respectively membership in the wto commits its members to fundamental principles in trade with other members including mostfavored nation treatment mfn the imports of goods and services originating from one member country will be treated less favorably than imports of goods and services from any other member country mfn is to be unconditional in practical terms this means that in most cases country cannot apply higher import tariff to good from one member country than it applies to like goods from any other member country national treatment imports of goods and services are treated less favorably than like goods and services produced domestically in practical terms this means that governments cannot discriminate against imports in the application of laws and regulations such as regulations to protect consumer safety or the environment transparency government laws and regulations that affect foreign trade and investment are to be published and available for anyone to see procedures to implement the laws and regulations are to be open lowering trade barriers through negotiations since the ga tts creation its members have conducted eights rounds of negotiations to lower trade barriers at first these negotiations focused on lowering tariffs but over time the rounds have broadened ga ttwto coverage to include nontariff barriers such as

government policies and practices pertaining to intellectual property rights protection and foreign investment regulations that affect trade reliance on tariffs in order to promote predictability and openness in commerce the wto requires member countries to use tariffs and avoid using quotas or other nontariff measures when restricting imports for legitimate purposes such as on injurious imports as part of its function to administer the rules established under the agreements the wto provides mechanism for the settlement of disputes between members where the dispute involves alleged violations of wto agreements moreover each members trade regime is reviewed by the wto secretariat from timetotime to ensure that it conforms to wto rules trade among wto members accounts for about 90 of total world trade 4 the collapse of the soviet union and its east european bloc and the movement of many developing countries toward liberal trade policies have spurred interest in joining the wto article xii of the agreement that established the wto sets out the requirements and procedures for countries to accede any state or customs territory having full autonomy in the conduct of its trade policies is eligible to accede to the wto on terms agreed between it and wto members the accession process begins with letter from the applicant to the wto requesting membership the wto general council the governing body of the wto when the ministerial conference is not meeting forms working party wp to consider the application membership in the wp is open to any interested membercountry more than sixty member countries including the united states are part of the wp the us delegation is led by the assistant us trade representative for wto and multilateral affairs and includes representatives from the us departments of commerce and agriculture the applicant submits memorandum to the wp that describes in detail its current trade regime the applicant and the wp then negotiate to determine what legislative and structural changes the applicant must make to meet wto requirements and to establish the terms and conditions for entry of the applicant into the wto the wps findings are then included in report of the working party and are the basis for drawing up the protocol of accession while it negotiates with the wp the applicant must also conduct bilateral negotiations with each interested wto member during these negotiations the wto member indicates what concessions and commitments on trade in goods and services it expects the applicant to make in order to gain entry and the applicant indicates what concessions and commitments it is willing to make until the two agree and set down the terms the terms of the bilateral agreements are combined into one document which will apply on an mfn basis to all wto members once the applicant has joined the wto the accession package is conveyed to the general council or ministerial conference for approval article xii does not establish deadline for the process the length of the process depends on number of factors how many legislative and structural changes an applicant must make in its trade regime in order to meet the demands of the wp how quickly its national and subnational 4 based on wto background information located at httpwwwwtoorg httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31979g20g158g156g156g146g138g514g156g561g3g140g140g142g156

accession is political process as well as legal process its success depends on the political will of all sidesthe wto member countries and the applicant country formal vote is taken in the wto that requires 23 majority for accession although in practice the wto has sought to gain consensus on each application the process can take long time chinas application took over 15 years

1947 after it declined to join the international monetary fund imf and the world bankthe other two multilateral organizations that resulted from the bretton woods conference immediately following the end of world war ii in fact soviet trade and economic policy conflicted with the principles of the ga tt the gatt was based on removing barriers to trade and on developing economic interdependence among countries soviet foreign economic policy was largely based on the concept of selfsufficiencythe domestic economy would produce as much as possible for itself and import only those products which it could not produce exports were used merely to buy necessary imports not to build markets these economic policies helped to bring about the collapse of the soviet union the soviet union modified the concept of selfsufficiency to include members of the soviet blocthe east european countries some asian communist countries and cuba confining most of its trade with these countries in system of limited international division of labor only small am ount of trade was conducted outside the bloc the soviet union spearheaded the formation of the council for mutual economic assistance cmea what could be loosely described as the soviet blocs version of the gatt in august 1986 the soviet union applied to take part in the uruguay round negotiations of the gatt as an observer with the intention of becoming full member the united states and other western industrialized countries opposed the request because of the soviet unions central planning economic system 5 in 1990 however the soviet union received observer status to the uruguay round negotiations after ga tt signatories including the united states concluded that the soviet union was moving toward becoming an open economy under president mikhail gorbachev 6 after the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 russia retained the observer status held by the soviet union and in june 1993 it formally applied to accede to the ga tt on june 16 1993 the gatt established working party on russias accession and in january 1995 the application was converted to an application to become member of the wto 5 it should be noted that other nonmarket economies had acceded to the gatt albeit under special conditions poland 1967 hungary 1973 and romania 1971 the united states was also concerned that the soviet union intended to use gatt membership for political purpose s the soviet union sought observer status once before in 1982 kennedy kevin c the accession of the soviet union to the gatt journal of world trade law april 1987 p

efforts to dismantle the soviet economic system of central planning and replace it with more market based economy president putin has made entry into the wto top priority because he sees it as mechanism for overcoming the political hurdles that have impeded economic restructuring the possibility of accession to the wto has been an opportunity for him to get some significant economic reform legislation through the russian parliament many russian and foreign experts have argued that these reforms and more are necessary if russia is to achieve longterm economic growth and development at the same time number of economic interest groups that favor the statusquo such as agriculture the auto industry and raw material producers have fought against economic reforms and oppose russian accession to the wto g6g152g150g142g156g157g146g140g561g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g5g152g151g141g146g157g146g152g151g156g561 russia has enjoyed economic growth measured in annual changes in gdp since 1999 russian gdp increased 54in 1999 91 in 2000 and 51 in 2001 47 in 2002 73 in 2003 72 in 2004 64 in 2005 67 in 2006 and 81 in 20077 but the growth occurred after long period of economic stagnation during the final years of the soviet union and deep recessiondepression during the 1990s many specialists have attributed the economic growth to the depreciation of the ruble at the end of the 1990s and to the rise in world energy prices since 2001 however russia has been plagued by economic problems including high poverty rate and poor health conditions in addition economic growth has taken place unevenly throughout the country with the major cities of moscow and st pete rsburg and regions wellendowed with marketable natural resources accounting for most of the economic growth while less fortunate regions remained stagnant or have become poorer moreover income distribution among the russian population has become increasingly unequal as small portion of the population acquires larger shares of wealth

largely due to the rapid growth in the value of russian exports of crude oil natural gas other fuels and other natural resources in 2006 russias current account surplus was 956 billion an increase from 291 billion in 2002 it declined to 783 billion in 200710 however the surpluses could prove ephemeral russia exports primarily raw materials for which market prices tend to be highly volatile in 2006 oil natural and fuel such as coal accounted for 65 of total russian exports of goods metal and chemicals accounted for another 20 11 while russia has clearly benefitted from current high prices for fuels more diversified trade structure could stabilize its trade situation russian imports especially of machinery and equipment and of processed foods have increased sharply recently12 foreign direct investment in russia has surged in the last few years indicating some investor confidence in russian economic prospects despite putin government measures to renationalize the energy sector in 2002 35 billion in foreign direct investment fdi flowed into russia in contrast 550 billion in fdi flowed into russia in 200713 the level of foreign direct investment is still considered low given the size and needs of the russian economy

planning was bound to be more difficult and longer than that of the central and east european states the communist system was much more entrenched in the soviet union than it was in the rest of the soviet bloc furthermore russia does not have legacy of market economy to draw on as is the case with some of the central and east european countries russia has had to deal with the legacy of soviet economy that was administered to meet the needs of the military while civilian production and investment were given low priority however russias economic problems also were the result of policy failures during the transition these failures included loose monetary and fiscal policies early in the transition period they have also included structural problems such as poorly developed and executed privatization programs that have left many potentially productive assets in the control of enterprise mangers from the soviet period or in the hands of few politicallyconnected individuals oligarchs who extracted the value from many of these assets rather than making them commercially viable for the long run in addition an inefficient banking system the lack of private land ownership protection the absence of adequate commercial ws and an inefficient and corrupt government bureaucracy have inhibited economic growth and development despite the setbacks russia has made some important strides the government has eliminated price controls on most goods and services this reform has been important because it allows the market forces of supply and demand to guide producers and consumers on purchasing production and investment controls have remained on some important items such as energy housing and transportation but these too are to be removed eventually 10 economist

open economy than of militarized economy for example the services sector once minor part of soviet economy has emerged in the postsoviet russian economy and now accounts for more than half of national output the private sector has grown and accounts for roughly 34 of national output since taking the reins of power president putin has forced russia into new phase of economic reform putin has enjoyed high degree of popularity among the russian people that has translated into overwhelming political clout in the russian parliament in addition the continuing period of economic growth has provided window of opportunity for putin and his government to tackle economic restructuring he has been able to push important economic legislation through the russian parliament tax reform land reform reform of government bureaucracy to make it more responsive to the needs of the economy rather than an impediment to development and growth judicial reform and improvement in corporate governance especially the protection of minority shareholders rights the fragile basis of russias economic growth strongly suggests that russia has far to go in economic reform analysts point to russias weak and underdeveloped financial sector poorly developed system of commercial laws and confusion over federal vs regional and local responsibilities in important economic policy areas furthermore even though russian laws have been passed to restructure the economy the success of their implementation remains to be seen furthermore since 2004 the putin government s shown signs of braking if not halting reforms and has reestablished state control over critical sectors particularly energy generating some skepticism regarding putins co mmitment to russian economic reform

in determining the terms and conditions for russias accession to the wto wp members scrutinize russias foreign trade and investment regimes and policies to ascertain to what degree they conform to wto rules and where russia needs to change russia has made significant strides in that regard it eliminated two important pillars of soviet central planning in november 1991 the state monopoly on foreign trade and the ban on foreign investment in the russian economy in october 1992 another legacy of central planni ng was eliminated when the russian ruble was made convertible into foreign currencies and mu ltiple exchange rates were eliminated dual exchange rate was briefly introduced in january 1999 as result of the august 1998 financial crisis but was eliminated in june 1999 in the early to mid1990s the central bank imposed fixed or pegged exchange rates in an attempt to control ruble depreciation since the august 1998 crisis the ruble has been allowed to float but the central bank of russia intervenes by buying or selling rubles the ruble has remained relatively stable since 1999 in 1992 the russian government adopted the harmonized tariff system that is used by wto members and it maintains system of twocolumn tariff ratesmfn and nonmfn tariff rates tariff rates on nonagricultural products range from 0 to 30 some countries receive tariff advantages under russias generalized

sector dominates the russian economy not only do oil natural gas and electricity drive industry and provide heat to residents but energy is also the largest russian export and hard currency earner the current structure of russias energy sector is largely legacy of the soviet union the oil industry has been broken up into several privatized companies natural gas and electricity are largely monopolies run by gazprom and united energy systems ues respectively which are jointstock companies with significant government ownership the structures of these companies are now the subject of reform but that process has proved politically controversial and therefore slow domestic prices for russian energy are regulated by the government while exports of energy products command world prices domestic prices are lower than world prices in some cases significantly although the russian government has been raising domestic energy prices and reducing the subsidies the eu and the united states have pointed out that the gap between the world price for natural gas and the russian domestic price has been as large as six to one for electricityfive to one and for oilfour to one 20 the dual pricing is partially result of policy of providing affordable heating and electricity to residential customers regardless of ability to pay and providing favorable fuels rates to enterprises and to government agencies such as the military 21 some wp members particularly the eu and to lesser extent the united states have raised concern that dual energy pricing gives russian manufacturers an unfair competitive advantage and would be illegal under the wto subsidy agreement22 wto disciplines regarding subsidies are contained in the agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures under the agreement s ubsidy is actionable only if it is specific subsidy that is it is subsidy that is available only to an enterprise an industry group of enterprises or industries in the country that gives the subsidy the agreement defines three kinds of subsidies prohibited subsidies are ones that distort international trade for example subsidies that require recipients to meet exports targets or to use domestic products these subsidies must be eliminated otherwise the country that complains about them can take countermeasures actionable subsidies are not prohibited unless it is determined that the subsidy causes injury if such determination is made then the complaining country can impose countervailing duty nonactionable subsidies are nonspecific or are specific subsidies for industrial research or development activity for assistance to disadvantaged regions or for adapting existing facilities to new environmental laws or regulations they cannot be challenged in the wto 23

russias energy pricing policies because natural gas is significant input in fertilizer production accounting for 34 of the final price according to one estimate24 the russian government and russian

that russias domestic energy prices reflect its comparative advantage in energy production the eu and russia came to an agreement on the dual energy pricing issue where russia agreed to gradually

the economy throughout russiansoviet history its political importance far outweighs its share of the russian economy 72 of russian gdp in 200130 agriculture has been severely affected by the transition to market economy as much as or more than any other sector of the economy according to one estimate agricultural production declined around 40 in volume terms since 1991 much of the decline occurring in livestock production31 several factors have contributed to the downturn one factor is soviet agriculture policy the soviet government determined what and how much the economy should produce and directed resources accordingly in the 1960s the government decided that the soviet people should eat more meat and it subsidized animal feed production and imports of animal feed to fulfill this objective the government set meat prices at low level to make it affordable to consumers however after the collapse of the soviet union market prices were instituted and state subsidies were dramatically cut increasing the cost of meat production 32 furthermore when the russian government liberalized trade russian producers of poultry and other meats could not compete with foreign producers who could sell them more cheaply while the russian federal government has cut support local and regional governments have continued to provide assistance in the form of equipment favorable credits and export subsidies they are concerned about food security and unemployment and about maintaining the supply of housing education and other services that state farms provided to the rural communities during the soviet period and continue to provide second factor contributing to the decline in agricultural production has been the slow pace of restructuring of russian farms despite the introduction of privatization the vast majority of former state and collective farms remain intact as joint stock operations or cooperatives and operate in virtually the same inefficient manner as they did under the soviet government 28 the estimates are according to the international intell ectual property rights alliance iipa nonprofit group representing copyrightbased industries

local governments and from factions within the russian parliament to protect agriculture from further erosion and to provide time and resources to permit it to become competitive this pressure has translated into difference in positions in the accession negotiations between russia and agricultural exporting countries including the united states canada and australia over the level and l ongevity of government support to agriculture the russian government has argued for higher levels and longer phaseout periods for supports than its negotiating partners are willing to accept russian negotiators have also asserted that it should not be required to bind itself to dramatically lower support levels during the accession process while other wto members are currently in the process of negotiating the agriculture subsidies in the current round of wto negotiations doha development agenda dda the wto members have argued that the subsidies that russia wants to maintain distort trade and are concerned that they give russian agriculture producers an unfair advantage the russian side has argued that without government support russian agriculture could not compete with eu and us agriculture both of which receive sizeable government subsidies 33 another controversy in agriculture has emerged over russias decision to restrict meat imports on january 23 2003 the russian government announced it would impose threeyear quota on poultry imports effective may 1 2003 at the same time the government announced tariffrate quotas trqs on imports of beef and pork effective april 1 2003 and to remain in effect until 2010 34 meat exporting wto membercountries including the united states canada argentina australia and new zealand have expressed stiff opposition claiming that the restrictions may retard the process of russias accession to the wto they specifically argued that russia has violated the standstill principle under which countries applying for wto membership are to refrain from imposing new trade restrictions during the accession process russia counters that it is imposing the restrictions to protect its domestic meat producers from import surges right that is enjoyed by wto members 35 during the uruguay round wto members agreed to expand disciplines over trade in agricultural products and agricultural trade is on the agenda of the

agreed in august 2002 on new veterinary certificate for us poultry that would include inspections by russian veterinarians of us processing and storage facilities but technical issues remained that prevented the process from being implemented on april 3 2003 the two sides announced the resolution of the problems allowing the inspection of the facilities to go forward and us poultry exports to

services were governmentowned and operated and were confined to personal services for example lodging hair salons restaurants they were not well developed because they were not government priority financial services were virtually nonexistent in the soviet union because their function as intermediaries between savers and borrowers of capital had role in the soviet planned economy the services sector has grown rapidly during russias transition to market economy but has not matured in most cases the united states the eu and other advanced developed wto members have argued that russia needs an efficient financial services industry to promote economic growth and development and that opening the industry to foreign investment would introduce expertise and new capital russian officials and business representatives claim that their service industries must have government protection as infant industries because they are too immature and would be wiped out if they had to face foreign competition too soon an example is the fledgling russian insurance industry private insurance companies have been developing since the government monopoly was removed after the collapse of the soviet union but not sufficiently to meet demand foreign insurance companies that could help fill the gap and bring expertise and wide range of products are restricted for example the government limits total foreign capitalization to 15 of the domestic insurance industry requires the general director and the chief accountant to be russian citizens restricts participation to foreign companies that have been in business less than 15 years in their home country and requires that foreign insurance companies operate as minority shareholder in russian insurance co mpany before they can be granted their

amendment to trade relations with russia russias current conditional ntr status from the united states is governed by title iv of the trade act of 1974 as amended section 401 of title iv requires the president to continue to deny ntr status to any country that was not receiving such treatment at the time of the laws enactment on january 3 1975 in effect this meant all communist countries except poland and yugoslav ia section 402 of title iv the jacksonvanik amendment denies the countries eligibility for ntr status as well as access to us government credit facilities such as the exportimport bank as long as the country denies its citizens the right of freedomofemigration these restrictions can be removed if the president determines that the country is in full compliance with the freedomofemigration conditions set out under the jacksonvanik amendment for country to retain that status the president must reconfirm his determination of full compliance in semiannual report by june 30 and december 31 to congress his determination can be overturned by congress via the enactment of joint resolution of disapproval at the time of the december 31 report the jacksonvanik amendment also permits the president to waive full compliance with the free emigration requirement if he determines that such waiver would promote the objectives of the amendment that is encourage freedom of emigration this waiver authority is subject to an annual renewal by the president and to congressional disapproval via joint resolution before country can receive ntr treatment under either the presidential determination of full compliance or the presidential waiver both the united states and the country in question must have concluded and enacted bilateral agreement that provides for among other things reciprocal extension of ntr or mfn status the agreement and presidential proclamation extending ntr status cannot go into effect until joint resolution approving the agreement is enacted in 1990 the united states and the soviet union signed bilateral trade agreement the agreement was subsequently applied to each of the former soviet states the united states first granted ntr treatment to russia under the presidential waiver authority beginning in june 1992 and since september 1994 under the full compliance provisi on presidential extensions of ntr status to russia have met with virtually congressional opposition russian political leaders have continually pressed the united states to graduate russia from jacksonvanik coverage entirely they see the amendment as cold war relic that does not reflect russias new stature as fledgling democracy and market economy moreover russian leaders argue that russia has implemented freedomofemigration policies since the fall of the communist government making the jacksonvanik conditions inappropriate and unnecessary while russia remains subject to the jacksonvanik amendment some of the other former soviet republics have been

process of making world trade rules we are already in the world trade but we have say in shaping the rules of trade this tends to stunt the russian economy and make it less competitive 53 53 annual

g344g344g561in acceding to the wto russia is making legally binding commitment to conform to wto rules in so doing it agrees to make its foreign trade and investment regimes open to the scrutiny of the wto and its members at the same time the wto provides multilateral forum for russia to settle trade disputes with other wto members as wto member russia will have voice in how those rules are made and implemented it would be major step in integrating russia within the international trade system but before it can accede to the wto russia must satisfy wto members that it is ready to meet its obligations the working party negotiations and the bilateral negotiations to date suggest that those countries are not satisfied and require that russia make major adjustments in policies and regulations the adjustments include reviewing and possibly changing more than 100 russian laws and reviewing more than 1000 international agreements that russia has with various countries54 however the overall impact of wto accession on russia will depend on the terms and conditions of accession that russian and its trading partners in the wto finally agree on in general russia will likely have to reduce tariffs and other protective measures for import sensitive industries such as autos and aircraft and will have to open up key financial service industriesbanking and insuranceto foreign competition in the short run such adjustments could lead to the loss of jobs in those areas and the need for the russian government to provide unemployment insurance and other adjustment assistance however globally competitive industries such as the raw material producers could see markets abroad opening up and an increase in foreign investment as accession forces russia to restructure its economy in the long run mainstream economic theory and the record of economies that have gone through similar transitions suggest that trade liberalization will lead to more efficient russian economy and to raising the living standard of the average russian citizen 55 new industries will probably emerge over time helping to diversify the russian economy the russian business community is divided on the issue of accession some have expressed skepticism if not out right opposition to accession among this group is oleg deripaska an influential and powerful aluminum and auto business magnate he is concerned that wto accession will force russia to eliminate protection and that the domestic auto industry will face competition from us european and japanese manufacturers he is also concerned that russia would have to charge higher prices for energy major input in aluminum production similarly representatives of aviation furniture financial services telecommunications and agriculture have asserted that russia stands to lose more than it will gain from accession because russia has not matured sufficiently to meet the competition 56 continued federation moscow april 18 2002

regional political leaders in the major business centers of moscow and st petersburg and in regions where raw material production is located political leaders in regions where fledgling importsensitive manufacturers are located have been skeptical or opposed to accession for most russians accession has not attracted much interest57 putin and the current russian political leadership have made economic growth and development their highest priority and they view russias admission into the wto as an essential part of the strategy to fulfill those goals putin appears to view the accession process as way of forcing the government bureaucracy the duma and russian industry to confront the changes that are required if russia is to attain longterm sustainable economic growth and development while putins political future probably does not depend directly on whether russia gets into the wto it will likely be evaluated on the basis to what degree economic life in russia has improved wto accession would be further sign of russias acceptance and participation in the major multilateral economic institutions the world bank the international monetary fund and the g 8 in so doing russia would distance itself further from its soviet past

may improve the business climate in russia which has been unpredictable the us business community often cites poor intellectual property rights protection inconsistent and opaque customs regulations inconsistent enforcement of the regulations and irrational sps and technical trade barriers as among the impediments to trade and investment accession could bring more stability and openness in the business climate since russia would have to adhere to wto rules that promote these conditions the volume of us imports from russia has been low primarily because russias limited export base nevertheless some us importsensitive industries for example steel may face increased competition from russian producers these industries may press us negotiators to include as part of the terms and conditions for russias accession special safeguard provision beyond that provided in the wto agreements that would cushion the potentially adverse impact of large increase in russian imports upon accession such provision was included in the conditions for chinas accession to the wto and was codified in us law as section 421 of the trade act of 1974 similar to section 201 escape clause provision of the trade act of 1974 section 421 allows the united states to temporarily restrict fairly traded imports that cause or threaten to cause injury to the domestic injury unlike section 201 however section 421 permits the restrictions to be applied solely to imports of like products from china rather than requiring them to be applied on an mfn basis on imports of like products from all countries in addition the required thresholds of cause and level of injury to the domestic industry for relief under section 421 is lower than under section 201 section 201 requires that imports be substantial cause of serious injury whereas section 421 requires only that the imports be significant cause of material injury for many in the us business and agricultural community the issue is not whether russia should 57 eastwest institute regional report vol 7 22 july 10 2002 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31979g20g158g156g156g146g138g514g156g561g3g140g140g142g156

most populous country that is not member of the wto if russia accedes it would significantly expand the geographical coverage of wto rules to all major economies leading to larger degree of stability and transparency to the international trading system at the same time russias entry into the wto would continue trend in which as the membership of the wto becomes larger and more diverse it becomes more difficult for that membership to reach consensus on important issues in addition trade disputes between russia and its trading partners will be brought to the wto for resolution rather than addressed bilaterally adding to the ever growing caseload of the wto as an economy still in transition russia would bring its own perspective to wto negotiations for example russia could be expected to challenge the positions the united states and other countries have taken in the wto on the role of subsidies in trade and the degree to which trade in services should be liberalized
