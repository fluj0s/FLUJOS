management wg through the cfacc dgsx intends to test dcgs 102 ingest capabiliti of other available imagery from additional platforms during ec08 significant issues dib federation is only partially complete continue to work through compatibility issues with the different dib versions spread amongst the ddte nodes some system baseline changes are required in order to overcome some of the compatibility problems however this places the site ddte accreditation at risk working to identify window of opportunity to take down the ddte connection in order to apply the changes and run the security accreditation scripts without impacting ec08 operations summary success continued progress regarding dib federation dgsx has expanded their federation effort to include partial federation with six additional nodes on top of the two nodes completely federated with lesson learned dgsx is not set up to ingest fmv data on the ddte network need to ensure the jisrm personnel are aware of the dgsx tped capabilities to facilitate appropriate tasking additional comments was logged onto iws all day and did not see any other sites available on the server collaboration with other sites is difficult over voip due to busy phone lines it may be easier to communicate if key site pers onnel are available on iws in order to receive chat communications regarding any issues that need to be worked even if the person receiving the message is busy on the voip it is likely that they would see the message on chat when they ca back to their workstation some people may be using adobe connect

in place this will impact the ability to do dib federat ion for anyone on cfe ie 513th and dcgsa at echo and sharing between the ddte nodes and cfe will occur crossdomain guards are supposed to be in place by cob end of this week dib v13b2 patch install and testing wi ll occur this week or early next week imagery products products collected received mti data from astor sentinel summary successes dcgsa v31 ft monmouth was able to f ederate with dgsx and pull metadata on 1200 products this was not accomplished for multiple reasons during jefx those reasons became lessons learned and allowed us to overcome potential issues in ec08 cgs served for the first time as the astor sentinel ground station and passed collected data to dcgsa v30 other dcgs systems were able to pull th is data for viewing via the dib over the ddte network only few minutes of data was collected bec ause of some issues with the sensor on the astor sentinel aircraft where help is needed cross domain guard solution is an overall ec08 problem if not resolved quickly it will prohibit anyone on ddte from passing data to the coalition network and vice versa the dcgsa nodes at echo range and the 513th which reside on the coalition network and without cross domain guard will not be able to pass data back and forth to ddte additional comments dcgsa v31 dib federation status as of 15 july 2008 dcgsmc teg main

script analysts that should not have seen the actual mda target sites were able to download the kml from the cfe wiki where it was posted for all to see where help is needed it would be helpful to have more collection platforms data available live we realize why they are not but because they are not this week has turned more into preparation week as opposed to an operational week it will give
