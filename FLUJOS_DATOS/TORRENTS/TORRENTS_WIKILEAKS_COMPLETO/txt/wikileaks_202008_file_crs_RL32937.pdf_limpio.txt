cse program has evolved into multifaceted program while costrecovery still remains an important function of the program other aspects of the program include service delivery and promotion of selfsufficiency and parental responsibility the cse program has helped strengthen families by securing financial support for children from their noncustodial parent on consistent and continuing basis and by helping some families to remain selfsufficient and off public assistance by providing the requisite cse services child support payments now are generally recognized as very important income source for singleparent families on average child support constitutes 17 of family inco for households that receive it 2001 data among poor families who receive it child suppor t constitutes about 30

families and provide stable source of income for all singleparent families with noncustodial parent although both bills share identical objectives with respect to simplifying cse assignment and distribution rules and strengthening the family first policies started in the1996 welfare reform law the approaches used differ both bills revise some cse enforcement tools and add others the senate finance committeereported bill includes larger list of cse provisions than does the house subcommittee bill this section of the report does not discuss all of the cse provisions included in s 667 and hr 240 for description of all of the cse provisions in s 667 as reported by th senate finance committee and hr 240 as approved by the house ways and means subcommittee on human resources see table 1 in the last section of this repor t which provides sidebyside bill comparison assignment of child support rights as condition of receiving tanf bene fits family must assign their child support rights to the state assignment rules determine who s legal claim on the child support payments owed by the noncustodial parent the child support assignment covers any child support th at accrues while the family receives tanf benefits as well as any child support that accrued before the family started receiving tanf benefits assigned child support collections are not paid to families but rather this revenue is kept by states and the federal government as partial reimbursement for welfare benefits nonwelfare families who apply for cse services do not assign their child support righ ts to the state and thereby receive all of the child support collected on their behalf an extremely important feature of the ssignment process is the date on which an assignment was entered if the assign ment was entered on or before september 30 1997 then preassistance and duringa ssistance arrearages are permanently assigned to the state if the assign ment was entered on or after october 1 1997 then only the arrearages which accumulate while the family receives assistance are permanently assigned the familys preassistance arrearages are temporarily assigned and the right to those arrearages goes back to the family when it leaves tanf unless the arrearages are collected through the federal income tax refund offset program under s 667 as reported by the sena finance committee the child support assignment would only cover any child s upport that accrues while the family receives tanf benefits this would mean that any child support arrearages that accrued before the family started receiving tanf be nefits would not have to be assigned to the state even temporarily and thereby an child support collected on behalf of the formertanf family for preassistance rrearages would go to the family in contrast hr 240 as approved by th house ways and means subcommittee on human resources does not make any change s regarding the child support assignment rules httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32937crs5 6

other words the distribution rules determine which claim is paid first when child support collection occurs the order of payment of the child support collection is of tremendous importance because in many cases pastdue child support ie arrearages are never fully paid tanf families while the family receives tanf benefits the state is permitted to retain any cu rrent support and any assigned arrearages it collects up to the cumulative amount of tanf benefits which has been paid to the family the 1996 welfare law pl 104193 repeal ed the 50 required pass through6 and gave states the choice to decide how much if an of the state share some all none of child support payments collected on be half of tanf families to send the fa mily states also decide whether to treat child support payments as income to the family while states have discretion over their sh are of child support collections pl 104 193 required states to pay the federal gove rnment the federal governments share of child support collections collected on behalf of tanf families this means that the state and not the federal government bears the entire cost of any child support passed through to and disregarded by fa

federal cost sharing to states to direct more of the child support coll ected on behalf of tanf families to the families themselves often referred to as familyfirst policy as opposed to using such collections to reimburse state and federal coffers for welfare benefits paid to the families however the approaches of the bills differ with respect to the amount of federal costsharing provided and whether to help states pay for the current cost of their cse passthrough and disr egard policies or to encourage states to establish such policies or increase the passthrough and disregard already in place under s 667 as reported by the nate finance committee the federal government would share in the costs of the entire amount of passthrough and disregard policies used by states s 667 would allow states to pay up to 400 per month in child support collected on behalf of tanf or foster care family 600 per month to family with two or more children to the family and would not require the state to

the house subcommittee on human resources would allow states to increase the amount of collected child support they pay to families receiving tanf benefits and would not require the state to pay the

any child support arrearages that accrue during the time the family is on tanf belong to the state and federal government one of the goals of the 1996 welfare reform law with regard to cse distribution provisions was to create distribution priority that favored families once they leave the tanf rolls thus generally speaking under current law child support that accrues before and after fa mily r eceives tanf goes to the family whereas child support that accrues while the family is receiving tanf go to the state this additional family income is expected to reduce dependence on public assistance by both promoting exit from tanf and preventing entry and reentry to tanf s 667 as reported by the senate fi nance committee would give states the option of distributing to former tanf families the full amount of child support collected on their behalf ie both curre nt support and all child support arrearages including arrearages collected throug h the federal income tax refund
