apparent duplication of efforts between ojps gran t programs as well as grant programs administered by other offices in doj and the various bureaus within ojp that were charged with administering grants congress stressed the need for management structure that would allow for great er centralization of accountability and responsibility for obligation of all ojp funds2 to achieve this goal

management challenges in doj for the years 20022004 note that ojp c ontinues to have pr oblems managing its grants43 according to the oig part of the problem stems from the large influx of grant funds into doj since the passage of the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 pl 103322 like gao the oig found that many grantees were not submitting their progress reports or financial reports in addition oigs audits found that sitev isit reviews were not consiste ntly addressing all of the grant conditions44 in its fy2003 memorandum the oig found dojs grant programs to be

regarding ojp grant program evaluations and compliance monitoring at issue for congress is wh ether ojp has done enough to fully correct the identified deficiencies in its management and oversight of its grant programs or whether another level of oversight is necessary to streamline ojp grant programs and improve efficiency through greater monito ring of programs the gao and the oig reports raise questions about whether the current organizational structure of ojp is capable of properly managing its grant programs are grant managers at ojp accountable for the performance of the gran ts they manage has ojp done enough to train grant managers to address the issues reported by the gao and the oig when monitoring their grants has the administration taken the steps necessary to ensure that
