the north american market for surface activity measuring instrume nts is highly fragmented and characterized by fierce competition and pricing pressu res the following is list and brief description of the competitors kibron will need to face for tering the north american market along with some comments cahn instruments cahn instrume nts is manufacturer of thermal analysis and surface science instruments analytical micro and laboratory balances the company was acquired by thermo electron corporation and sells its products now under the name the rmocahn with this chan has gained very large sales force and distributorship however the sales representatives have very poor understanding of tensiometers and their applications cahns tensi ometers are fairly old in design and the surface tensioncmc software is difficult to install use and is ms do s based company headquarters united states north american distributor thermo electron instruments tensiometers ringplate cmc capabilities contac t angle technical specifications satisfactory price 1400000 and up brand name recognitionreputation satisfactory comments thermo electron is large international and publicly traded company that offers thousand of products with the tensiometers making up minute percentage of sales the main reason for thermo electrons acquisition of cahn was to enable it the claim of offering complete surface science solution to their clients we believe that despit its past successes cahn is on the border of becoming obsolete without complete refocus and effort by the rmo electron corporation something that we feel is unlikely camtel ltd camtel is both manufacturer of nsiometers and langmuir troughs in addition to being reseller for other companies such as sita messe gmbh and first n angstroms camtel does sell directly into the north american ma rket from england however the company has brand name recognition and its product lineup is weak from techn ical point of view camtels tensiometers are weak with the top of the line instrument hav ing resolution of only 1 dynescm not much is known about their more recently developed langmuir throu gh though the technical specs look fine the company claims it is current ly developing new products with additional outside funding company headquarters great britain north american distributor none instruments tensiometers ringplate cmc capabilities langmuir trough technical specifications poor price 1500000 and up brand name recognitionreputation poor comments unless substantial changes occur within the companies marketing approach we believe that camtel faces an impossible task of ever becoming an active player in the north american market ramehart instrument co rameharts main business is focusing on other vacuum stoppering system and hatching machines ramehart is an old american goniometer manufacturer however the design of its goniometer was never changed or improved for very long period of time their hardware is very primitive and the unit can only do very simple applications as in the old time although the video capability was recently implemented this make s ramehart loss its market share to the diminishing level and can only sell to less chnical demanding and low budget customers company headquarters united states north american distributor none instruments goniometer technical specifications poor price 1400000 and lower brand name recognitionreputation poor comments ramehart needs desperately for substantial changes with their design and technical quality of its instruments otherwise we believe that ramehart is facing diminishing destiny from the market or just maintains survival by lowering their price continuously csc scientific csc is both manufacturer of tensiometers and reselle r moisture analyzers sieves and titrators the only tensiometer is torsion based old inst rument design that comes in nice carrying case to officially make it the only portable static tensiometer unit on the market company headquarters united states north american distributor none instruments tensiometers ringplate moisture analyzers titrators sieves technical specifications poor price 400000 brand name

have the marketing muscle financial backing or technical knowhow to survive in the tensiometer market dataphysics gmbh dataphysics has broad range of sophisticated surf ace tension and contact angle instruments bundled with powerful and userfriendly software the company has solid understanding of surface science and is well repres ented in the north american market with strong clientele and reputation in chnical and customer supports since its introduction to the north american mark et dataphysics has continuously gained market share mainly at the expense of its main rival kru ss and is

dataphysics achilles heel is the exorbitant prices of their instruments the complete absence of instruments for the entrylevel mark et and the fact that they are ma inly geared and designed for highly efficient and automated qc operations and for serious research purposes first ten angstroms first ten angstroms has been around for wh ile now and established themselves as the low cost alternatives in contac t angle and pendant drop surface tension analysis instruments over the past years they have devoted more and more of their limited resource towards contact angle measuring devices and formed loos alliance with camtel ltd for their sales of tensiometers in the united states more recently it has been rumored that for the owners of first ten angstroms are looking to be bought out company headquarters united states north american distributor first ten angstroms in addition to independen t sales representatives instruments tensiometers drop contact angle technical specifications satisfactory price 1000000 brand name recognitionreputation satisfactory comments first ten angstroms is by their own admission happy to occupy the growing niche of the low end contact angle instrument marke t surface tension analysis using the pendant drop method has become more of an added freebie than anything else in large part due to the poor software capabilities for producing accurate and reproducible surface tension values we know of several first ten angstrom customers who discarded the instruments and ended up buying new ones fr om dataphysics future digital scientific corp first ten angstroms will continue to do and focus on w hat they do best namely offer low cost contact angle instruments krüss gmbh krüss offers wide range of tensiometers ringplatedrop bubble cmc

recognitionreputation excellent comments krüss has been under strong attack in the north american market by its main competitor dataphysics and seen is position as the do minant market player complete eroded recent management shakeup at its subsidiary in the united states has seen krüss trying to reverse its fortunes but the jury is still out whether this will be successful or not its instruments are also very expensive and they have lost the technical edge to dataphysics t heir products are relatively poorly supported while comparing with dataphysics userfriendly design and st rong local technical support in north america with the exception of portable bubble tens iometer their product line for entryl evel surface tensiometers is non existent nevertheless krüss can be very aggressive and has shown willingness to compete only on price even if that means selling significantly below the cost ksv instruments ltd ksv manufa ctures tensiometers contact angle instruments and langmuir blodgett through the company has established strong reputation in the north american langmuirtrough market within regards to the surface tension nd contact angle markets the company has faired less

market and command most of it their tensiometers however have faired ss well with the instruments looking old and the accompanying software being less than modern it shoul d also be added that ksvs execution is somewhat lacking since most of the website links and search engine hits direct the user to the old website which has been dismantaled thus leading to the confusion lauda gmbh lauda has broad range of sophisticated surface tension instruments with an impeccable reputation from technical point of view the past scientific literature is filled with lauda instruments though this is slowly changing the company made stra tegic shift some years ago and decided that thermo control equipment would be the future of the c ompany and devoted all of its resource to that field laudas historically leading surface tens ion products have therefore suffered and seen improvements for quite some time now laudas marketing with regards to its tensiometer product line has been disaster in the north american market while brinkman and vwr have the rights to sell laudas tensiometers their sales repre sentatives are technically inept and not actively pushing the products resu lting in less

industry leader price 800000 and up brand name recognitionreputation excellent comments laudas fortunes in the north american tensio meter market are almost tragic the company seems to solely rely on its past reputation for technical excellence and leadership to sell its instruments this strategy has of course completely failed and laudas tensiometers are on the verge of becoming extinct the competition has caught up and is doing much be tter job of establishing brand name as matter of fact the only loyalty lauda seems to still have is with industry veterans and professors most of whom are and have retired it seems that lauda is content with their success in the temperature control business and have in principal abandoned the tensiome ter market in the united states nima technology

current marketing philosophy sensadyne instrument division sensadyne offers various bubble t ensiometers with an exclusive focus on dynamic surface tension and in line process measurements the company has was founded at the university of wisconsin in the 1980 s and therefore quickly found acceptance within the academic research community over the past cade the company has tried to diversify its sales into industry but has faced stif f competition mainly from sita sensadynes products are old in design and appearance and their optional softwa re is ms dos based and difficult to use company headquarters united states north american distributor sensadyne instruments and independent dist ributors instruments tensiometers dropbubble cmc capabilities technical specifications adequate price 1200000 brand name recognitionreputation adequate comments sensadyne has had difficult time in the north american market mainly due to the competition from sita it even tried to take sita to court for patent infringement solely for the purpose of slowing sitas momentum in the bubble tensiometer market the it was dismissed as having merit sensdynes biggest difficulty is old instrument design lack of new products and very poor marketing sinterface gmbh sinterface manufa ctures bubble tensiometers inte rfacial rheology instruments and foam testers the company s strategic partnership with lauda gmbh

1600000 brand name recognitionreputation poor comments sinterface has representatives in the north american market as of yet however they are actively trying to establish an office in the united states it seems like sinterface will likely end up competing for the highend market for tensiometers with focus on dynamic surface tension this is mainly due to their cost structure and instrument desig n philosophy though this might change sometime in the future sita messetechnik gmbh sita manufactures in dustry leading bubble tensiometers and foam testers the company has established itself as the leading manufactur er of bubble tensiometers and is financially and technically sound sita continuo us to add new instrument s to its product line and shown lot of flexibility when it comes to customer feedback and im proving its instruments in very quick fashion their products are incredibly reliab userfriendly and very much loved by clients as dataphysics sita is continuously taking market share from kruss in the bubble tensiometer business and the trend seems not be stopped soon sita is also well rep resented by the same distributors of dataphysics in most area of the world

very strong price 800000 brand name recognitionreputation excellent comments sita only makes bubble tensiometers and thus aims at the dynamic surface tension segment of the market it recently introduced an additional low end bubble tensiometer that has been well received by the market as long as sita does not have static t ensiometer in its product lineup it will remain only an indirect competitor to kibron for ce rtain industrialresearch applications tantec tantec is headquartered in denmark and s subsdiaries in germany and the united states the company makes various surface sc

recognitionreputation adequate comments tantecs tries to serve the low end tensiome ters market their product design is old and instrument interface cumbersome it is our impression that tantec has serious interest in the tensiometers market and instead is using all its res ources to advance the stat ic control product line temco inc temco is manufacturer of fluid testing equipment and mainly ca ters to the oil and gas industry the company recently teamed up with surface tensiometry incorporated and now markets and sells their tensiometers exclusively while in the past their only surface tension instrument was based on the pendant drop method the company recent ly introduced semiportable new forcebalanced based system which it claims is based on proprietary technology and thus patent pending temco is an aggressive company known mainly in the oil and gas industry company headquarters united states north american distributor temco inc instruments tensiometers ringplatedrop technical specifications good price 800000 and up brand name recognitionreputation adequate comments temco up to this point is not well known outside its core constituency though for surface tension they seem to be aiming at wider audience with new product the teaming upmerging with surface tensiometer inc has allowed both companies to pool their resources and become more aggressive surface tensiometry inc was founded by consortium of professors university of oklahoma and shinshu univesrity japan marketing and exposure k eeps on being major weakness of the company in summary it is evident that there are large nu mber of companies vying for market share in the north american surface activity measuring instrument market ther are some pointed observations to be made though
