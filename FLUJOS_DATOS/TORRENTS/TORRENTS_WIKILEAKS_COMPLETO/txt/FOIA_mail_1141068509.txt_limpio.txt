rddldeocolumbiaedu kbriffaueaacuk hi tim yes we processed our own rcs chronology using jans jaemtland data i also agree that using jaemtland or not would make little difference to the results rosanne is presenting at this nas meeting on thursday which mcintyre is obviously going to use as forum to muddy the waters even further he has given us hard time about the use of gaspe and the polar urals chronologies and their influence on the hockey stick trend over the past 2 centuries however removing these series makes little difference to our results in the past few centuries am just going through your emails wrt the coral paper it is huge help thanks rob original message from 1tim osborn to 2rob wilson cc 3rosanne 4kbriffaueaacuk sent monday february 27 2006 223 pm subject re emailing wilson et technical comment thanks for the very clear answers rob we didnt use jaemtland and you did that is why mcintyre suggested that we disagreed but in fact our reason for excluding it was not that it didnt correlate with temperature positively but that we didnt even calculate correlation because the rcs chronology series we received stopped in 1827 rather than 1978 it is true that the full set of core data from jan esper span the range 11071978 but the rcs chronology we received spanned the range 13161827 only and this matches the replication diagram in esper et 5httpwwwsciencemagorgcontentvol295issue5563imagesdata2250dc11066208s2_me dgif which stops then for jaemtland presumably you obtained the set of core data and did your own rcs processing etc rather than using the esper et rcs chronologies anyway i think that clears up our supposed differences over jaemtland though do let know if you have any more points to add our results would have been very little affected by including jaemtland anyway cheers tim at 0958 25022006 rob wilson wrote moring tim answers in red on related matter science have forwarded some questionsrequests from mcintyre about our paper that theyd like our response to one of them states that darrigo et 2006 have reported directly opposite findings in respect to the correlation between their rcs chronology and gridcell temperature for jaemtland and the two foxtail series i am not sure where he got that from we used jaemtland it is good site we did not use the foxtail data for similar reasons for us not using the bristlecone pine data see below we didnt give correlation for jaemtland so it is hard for you to have obtained the opposite of nothing but anyway i wanted to ask whether in fact your jaemtland differed from the one we used the one we used should be the same as esper et with data provided by ed cook you seem to be citing naurzbaev and vaganov 1999 for your jaemtland record which seems odd and its start and finish years differ from the series i got so im guessing that the data are different and thus theres reason why different data would have consistent correlations also do you know what correlation and for what season annualmean you got for jaemtland we also used the esper data the nv reference is completely wrong i checked with rosanne not sure how that got in the nv reference is actually for taymir apologies for that hopefully there are more mistakes like that anyway to clarify what we did to the data here is an exert from the report i wrote for rosanne 2 years ago the data from this site were those utilised by jan esper for his science paper after removing few low correlated series the final dataset consists of 156 radii over the period 11061978 unfortunately however the period 12921315 is represented by only one radius and replication is only reasonable from the mid 14th century in the end i used the period represented by 10 or more series 13401978 this should agree with the data you have as for correlations with temperature jaemtland is ok against the relevant local 5x5 land cru version 1 grid the std and rcs chrons correlate with the junsep season at 048 over the 19561970 period residual problems were found with this relationship all screening was done up to 1970 so that potential divergence would not effect the screening process in this situation though there was divergence for the 19711978 period on your darrigo et exclusion of the borealupperwright series it wasnt clear which one or more of the 3 reasons listed applied to these 1 significant temperature correlation 2 significant precip correlation 3 too far south i know that the temperature signal is debatable in such records but i seem to recall you saying that on the longer time scales they and i think you were referring to borealupperwright but i may have been mistaken showed some agreement with the n american series from this recent paper giving some support at least for temperature signal is my recollection correct as i said earlier i did not look at the foxtail data however i have played with the bp data the sites i utilised are described in this extract of the 10 bristlecone pine chronologies sent to 3 chronologies were identified to express significant summer temperature signal using correlation analysis against local gridded data these three sites also load upon the same principal component in pca using all 10 chronologies these three sites are hermit hill n 38 10481983 and windy ridge n 29 10501985 from colorado and sheep mountain n 71 0 1990 from california figure 1 the correlation of the std and rcs chronologies against local gridded julysep mean temperatures is 038 and 034 respectively i have also showed you comparative plot of the rcs chronology with my north american average series and the comparison is pretty good for most of the record and certainly there does not seem to be any obvious inflation of index values in the 20th century so why did we not use this site well 1 steve macintyre was kicking up fuss about these data and we felt that perhaps it might be opening us to criticism if we used them 2 these data are have been reported to also show precipitation signal i did some analysis on site basis but cannot find the results however the precipiation signal in the 3 chrons used was also weak the temperature signal is stronger this agrees with the bp vs na chronology comparison 3 as this was low latitude site then we would also need to include other low latitude sites eg from the himalayas jan would not let use his data for this region so in the end we decided to keep the dataset as high latitude as possible quebec alps and mongolia being the most southerly sites i hope this answers your queries rosanne is presenting at the nas meeting next week and we have been trying to address many of the criticisms of macintyre that he is posting on his blog i think jan making his data available was probably bad
