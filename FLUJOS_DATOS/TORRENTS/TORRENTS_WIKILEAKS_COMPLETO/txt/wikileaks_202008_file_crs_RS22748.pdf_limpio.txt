interrogations bills addressing this issue are currently pending introduction this report discusses the circumstances in which law enforcement officer may question an individual about hi s alienage status without r unning afoul of constitutional protection it provides background on the lega l framework governing these interrogations and discusses the salient legal issues that may arise as general rule an officer may freely ask an individual questions concerning his alienage stat us so long as the individual can refuse to answer it is only when the circumstances surrounding the questioning cease to be consensual and become coercive that the encounter becomes seizure and triggers the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures this report does not discuss custodial interrogations background on the fourth amendment all persons within the external boundaries of the united states including aliens enjoy fourth amendment protections1 the fourth

identification by the police does not by itself constitute fourth amendment seizurebe reasonable2 reasonableness means that justifica tion is required prior to conducting fourth amendment search or seizure3 the degree of justification required varies depending on the circumstances though in mo st cases search or seizure conducted without warrant supported by probable cause4 is presumed unreasonable5 however an officer can conduct stop and frisk if there is reasonable suspicion6 that the suspect is planning or has committed crime7 nonetheless not all encounters between law enforcement officers and individuals constitute seizure which would trigger fourth amendment protections in order to determine whether fourth amendment seizure has occurred courts look at the totality of circumstances and ask whether reasonable person would believe he was free to leave the encount er with the officer8 when one cannot leave the presence of the police for reasons unrelated to police coercion eg the seizure occurs on bus the test is whether reasonable person would feel free to decline the officers requests9 while traditional arrests are almost always fourth amendment seizures10 such seizures may also include brief detentions such as s top that fall short of an arrest11 consensual encounters are not fourth amendment seizures asking someone to identify himself does not in itself constitute fourth amendment seizure12 however if person refuses to answer questions regarding his identity detaining the person in order to continue questioning would fall under fourth amendmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22748crs3 13 see brown v texas 443 us 47 1979 finding fourth amendment seizure when two officers physically detained the defendant in or der to determine his identity after the defendant refused the officers requests to identify himself 14 delgado 466 us at 216 15 id while most citizens respond to police request the fact that people do so and do so without being told they are free not to respond rdly eliminates the consensual nature of the response 16 id unless the circumstances of the encounter are so intimidating as to demonstrate that reasonable person would have believed he was not free to leave if he had not responded one cannot say that the questioning resulted in detention under the fourth amendment 17 466 us 210 18 id at 211212 19 id at 212 20

stress that an office rs questioning may still be consensual without telling the individual that he is free not to respond14 the fact that most individuals answer police questions without being told they are free not to respond does not render these encounters any less consensual15 in order for an encounter with an officer to rise to the level of fourth amendment seizure the encounter must be so intimidating that reasonable person would have believed he wa s not free to leave if he had refused to respond to the officers query16 the leading case on this issue is ins v delgado 17 in delgado immigration and nationalization service ins agents conducte d surprise inspection of worksite in order to determine whether undocumented liens were present among the employees18 after entering the worksite the ins posted ag ents at all the exits proceeded to approach employees and asked them questions regarding their citizenship status19 if an individual did not provide credible reply or admitted he was an alien he was asked to show his immigration papers20 in the meantime the employees continued with their work and were free to walk around the worksite21 the court held that there was fourth amendment seizure of the workforce because the worker s could not have had reasonable fear that they would be detained within the wo rksite if they attempted to leave22 the court concluded that the possibility of the employees being questioned if they sought to leave the worksite should not have resulted in an reasonable apprehension that they would be detained23 therefore the employees were subjected to consensu encounters rather than fourth amendment seizures24httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22748crs4 25 united states v anguloguerrero 328 f3d 449 8th cir 2003 zepeda v ins 753 f2d 719 9th cir

id at 5152 30 accord hiibel v sixth judicial c ourt of nevada 542 us 177 2004 31 it should be noted that the fifth amendment prohibition against selfi ncrimination extends only to criminal violations while illegal presence w ithin the united states is generally civil violation from delgado it appears that an officer may as k questions regarding alienage so long as in the totality of circumstances reasonable person would have felt free to decline to answer otherwise there is seiz ure and it must be shown to be reasonable in order to pass constitutional muster some lower courts have declined to distinguish questions regarding alienage from more gene ral questions about id entification and have held that questioning someone about his or her alienage status does not trigger fourth amendment concerns25 though these cases deal almost exclusively with immigration officers the analysis of whether fourth amendment seizure has occurred would appear similar when state and cal officers are involved26 situations that are fourth amendment seizures though officers have broad leeway to ask questions when the encounter is consensual if the encounter becomes sufficiently coercive it will rise to the level of fourth amendment seizure which an officer must justify by some cause or suspicion there is bright line that separates cons ensual encounter from coercive encounter the distinction depends on the totality of th circumstances because of this there are several situations in which there can be fourth amendment seizure that falls short of traditional arrest refusal to answer refusal to respond to question concerning alienage cannot be the sole basis to support fourth am endment seizure if an officer attempts to compel an answer there is possibility that seizure may take place for example in brown v texas the defendant was standing in an alley when pair of police officers asked him for identification27 after the defendant refused to identify himself he was arrested for violating state provision requi ring individuals to identify themselves to police when lawfully stopped28 the supreme court ruled that this situation rose to the level of seizure and was unsupported by the reasonable suspicion that the fourth amendment required29 from this case it is clear that refusal to provide identification is not enough on its own to suppor t fourth amendment seizure30 even if an arrest is effected because of refusal to answer it would appear that suspected undocumented alien may not be compelled to answer when arrested for violating criminal provision of the ina because of the fifth amendmen t prohibition against selfincrimination31httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22748crs5 32 see united states v springer 946 f2d 1012 1017 2d cir 1991 reasonable suspicion to detain

287a2 34 delgado 466 us at 216217 35 see ina 287a1 2inquiry which results in an arrest generally law enforcement officer may use information obtained in consensual interrogation to provide the reasonable suspicions needed to support stop of suspect32 likewise federal immigration officers can also use reasonable suspicions arising from consensual interrogation to support brief detention of suspected undoc umented alien this is because of their statutory authorization to arrest aliens for illegal presence within the united states33 however it is not clear whether state or cal officers can conduct stop after obtaining information that would give rise to reasonable suspicion of illegal presence since they do not have the same statutor authorization to detain spected undocumented aliens as federal immigration officers the difference between federal and state or local officers when an officer takes additional steps to compel an individual to answer questions concerning alienage by detaining him the fourth amendment imposes some minimal level of objective justification in order to validate the detention effected for the questioning34 it would seem that minimal level of objective justification would vary depending on whether the questioning officer was either federal immigration officer or state or local officer federal immigration officers federal immigration officer has statutory authorization to interrogate and arre st undocumented aliens without warrant35 due to this authorization immigration officers who have reasonable suspicions that suspect is in the united states without legal status may tain the person for further questioning and if probable cause should arise to arrest the individual state or local officers though federal immigration officers can detain suspected undocumented alien with only reasona ble suspicions of illegal presence state and local officers lack federal statutory aut horization to do so in most cases state and local officers may only detain individuals and then question them about alienage when the detention is conducted during exer cise of law enforcement dutie s such as during an

httpwwwfairusorgsitedocserverolc_opinion_2002pdfdocid1041for state or local criminal violation36 moreover it has been traditionally understood that state and local officers may only enforce the criminal provisions of the immigration and nationality act ina since the pervasive regulatory scheme that constitute the civil provisions of the ina appear to evince congressional intent to preclude state enforcement37 this would seem to mean that unless there is suspicion that the suspect committed criminal violation of the ina suspicion of illegal presence alone may not be sufficient grounds for st ate or local officer to tain suspected undocumented alien38 under this theory unless the state or local officer was detaining suspect for violating either criminal provision of the ina or for violating some state or local law the officer most likely cannot detain the susp ect for further questioni ng if the only basis for doing so is suspicion that the suspect is an undocumented alien39 an alternative theory posits that states have inherent authority to enforce both the criminal and civil provisions of the ina this theory is relatively new and has some support in case law40 it has also been endorsed by the department of justice in an office of legal counsel opinion41 however federal court has expressly held that state or local officers may enforce civil provisions of th ina it is clear that under either theory state or local officer may detain someone for further questioning for either suspected violation of criminal provision of the ina or for suspected state or local offense however until there is further guidance from the federal courts it is an open question as to whether state or local officers have the aut hority to detain individuals of suspected civil violations of
