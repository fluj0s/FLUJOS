object to providing public aid for privately owned infrastructure and some warn that public ai d will do more harm than good on the other side of the issue numbe r of public benefits can be associated

rail transportation there are also those who support public aid for rail projects for the purpose of enhancing freight mobility this view holds that freight railroads are so critical to the national economy that upgradi ng and expanding their infrastructure is national concern freight railroads primarily finance projects themselves with almost government assistance the railroads have been investing heavily in their service capacity particularly with respect to intermodal terminals the question is if their pace of investment is sufficient to meet anticipated demand there is growing sense by some parties that public support for intermoda l rail projects must become more common if growing congestion and in efficiencies in the nations intermodal transportation system are to be

in rail infrastructure background what is intermodal rail intermodal rail is the movement of cargo in combination with at least one other mode of transport but under single bill of lading although intermodal rail could include many types of commodities such as grain or coal the rail industry limits the term to mean the carriage of trucktra ilers with wheels or containers without wheels by rail trucking is critical to intermodal rail transport trucks are utilized for the pick up or delivery of the trailer or c ontainer to the shipper at either end of the rail segment5 import and export moves through s eaports involve water in addition to rail and truck modes import and export containers may be transferred directly between ship and rail if the port has an ondock rail facility if the rail facility is located offdock truck will transfer th container between the port and railroad6 truck may also transfer container be tween two rail terminals if the transit involves two rail networks that do not share common terminus7 the most common forms of intermodal rail are traileronflatcar tofc containeronflatcar cofc and doublestack container dst railroads

in tons source us dot fhwa office of freight management and operations historical context although today the railroads may be operating close to their physical capacity it was not very long ago that they were burdened with too much capacity this dramatic change in circumstances over the past 20 to 30 years is largely due to technological innovations coinciding with deregulation and trade

action agenda business leaders for transportation april 2002 p 7 significant development in the recent history of intermodal rail was the implementation of doublest ack container cars in the early 1980s in 1984 only one doublestack train per week originated from the west coast and served only one inland market today over 241 doublestack trains per week originate on the west coast and serve all the major us long haul markets10 doublestack cars allow railroads to potentially carry double the amount of containers for given train length this produces cost savings in terms of per unit crew costs and shortens the length of track needed in switching yards howeve r doublestack trains also require higher clearances for overpasses and tunnels nd require expensive lifton and liftoff equipment in terminals because intermodalism and containerization is relatively recent phenomenon the rail network was largely built before and is not specifically designed for this type of cargo this creates some inherent inefficiencies in the networks connectivity for instance to m ove container across the country requires carriage by more than one railroad in ma ny instances depending on the destination the western railroads track doe s not directly connect to the eastern railroads track often requiring truck to transfer the c ontainer crosstown be tween rail terminals this most often occurs in chicago wher it is estimated that 3500 containers day are transferred by truck between rail terminals11 this truck traffic contributes significantly to the regions road congesti on st louis kansas city memphis and new orleans are other importa nt interchange points between the eastern and western rail networks when doublestack trains first came into use in the early 1980s the new intermodal traffic consumed underutilized rail capacity today however due in large part to deregulation s upply and demand are closer to equilibrium as result of series of deregulatory acts most notably the staggers rail act of 1980 pl 96 448 and culminating in the interstate commerce commission termination act of 1995 pl 10488 railroads we re given more freedom to abandon unprofitable lines and concentrate traffic on limited number of high density routes deregulation also spurred industry concentration today there are six large freight railroads in north america two in the west two in the east and two in canada w ith us routes the disappearance of excess capacity was also partly result of the decline of passenger trains to support passenger train operations multiple track yard bypasses and sophisticated signaling syst ems were installed this infrastructure generated additional capacity by allowing trains of varying speeds to use the same rightsofway however the rail passeng er service act of 1970 created amtrak allowing the private railroads to focus on moving freight the freight railroads economized by strategies such as single tracking and lowering maintenance

international freight volumes are growing faster than domestic volumes and are forecasted to nearly double by 202013 major study on freight rail expects that rail traffic m easured in tonmiles will increase 47 by 202014 this forecast continues trends experienced in recent years intermodal has been the fastest growing segment of rail traffic in the last decade in the last two decades intermodal rail volume has almost quadrupled from 31 million trailers and containers in 1980 to 121 million units in 200315 in 2003 intermodal surpassed coal for the first time as the leading revenue source for us freight railroads16 much of the increase in intermodal volumes is the result of burgeoning trade volumes particularly in marine contai ners approximately half of us intermodal rail traffic is generated by imports or exports in addition to trade growth port rationalization strategies by ocean carriers is also fueling the demand for intermodal rail services in anticipation of rising container volumes ocean lines are deploying larger container ships because there are economies of ship size at sea but diseconomies of ship size at port these larger container ships are calling at fewer us ports fewer port calls will in turn place greater reliance on the railroads to disperse and gather container cargo to and from the hinterland highway congestion relief many observers belie ve

are likely to closely examine the financial health of the railroad industry in debating the issue of government aid opinions differ as to whether or not the railroads need an external sour ce of capital to augment their reinvestment capacity economists might contend that pr ivate investors are not shortsighted and possess the most skill in supplying the right level of capital to the rail industry they may argue that if the pace of commerce and growing truck congestion dictates greater demand for rail services private capital ttracted by the prospect of good returns will flow to the industry without sp ecial government encouragement others contend that natural market for ces keep supply of rail facilities in check commentators have suggested that investors would rather see rail

inadequate revenue but inade quate competition they cont end that if one is looking for an explanation of why there seems to be chronic shortage of rail service one only needs to open an economics textbook and turn to the chapter on monopolistic behavior economic theory suggests they argue that in an imperfectly competitive market profitmaximizing firms tend to under produce good nd may opt for different levels of quality than would perfectly competitive firms the alliance for rail competition for instance argues that more rail to rail co mpetition would drive efficiencies and provide incentive for rail carriers to raise service quality to levels that customers demand rail carriers respond that inte rmodal traffic is highly competitive because of the containers easy transferability among modes intermodal customers often have various shipping options for instance customers may have choice of more than one railroad they could choose to simply tr uck the container or for transcontinental traffic they could choose to utilize the all water route and ship the container through the panama canal on limited number of routes containeronbarge may be an additional option railroads also note that rail supply shortages mainly occur during the peak season lasting only few weeks year they argue that they cannot be expected to build their physical plant ar ound relatively shortlived spike in demand while the rest of the year th infrastructure is underutilized private infrastructure federal support for freight rail raises di fficult issues because the freight railroads operate differently than ot her modes an important difference is that unlike highways waterways and airways which all use public infrastructure rail track is privately owned this raises the difficu lt question of whether public funding should be used to support projects in privat ownership and under private control another important difference is that like the other modes railroads generally do not share their infrastructure with competing railroads this raises the issue of open access if competitive equity is the ra tionale for providing railroads with some form of regular public assistance some would extend this argument further to include railtorail competition in other words lik the other modes railroads could receive federal support for infrastructure but in ex change railroads should compete with each other over the same track as one industry analyst stated the cost of railroad accesshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31834crs9 29 anthony kruglinski open access not if but when

competitive access from the shippe rs point of view would be detrimental to the financial health of their industry railroads contend that the best way to raise capital for reinvestment in rail infrastructure is to allow them to continue to operate without intrusive government intervention detrimental to industry efficiency policymakers are likely to debate whethe r federal aid to the railroad industry might do more harm than good to the industr topics of discussion include whether federal support would reduce the rail industrys efficiency whether it would actually slow down the rate of construction in ne w facilities and whether it would lead to investment in uneconomic facilities some industry analysts are concerned th at government support for rail projects could create less incentive for the railroads to continue their costcutting initiatives railroads have been improving profita bility through mergers increasing labor productivity consolidating ter minals striving to capture more market share from trucks through service improvements selling light density track to regional and shortline railroads and investing in more fuel efficient locomotives and freight cars further application of technology could not only offer railroads additional cost saving opportunities but also increase the throug hput capacity of existing infrastructure examples of technology deployment in clude further expansion of doublestack intermodal trains computeraided dispat ching systems and sensors for improving shipment tracking some analysts fear that public aid could dampen the industrys pursuit of these cost saving strategies other concerns include possible conflic ts between public and private planning horizons and excessive politicization of th project selection process critics question if public involvement would have the opposite of the intended effect and actually slow the pace of fac ility improvements the public sector generally operates under longer term planning horizon and is motivated by broadlydefined needs railroads on the other hand are driven by specific customer need s and require faster return on investments some also questi on whether government can target the right projects to finance they are concerned that political considerations will dominate the selection process if federal assistance were in the form of public funds it could lead to overinvestment in rail capacity in some places to the extent that public funds are available for construction of new project the project may have to pass lower hurdle in terms of evaluating risk and return than if the project was financed by railroad on standalone basis as is often said in this regard you never spend somebody elses money as carefully as you spend your own underestimating investment risk in new f acilities could also lead to the development of uneconomic facilities for example due to slowdown in global trade or changes in shippinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31834crs10 30 robert gallamore perspectives and pros pects for american railroad infrastructure infrastructure summer 1998 p 36routes as result of rail mergers or ter minal consolidation the physical life of facility could outlive its economic life potential congestion relief growing congestion on the nations highway system has raised the issue of the possible need to divert more truck tra ffic from road to rail however when evaluating the ability of the railroads to take trucks off the highways it is important to recognize some of the limitations of in termodal rail in reducing truck traffic intermodal rail almost always relies on trucks for the pickup and delivery portion of the haul this truck move frequently ccurs in urban areas where the problem of congestion is most acute therefore in termodal rails contri bution to congestion relief is probably most applicable to reduc ing the number of longhaul trucks on the interstates connecting cities rather than reducing the number of shorthaul trucks on urban streets and circ umferential highways when assessing the potential of the railroa ds to take trucks off the highways it is also important to recognize distinction between international and domestic intermodal service railroads have demonstrated their ability to successfully capture the inland portion of interna tional container shipments however international marine container shippers are generally less service sensitive and more priceelastic than domestic truckload shippers one or two day delay in the context of week to three week ocean transit is not completely unexpected domestic shippers on the other hand demand more precise schedules the time and co st of the truck pick up or delivery at either end of rail move must be considere d in the words of one rail analyst30 the trouble with intermodal transport is that complexity increases the risk of failure in theory any good 4x100m relay team should beat the world champion 400m sprinter but the relay team has high er risk of dropped baton or even late arrival at the stadium so matter how elegant the piece parts if more complexity reduces reliability and margin s for error are too slim what ought to be possible just might not be an additional consideration in evaluating the potential of rail to alleviate highway congestion is the economics of shor thaul intermodal tra ffic shorthauls generate the greatest amount of truck traffi c however interm odal rail generally is not competitive with trucks for hauls ss than about 500 miles which is the point where doublestack trains also generally br eak even although the market potential for shorthaul rail is large it offers even thinner profit margins or none at all for the railroads compared with longhaul intermodal one of the difficulties for the railroads in capturing this market is that the highway system has dispersed manufacturing and distribution centers s imilar to passenger ra il successful freight rail requires high density trucks have less difficulty in finding load for the backhaul portion of move because they are not limited by track trucks can also offer shippers more flexible schedulinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31834crs11 31 why

topic of discussion in the debate about aiding and assisting rail infrastructure development is clarifying under what conditions public aid might be provided one view which is well establis hed is that public aid should be directed to those rail or railrelated projects which improve passenger vehicle mobility projects that mitigate gradecrossing delays or upgrade passenger rail corridors are primary examples another popularly held assumption is that public aid should be provided because there are energy safety and environmental benefits to rail transportation in this view these external benefits are justifia bly not likely reflected in the rail industrys investment decisions the markets tendency to underproduce these public goods it is argued warrants ro for government there are also those who support public aid for rail projects for the purpose of enhancing freight mobility this view holds that freight railroads are so critical to the national economy that upgrading and expanding their infrastruct ure is national concern an argument could also be made that pub lic assistance for rail infrastructure is advisable for national security reasons passenger mobility grade crossing separation and crossing signal upgrades are well established as railrelated projects with strong public interest grade crossing separation is traditionally viewed as public good becau it improves the sa fety and mobility of vehicular traffic as side benefit it may also improve the flow of train traffic the railhighway grade crossing program 23 usc 130 provides funds for improving grade crossings public benefits are also traditionally associated with improving infrastructure on intercity passenger or commuter rail corridors passenger rail financing is inextricably linked with freight trains because most passenger trains run on track owned by the freight railroads investment in positive tr ain control technologies and upgrading right of way for highspeed rail are projects that improve passenger mobility but may also have collateral benefits for freight train operations the freight railroads are cautious of acceptin g public funding for track upgrades for passenger operations because they fear loss of control over future investment decisions they are also skeptical of the longterm physical compatibility of freight and passenger trains sharing the same track31 one advantage of accepting public funding for passenger rail upgrades is that the freight railroads can access capital at lower interest rates from public sources than from private money markets32 another rationale for funding rail project s is that cities need intermodal options because of serious congestion problems on urban highways many argue that building additional highway lane miles will not improve

seamless intermodal transportation system will enable other economic sectors to enjoy enhanced productivity as well thereby enhancing overall economic growth and securing competitive position for the

strengths of each mode ra il transportations f undamental advantage derives from steel wheels on steel track reduc ing the friction of moving heavy loads according to one study rail transportation is three or more times more fuel efficient than trucks35 which could also translate into lower freight rates for shippers intermodal rail could also be nefit the trucking industry some trucking firms

bottlenecks is especially critical rail and road connections with ports and inland terminals are of ten choke points in th intermodal network the main rail lines are experiencing high track utilization rates most of the main line system is single tracked double tracking and increasing the number of sidings in some regions would allow time sensitive intermodal trains to pass less service

alameda corridor another example of toll railway is the alameda corridor it connects the ports of angeles and long beach with terminus for the transcontinental rail network located 20 miles north of the ports the ports purchased the rail right of way from the railroads and eliminated 200 at grad road and rail intersections by lowering the rail track in ten mile trench and c onstructing overpasses nd underpasses for the roadways the railroads will reimburse part of the construction costs to the ports by paying per container fee for use of th corridor the idea for the corridor was proposed in 1984 by the southern califor nia association of governments scag which is the local metropolitan planning organization mpo construction began in april 1997 and was co mpleted in april 2002 broad array of analysts have suggested that the alameda corridor is model for improving the nations freight transpor tation system that could be repeated at other major cargo hubs the key to success for such

be identified modal equity despite concerns about capita l shortfalls the north american freight railroads are arguably the most selfsufficient railroads in the world freight or passenger when considering how government could gage in more cooperative relationship with the railroads many suggest the railroads first among them that the government first do harm the railroads and ot hers contend that the most economically efficient policy the government could pursue to assist the pace of railway development is modeneutral transporta tion policy if fede ral funding distorts modal choice the nation as whole in this view may pay larger freight bill than is necessary while subsidized carrier may offer lower rate the real cost of transport may not be lower the cost differe nce is merely transferred to others the real total cost the lower rate plus the am ount of subsidy may be greater than an aided competing mode may be willing to offer while some economists agree that federal funding should not be biased in fa vor of or against any one mode congress has not previously adopted m odal equity as policy goal one controversial policy option is to re fine current modal funding programs so that all surface freight modes pay the full cost of their infrastructure according to dot study on highway cost allocation th heaviest trucks pay only about 80 of their full cost of highway use47 according to cbo report barges pay only about 10 of the cost of their rightsofway48 proposals for how best to aid rail capacity are likely to renew debate on the long standing issue of modal equity rail trust fund the railroads are the only transportation mode in the united states that do not benefit from federal trust fund one proposal being discussed is to create railway trust fund analogous to the highway wa terway and airway trust funds these existing trust funds are financed with levi on the users of the transportation system provided they vary in the type and co mbination of surcharges imposed but may include taxes on fuel new equipment cargo waybills and passenger fares the rationale of transporta tion trust funds is to provi dedicated pool of funds for infrastructure projects thus ensuring regular system atic funding stream rail trust fund set up in the manner of the high way trust fund could provide steady and predictable source of funds for rail

aug 21 2000 p 8also entice private sector and local govern ment participation by leveraging federal dollars with contributions from local sources federal funds could serve as catalyst for getting projects underway critics of rail trust fund argue that ch program puts the government in position of giving with one hand while taking away with the other if the goal is to shift additional resources to rail impr ovement projects some question how taxing the railroads and then handing it back w ith directions on how to spend it would accomplish this goal decision makers may also consider the impact of rail trust fund on rail competitiveness if rail surcharges increase the cost of rail visavis truck or barge it may divert freight to these competing modes an additional concern with rail trust fund is that once established it may prove difficult to terminate if changing economic circumst ances invalidate the need for the fund multimodal trust fund many observers believe that major obstacle to achieving the goal of national intermodal transportation network as envisioned in the intermodal surface transportation and efficiency act istea pl 102240 is that the modes are separately managed nd funded creating parate trust fund fo r rail projects could reinforce what these observers describe as stovepipe approach to transportation planning and finance intermodal supporte rs argue the focus should be on improving the connectivity and inter operability among modes public funding should be directed at improving the intermodal connectors that is the roadways or railways that link to seaports airports and rail rds resource paper prepared for the transportation research board noted every federal reauthorization act for tr ansportation has categorized funding into discrete programs for specific classes of projects typically along modal lines because the old modal boundaries are beco ming increasingly blurred at critical nodes and along key corridors compartmentalized approach presents clear challenges to dot in advancing these important types of investments49 this raises the matter of how multimoda l trust fund could be financed could funds be generated from an ll mode freight surcharge could pool of resources be generated from portion of existing trust funds these are complex policy questions with easy answers or consensus among stakeholders modify existing programs rather than creating additional trust funds another opti on being debated is making it easier for rail projects to qualif for existing highway trust fund htf financed programs federal assistance could for example be targeted to rail projects where the alternative highways are heavily congested use of highway trust fund monies for nonhighway projects is l ong standing debate although isteas language encouraged an intermodal approach for solving transportation needs it didhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31834crs19 not mandate it state dots consulting with metropolitan pla nning organizations mpos are given the power and flexibility to decide which projects get funded intermodal freight particular ly rail freight has not r eceived significant amounts of funding from istea nor tea21 intermoda lism has largely been marketdriven rather than policydriven development the real focus of intermodalism in these laws is that it allowed the use of highway trust fund money more broadly for mass transit projects an advantage of allowing htf funds to be used for nonhighway projects is that it increases the options of state and local planners in solving their transportation needs it should be noted that some stat laws prohibit gas tax money being used for nonroad projects nevertheless more opti ons could lead to more cost efficient systemwide solutions for example it coul d be less expensive to improve an existing rail line to handle more traffic than to build additional highway lane miles another advantage of this approach is that it maintains the basic program framework created by istea and tea21 drawback of using the htf for nonhighway projects is the problem of eligibility creep expanding eligibility may dilute the political support for the fund if the interests benefitting from it are too widely dispersed using the gas tax to support nonroad projects could also reduce th userspay princi ple the principle that those who benefit must pay for the cost the existing gas tax is an imperfect pricing system however because all users do not necessarily pay their full costs for example the fuel tax does not capture the costs of congestion delays and air pollution and crosssubsidizes certain classes of system users expanding the eligibility of existing programs for rail does not guarantee that rail projects will be funded state dots and local mpos may favor highway and passenger related projects over freight rail concerns freight rail projects face stiff competition from highway and transit needs for limited resources in the htf local governments may perceive the benefits of freight rail projects as flowing outside their geographic boundaries another downside of increasing availability of htf dollars for rail projects is that it may make railr oads dependent on public aid to get certain types of projects underway private carri ers may then demand government aid on routine basis for private infrastructure improvements railway user charges toll railways such as the examples cited above in delaware and southern california are an alternative solution that some policymakers suggest could be repeated elsewhere the advantage is that they overcome the economic hurdle railroads face with large in itial capital outlays for new c onstruction the initial outlay is provided with public funds or by regi onal transportation aut hority the railroads repay some portion of the construction costs over period of time the rate of repayment is based on traffic volume with per car user fee the disadvantage of this proposal is that it probably can not be applied on national basis this option is more well suited to geographically limited corridorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31834crs20 50 jeremy f plant railroad policy and in termodalism policy choices after deregulation the review of policy research june 22 2002intermodal freight planning the issue of how an aid program might be arranged raises related issue of how projects deserving public support might be identified premise of istea and tea21 is that states and mpos are in the best position to identify and prioritize transportation projects needed in their area of jurisdiction howe ver intermodal rail shipments are typically broader in scope geographically than the jurisdiction of single mpo or state dot significant portion of intermodal rail shipments move from one region of the country to anot her if not across the entire country as mentioned earlier half of all intermodal rail loadings are imports and exports at issue is how to select freight projects that could optimize the network nationally with transportation planning process that is largely decentralized to state the issue another way how can na tional interests be weighed with local concerns freight stakeholders contend that the existing transportation planning process results in an incremental approach to solving bottlenecks expanding freight capacity at one node in the network can have adverse repercussions for the surrounding community of the next hub dow nstream if additiona l traffic overloads their facilities from freight stakeholders point of view simply moving the choke point to the next hub does little to enha nce the overall flow of goods as one observer noted you can not fit an 18 pipe into 9 pipe on the other hand if mpos or states do not coordinate their activities they could end up competing with one another for the same freight busine ss this could lead to overcapacity one option is for mpos and state governments to work together to create regional planning perspective some states are already participating in multistate studies on corridors that cross state lines in the reauthorizati on debate policymakers may consider whether to formalize these multijurisdictional arrangements or allow them to continue informally another proposal is to create national rail map similar to the national highway system id entified under the national highway system designation act
