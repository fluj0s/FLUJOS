on the budget of the united states government fiscal year 2001 table s8the lhhsed bill typically is one of the more controversial of the 13 regular appropriation bills not only because of the si ze of its funding total and the scope of its programs but also because of the continuing importance of various related issues such as restrictions on the use of federa l funds for abortion this bill provides most of the discretionary funds for three federa l departments and seve ral related agencies including the social security administra tion ssa of the 13 annual appropriation bills the lhhsed bill is the largest si ngle source of discretionary funds for domestic federal programs the defense bill is the largest source of discretionary funds among all federal programs for fy2000 the lhhsed

appropriations may cons ist of mixtures of budget authority enacted in various years at least two summary measures are used program level appr opriations and current year appropriations program level appropriations reflect the total discretionary appropriations in given bill regardless of the year in which they will be spent and therefore include advance funding for future years current year appropriations represent discretionary appropriations in given bill for the current year plus discretionary appropriations for the current year that were enacted in prior years current year discretionary appropriations are similar to the amount counted for the 302b allocations ceilings d iscussed later p 13 an advance appropriation is funding that will become available in fis cal year beyond the fiscal year for which the appropriations act is enacted for exam ple funds included in the fy2000 act that cannot be spent until fy2001 at the earliest scorekeeping adjustments are made to account for special funding situations the congressional budget office cbo monitors these adjustments all of these amounts are shown in table 2 along with current year funding for mandatory programs

discussion in the us department of education section p 36advance appropriations the lhhsed bill has used increasing amounts of advance appropriations in recent years as part of the fy 1998 lhhsed

fy2001 the presidents request is 198 billion for advance appropriations for lhhsed programs however the fy2001 conference agreement provides 188 billion for lhhsed appropriations for fy2002 and

appropria tions provided the corporation for public broadcasting cpb 350 million for use in fy2002 advance appropriations can be used for several objectives thes include the provision of longterm budget information to agencies and other recipients such as state and local educational systems to enable better planning for fu ture program activities and personnel levels the more contentious aspect of advance ppropriations however is that they avoid the 302a and 302b allocation ceilings for the current year such funding must be counted in the year in which first become s available thereby using up ahead of time part of what will be counted against the allocation ceiling in future years major funding trends the lhhsed appropriations consist of mandatory and discretionary funds however the appropriations committees fully control only the discretionary funds mandatory funding levels for programs included in the annua l appropriations bills are modified through changes in the

requested forward funding and advance appropriations many of the larger ed programs have either aut horization or appr opriation provisions that allow funding flexibility for school program years that di ffer from the federal fiscal year for example some of the elementary and s econdary education formula grant programs receive funding through appr opriations that become available for obligation to the states on july 1 of the same year as the appropriations and rema in available through the end of the following fiscal year that is fy2001 appropriations for some programs will become available for obliga tion to the states on july 1 2001 and will remain available for 15month peri od until september 30 2002 this budgetary procedure is popularly known as forwa rd or multiyear funding and is accomplished through funding provisions in the lhhsed appropriations bill forward funding in the case of elemen tary and secondary education programs was designed to allow additional time fo r school officials to develop budgets in advance of the beginning of the school ear for pell grants however aggregate program costs for individual students pplying for postsecondary educational assistance cannot be known with certainty ahead of time appropriations from one fiscal year primarily support pell grants dur ing the following academic year that is the fy2001 appropriation will support the 20012002 academic year unlike forward funded programs however the funds remain available for obligation for 2 full fiscal years thus if cost estimates turn out to be too low funds may be borrowed from the following years appropriati ons or conversely if the estimates are too high the surplus may be obligated during the following year an advance appropriation occurs when th appropriation is provided for fiscal year beyond the fiscal year for which th appropriation was enacted in the case of fy2001 appropriations funds would normally become av ailable october 1 2000 under regular funding provisions but woul d not become available until july 1 2001 under the forward funding provisions discu ssed above however if the july 1 2001 forward funding date were to be post poned for obligation by 3 months until october 1 2001 the appropriati on would be classified as an advance appropriation since the funds would become available only in the next fiscal year fy2002 for title i grants to leas the fy 1998 appropriation of 74 billion was sp lit 60 billion of forward funding and 14 billi on as an advance appropriation for fy1999 77 billion was split so that 15 billion was for forward funding and 62 billion was an advance ppropriation the fy2000 ppropriation was 79 billion for title i grants to leas with forwar d funding of 17 billion available july 1 2000 plus an advance appropriation of 62 billion available october 1 2000 what is the impact of these changes in funding provisions at the program or service level relatively little is changed by the 3month delay in the availability of funds since most expenditures for standa rd school year occur after october 1 athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30503crs37 8for additional information on budget enfo rcement procedures see crs report 98720 manual on the federal budget process by robert keith and allen schickthe appropriations level however significant technical difference occurs because forward funding is counted as part of the current fiscal year and is therefore fully included in the current 302b allocation for discretionary ppropriations under federal budget scorekeeping rules an adva nce appropriation is not counted in the 302b allocation until the following year in essence 3month change from forward funding to an advance appropr iation for part or all of the annual appropriations for given program allows onetime shift from the current year to the next year in the scoring of discretionary appropriations8 for additional reading crs issue briefs crs issue brief ib10029 education for the disadvantaged
