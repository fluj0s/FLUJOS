years later the tax reform act of 19762 codified irs practice that the social security number was to be used as the identifying number for individuals however it was not until after the enactment of the tax reform act of 19863 that taxpayers claiming dependency exemption were required to provide social security number for all dependents age 5 and over in 1990 the irs reported

enacting irc 312775 million fewer dependents were claimed on tax returns in 1987 than in 19864 since that time the age has been lowered several times effective for tax year 1995 all dependents claimed on tax return were required to have taxpayer identification number5 in 1996 supplying dependents taxpayer identification number was made part of the requirements for claiming the dependency exemption6 the 1996 legislation explicitly authorized the irs to deny the dependency exemption if taxpayer identification was furnished it was recognized that the change would have consequences for other deductions such as head of household filing status the dependent care credit and more recently the child credit7 exemptions from participating in social security based on religion there are number of united states citizens who have religious objections to participation in the social security system some of them have been accommodated by the social security laws for example irc 1402g8 allows an exemption from the social security selfemployment act to members of certain religious sects which are conscientiously opposed to private or public insurance and which make provision for care of their dependent members and irc 1402e allows certain ministers members of religious orders and christian science practitioners who are opposed to the acceptance of social security benefits because of religious principles to avoid selfemployment taxes on income from their performing religious services in 1982 the supreme court held that without an explicit statutory exemption an employer who qualified for the irc 1402g selfemployment exemption on his own income could not use his religious beliefs to avoid paying social security on the wages of his employees who were members of the same sect and who shared his religious objections to social security9 congress is permitted but not required to accommodate religious objections to social security coverage congress granted those employers tax relief in 1988 for tax years beginning in 198910 to date there are statutory exemptions for failing to provide taxpayer identification number when required on tax return case law and the religious freedom restoration act although the supreme court has not considered case involving taxpayers objection to providing dependents social security number there is relevant precedenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20066crs3 in bowen v roy 476 us 693 1986 parents of native american child challenged the constitutionality of using social security numbers in the federal food stamp and afdc programs the parents believed that using number to identify their daughter would rob her spirit and prevent her from attaining greater spiritual power the supreme court held that the statutory requirement that applicants provide social security number as condition of eligibility for the benefits did not violate the free exercise clause which protects the right to believe but not necessarily the right to engage in all religious practices the court found that the free exercise clause protected individuals from certain forms of governmental compulsion but it did not give the individual right to dictate the conduct of the governments internal procedures the court stated governments today grant broad range of benefits inescapably at the same time the administration of complex programs requires certain conditions and restrictions although in some situations mechanism for individual consideration will be created policy decision by government that it wishes to treat all applicants alike and that it does not wish to become involved in case bycase inquiries into the genuineness of each religious objection to such condition or restrictions is entitled to substantial deference moreover legitimate interests are implicated in the need to avoid any appearance of favoring religious over nonreligious applicants 476 us at 707 the court suggested that if the statute had created mechanism for individualized exemptions the governments refusal to extend the exemption for religious reasons might be violation of the free exercise clause however where the statute was facially neutral and applied to all applicants with provision for individual exemptions and where use of the social security number clearly promoted legitimate and important public interest the court found violation the court noted that approximately 38 million families received afdc benefits and approximately 20 million people received food stamps calling the size of these programs of truly staggering magnitude the court found the use of social security numbers important to the administration of these programs the dissenting justices objected to the test used by the majority the dissenters thought that the government had made case that there was compelling state interest in requiring the use of social security numbers but the dissenters would also have required the government to show that granting religious exemption to those who legitimately object to providing social security number would harm its compelling interest in preventing welfare fraud under the test used by the majority in bowen v roy the requirement that social security numbers be provided for dependents on tax returns may appear to be at least as important and compelling in the administration of the income tax as it was found to be for the administration of the food stamp and afdc programs the number of tax returns filed and the number of dependents claimed on tax returns dwarf the number of welfare recipients unique identifiers are important to the integrity of the system if bowen v roy is still the test to be applied the government would appear to be under obligation to waive the requirement that taxpayers furnish social security number for their dependents in order to claim the dependency exemption and other tax benefits flowing from the ability to claim such an exemption

42 usca 2000bb et seq was enacted in 1993 it requires that statute or regulation of general applicability not burden persons free exercise of religion unless it is essential to further compelling governmental interest and does so by the least restrictive means this is essentially the test for which the dissenters argued in bowen v roy the purpose of the religious freedom restoration act was to restore the interpretation of the free exercise clause prior to the supreme court decision in employment division oregon department of human resources v smith11 since bowen v roy predates that decision it may be that the religious freedom restoration act was not intended to affect the bowen v roy decision however the bowen v roy decision did not require the government to demonstrate that requiring social security number is the least restrictive means of ensuring the integrity of the tax system although city of boerne vflores12 has held the religious freedom restoration act to be unconstitutional as applied to the states the supreme court has not decided the constitutionality of the act as applied to the federal government lower courts reviewing challenges to social security tax laws and to laws requiring furnishing of social security numbers have assumed the constitutionality of the act have held that the government has compelling interest in collecting the tax and have stated that payment13 or social security number14 requirement at issue was the least restrictive means of furthering that interest number of taxpayers have litigated their religious objections to supplying dependents social security number in order to claim dependency exemption for their child in miller v commissioner 114 tc 32 june 23 2000 the parents attached notarized affidavit to their tax returns stating their religious objection to using identifying numbers for their two children the parents believed that social security numbers represented the mark of the beast warned against in the bible at revelations 131618 except for supplying the social security numbers the parents met all the statutory requirements for claiming the children as dependents the tax court examined the statutory requirements bowen v roy and the religious freedom restoration act and found that although the taxpayers free exercise of religious was burdened by the requirement the government has compelling interest in effectively tracking claimed dependency exemptions the court also examined the statutory accommodations of religious opposition to participation in the social security system and found that general religious exemption to the social security number requirement wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20066crs5 15see also davis v commissioner tc memo 2000210 july 10 2000 kocher v commissioner tc

being made the court ruled that using alternate numbers which the parents had proposed would not serve the purpose of being able to crossmatch series of unique identifiers15 administrative exception to tin requirement the 1986 blue book16 suggested that there is an administrative procedure for obtaining taxpayer identification number for those who are exempted from social security selfemployment taxes under irc 1402g congress noted that certain taxpayers because of their religious beliefs are exempted from the social security selfemployment taxes sec 1402g congress intended that these taxpayers and their dependents who currently acquire their tins from the irs continue to be permitted to do so it was the intent of congress that these taxpayers continue to be exempted from the general requirement of obtaining social security number from the social security administration others of these taxpayers obtain their tins under special procedures with the social security administration congress intended that these procedures continue to be available to these taxpayers17 in letter ruling 199950034 the irs discussed its practice of exempting those members of recognized religious groups who have waived participation in the social security system from providing social security numbers or taxpayer identification numbers for their dependents the memorandum contained in the letter ruling argued that the quoted language justified the irs practice of not requiring dependent social security numbers for children of those with irc 1402g exemptions interestingly in order to obtain the 1402g exemption members of the recognized religious groups must file irs form 4029 application for exemption from social security and medicare taxes and waiver of benefits and the form requires the applicant to obtain social security number before filing the form the irs does issue certain nonsocial security taxpayer identification numbers among these are itins individual taxpayer identification numbers used by nonresident aliens and resident aliens ineligible to work in the us atins temporary adoption identification numbers for children who are placed for adoption by an authorized placement agency when the child does not already have social security number ptins preparer tax identification numbers for tax preparers to use on returns they are paid to prepare and eins employer identification numbers which are generally used by businesses httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20066crs6 18736 f2d 1269 9th cir 1984even if the irs had system for providing nonsocial security number to objecting taxpayers it is not clear that this would help taxpayers who have religious objection to having any sort of governmentfurnished number in callahan v woods18 the court of appeals recognized that obtaining social security number was substantial burden on the free exercise of religion for those who believe that such numbers are the mark of the beast although the court recognized the governments compelling interest in using the social security number it required the government to demonstrate that granting callahan an exemption from the requirement of having social security number in order to obtain welfare benefits would impede the governments efficient operation of the program although the case law does not reveal whether the government was able to make such showing in callahans case the tax system would be heavily burdened if large number of religious objectors failed to use some sort of identifying number congressional power to act united states v lee suggests that congress is not prohibited from passing law establishing an alternative nonnumerical system for taxpayers who have religious objections to having number or having number for their dependents but the free exercise clause does not require that the tax system provide such an accommodation as the supreme court stated in bowen v roy appellees may not use the free exercise clause to demand government benefits but only on their own terms particularly where that insistence works demonstrable disadvantage to the governm ent in the administration of the programs 476 us at 711712 we are aware of one bill in the 106th congress to provide religious exemption from the requirement to provide taxpayer identification number for dependent hr 2494 would permit taxpayer who has sincerely held religious belief under which the taxpayer is conscientiously opposed to obtaining an identifying number with respect to qualified dependent may in lieu of such number provide certain other documents to prove that the dependent exists generally bills such as the freedom and privacy restoration act of 1999 hr 220 which would substantially restrict the use of social security numbers as means of identifying individuals and prohibit the use of government wide uniform identifying numbers would retain the use of the social security number for taxpayer identification purposes without statutory exemption taxpayers are required to use social security numbers on their tax returns or face any penalties for failure to do so this is especially true if the taxpayer wishes to obtain the benefit of exemptions deductions or credits which are contingent on furnishing the number
