country globally accounts for about 46 of the worlds population within the next few years the us populationcurrently estimated at 299 million personsis expected to reach twice its 1950 level of 152 million more than just being double in size the population has become qualitatively different from what it was in 1950 as noted by the population reference bureau the us is getting bigger older and more diverse the objective of this report is to highlight some of the demographic changes that have already occurred since 1950 and to illustrate how these and future trends will reshape the nation in the decades to come through 2050 the united states is getting bigger this report considers population change and the underlying factors that contribute to population growth in the united states these include increasing survival due to declining mortality rates especially for the three most prevalent causes of death fertility levels that are hovering around the generational replacement level and trends in net international migration wherein more migrants move into the united states than americans who leave the united states is getting older aside from the total size one of the most important demographic characteristics of population for public policy is its age and sex structure this report illustrates how the united states has be in the midst of profound demographic change the rapid aging of its population as reflected by an increasing proportion of persons aged 65 and older and an increasing median age in the population the united states is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse reflecting the major influence that immigration has had on both the size and the age structure of the us population this section considers the changing profile of the five major racial groups in the united states in addition trends in the changing ethnic composition of the hispanic or latino origin population are discussed although this report will not specifically discuss policy options to address the changing demographic profile it is important to recognize that the inexorable demographic momentum will have important implications for the economic and social forces that will shape future societal wellbeing there is ample reason to believe that the united states will be able to cope with the current and projected demographic changes if policymakers accelerate efforts to address and adapt to the changing population profile as it relates to number of essential domains such as work retirement and pensions private wealth and income security and the health and wellbeing of the aging population these topics are discussed briefly in the final section of this report this report will be updated as needed httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32701g22g145g142g561g5g145g138g151g144g146

number of additional women slightly outnumbering additional men see figure 1 this increase of about 85 in the size of the us population was remarkable compared with other industrialized countries germany and italy for instance grew by only 20 and 22 respectively during the same period 6 and number of countries most notably in eastern europe have recently experienced absolute reductions in the

3 respectively but decreased slightly for non hispanic black women fertility also increased for asian and pacific islander women but was essentially unchanged for american indian women 10 the crude birth rate cbr is the primary measure of fertilit used in this section because of its value in indicating directly the contribution of fertility to the population grow th rate however because the age

mexican origin 2958 and other hispanics 2733 were above replacement many european and asian countries or regions have levels of fertility that are considerably lower than in the united states for instance macao sar 084 hong kong 094 ukraine 112 czech republic 117 and slovakia 120 are all well below replacement15 the mean age of all firsttime mothers in the united states was 252 years in 2003 slightly higher than in 2002 this alltime high for american women attests to the continuing tendency of women to postpone childbearing since 1970 the mean age at first birth has risen 38 years from 214 years mean age at first birth varies considerably by race and hispanic origin women of asian and pacific islander descent had the highest age at first birth 283 years whereas american indian women had the lowest 218 years childbearing by unmarried women rose steeply in 2003 the number of births to unmarried women climbed 4 to 1415995 the highest number recorded in the more than six decades for

uses demographic projection techniques to predict future trends in american fertility they project that birth rates will remain low through 2050 in the narrow range of 139143 births per 1000 persons annually note however that future trends in fertility are notoriously difficult to predict and specialists continually question the underlying assumptions of the models some experts are concerned that stability in us fertility may not continue particularly in light of the declines that have occurred in other developed countries 16 others argue that very low fertility is not inevitable and that fertility may return to higher levels for instance morgan17 in his address as president to the membership of the population association of america argued that there are both persistent rationales for having children and institutional adjustments18 can make the widespread intentions for having two children attainable even in increasingly individualistic and egalitarian societies g15g152g155g157g138g149g146g157g162g561 as is evident from figures 2 and 3 crude death rates cdr in the united states have been remarkably constant since 1950 fluctuating within the narrow range of 85 to 97 deaths per 1000 persons19 the record low of 84 was attained in the most recent year for which final data are available 200320 in general crude death rates are referred to as crude because they are influenced by two underlying characteristics of population making it difficult to interpret trends in the cdr without disentangling trends in these two underlying components the populations age structure an older population generally has higher crude death rates because higher proportion of persons are in the older age groups where death rates are higher mortality risk or the likelihood of death at particular age the risk of mortality reflects the health and disease profile of the underlying population public health and sanitation the availability of and access to health care the education of the population and other factors ageadjusted death rates are better indicators than crude rates to measure mortality risk across time or across populations 21 if ageadjusted rates are

ageadjusted death rates have exhibited dramatic decline since 1950 rather than being remarkably constant as suggested by the crude death rates use of the ageadjusted rates has allowed much more

surpassed the previous highest value which was recorded in 2002 record high life expectancy was attained by the total population as well as by each of the black and white populations both males and females in each of the two major race groups attained record high levels us life expectancy continues to fall short of that attained by number of other countries including japan 819 years iceland 806 and switzerland 80425 the 10 leading causes of death were 1 heart disease 2 malignant neoplasms cancer26 3 cerebrovascular diseases stroke 4 chronic lower respiratory diseases 5 accidents unintentional injuries 6 diabetes mellitus 7 influenza and pneumonia 8 alzheimers disease 9 nephritis kidney disease and 10 septicemia ageadjusted death rates continued to decrease for the three leading causes the ageadjusted death rate for influenza and pneumonia 7th leading cause also decreased by 27 despite an influenza outbreak in 2003 increasing trends for alzheimers disease continued differences in mortality between men and women continued to narrow in 2003 the ageadjusted death rate for men was 41 greater than that for women down from 42 greater in 2002 life expectancy at birth for females was 801 years while it was 748 years for men both increases from the previous year the sex gap in life expectancy 53 years has been falling from its late 1970s peak of 78 years differences in mortality between the black and white populations persisted even though there was trend toward convergence the ageadjusted death rate was 13 times greater the infant mortality rate 24 times greater and maternal mortality rate 35 times greater for the black population than for the white population life expectancy for the white population exceeded that for the black population by 53 years the infant mortality rate was 685 infant deaths per 1000 live births small reduction from 2002 note that the rate had increased in 2002 the first increase in over four decades as with the data for fertility demographers use demographic projection techniques to predict the future trends in american mortality the census bureau projects that crude death rates will remain low through 2050 in the narrow range of 86 to 99 deaths per 1000 persons in the population its figures gradually increase reflecting the census bureaus assumption that the aging of the population will not be fully offset by continued reductions in the risk of dying 24 life expectancy at birth represents the average number of years that group of infants would live if they were to experience the current observed

while annual drops of about 1 in the cancer death rate number of deaths from cancer per 100000 people have been observed over the past decade the actual number of cancer deaths still rose each year

survival are difficult to predict and specialists disagree on not only the level but also the direction of future trends three recent articles were published that suggest that current models may be too pessimistic in their assumptions about mortality and survival probab ilities ie americans may live longer than currently projected27 two of these studies showed that there has been tendency for international life expectancy to rise linearly by more than two years per decade over the past 40 years28 or the last 160 years29 suggesting that future mortality decline may be more rapid than current models suggest also useful analysis of the contri bution of smoking behavior to mortality trends30 suggests that slow female gains in the united states may be temporary and that the pace of mortality gains may pick up fairly soon on the other hand another expert recently argued that the trend toward longer lives will probably level off in coming years as result of the rising tide of obesity and the reemergence of deadly infectious diseases 31 g16g142g157g561g11g150g150g146g144g155g138g157g146g152g151g561 immigration has been an important component of population growth in the

relevant policy considerations are whether there are sufficient schools and later enough jobs and housing to accommodate them on the other hand critical policy challenges in countries with old population structures are to develop retirement and medical systems to serve the older population often with simultaneous reductions in the number of workingage persons to support them the population of the united states had been relatively young in the first half of the 20 th century consequence of history of three demographic trends acting in concertrelatively high fertility declining infant and childhood mortality and high rates of net immigration to the united states by young workers and families since 1950 the united states has been in the midst of profound demographic change rapid

years43 and births outnumbered deaths by margin of 25 to 1044 three characteristics of the 1950 pyramid are especially worth noting the only significant departure from pyramidal shape is notches representing persons aged 1024 years these persons were born primarily during the economic depression of the 1930s when birth rates were comparatively low early baby boom births are evident in the youngest age group 45 the number of persons aged 65 and older in the population was still relatively low124 million persons representing 81 of the us population the population pyramid in year 2000 the most recent year in which the us population was enumerated by the decennial census is typical of population experiencing slow growth reflecting lower fertility fewer people entered the lowest bars of the pyramid and as life expectancy has increased greater percentage of persons have survived until old age as result the population has been aging by 2000 the median age of the population had risen to 353 years while infants and children under the age of five accounted for only 68 of the population important characteristics of the us population in year 2000 include the us population grew by roughly 85 between 1950 and 2000from 152 million to 282 million persons the pyramid which is significantly larger in all age groups reflects this fact the bulge of the babyboom generation those born between 19461964 can be seen in the pyramid for ages 3554 years in 2000 after 1964 birth rates moved downward until the late 1970s as the last members of the baby boom approached their childbearing years during the 1980s the number of births rose again peaking in 1990 these children the youngest generation are represented by the slightly widening base of the pyramid even though the number of births per woman is near an all time low the population continues to grow in part because of the children and grandchildren of the huge babyboom generation 46 the number of persons aged 65 and older had been steadily increasing and reached 351 million persons representing 124 of the us population the fact that female survival chances exceed those of men especially at the older ages becomes noticeably more evident in the 2000 pyramid about 43 of the total female population was aged 80 and above in 2000 compared to only 22 of men 43 extraction from us bureau of the census international data base

population pyramid will longer resemble christmas tree rather it will be increasingly rectangular in this population of 4201 million persons the most striking feature is the projected number of people who will be aged 65 and older867 million just over one in every five persons in the total us population to put these figures into perspective the oldest state in the year 2000 census was florida with 176 of the states population in the age category 65 years and older47 by year 2050 the percent elderly in the national population will surpass the figures observed in the oldest states today the oldestold those aged 80 and above and including the youngest of the ba by boomers will be the most populous age group337 million persons or 80 of the entire us population the oldestold women of the same age will account for 96 of all women the baby boom generation will have accelerated population aging but aging will continue to be one of the most important defining characteristics of the population even after the youngest of the baby boom population has passed away this reflects projections of continuing low fertility coupled with improving survival in the united states 48

social security is often attributed to demographic trends that have led to aging populations however beyond the simple mathematics of the worsening age dependency ratio 59 decreasing labor force participation rates have contributed to financial imbalances within pension programs further increasing the number of retired persons relative to those in the workforce the declining labor force participation of older men is one of the most dramatic economic trends of the past four decades in the united states between 1963 and 2003 labor force participation 59 the ratio of the number of

period labor force participation rates dropped from 76 to 50 for men aged 6264 and from 21 to 12 for men aged 70 and over60 for all of these groups most of the declines occurred prior to 198061 an individuals decision of whether to stay in the workforce or to retire is based on the complex interaction of number of factors including but not limited to eligibility for social security benefits availability of and benefits under an employerfinanced pension plan work incentives to stay in the labor force such as continued benefit accrual after attaining the early retirement age options for phased retirement or to work reduced hours etc the physical and cognitive health of the worker and potentially other family members spouse an aging parent an adult child with disability availability and eligibility for disability and unemployment insurance programs and the workers relative preference for leisure compared to employment policy levers are however available to influence labor force participation and retirement decisionmaking for instance the federal government influences employers decisions about whether to offer benefits like pensions and health insurance through direct legislation such as erisa and the age discrimination act through social insurance programs such as social security and medicare and through the financial incentives created for both employers and employees by the internal revenue code 62 g18g155g146g159g138g157g142g561g25g142g138g149g157g145g561g138g151g141g561g11g151g140g152g150g142g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g348g345g561 income security during retirement coupled with an increase in the number of postretirement years during which individuals can enjoy family and leisure is one of the primary social achievements of the 20th century at the same time this accomplishment has introduced some fundamental public policy challenges associated with population aging from an individuals perspective the two most basic challenges are to ensure that they have sufficient income security during their retirement years and that they have protection against the increasing risk of experiencing periods of poor health andor disability for policymakers there are fundamental questions with respect to what the federal role should be in helping individuals meet these objectives major domestic political challenge of the 21 st century will be how to adapt our oldage income security and health insurance systems to ensure financial solvency while ensuring that there is an adequate safety net to protect the most vulnerable in the population one option that is likely to be considered involves relying on 60 federal forum on agingrelated statistics 2004 older americans 2004 key indicators of wellbeing indicator 11 based on data

any reductions that may take place in the level of publictier support the underlying question is how realistic it is to assume that individuals will save sufficiently over their lifetime to contribute significantly to their own income needs during retirement another central question regarding income security for older persons is whether individuals and families will assume greater responsibility for their own retirement if current government programs are scaled back because of budgetary pressures

decades of population aging have occurred in the united states wherein the proportion of young persons has declined while the number of older persons has expanded dramatically the changing age structure has raised philosophical questions around the theme of intergenerational equity many analysts might expect such demographic changes to have favorable consequences for children and troubling ones for older persons fewer children should mean less competition for resources in the home as well as greater availability of social services earmarked for children especially public schooling the sharp rise in the number of elderly should put enormous pressure on resources directed towards the older ages such as medical care facilities nursing homes and social security funds 64 however preston in his 1984 presidential address to the membership of the population association of america documented that exactly the opposite had occurred conditions for children had in fact deteriorated and improved dramatically for older americans now two decades later the issue continues to be one of considerable debate recent study 65 argued that without an overhaul of entitlement programs which largely favor older persons or taxrevenue reform the everexpanding social security medicare and medicaid budgets will tighten the squeeze on other domestic spending including programs for children welfare education the environment community development housing energy and justiceprograms that reach the majority of all americans but others argue that there are potentially catastrophic outcomes associated with the redistribution of federal resources among age categories for instance the safety nets for the most vulnerable may be interrupted costs might be transferred to the states with limited capacity to absorb the additional expenditures individuals may be unable to assume the additional responsibilities asked of them there is generally accepted rule in welfare economics for how an age groups interests ought to be represented in public decisionmaking as noted by preston 66 however we are continually faced with two questions first do we care about our collective futurethe commonwealthor only about our individual futures and if we have collective concerns we face an even more difficult decision about what mix of private and public responsibilities will best serve the needs of the generations 64 s h preston children and the elderly divergent paths for americas dependents demography vol 21 4 1984 hereafter cited as preston children and the elderly 1984 65 c steuerle

aging may or may not result in increasing proportions of older persons in poor health the numbers experiencing that condition are almost certain to rise thus as the us population ages the social and economic demands on individuals families communities and the government will grow with substantial impact on the formal and informal health and social care systems and on the financing of medical services in general in conjunction with the growing numbers of older persons the united states faces secular change in health status as reflected in rates and outcomes of various conditions and disabilities trends in cognitive impairment and dementia have enormous policy implications but whether changes in disease and disability rates will alter the rates of longterm institutionalization is unclear while recognizing the necessity to address the changing health needs of the older population critical questions remain regarding the best mechanisms for health system organization delivery of and access to services administration and financ ing socioeconomic differentials also need to be addressed g11g150g150g146g144g155g138g157g146g152g151g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561 immigration has historically been major contributor to population growth in the united states and immigration reform has recently been an acti ve topic for both the president and for congress when president george w bush announced his principles for immigration reform in january 2004 he included an increase in permanent immigration as key component president bush has stated that immigration reform is top priority of his second term and has prompted lively debate on the issue bills to revise permanent admissions are being introduced but only one has had any legislative action so far in the 109 th congress

number of immigrati on and identification documentrelated provisions intended to improve homeland security among these are provisions to change the immigration and nationality act ina with respect to asylum and other forms of relief from removal to expand the terrorismrelated grounds for alien inadmissability and deportation and to set standards for stateissued drivers licenses and personal

biracial society with large white majority and relatively small black minorityand an impenetrable color line dividing these groupsthe united states is now society composed of multiple racial and ethnic groups along with increased immigration are rises in the rates of racialethnic intermarriage which in turn have led to sizeable and growing multiracial population 71 these trends are projected to continue for the next decades this diversity presents policy challenges in number of areas for instance assimilation many asian americans speak their native languages at home and maintain their distinct ethnic cultures and values signaling that they either face difficulties fully assimilating into the american mainstream or purposefully resist full assimilation 72 the continued flows of latino immigrants ensure that the spanish language and diverse latino cultures will endure in the united states73 the degree to which there are language barriers or lack of assimilation of immigrants has important implications for both entry into and achievement in the educational system and the labor force income disparities there are persistent differences in family incomes among racialethnic groups in the united states for instance in 2000 the median income level for black familyat about 31000was about 17000 lower than that of white family about 52000 74 one consequence of this disparity is that lowincomelowwealth persons face hurdles when attempting to become homeowners75 mortgage underwriting criteria present two potential borrowing constraints for lowincome buyers 1 the wealth constraint results from the buyers need to amass downpayment capital and funds to cover other upfront costs necessary to initiate the transaction and 2 the income constraint results from maximum

poverty rates between 1990 and 2000 the poverty rate declined from 281 to 212 among hispanics and from 122 to 108 among asians and pacific islanders the declines have been especially steep among african americans with rates dropping from 319 to 221 still americas racial minorities continue to have disproportionately high poverty rates in 2000 47 of the poor were non hispanic white and poverty rates among blacks and hispanics were roughly twice the national average 78 poverty and welfare receipt are inextricably linked government programs may help lowincome persons meet their basic daily
