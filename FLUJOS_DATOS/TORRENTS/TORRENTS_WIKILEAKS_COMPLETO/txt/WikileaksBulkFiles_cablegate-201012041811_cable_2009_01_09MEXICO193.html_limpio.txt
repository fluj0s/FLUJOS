counselor charles v barclay reason 14 b d summary 1 c 2008 set new record for organized crimerelated homicides with more than 6000 killings violence in mexico suddenly provided fodder for us and international media with commentators suggesting worse to come while the death toll is already at disturbing levels and there are signs violence will taper off anytime soon we will continue to evaluate information or evidence that would suggest the cartels have decided to up the significantly by undertaking masscasualty attacks on civilians systematically attacking gom officials or institutions or targeting usg personnel internecine struggles among the cartels and gom counter narcotic successes have increased the costs of doing business and account for most of the uptick last year frustrated traffickers seeking to diversify profitmaking activities through kidnappings and extortion account for more end summary drugrelated homicides on the rise 2 c few killings in mexico are thoroughly investigated and determining which are truly related to organized crime remains an inexact science but mexicos attorney generals offices yearend estimate stands at 6262 other gom authorities put the toll from organized crime slightly higher sedena reports that drugrelated killings represented roughly 17 of all homicides last year while the national system of public security snsp part of the public security secretariat ssp estimates total of approximately 10700 intentional homicides snf table i organized crimerelated killings by year 2005 1855 2006 2489 2007 3038 2008 6380 source sedena snf table ii 2008 ocrelated killings by month jan 282 feb 283 mar 417 apr 320 may 496 jun 531 jul 540 aug 587 sep 526 oct 847 nov 843 dec 708 source sedena spike in violence concentrated at the border 3 c violence continued to be concentrated in few key states and in 2008 there was spike in drugrelated killings in the northern border territories an estimated 41 percent of these homicides took place in chihuahua and baja california states and largely in two urban areas ciudad juarez and tijuana see mexico 3586 sinaloa continued to rank among the most violent states with approximately 1048 or 18 of these killings the surge in violence along the border stems largely from the intensified struggle among cartels over few lucrative land crossings to the us in particular the january 2008 arrest of cartel leader alfredo beltran leyva sparked serious rift among the gulf juarez and sinaloa pacific cartels which is being played out viciously in ciudad juarez see mexico 1766 in tijuana rival factions of the weakened arellano felix organization one of which is backed by the sinaloa cartel are battling for control changes in cartel behavior 4 sbu beyond its broadened scope the nature of cartel violence changed in 2008 organized violence was characterized by significantly increased brutality callous disregard for the potential for collateral damage and more frequent targeting of soldiers and police mexicos drug trafficking organizations dtos have also more frequently orchestrated violence to send intimidating messages to security forces the mexican public and the body politic 5 sbu incidents such as the august beheadings of 12 in yucatan the execution style killing of 24 on the outskirts of mexico city in september late fall killings of soldiers in monterrey and guerrero in late december contributed to growing public unease here and garnered media attention abroad several firsttimeever incidents involving grenades and improvised explosive devices such as the notorious independence day grenade attack in morelia the shooting and undetonated grenade attack on the us consulate in monterrey the use of improvised explosive devices in downtown mexico city and sinaloa and grenade attack on police cadets in jalisco demonstrate that not only have the cartels successfully expanded their arsenals but at least some elements have developed tolerance for inflicting civilian casualties 6 sbu cartels have also expanded their use of violence to intimidate beheadings and the prominent placement of dismembered bodies in public places relatively rare two years ago are now common throughout the country the late night grenadeshooting attack on our consulate in monterrey was obviously designed to send message although individual or group has ever claimed responsibility more explicit was the january assault on the monterrey offices of televisa accompanied by message telling the broadcaster to do better job reporting on corrupt public officials attacks such as these remain sporadic so far and we have insufficient indications whether they mark new trend or not 7 sbu despite these sporadic attacks mexicos drug war continues to primarily impact security forces and those linked directly or indirectly to the drug trade the civilian population in some urban areas along the border remains bunkered down with some of those who have the money either sending their children to school in the us or relocating entirely to minimize risk in much of the rest of the country though the civilian population not involved in the drug trade remains essentially insulated from the violence though not from its effects police killings increase along with overall death toll 8 sbu sedena estimates that at least 522 civilian law enforcement and military personnel were murdered last year compared to 315 in 2007 snf table iii drugrelated militarypolice homicides 2007 2008 of total afi 22 69 5 10 pfp 12 38 37 197 state police 62

statistics sedena statistics 9 c increased confrontations between security forces and criminals is one explanation for the increasing killing of security forces personnel gom authorities argue that killings are longer just scoresettling among bad cops but increasingly the consequence of the governments aggressive fight against the cartels some analysts we have spoken to agree however they also note that with few exceptions the majority of deaths are not the result of direct confrontations they argue that the crackdown on police corruption has put compromised police officials in the position of either being prosecuted or breaking their established agreementsarrangements with the cartels hence some of those who presumably choose the latter course are being punished brutally see mexico 2371 3498 10 sbu it is worth noting that police victims at all levels of government represented eight percent of all 2008 killings believed to be drugrelated figure slightly lower than the percentage in 2007 the vast majority of victims continue to be state and municipal law enforcement officers senior level federal police killings were still rare occurrences in 2008 the most highprofile death remains the may killing of edgar millan gomez the countrys highestranking federal police officer targeting of soldiers an ominous sign 11 snf there have been notable incidents of horrific violence against soldiers including string of slayings of enlisted men in monterrey in october and the systematic decapitation of seven troops in guerrero see mexico 3779 the theory that those killed in guerrero were rogue soldiers involved in drug trafficking has been discounted suggesting the cartels have begun to target soldiers to exact revenge for successes registered by the military and attempt to undermine the institutions resolve the monterrey and guerrero killings immediately followed successful military operations in the respective regions resulting in seizures and arrests whether such tactics will have chilling effect remains to be seen sources tell us that while some soldiers are more fearful many others are keen to strike back at the cartels with greater resolve sedena and semar have instructed regional commanders to implement force protection countermeasures to reduce the risk of future incidents us personnel and institutions targets 12 c we have observed significant uptick in threats as well as incidents of surveillance against usg personnel and properties over the last three months all threats are treated seriously and precautions taken fortunately none has come to fruition 13 snf on october 12 unknown persons fired gunshots and tossed an undetonated grenade at the us consulate in monterrey the attack occurred after hours one was injured and little damage occurred message was left and we have uncovered useful intelligence regarding the authors or their motives one unsubstantiated report cited source claiming senior gulf cartel leader ordered the attack however with little hard evidence attempt to claim credit and follow on incident to date the possibility remains that this was an isolated possibly even impulsive attack not likely undertaken at the behest of senior cartel leaders 14 c while the cartels have not yet directly targeted usg law enforcement or other personnel they have shown little reticence about going after some of our most reliable partners in mexican law enforcement agencies ten close dea law enforcement liaison officers have been killed since 2007 seven of whom were members of special vetted units similarly within the past two years 51 close fbi contacts have been murdered more than sixty of mexicos best law enforcement officers in whom we have placed our trust and with whom we have collaborated on sensitive investigations shared intelligence and in many cases trained and vetted have been murdered by the cartels we do know from sources that cartel members have at least contemplated the possibility of doing harm to both our personnel and institutions but we frankly dont know enough about how dto members think and operate to know what factors might trigger decision to mount such an attack but the potential threat is very real 15 c we assess that the threat to us personnel could increase if the violence continues to escalate and more highlevel government officials and political leaders are targeted also reaction may be triggered if traffickers perceive their losses are due to us support to the goms counternarcotics efforts we will continue to monitor potential threats to us personnel from organized criminal gangs and be alert to information that suggests drug traffickers increasingly see the us hand as responsible for their losses measure of success 16 c while attributing last years significant spike in violence to its own successes marks an effort by the calderon administration to put the best face possible on grim situation there is also considerable truth to the assertion president calderons counternarcotics team has scored significant successes particularly in the last 12 months record numbers of weapons and drugs have been seized key members of drug cartels have been arrested andor extradited cartel sources inside government institutions have been arrested including former deputy attorney general and the head of interpol in mexico the gom has disrupted cartel operations in meaningful ways in yearend reports sedena and semar reported that together they have reduced the maritime trafficking of illicit drugs by 65 percent and cut direct air transit of illegal drugs from colombia by 90 percent according to collaborative sensitive reporting the january 2008 arrest of alfredo beltran leyva split the pacific cartel and accentuated antagonism between that dto and the gulf organization which caused the spike in violence in chihuahua sinaloa and baja california see also mexico 1766 in addition to these rifts frustrated traffickers have turned to kidnappings and extortion to compensate for the loss in drugtrafficking revenue expanding their reach and impacting greater number of bystanders who have involvement in dto activities these kinds of impacts bring home to ordinary mexicans the nature of the struggle here outlook 17 c mexican authorities and law enforcement analysts predict that violence will likely get worse before it gets better recent truce rumors notwithstanding there is currently indication that the violence will soon abate cenapi reports 280 killings for the first 20 days of january the cartels have shown themselves to be remarkably innovative vicious and resilient when aggressively confronted given their powerful weaponry and deep penetration of the countrys security institutions further attacks against security forces and government officials seem all but inevitable however while violence remains at unacceptably high levels here we have reason to believe at this point that it will escalate either quantitatively or qualitatively visit mexico citys classified web site at httpwwwstatesgovgovpwhamexicocity and the north american partnership blog at httpwwwintelinkgovcommunitiesstatenap bassett
