slower world economic growth and capital losses on stock markets indirect costs include higher insurance and shipping fees diversion of time and resources away from enhancing productivity to

the global war on terrorism and perhaps emboldened terrorists to attack in bali spain morocco and saudi arabia policy question for congress is how to evaluate the costs and benefits of further spending to counter terrorism and its economic impact this report will be updated periodically strategy of qaeda is to hurt the western world by attacking economic nodes and avenues of commerce osama bin laden has pegged the cost of the 911 attacks on the us economy at 1 trillion1 this attack along with the bali bombings in indonesia and the madrid train bombing was aimed partly at taking down the global economic system and inspiring recruits by demonstrating that qaedas terror attacks could cause significant damage and to raise fear levels that would cause governments businesses and individuals to change the way they behave in everyday life this fits into aim of qaeda to destroy western powers by exhausting them in much the same manner that the resistance did after the ussrs invasion of afghanistan or the united states did to russia in the cold war in each case the prolonged war ended as much from economic exhaustion as from military victories the purpose of this report is to briefly survey the global economic costs of 911 details of the effects of 911 and terrorism on the us and world economies are also addressed in other crs reports and various studies2 1 sept 11

for congress not only because imposing such costs is part of qaedas strategy but because in certain cases congress provides the funds to cover those costs hr 10 hastert and s 2845 collinlieberman both touch on many of these issues this economic warfare also may affect us economic growth and productivity cause financial instability in other countries and hamper international trade and capital flows the policy issues for congress center on how much more security to fund actions to be taken to sustain world economic growth particularly in the nations cooperating in the antiterrorism effort how to maintain the integrity and security of the american and global economy and how to expedite trade flows and business activity hampered by increased security procedures the 911 terrorist attacks affected the world economy at different levels depending on how the attacks are viewed see figure 1 first they can be seen as onetime event along with its accompanying aftermath much like hurricane or other natural disaster the impact of the attacks within this framework is direct and primarily physical lives lost and property damage usually is confined to the immediate area of attack repercussion from the attack then may cause an economic shock wave that is transmitted around the world through financial markets trade and levels of confidence in the 911 case the costs begin with the approximately 34 billion in insured losses covering part of the 216 billion in capital losses for buildings and infrastructure 576 million for rebuilding the pentagon and 7 billion for official victim compensation covering claims crs3 for 2973 killed as well as some of the 78 billion in lifetime earnings lost by 2780 new york workers3 second the 911 attacks combined with subsequent terrorist incidents caused gestalt shift in public perceptions of the threat to their security and their vulnerability to terrorist activity this heightened the need for security required greater government expenditures to counter terrorism and fundamentally altered how companies conduct business and people pursue life it affected everything from airline security checks to the organization of government and from terrorism insurance coverage to sales of duct tape responding to the need for greater security increases direct cash outlays expenditures that may reduce or not add to productivity as governments and businesses spend more on guarding lives and property rather than investing in research technology and new equipment the global costs of this shift in perceptions of threat are dispersed varied and in many cases difficult to quantify some costs such as those for terrorism insurance and airport security may be calculated but the costs of human anxiety incursions on civil liberties and personal responses to escalated threat levels are elusive third the 911 attacks also can be viewed as the defining event that transformed the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21937 us counter terror effort from lawenforcement actions and limited military retaliation to global war on terror in this context 911 triggered series of government actions to include the invasions and occupations of afghanistan and iraq despite the apparent lack of direct connection between iraq and the 911 attacks estimates of the economic impact of 911 in this case become the costs both in budgetary outlays and in human life of the global war on terrorism macroeconomic effects following the terrorist attacks the already weak international economy was weakened further the aftershocks of 911 were felt immediately in foreign equity markets in tourism and travel in consumer attitudes and in temporary capital flight from the united states central banking authorities worldwide reacted by injecting liquidity into their financial systems still the downturn in business conditions became more generalized and most of the world dropped into synchronous recession from 41 world economic growth in 2000 to 14 in 2001 growth rate of less than 2 for the world is considered to be recessionary by late 2002 aggressive reflationary fiscal and monetary policy in the united states and booming chinese economy led the recovery as shown in figure 2 the 2001 recession turned into weak economic recovery with world growth of 19 in 2002 and 27 in 2003 still anemic when compared with the growth rate of 23 in 1998 during the worst of the asian financial crisis for 2004 the recovery picked up speed and its strength broadened with growth at 4 even though by mid2004 the world was hit with petroleum prices exceeding 40 per barrel of which 6 to 10 was security premium caused primarily by instability and uncertainty in the middle east still in most markets there appeared to be general 3 bram jason james

have affected economic growth abroad an australian study pointed out the negative macroeconomic consequences of terrorism for developing nations because of reduced trade investments and tourism the 2002 bali bombings reduced indonesias growth rate by an estimated 1 percentage point7 september 11 also marked the end of an era in the united states it wiped out the lingering euphoria from the roaring 1990s and replaced it with cloud of uncertainty and lowered expectations of growth this had major effect on equity markets worldwide in the united kingdom germany france canada and japan equity values after initially recovering from the 911 shock subsequently fell and in september 2002 generally were below the lowest values recorded in the immediate aftermath of 911 the loss in market capitalization on us exchanges in september 2001 was 17 billion by one estimate8 budgetary effects for the united states the budgetary impact of 911 has become intertwined with that for subsequent terrorist activity and the general war on terror according to the office of management and budget for fy2004 the administration requested 527 billion for funding to combat terrorism this was 83 more

billion and other nations have pledged 144 billion11 in 2002 study on the economic consequences of terrorism the organisation for economic cooperation and development pointed out the trend toward steppedup security spending among the industrialized oecd nations the oecd has not yet published data for 2003 and budgets for 2004 but in 2001 and 2002 defense expenditures were increasing worldwide in us dollars defense expenditures in 2001 and 2002 were respectively 464 and 515 billion for nato 22 and 24 billion for nonnato europe 44 and 48 billion for russia and 133 and 141 billion for east asia and australasia12 it is not clear how much of this increase in defense expenditures is for security or how much is being spent on more homeland security in nondefense budgets httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21937 in other nations increased costs of commerce and reduced travel another channel of effect from 911 is increased private sector costs arising from heightened perception of the threat from terrorism and the increased probability of and costs of such attacks should they occur some of this is reflected in rising insurance costs enhanced measures to ensure security of shipments and in reduced travel and tourism what cannot be measured is the decrease in productivity by individuals arising from lost time greater hassles and general anxiety caused by the new security environment in europe 36 of companies recently surveyed expected terrorists to deliberately target their organization or staff 93 believed that the war in iraq had increased that threat yet the survey found that 77 of organizations spend less than two percent of their global revenues on security13 following 911 in the united states terrorism insurance for property virtually disappeared or prices soared in 2002 prices moderated particularly after congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act with this federal backstopping of insurance claims in the united states through 2005 about 436 of premiums on property are to 9 us office of management and budget 2003 report to congress on combating terrorism september 2003 10 crs report rs21644 defense funding for iraq afghanistan and enhanced

following 911 commercial property and liability insurance rates rose by about 30 on average with target structures eg chemical and power plants iconic office buildings showing steeper increases in response to rising insurance rates for aviation insurance the european union took measures that allowed member states either to pay insurance premiums linked to the risk of war and terrorism for their airline companies or to grant them state guarantee against such risk industry experts expect securityinspired measures to amount to between 1 and 3 of the value of shipments15 the travel and tourism industry was hit particularly hard by 911 and subsequent terrorism but also by the sars outbreak and recession although most of the funds not spent on travel and tourism is spent elsewhere the adjustment costs for the industry and economy can be significant us exports of travel services foreign tourists visiting the united states dropped by 12 in 2001 and 4 in 2002 employment in us industries related to travel and tourism in 2002 was down by 270000 persons from 200116 despite government assistance 15 billion emergency assistance package in 2001 several airlines have declared bankruptcy colleges report that new security procedures are reducing foreign student applications and lengthening wait times for visas17 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21937 conclusion the immediate costs and subsequent economic effects of 911 are large and varied but they still are small when compared with global gdp in excess of 40 trillion for us policymakers central question is how much to spend on preventing another 911 type attack several approaches exist for addressing this question one is to compare expenditures costs with potential benefits damage not sustained and to ensure that costs are commensurate with benefits both the government and private sector share the costs governments take actions to reduce the probability of terrorist attacks in general while the private sector protects or insures against the loss of specific private property the problem with this approach is that the psychological and political repercussions from 911 were so large that many people feel that another 911 should be prevented at all costs also the prospect of nuclear attack by terrorists raises the benefit of prevention considerably second approach is to see what companies spend on security for their operations it appears that businesses are spending about 2 of their revenues and 13 of the value of cargo in shipment on security two percent of the 117 trillion us gdp amounts to 234 billion third approach is to examine the opportunity cost of budgeting for security the cost to the nation of funding for homeland security for example is what is given up by not funding other national programs such as health care or transportation 14 insurance information institute see also crs report rs21444 the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 summary of provisions 15 oecd opcit p 1819 16 see
