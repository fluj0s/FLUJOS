forthebirthday game whynot4or6 well theorigin ofthat figure wasacalculation ofaverage ofstats anditvitally concerns themakebreak point ofanargo what isamakebreak point this isthepoint interms ofgross divisional statistics below which anorgstruggles itdoes nothave money forvithl things like equipment oreven postage staff payislow theorg isselling more than itisdelivering andbacklogging itsadvance payments itdoes nothave money tobroadly promote inshort itisstruggling tokeep going above themakebreak point theres lots ofmoney forthings staff payisgood tech staff isadequate notonly tocatch up backlogs buttokeep upthepresent sales there isagood hcn tokeep ethics inandthestaff canafford aqual notjust forthe public butforstaff enhancement there aremany examples ofthis inorgs onetime boston org wasbelow themakebreak point itonly hadafewstaff it could notdomuch bywayofdissemination everyone wasworki g hard buttheorgwasgetting nowhere then aseaorgcommand earn went inasitsexecs they hired more staff promoted actual regged properly booted interference offthelines began todeliver like awhirlwind andvoilatheorgsoared upabove themake break point thestaff despite increased numbers wasfarbetter paid than they ever hadbeen before booksales soared thecrg grew soprosperous ithadmoney toburn andwasstill sending moe toflag than many soorgs they shot injust afewweeks from well below themakebreak point towell above it andhowdidthey dothis its allintheoecvolumes plus theproductorg officer tapes they simply hired more staff got them onpost putthefull form oftheorgthere inaninstant hatting blitz demanded andgotreal production from every post they didnt even usegimmicks theydrove thepublic inwithti1 usual they delivered good tech likemad 48 lrhed339rl int 2 boston soared itgotabove themakebreak point rapidly andafter th8l itwasallroaring lines andclover sohowabout this 54x noorgintheworld today including soorgs oreven the fsoisabove themakebreak point why because inflation raced ahead while theorgs stood still themakebreak poidt rose insome cases notably afewclass ivorgs being below themakebreak point now they began tofall apart itbecame harder andharder fortheorgtobuythethings itneeded the delivery backlogged further andfurther staff numbers grew less staff paybegan tofall more andmore disestablishment became more pronounced they were harder torunandharder to work in inafewcases notknowing what waswrong they bcan toseek advice from wrong sources andlook forcrazy shortcuts andgimmicks butthereal whywasthat they hadfallen below thecurrent makebreak point ineach oneoftheir gross divisional statitics andthen began tohave ahard time ofit sowhere does this 54x come from itisthemultipleof thegdses togetevery orgintheworld back upjust above their makebreak point inrelation tothecurrent economic scene that iswhytqecomparison wasmade tooldsaint hill it wasabove themakebreak point ofitsday wow anditisvery interesting that itwent from sixstaff to over 250injust afewweeks they were notallscientologists they were wogs butthey went onto areal orgboard p0st bypost they were instant hattedohmygod they were productofficered togettheproducts oftheir hats theback door wasopen through qual forthose whocould notpull their freight while thefront door kept recruiting thefunctions oftheorglisted inlrhed339r went inin roughly thesame order asthey aregiven inthat lrhedandthe volume ofthose functions wasincreased over andover bygoig through that same sequence over andover increasing each function inturn there wasanallocation board forhiring cnd each applicant whocame inwasslotted into that board andput onthenext needed post andasanote this isfareasier to dotoday with worldwide unemployment atanear highest ever than twastodothen these wogs through hatting andproduction onpost an good cramming very rapidly became scientologists andofttcir ownvolition existing field auditors were quick tojoin the winning team andrapid hard intech training ofnewones quickly hadtheorguptoitsears incompetent tech andqual staff themajor pluspoint waspurpose organdwegotone anything that did wascast aside andeverything that did every post there were noother fish towewanted abig boomlng notcontribute tothat waspushed infast on fry andthere wasanother pointitisadifferent idea theconsideration that ittakes along time tobuild somethi1g isnottrue that itself isanaberration aneffort to discourage destruction bypretending creation takes along time ittook only afewweeks tobuild theoldsaint hill org that they didthesame thing afewyears later inboston shows that itisnotjust iwhocandoit 49 lullujjhl int 3 thedifference between notdoing itanddoing itissimply having thepurpose ofdoing itandthen doing it there isrefined tech

soletusputitthis way areyouandyour orggoing to continue tostruggle andflounder orareyougoing toflourish andprosper theanswer depends completely onwhether individual execs andstaff gettheir orgabove
