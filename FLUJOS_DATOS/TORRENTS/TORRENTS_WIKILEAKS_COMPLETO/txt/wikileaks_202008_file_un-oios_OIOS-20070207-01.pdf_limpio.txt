guillaume hendriks united nations nations unies office of internal oversight services unhcr audit service audit of unhcr operations in darfur ar200611503 executive summary in september 2006 oios conducted an audit of unhcr operations in darfur the audit covered activities with total expenditure of us 217 mil lion in 2005 and 2006 draft of this report was shared with the director of the bureau for africa nd the representative on which comments were received by january 2007 management has accepted most of the recommendations made and is in the process of implementing them overall assessment in darfur unhcr is working in very difficult and volatile environment taking this into account along with the positive action taken andor proposed by management to strengthen the internal control weaknesses identified by oios an assessment rating of average has been given nonetheless if the proposed action is not t aken promptly particularly over supply management activities the lack of sound internal c ontrols will continue to have negative impact on the effectiveness of the operation programme management for the three partners reviewed with the exception of the danish refugee council drc reasonable assurance could be obtained that unhcr f unds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subproject agreem ents audit certificates for the 2005 sub projects were not yet available the drc subprojects could have been better managed the 2006 subproject was terminated in the middle of the year following differences in opinion with unhcr the original 2005 accounting records had been transferred to copenhag and only copies of some of the vouchers were available for oios review the main expenditure for expatriate salaries us 420000 could not be supported and the salary rate s paid over us 6000 per month for long periods far exceeded those allowed under unhcrs p rogramme management rules and procedures management confirmed that the salary rates paid wer discussed and the project proposal accepted by headquarters the budget provisions for intersos were not suffici ently detailed about us 620000 had been allocated in 2005 and 2006 without adequately breaking down the costs per activity this budgeting practice resulted in lack of control an d transparency and gave the partner excessive latitude on how to disburse unhcr funds the five per cent headquarters operational support cost had not been correctly computed for intersos as major local purchases were not deducte d from the calculation baseline resulting in an overpayment of us 76800 in 2005 nd 2006 oios has recommended that the 2006 support costs be revised to yield savings of u s 38000 action was taken and us 38000 has been recovered from subsequent instalm ent overall the programme implementation rate was low at the time of the audit programme expenditures were only about 38 per cent of the fun ds advanced to partners moreover the abod costs of us 123 million in 2005 and 2006 exc eeded the programme costs of us 94 million meaning that abod expenditures wer 57 per cent of the total expenditure in response to the draft report management partly attributed the delays to the fact that for some time project instruments were processed in kha rtoum and not in elgeneina and b the instructions received by the so to dramatically red uce expenditures and therefore the lateness of the implementation was not perceived as major problem administration oios observed since its last audit improvements i n the establishment and compliance with unhcrs rules and procedures over administration an d finance for example although there were some delays in the settlement of operational dvances they were monitored and cleared on systematic basis such practice should conti nue so geneina set aside in the office safe cont ingency fund of us 100000 to pay three month salary advance to local staff in case of evac uation and the amount was retained in the office safe for several months in oios opinion th is presented serious security risk to the office and staff also from an accounting perspecti ve the amount was charged directly to expenditure even though the funds were not disburse d the money has since been deposited into the bank and action was being taken to ensure the accounting transactions were corrected the so spent us 100000 on new field office buil ding that was never occupied due to security concerns oios was concerned as the build ing was constructed on leased land whether unhcr could recover its investment management have sought advice from the legal affairs section and it is unhcrs intention t repossess the premises when security improves supply management despite their importance to the operation the supp ly chain activities especially asset management were weak and required urgent attention improvements were also needed for fuel management and warehousing security and safety security considerations have greatly curtailed unhc rs ability to operate effectively in darfur growing tensions have created considerable insecurity for staff and partners in the region morss compliance rates needed improvement but efforts are underway

2006 oios conducted an audit of unhcrs operations in darfur the audit was conducted in accordance with the international standards for the professional practice of internal auditing oios r eviewed the activities of suboffice so geneina and of three of its implementing partners 2 in july 2005 oios had audited the activiti of so geneina and reviewed the partner intersos recommendations were made to rei nforce project control and monitoring activities and significantly improve asset managem ent and fuel management where urgent attention was required 3 the sudanese government and the largest fac tion of the slma sudanese liberation movement army signed the longawaited peace agreem ent aimed at ending the conflict in darfur on 5 may 2006 in abuja nigeria this agree ment followed an april 2004 ceasefire and two peace protocols signed in november 2004 ho wever since september 2005 the security situation especially in west darfur has steadily deteriorated the sudanchad border area is also increasingly at the centre of heighten ed security tensions 4 the main objective of the darfur programme is to make the necessary interventions to ensure that international standards of protection re met for all persons of concern this also includes the strengthening of communitybased prote ction mechanisms in camps host communities and villages of return the rapidly wor sening security situation has curtailed unhcrs capacity to respond effectively to the many challenges 5 the findings and recommendations contained in this report have been discussed with the officials responsible for the audited activitie s during the exit conference held on 9 september 2006 draft of this report was share d with the director of the bureau for africa and the representative on which on which comments w ere received by december 2007 management has accepted the audit recommendations m ade and is in the process of implementing them ii audit objectives 6 the main objectives of the audit were to ev aluate the adequacy and effectiveness of controls to ensure reliability and integrity of financial and operatio nal information effectiveness and efficiency of operations safeguarding of assets compliance with regulations and rules letters of i nstruction and subproject agreements iii audit scope and methodology 7 the audit focused on 2005 and 2006 programm activities under projects 0506sbsudrp332 with expenditure of us 94 mil lion our review concentrated on the activities implemented by intersos expenditure of us 356 million danish refugee 2 council drc expenditure of us 133 million and amel centre for treatment and rehabilitation actr expenditure of us 285000 we also reviewed activities directly implemented by unhcr with expenditure of us 22 llion 8 the audit reviewed the administration of so geneina with administrative budgets of us 123 million for 2005 and 2006 oios was unabl to obtain accurate data regarding assets deployed in the operation similar situati on found in oios previous audit the number of staff working for the unhcr operation in the offices reviewed in darfur was 96 this included staff on regular posts united nation s volunteers and staff on mission 9 the audit also followedup on findings and recommendations made in oios july 2005 audit regarding financial and cash management oper ational advances and supply management in particular asset and fuel management 10 the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems field visits interviews with staff analysis of applicab data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations review of implementing partners 11 for the three partners reviewed with the exception of drc reasonable assurance could be obtained that unhcr funds were properly accounte d for and disbursed in accordance with the subproject agreements audit certificates for 2005 subprojects were not available at the time of the audit danish refugee council 12 due to the security situation in darfur th original vouchers and supporting documents for the 2005 subproject had been transferred to dr cs headquarters in copenhagen complete set of copies had not been retained in dar fur in the absence of the original documents and accounting records and missing photoc opies of expatriate salaries oios was unable to provide assurance that unhcr funds had be disbursed in accordance with the subproject agreement for expatriate salaries onl few contracts were available and this alone was not sufficient evidence of the disburseme nts this accounted for 30 per cent of the total expenditure the 2006 records were available for our review 13 in 2005 the partner had spent us 481000 of the us 660000 remitted the balance of us 179000 was carried forwarded and used for 2 006 subproject activities similarly under the sdd budget an amount of sdd 3937 millio n us 179000 was carried forward to the 2006 subproject drc cited an email dated 19 january 2006 from the senior programme officer as authority to use the 2005 unspent funds for 2006 activities in some cases if sub projects completed on time and the next years sub project agreement has been entered into unspent balances may be usedor offset against the first instalment this was not the case in this instance as funds were advanced to the par tner in 2006 effectively therefore the 2005 unspent amount remained unadjusted 14 for 2005 us 420000 was charged for expa triate salaries the monthly rate paid was us 6000 for the full year one was budgeted at us 6300 the salary rate budgeted and 3 charged far exceeds the amount allowed in unhcrs r ules and procedures in oios opinion the unhcr standard rates should have applied oios was informed that these higher salaries were paid in consultation with headquarters the office could not provide oios with evidence of the consultation process 15 moreover in accordance with unhcrs polic on the payment of implementing partners expatriate staff the lumpsum contributio n should cover all costs such as salaries benefits and related costs including travel oios bserved that in addition to the already high salaries further us 83000 was budgeted for sta ff travel and medical insurance costs and us 41500 was reported as spent on rr travel dsa and travel of expatriate staff to copenhagen it also goes against unhcrs principle whereby salary budgets for partners should be consistently applied procurement activities 16 drc is not prequalified to undertake proc urement on behalf of unhcr and therefore should apply unhcrs ip procurement guidelines drc did not always comply with the required procedures and some exceptions were noted by oios in terms of tendering for goods also adequate supporting documents were not always on file for example there was evidence that the award of the contract for veterin ary items costing us 34910 was done competitively drc stated that the items were of specialized nature and could only be sourced from single supplier while this might ve been the case oios suggested that for the future any explanation for noncompliance with the procurement procedures be justified in writing oios was pleased to note however that in 2 006 the situation has markedly improved with regard to the level of compliance with sound p rocurement procedures unhcrs relationship with the partner 17 during the latter stages of implementation of the 2005 subproject the partnership with drc ran into difficulties this was mainly as there was perception within unhcr that drc had failed to meet all the subproject objectives the reports produced by drc under the information pillar were of limited use and were onl belatedly shared with unhcr and therefore did not assist unhcr in addressing protec tion concerns in timely manner while the rehabilitation projects did make an impact in s ome areas the lack of community participation was noted and commented upon by unhcr unhcr also expressed concern about the lack of geographical and sectoral coverag of the cbrps communitybased reintegration projects on its part drc was conce rned about the lack of clear communication channels with unhcr the lack of clarity of message s from unhcr and staff changes also in their opinion unhcr did not give them the essent ial support required to effectively implement the project such as vehicles telecommun ication and computer equipment 18 in oios view differences that have dir ect impact on the effectiveness of project implementation should be resolved as they emerge if regular and effective project monitoring had been undertaken the gaps in programme implemen tation would have been detected early on and remedial action could have been taken in ios view communication with partners should be improved to ensure problematic issues are identified discussed and resolved 19 management agreed that there had been problems and misunderstandings with the partner and that unhcr had not been getting the pro tection services that had been agreed management stated that as they had been requested t significantly reduce the operations budget due to funding shortages it was then decide d to terminate the partnership with drc 4 and focus on other subprojects more in line with s trategic and operational priorities recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sudan should ensure tha t the salaries and remunerations budgeted and paid to par tners expatriate staff is within the scales prescribed in unhcrs rules and procedures the representation should als ensure that differences between unhcr and its partners are resolved sufficiently early on and resolved to reduce any ne gative impact it could have on the effective implementatio n of the subproject rec01 20 management stated that for the 2007 subprojects t he salaries and remuneration budgeted would be within the scales prescribed in u nhcrs rules and procedures it was also added that partnership with drc was likely to resum in 2007 oios is pleased to note that action will be taken oios will close the recommend ation when it has received copy of the 2007 subproject for drc where salary and other ass ociated costs have been budgeted in accordance with unhcrs programme rules and procedu res b intersos 21 oios was able to reconcile from the summar books of account to the expenditures reported in the spmr intersos operated two nonint erest bearing accounts for the unhcr subproject one in local currency and another in u s dollars the bank account was not operated on joint signatory basis which is contr ary to good accounting practices internal controls over the approval and authorization of exp enditure were assessed as satisfactory overcharge of support costs 22 in 2005 local procurement under the sdd b udget was sdd 195 million us 796000 or 63 per cent out of the total expenditure of sdd 309 million us 126 million this amount should have been excluded from the headquarters sup port cost calculation base with the 5 per cent support cost recalculated oios calculations showed that the budgeted amount should have been us 45500 instead of us 84000 this re sulted in an overpayment of us 38500 in 2005 similar situation occurred in 2006 whe n local procurement was sdd 2058 million us 935000 56 per cent of the total budget of s dd 366 million us 166 million and the overhead support budget should have been us 38000 instead of us104800 oios estimated an overcharge of us 76800 for 2005 and 2006 while it may be difficult at this stage to recover overpaid amounts for 2005 an appr opriate readjustment to the 2006 budget should be made 23 this issue had been brought to the attenti on of unhcr in oios june 2005 audit the corrective measures were not taken and therefore op portunities for cost savings were lost 5 recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sudan should ensure tha t the programme unit comprehensively reviews the 5 per ce nt overhead costs budgeted by intersos and makes sure that these are in accordance with unhcrs rules and proc edures the amounts overbudgeted in 2006 should be adjuste d in subsequent revisions this will result in cost savi ngs estimated at us 38000 rec02 24 management stated that the overbudgeted 5 per cent overhead costs estimated at us 38000 have been recovered from their last inst alment oios is pleased to note the positive action taken and will record this recommen dation as implemented on receipt of copy of the documents showing that us 38000 has been r ecovered procurement 25 the partner is prequalified to conduct pr ocurement on behalf of unhcr but opted to observe unhcrs ip procurement guidelines oios re view found that proper procurement procedures were not consistently applied for examp for the purchase of water pumps of us 43700 while three offers were available the contract was awarded to the most expensive offer without any specific reason recorded for so other purchases there was evidence of competitive bidding 26 overall the documentation supporting proc urement should be improved goods received notes and waybills evidencing the despatch of goods to field locations were not always available also in cases where competitive bidding was done the evaluation and comparison of offers were not properly documented w ith comparative table or listing of the criteria and factors leading to the award of the co ntract subproject budgeting 27 the 2005 local currency budget included lumpsum amount of sdd 675 million us 294000 for cbrps water sanitation and nfis under h98j10999 this budget was not broken down to reflect the exact activities to be implemented and as consequence the partner used considerable latitude in disbursing th em this was repeated in 2006 where lumpsum of sdd 75 million us 326000 had been ma for cbrps oios noted that in some instances in 2005 unjustified costs were made against this budget line for instance the cost of an expatriate staff members salary of sdd 250 million us 10900 was charged to the local subproject but these salary costs were already budgeted for in the us dollar sub project 28 in the future in order to improve budgeta ry monitoring and control as well as increased transparency such lumpsum budgeting shou ld be avoided 6 recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sudan to improve trans parency should ensure that lumpsum budgets are not provided for in partner subprojects budgets should have sufficient detail to facilitate the monitoring and controlling of expenditures against budgets the representation should review the validity of the sa lary costs charged to the local currency subproject and if i t is found that the amount was incorrectly charged it should be recove red rec03 29 since the oios mission management has had extensiv discussions with the partner on the lumpsum budget submission and it has been agree d that this will not apply in their future budgets on the validity of the salary costs charge d to the local currency budget the incorrect amount has been recovered from the last instalment of the partner oios is pleased to note that corrective action will be taken oios will keep the recommendation open until copy of the 2007 subproject budget has been provided which all ows proper monitoring of budget versus actual expenditure c amel centre for treatment and rehabilitation 30 the accounting system was very basic and c onsisted of handwritten ledgers in arabic oios was however with assistance able to agree th list of expenditures incurred to the spmr the expenditures were properly supported and the documents were easily retrieved 31 oios understands that it has been acknowle dged that the partner has done good work and the reason for the end of the partnership in ju ly 2006 was the lack of unhcr funding oios noted that while the unspent balance at the d of the project period had been refunded to unhcr they still have unhcr assets in their cus tody this includes minibus two motorcycles two generators and it equipment unles s the right of ownership is to be transferred to the partner the assets should be re covered b other programme issues 32 staff sent on mission from the representat ion satisfactorily carried out project financial monitoring but performance monitoring was difficul t due to the security situation oios observed that the programme implementation rates we re low as were the associated expenditures even though nine months of the 2006 pr oject period had elapsed as of september 2006 only sdd 217 million us 986400 of the loca l currency budget had been remitted to partners from budget of sdd 567 million us 257 million from the us dollar budget only us 936000 from us 237 million had been rem itted this corresponded to release of 38 per cent of the available funds subproject agr eements were delayed resulting in the late release of instalments to partners affecting the p rogramme and implementation cycle the so relied on the office of the representation to prepa re the subproject agreements fobs and iprs as this capacity did not exist in geneina 33 the insecurity in west darfur had rendered most operational sites inaccessible to both unhcr and implementing partners this combined wit h the relocation of programme staff to south sudan affected implementation the so was also of the view that as the subproject agreements were prepared in khartoum and due to th at offices other priorities it had knockon effect in the late signing of subproject agreements with partners most of them were signed in mayjune 2006 as opposed to earlier in the year it was combination of 7 these factors that resulted in the low rate of prog ramme implementation in the whole of west darfur 34 oios was pleased to note that the programm unit had been strengthened and some of the tasks previously undertaken in khartoum were to be managed locally recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sudan should ensure tha t the 2006 subprojects are implemented expeditiously and that the programme cycle for 2007 is planned well in advance so that subproject agreements are signed in timely manne r and project implementation can begin in the early part of the year rec04 35 in response to the draft report management partly attributed the delays to the fact that for some time subproject agreements were proce ssed in khartoum and not in elgeneina and b directions that the so dramatically reduce expenditures and therefore the lateness of the implementation was not perceived as major pro blem management indicated that to avoid delays these issues have been discussed with partners and they were requested to submit their 2007 proposals by mid december 2006 to enable so elgeneina to process the sub project agreements by january 2007 oios will close the recommendation on confirmation that subproject agreements were entered into in timely manner and subproject implementation is well underway c administration 36 in the areas of administration and finance the so elgeneina generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the period under review there were few table exceptions as outlined below creation of contingency reserve 37 in october 2005 and in february 2006 the so acting on instructions from the head of office set aside sdd 2224 million us 100000 t pay three months advance salary to locally recruited staff in case of possible evacu ation for security reasons the amount was never disbursed to national staff and remained in t he office safe the amounts were charged to the abod under temporary assistance 032 and gener operating expenses 415 in both the years and recorded as expenditure 38 oios pointed out that the practice of expe nsing amounts not yet disbursed contravened unhcr rules and procedures also considering the volatile security conditions holding funds of us 100000 in an office safe was very ris ky both in terms of financial loss and personal security of staff the senior administrati on assistant who was the petty cash custodian was given the responsibility of safekeep ing the cash even though there was formal record that the cash was in the safe oios c onsidered giving this responsibility to local staff member imposed unacceptable levels of r isks oios recommended resolution be promptly sought and in the interim the head of off ice should be ultimately responsible for the funds and the responsibility should not be and sho uld not have been delegated to junior staff member 8 39 so geneina explained that the retention of money in the safe was temporary measure to provide funds to local staff in the even t of an imminent evacuation the so was fully aware of the risks involved in keeping three months salary advance in the safe but had to balance this against the consequences of sudden d eparture whereby provisions would have been made for payment of salaries to staff not evacuated and expected to stay behind there was also an imminent threat of conflict and g iven the circumstances taking measures at the time seemed the most appropriate course of acti on to address the needs of staff staying behind the creation of the reserve was not only mo rally justified but necessary oios was informed that the funds have since been deposited i n the bank and the accounts against which it was initially charged have been credited 40 oios appreciates that the security situati on would have necessitated contingency plans to be established whether to maintain cash in sa fe was the most prudent option is questionable however from an accounting perspectiv the amount should have been charged to vf account rather than expensed also since s ome of the expenditures pertained to 2005 appropriate accounting entries for prior year adjus tments should have been made to credit the full us 100000 against the current abod is incorr ect it has the effect of increasing the current years abod by that extent 41 oios was also of the opinion that it was n ot necessarily correct to make blanket provision for all national staff the instructions provide for the identification of limited number of national staff who would be essential for running the office and if conditions deteriorate other staff would be considered to be on special leave with pay the three months salary advance is payable on an exceptional basis t staff at the discretion of the designated official also other unhcr offices in the country could have assisted in paying salary advances instead of holding such large amounts of c ash in safe recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sudan should ensure tha t any contingencies for evacuation salary advances in the field for staff is done only after proper consultation the representation should ensure that the proper accoun ting transactions are posted to correct the accounts of the amounts wrongly expensed in 2005 rec05 42 management stated that corrective action would be t aken prior to closing 2006 accounts oios will close this recommendation on confirmati on that the accounting records have been duly corrected b operational advances 43 there were some delays in the settlement nd liquidation of operational advances nonetheless in comparison to oios last audit pro cedures had improved the finance assistant was monitoring advances on systematic b asis and advances were not accumulated or carried over into subsequent advances the outst anding balance in vf 364 pending clearance was about us 25000 at the time of the udit close monitoring and attention should continue as some field offices are continuing to perate on the basis of operational advances paid by so geneina 9 c expenditure on field office kulbus 44 in 2005 and 2006 an amount in excess of us 100000 was spent on setting up and furnishing fo kulbus the amounts were disbursed i n stages and charged to the various abod expenditure categories the bulk of it was how ever allocated to 721 which covers alterations and improvements to premises due to th deterioration of security unhcr abandoned its plans to establish an office in the rea while some of the movable items had been retrieved significant part of the investmen t in the construction works remained at the site moreover oios learned that the land on which the building was constructed was rented and therefore the landlord owns the structure the building is currently occupied by concern an ngo who have taken over the lease 45 oios review observed that the so had not followed the proper procedures for opening and closing unhcr office additionally the lease deed had not been shared with the legal affairs section management confirmed that the legal documents have now been shared with this was even more important considering that the construction work was done on leased land the so should assess the value of the building and if it cannot be repossessed this asset should be writtenoff after following the app licable procedures and approvals of lambhamb management stated that the initial decision to st art an office at kulbus was dictated by operational realities however subseque nt developments on the security front forced them to abandon the office it is unhcrs in tention to repossess the premises if the situation stabilizes and therefore writeoff is not presently being considered concern will continue to use the premises and will be requested to release the office as soon as unhcr is allowed to resume activities in kulbus d solar overpayments 46 solar payments were processed in khartoum on the basis of claim documents and calculation sheet sent by the so geneina for sta ff in the darfur operations with the payment of solar centralized in khartoum it establ ished stronger control compared with that noted in the south sudan operation in genera l the process was satisfactory and was operating smoothly few errors were noted with re ference to payment of solar on sick leave and paternity leave 47 it should be noted that during sick leave spent outside the soa other than on medevac the entitlement to solar ceases also sol ar should be discontinued from the date the staff member leaves the soa on maternity r paternity leave oios found that this was not always the case and identified overpayment s amounting to us 10000 in three cases recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sudan should ensure tha t the solar payments estimated at us 10000 and overpaid to three staff members on sick leave outside the soa r on paternity leave are recovered rec06 48 the so informed oios that action had been initiated to recover the solar erroneously paid the staff members concerned have already agreed that the overpayments be recovered action will be taken prior to the year end closure oios is pleased to note the action taken and will close the recommendation on r eceipt of evidence that the amounts have been recovered 10 attendance records 49 improvements were required in the maintena nce of attendance records oios noted some discrepancies and recommended that full revi ew be undertaken and corrective action taken where necessary staff members leave records were duly corrected f expenditure of security upgrades to private res idences 50 some staff members in geneina preferred staying in private accommodation instead of the guesthouses maintained by unhcr oios was in formed that this had the approval of the representation while the unhcr guesthouses are generally moss compliant security upgrades are often required for private residences to make them morss compliant and this may entail additional cost to unhcr oios noted tha t security upgrades to private residence of one staff member cost sdd 839000 us 3650 t his was considerably more than the permissible amount of us 900 management informed oios that four staff members we re living in the house and generator was provided t them for their use resulting in some savings g abod costs and staffing levels 51 in june 2005 oios observed that given the level of operations the existing staff complement appeared excessive some of the manageri posts such as senior field coordinator senior community services officer sen ior programme officer and senior adminfinance officer did not appear necessary in its current review oios determined that even though the scale of operations had increased many of the planned field offices could not be opened due to security issues accordingly the level of expected work was far less than anticipated oios would reiterate therefore that review of human resource requirements be done to determine the level of staffing required to sustain and to implement an effective operation the orb has endorsed the new staffing s tructure that was proposed by the representation that took account both the operation requirements as well as the achievements reached so far in darfur 52 oios estimated that the abod cost for the darfur operation was us 123 million for 20052006 which was considerably more than the pro gramme costs of us 94 million for the same period oios appreciates that the darfur opera tions are protection focused requiring high staffing presence on the ground nonetheless the rapidly escalating staff costs are matter of concern which management should review management stated that there were constant requests to reduce the overall budget and often programme expenditure was curtailed in order not to compromise unhcrs presence on the ground and other activities this meant that budget reductions were at the expense of progr amme expenditure d supply management 53 supply management continues to be weak and an area of concern for management oios review of supply management showed that wides pread shortcomings persisted in the area of asset and fuel management and this has an i mpact on the efficiency of operations fuel management 54 on two previous occasions oios highlighted that the supply of fuel is crucial component of the darfur operation and that it was i mperative that reliable and cost effective 11 arrangements be concluded in 2005 and 2006 up to august the so procured diesel costing us 300000 despite the significant monetary value and quantities involved adequate attention had not been given to the procurement re ceipt issue and accounting of fuel more than two years into the operation the so still pro cured fuel in drums as they lacked adequate bulk storage capacity initiative had been taken to put in place longterm arrangements oios was informed that bulk fuel was brought in tan kers and transferred to drums such practice involving manual handling and dispensing of fuel could expose unhcr to considerable loss short supply and wastage the pr oblem was compounded as the so lacked the means to accurately measure the quantity in the drums 55 stock records reflecting receipts issues and balances were not available when requested at oios request they were prepared for 2006 and for some months in 2005 our review of the stock records prepared were found to be neither consistent reliable nor accurate this was not surprising as the receipt of fuel m easuring stick provided by the vendor was the tool used the office did not have any measurin g device and the fuel drums were assumed on some occasions to contain 198 litres and on othe rs 176 litres in view of the significant difference per drum and the absence of opening and closing balances oios considers that there is significant likelihood that discrepancie s will exist 56 oios proceeded to analyse the fuel stock r ecords and noted that from 12 november 2005 to 31 may 2006 the so purchased 62590 litres of diesel the consumption records for the same period showed that 53029 litres were used in the absence of closing balance of fuel this implies discrepancy of 9561 litres re presenting 15 per cent of the quantity purchased the so needs to carefully recreate the f uel records so that the apparent shortages can be explained physical verification of stock should be conducted 57 the so also maintained buffer stock of f uel of 120 drums 21120 litres valued at us 22000 this quantity was not shown in the stoc k records also strong internal controls were not in place for controlling fuel usage where by an analysis per vehicle and generator with explanations for overunder usage could have been done oios review noticed that there were marked differences of kilometreslitre p er vehicle and litreshour for the generators the so was unable to explain the differences 58 in response to the oios june 2005 audit ssurance had been given that long term fuel arrangement either through wfp or unmis were being worked on it was also stated that bulk storage facilities and measuring devices would be looked into and the administration unit had been asked to identify funds for immediate procurement oios regrets that action was taken despite the assurances given and there h as been change in the situation for the past two years this in oios opinion is not accept able as supply officer at the p3 level has been present in the so the so agreed with oios comments regarding the inad equate attention given to the handling of fuel and all eff orts would be made to correct this situation urgently 12 recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sudan should significan tly improve procedures for the procurement receipt issue rec ording and analysis of fuel in darfur immediate arrangements for bulk fuel procurement and storage facilities should be instig ated in consultation with the supply unit in khartoum sub office geneina should perform regular fuel stock counts to reconcile physical and book balances and undertake regular an alysis of usage per vehicle and generator rec07 59 in response to the recommendation management state d that procurement proposal for fuel bulk storage and handling capacity has bee n submitted to the representation procedures have been strengthened and daily issues of fuel are recorded on spreadsheet and weekly fuel stock counts are undertaken oios is pleased to note that action oios will maintain the recommendation as open until oios rece ives confirmation that bulk storage and handling system as been implemented as well as cop ies of some of the formal records now established to monitor and control fuel receipts an d issuances b asset management 60 oios observed and previously reported in 2 004 and 2005 that the management of assets should be considerably improved despite ass urances by management of the implementation of corrective measures very little has been done assettrak printouts were not available in so geneina and only spreadsheet l isting assets was provided to oios even though an assettrak printout was later obtained fro m khartoum the listings did not provide an accurate and complete record of the assets in darfu r marked differences were noted for example there were 79 toyota land cruisers recorde d while only 49 were operational in the field there was uptodate listing of assets ke pt by implementing partners and there were cases of assets not returned by former partners fo r instance amel centre still had unhcr toyota minibus two motorcycles two generators and assorted it equipment and drc had significant number of unhcr assets right of use ag reements with partners had not been updated oios also noted that some assets were not barcoded including several generators and it equipment complete and comprehensive phys ical verification of assets had not been carried out though oios was informed that verifica tion of assets in few locations such as nyala and zalingei had been done the so acknowledged the weaknesses in this area and asserted that requisite action would be initiated recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in sudan should as high priority improve asset management in darfur to re duce its reliance on the representation in khartoum assettr ak should be installed in suboffice geneina and asset da ta up loaded to ensure reliable and complete information is recorded full physical inventory should be under taken including assets used by implementing partners ass ets with partners longer working with unhcr should be ret urned with immediate effect rec08 61 management subsequently reported that assettrak has been installed in geneina physical verification of assets for unhcr and ips w as ongoing and with the completion of 13 this exercise the database would be updated and va lidated partners longer working with unhcr have been requested to return unhcrs assets discrepancies would be corrected and efforts would be made to ensure that the so was in compliance with unhcrs rules procedures governing asset management oios is pleased that this work has been done and will maintain the recommendation until confirmation that the exercise has been completed and assettrak has been updated and assets with former partners have been returned c warehousing 62 oios review of warehouses in geneina s howed that stacking of goods stored in the three warehouses was unsatisfactory there was ri sk that some of the stacks would collapse in other sections of the warehouse access to goods was difficult and due to disorderly stacking oios was unable to test count many of the items th is may have been the reason why periodic stock counts were not undertaken by unhcr this lac k of internal controls over stock in storage means there is higher risk of unauthorize d removaltheft also pallets had not been used and items stored at the lowest levels could be prone to deterioration the supply officer in geneina should have helped resolve many of th problems and ensured good warehouse procedures were in place 63 stock records are not up to date and diffe rences were noted as estimated by oios the value of inventory stored in the warehouse was abou t us 250000 although oios could not ascertain the value of some of the it and telecommu nication equipment oios recommended that in order to safeguard against the possibility of loss goods in the warehouse be insured oios did note however that the procedures for recei pt and issue of warehouse goods had improved since the previous review 64 the responsibility for ittelecommunicatio n items stored in the warehouse was vested with the units themselves and they were responsible to undertake all aspects of transactions such as receipt recording and issue of ittelecomm unication equipment the segregation of duties was not in place and should be introduced recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in khartoum should ensure that the physical layout of the warehouse in geneina is improved and that the goods are stacked in manner that would facilitate retrieval and physical count stoc k records should be maintained properly and physical invent ory should be undertaken every six months the warehouse conte nts should be insured against loss and theft rec09 65 management reported that physical count of items and systematic restacking has been completed for the elgeneina warehouse and tha t action for the nyala warehouse would follow vendors for wooden pallets would be identif ied for both locations and itbs issued oios is pleased to note the action taken and will c lose the recommendation upon confirmation that the physical count for nyala has been complete d wooden pallets have been purchased and are in use records are all uptodate and goods in sured against loss and theft 14 security and safety 66 unhcr staff in darfur operate in volatil and unstable environment and this has influenced the operations the movements of unhcr nd implementing partner staff have been greatly curtailed owing to security restrictio ns and this has affected project implementation recent reports indicate growing ten sion in the area and even some fatalities for ngo staff working in darfur this has created c onsiderable insecurity among staff members for security reasons some international st aff were briefly relocated to the south sudan operations while some local staff were evacu ated from phase iv to phase iii areas in darfur security upgrades to unhcr offices and gues thouses have been ongoing 67 management stated that despite serious constraints considerable efforts had been made to improve security for staff in darfur it was add ed that unhcr offices in darfur were among the most moss compliant offices in the reg ion field safety adviser is
