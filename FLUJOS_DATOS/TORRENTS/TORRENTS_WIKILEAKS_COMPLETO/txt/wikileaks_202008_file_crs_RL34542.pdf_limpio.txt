authority of 1025 bi llion after scorekeeping adjus tments for fy2009 cut of 36 million less than 1 from the comparable fy2008 level dot would receive net total of 635 billion cut of 1 billion from the comparab fy2008 level hud would receive 391 billion an increase of 4 14 billi on over the comparable fy2008 level however the requested increase in ne t budget authority for hud is largely attributable to decline in the amount av ailable to offset new funding in the hud budget the presidents budget request w ould actually result in an overall decline in nonemergency appropriations for huds programs and activitie s of just over 1 from the fy2008 level the house committee on appropriations subcommittee on thud reportedly marked up draft fy2009 thud appropria tions bill on june 20

is the impending deficit in the highway trust fund the portion of the fund that provides money for federal highway programs has long been projected to have 3 billion deficit by the end of fy2009 the

to prevent the fy2009 shortfall this legisla tion was opposed by the administration however on september 5 2008 the administration announ ced that revenues to the fund had declined more than expected

appropriations and threatened to veto any appropriations bills that exceed the requested level of funding citing last years appropriations experience when some in congress contended that the president refused to negotiate with congress over the final level of fy2008 appropriations congressi onal leaders have been cited in press reports indicating that congress may not pass many if any regular appropriations bills before the end of the 2008 calendar year instead report s indicate that congress will pass one or more continuing resolutions to keep the government operating after the end of

appropriations subcommittee structures since 2003 the house and senate committees on appropriations have reorganized their subcommittee structure three times in 2003 new subcommittee homeland security was added in or der to maintain the existing number of subcommittees at 13 the transportatio n appropriations subcommittees were combined with the treasury postal serv ice and general gove rnment appropriations subcommittees becoming the subcommittees on transportation treasury and independent agencies in early 2005 the house and senate committees on appropriations again reorganized their subcommittee structures the house committee on appropriationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34542crs4 reduced its number of subcommittees from 13 to 10 this change included combining the transportation treasury and indepe ndent agencies subcommittee with the district of columbia subcommittee to the resulting subcommittee in addition jurisdiction over appropriations for th department of housing and urban development and the judiciary as well as several additional i ndependent agencies was added the subcommittee was then known as the subcommittee on transportation treasury housing and urba n development the judiciary district of columbia and independent agencies or tthud the senate committee on appropriations reduced its number of subcommittees to 12 the senate also dded jurisdiction over appropria tions for the departments of housing and urban development and the j udiciary to the transportation treasury and independent agencies subcommittee the senate retained separate district of columbia appropriations subcommittee as result the areas of coverage of the house and senate subcommittees with jurisdiction over this appropriations bill were almost but not quite identical the major difference being that in the senate the appropriations for the district of columbia originate in separate bill at the beginning of the 110th congress in 2007 the house and senate committees on appropriations again reorganized their subcommittee structures the house and senate committees divide d the responsibilities of the tthud subcommittees between two subcommittees transportation housing and urban development and related agencies thud and financial serv ices and general government whose jurisdiction included the treasury department the judiciary the executive office of the president the district of columbia and many of the independent agencies formerly under th jurisdiction of the tthud subcommittees these changes make yeartoyear comp arisons of transportation and housing and urban development appropriation bills complex as their appropriations appear in different bills in combination with various other agencies other factors such as supplemental appropriations for response to disasters such as the damage caused by the gulf coast hurricanes in the fall of 2005 and changes in the makeup of the department of trans portation portions of which were transferred to

faas programs and activities continues to be debated in congress the authorization of the taxes and fees that support the airport and ai rway trust fund the primary source of funding for federal aviation programs was scheduled to lapse at the end of fy2007 these taxes and fees have been kept in force through series of shortterm authorization extensions at the same time there is widespread concern about the condition of the nations infrastructure significant component of which is transportation infrastructure the collapse of an interstate highway bridge in minnesota in august 2007 created concern over the conditions of th nations bridges portions of the interstate highway system are reaching the end of their projected 50year lifespan these factors combined with concern over growing levels of tr affic congestion have led to calls for significant increases in spending on transportation infrastructure the national surface transportation polic and revenue study commission has recommended that the federal surface transportation program be extensively restructured and that surface transportation investment from all sources be more than doubled from its present level to 225 billion annually3 while some in congress are calling for greater levels of federal spending on transportation infrastructure the primary source of federal highway funding the highway account of the highway trust f und is projected to run short of money before the end of fy2009 this was fore seen in safetealu which called for multibillion dollar rescission of contract authority at the end of september 2009 to balance the account but rising gas pri ces have led consumers to reduce their consumption of fuel4 which is reducing the revenues coming in to the highway account congress is considering legisla tion that would provide money from the general fund to the highway account in order to forestall the highway account deficit in fy2009 department of transportation budget and key

including as it does over 3 billion in cuts that have been repeatedly requested and repeatedly rejected by congress creates difficulty for appropriators if the appr opriators restore the funding for those programs even to just the level provi ded in fy2008 the resulting bill will likely exceed the presidents request meanwhile the president has threatened to veto fy2009 appropriations bills that provide more than the requested level of spending highway trust fund status the highway trust fund is the funding source for most federal surface transportati on programs the fund receives around 38 billion annually about 90 of which comes from federal taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel the fund has two accounts the highway account and the mass transit account the highway account receives about 87 of the re venues to the fund the highway account provides funds fo r federal highway programs the mass transit account provides funds for federal transit programs the highway account was expected to run short on money before the end of fy2009 nor was this temporary dip the highway account deficit is projected to increase in subsequent years this was foreseen in 2005 at the passage of safetealu which authorized more hi ghway funding during the authorization period than projected revenues coul d support safetealu provided for rescission of highway funding at the nd of fy2009 to prevent the highway account from going into the red however on september 5 2008 dot secr etary mary peters announced that the highway account was expected to run short of funding as early as october 2008 6 since

sharp drop in revenues during 2008httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34542crs9 7 the 8 billion figure comes from an arrangement reached in 1998 when highway authorizers agreed to transfer 8 billion in highway

fy2009 request due to rescission of contract authority in the fy2008 appropriation however that rescission did not actually reduce the am ount of new funding provided in fy2008as recordhigh gas prices have led motorist s to reduce their amount of driving these events have exacerbated the extent of the deficit projected in 2005 the highway account will still be receiving revenues in 2009 but the expenditures from the account will exceed the level of revenues received the administration has announced that beginning in september it will slow the rate at which highway funds are transferred to the states to level that the highway account can sustain on july 14 2008 the senate committee on appropriations reported out an fy2009 thud appropriations bill which included recommendation that 8 billion be transferred from the general fund of the treasury to the highway trust fund to cover the shortfall7 the house passed separate gislation hr 6532 on july 23 2008 to do the same the administration th reatened to veto the house bill on the grounds that it unnecessarily increases the federal deficit alters the userfee principle of the highway trust fund and je opardizes any hope of constraining future federal highway spending8 however in the face of the immediate shortfall in funding the administration has now ca lled on congress to pass legislation transferring funds to the high way account as soon as possible federal aviation ad ministration faa the faa budget provides both capital and operating funding for the nation s air traffic control system and also provides federal grants to airports for ai rport planning devel opment and expansion of the capacity of the nations air tra ffic infrastructure the presidents budget requests 146 billion in new funding for fy2009 this is 152 million 1 less than the amount of new funding provided in fy20089 the senate committee on appropria tions recommended 154 billion for fy2009 an increase of 788 million over the amount requested most of that increase is for the airport improvement grant program it is difficult to compare the requested funding level for opera tions the largest faa account and facilities quipment with the previous years funding because the budget request categorizes the f aa funding differently than the fy2008 appropriation reflecting the administrations faa reauthorization proposal

preserve air service to small airports in rural communities by subsidizing the cost of that service supporters of the ssential air service program contend that preserving airline service to rural communities was part of the deal congress made in exchange for dere gulating airline service in 1978 which was expected to reduce air service to rural areas some members of congress have expressed concern that the proposed cut in funding for the essential air service program could lead to reduction in th transportation connections of rural communities previous budget requests fro m the current

authority for adjusting the authorized highway funding level up or down to reflect the level of income received by the highway trust account in fy2008 the authorized level was increased by 631 milli

formula for allocating voucher funds to phas it has been overridden in recent years by formulas dopted by congress in the appropriations acts the amount available for voucher renewals each year is
