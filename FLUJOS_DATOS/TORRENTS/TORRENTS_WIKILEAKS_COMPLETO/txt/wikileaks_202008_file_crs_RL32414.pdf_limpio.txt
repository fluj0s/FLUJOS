act 21 usc 151159 her einafter vsta and its applicable regulations as the source of authority fo r its regulation of animal testing and more particularly the licensing of rapid test kits9 the vsta was originally enacted in 1913 primarily in response to substantia l losses being suffered by american hog raisers from the unregulated manufacture and distribution of antihog cholera serum10 the stated purpose of the vsta in 1913 was to prevent the introduction into the united states of dangerous and worthless viruses serums and analogous products for use in the treatment of domestic animals some of which products may be the mean s of introducing disease not now known in the united states and also for the purpose of controlling the use by preventing the interstate shipment of similar dangerous and worthless products that may be manufactured within the united states11 the usda found this legislation necessary in order to protect the farmer and stock raiser from improperl made and prepared

the vsta makes it unlawful for any person to prepare sell barter or exchange anywhere in the us or to ship or deliver in or from the us any dangerous or harmful vi rus serum toxin or analogous product

establishments that prepare viruses rums toxins or analogous products for use in the treatment of domestic animals pursuant to 21 usc 152 the vsta also prohibits the importation of any virus serum toxin or analogous product except under permit from the secretary of agriculture the secretary of agriculture is also authorized to make and promulgate rules and regulations as may be necessary to prevent the preparation sale barter exchange or shipment of dangerous viru s serum toxin or analogous product for use in the treatment of domestic animals or otherwise to carry out the vsta pursuant to this authority the usda through the animal and plant health protection service aphis has promulga ted comprehensive set of regulations governing the licensing of viruses seru ms toxins or analogous

sale barter exchange and shipment only usda regulations d iscussed below authorize use and distribution restrictions in the public interest or for the protection of animals analysis the usdas rejection of creekstones request to privately test all of its cattle for bse with rapid test kits has sparked considerable amount of controversy at issue is whether the usdas decision to reject creekstones request to test all of its animals for bse was valid agency action as such we first examine how rapid test kit might fall within aphiss regulatory purview next we address aphiss purported authority over private companies intending to conduct voluntary rapid tests for bse finally we discuss the validity of the usdas decision in the creekstone case rapid test kits in response to the need for an incr ease in bse testing the usda and some private beef producers have veloped plans to use bse rapid test kits in order for aphis to regulate the proposed rapid test kits however it must be demonstrated that such tests fall within the regulatory purview of the federal agency that is biological products intended for use in the treatment of animals and that act primarily through the direct stimula tion supplementation enhancement or modulation of the immune system the us da has reportedly licensed at least four different companies rapid test kits21 according to the lawsuit creekstone entered into discussions to purchase the rapid scr eening test produced by biorad inc the biorad rapid test kit is an enzyme linked immunosorbent ssay elisa designed for the rapid detection of the

question at any stage of production or distribution is intended for use in the treatment of animals through the detection or measurement of antigen s antibodies nucleic acids or immunity25 the usdas regulation and overs ight of rapid test kits seems consistent with its overarching mission under the vsta and ot her laws to protect us public and agricultural health by assuring that biologics used in the treatment of animals are pure safe potent and efficacious26 creekstone contends in its lawsuit that the bse rapid test kits are not viruses serums toxins or analogous products subject to regulation by the usda creekstone argues that the bse test kits are not used in the treatment of any animal because they are applied to tissue remove d from dead cattle and do not act through the stimulation supplem entation enhancement or modulation of the immune system of any animal27 because creekstone questions the usdas authority over the rapid test kits the court will likely have to ex amine the chemical r eactions and scientific mechanisms used by the rapid test kits in relation to the specifications listed in regulation and the vsta although an analys is of the scientific testing procedures used by each rapid test kit is beyond the sc ope of this report it still appears feasible to conclude that rapid test kit is at l east biological product intended for use in the treatment of domestic animals private testing as mentioned above the us da has reportedly only license d rapid test kits for surveillance purposes this limitation has re stricted the ability of private entities to obtain kits at the center of the debate is proposal from creekstone to privately test for bse 100 of the ca ttle it processes the test s however would be for reportedly marketing purposes rather than the usda approved surveillance purpose the usda claimed that creekst ones proposal had an implied consumer safety aspect that was not scientifically warranted and denied creekstones request to use rapid test kits we could not determine exactly which licenses or permits private company intending to use bse rapid test kits would need pursuant tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32414crs7 28 after discussions with creek stone however it appears private laboratories may need to become laboratory approved by state and federal animal health officials as per notice 0408 it is still unclear nonetheless the exact procedure for obtaining this type of approval 29 see generally chevron usa inc v natural re sources defense council inc 467 us 837 1984 reviewing courts inquiry under chevron is

authority over the actual prep aration of biological product in determining whether an agency action is valid reviewing court examines the bounds of authority granted to the agency by congress29 in chevron v natural resources defense council the supreme court establishe d two part test to assess the validity of an agencys interpretation of an authorizing statute30 first the court will look to the statute itself and determin whether congress has directly spoken to the question at issue if it has so spoken and the intent of congress is clear both the court and the agency must give effect to the expressed intent of congress in instances where congressional intent is not clear and the statutory language is ambiguous the courts will likely defer to any reasonable agency interpretation even if another interpretation is more plausible generally as long as the agency stays within congresss delegation of authority it is free to make policy choices in interpreting statute and such interpretations are entitled to deference31 here it must be demonstrated that aphiss use and distribution restrictions are within the bounds of congresss delega ted authority in the vsta the extensive reach of aphiss authority seems to stem from the vstas broad grant of authority to the usda to make and promulgate from time to time such rules and regulations as may be n ecessary to prevent the preparation sale barter exchange or shipment of any bi ological product in order to carry out the vsta the vsta also provides aphis with broad authority to issue suspend and revoke licenses for the maintenance of blishments that prepare biological products intended for use in the treatment of animals creating regulatory and licensing scheme governing the safety efficacy purity and potency of

agriculture 487 f supp 376 378 d co 1980vsta and its legislative history do not appear to explicitly address who may use biological product the extent to which aphis can deny license or the type of restrictions that can be placed on the licenses indeed with only ten short provisions it could be argued that c ongress intended that the vsta be implemented through comprehensive regulatory scheme the usda regulates the use and distributi on of biological product in 9 cfr 1025d provision pertaining to the bi ological product license it states where the administrator determines that the protection of domestic animals or the public health interest or safety or both necessitates restrictions on the use of product the pr oduct shall be subject to such additional restrictions as are prescribed on the license such restric tions may include but are not limited to limits on the distribution of the product or provisions that the biological product is restricted to use by veterinarians or under the supervision of veterinarians or both on march 17 2004 the usda through aphis s veterinary services issued notice 0408 and invoked this purported power it placed use and distribution restrictions on veterinary biological product licenses and importation permits for diagnostic test kits including rapid tests intended as an aid in the diagnosis of bse according to the notice such diagnostic test kits can only be sold and used by laboratories approved by st ate and federal usda animal health officials moreover it requires that potency testing distribution and use of the bse test kits be under the supervision or control of aphiss veterinary services in light of the lack of explicit langua ge on use restrictions in the vsta we discuss arguments that would seem to suggest that 1025d is supported by the vsta and congressional inte nt as well as arguments against such support arguments for the inclusion the usda asserts th at the vsta provides the authority for the department to ensure that veterinary diagnostic test kits are safe and accurate32 although the legislative history for the vsta has been recognized as extremely sparse by some courts33 the authority for aphis to regulate the design manufacture importation distribu tion selling testin g and labeling of biological products still appears broad the authority in the vsta to issue licenses and implement regulations for such things as the sale exchange and shipment of biologics could arguably capture restri ction on use or distribution indeed restriction on the sale of the rapid test

ogical product license for the products it intends to prepare usda has reportedl licensed the bse rapid test kits for surveillance purposes only and as mentione d above restricts the sale and use of such kits to only those laboratories appr oved by state and federal usda animal health officials arguably using rapid test kits for purposes other than surveillance purposes ie food safety or marketing reason may provide results outside the federally accepted performance parameters for the test for example aphis could argue that the tests which it approved for bse surveillance were not evaluated to determine if they were re liable enough to support claim that every individual animal that tests negative is actually negative34 overseeing the performance of diagnostic test kit to try to ensure that it produces adequate and accurate test results every time for the stated purpose may be compatible with aphiss regulation of the purity potency and efficacy of biological product the fact that the usda intends to keep bse testing within federal and state regulatory scheme seems c onsistent with the congressional recognition in 1985 that uniform national standard would better rve livestock owners veterinarians and the american public35 for example it arguably could be quite difficult to impose uniform national standard if private pa rties were allowed to conduct bse testing private companys economic interests for one might significantly influence companys compliance with federal regulatory protocol along the lines of maintaining uniform standard some courts have determined that where safety efficacy purity and potency of biological products are concerned aphis through its comprehensive regulations has preempted the field36 while these cases generally address the preemption of state common law tort claims they arguably demonstrate the breadth of aphiss oversight in the field of animal biologics it is this expansive field of authority that makes it plausible to argue that regulation over the actual use of rapid test kit would not be manifestly contrary to the vstahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32414crs10 37 the usda specifically included provision for

that allow aphis to monitor the actual possession use and transfer of biological agents and toxins these regulations however find their authority in the agricultural bi oterrorism protection act of 2002 pl 107188 tit ii 211 not the vsta they were apparently implemented in light of the increased threat of biological warfare and require th registration of any individual or entity that possesses uses or transfers specified agents or toxins including bse it is of note that congress essentially reached outside the vsta to support regulating the actual use and possession of these biologi cal agents and toxinsthe restriction on use and distribution also seems consistent with aphiss overarching mission under the vsta to prot ect us public and agricultural health by assuring that biologics used in the trea tment of animals are pure safe potent and efficacious37 for instance rapid test kit may be efficacious for program in which thousands of targeted cattle are tested to deter mine nationwide prevalence but not efficacious to support the certification of thousands of specific individual animals as bsefree because the tests could have some falsenegative or false positive results the restriction on use and distribution could also be buttressed by the usdas objective to preserve domestic and international market confidence in us agricultural commodities for example with respect to the testing of chronic wasting disease the bse analogue in deer and elk aphis has argued that such testing must be performed exclusively by federal and state regulatory agency laboratories in order better maintain intern ational credibility of the us animal health system38 arguments against the inclusion while the vsta and aphiss overall mission broadly support its regu lation of the use of biological product it appears the vsta its regulations and some legislative history place much more emphasis on the manufacture of biological product ra ther than its intended use indeed creekstone alleges in its lawsuit that the vsta only authorizes the licensing of establishments that manufacture bi ological products and not the products themselves39 with respect to the vsta regulations in subchapter of title 9 of the cfr we located only one subpart of one section 1025d which restricts the actual use of biological produc t except maybe for import permits40 t h regulatory control that aphis is attemp ting to accomplish with this one subpart of the licensing regulation could be called into question when viewed comparatively to the developed legal and regulatory fra mework utilized by the food and drug administration fda and two other agencies in the department of health and human services dhhs to oversee similar activities the fda not only regulates human drugs and biological

42 usc 263a some may find that the regulatory control that aphis is attempting to accomplish with 1025d is similar to that of the clia but uses what appears to be much less developed legal and regulatory framework accord ingly there may be some doubt as to the expansiveness of the usdas authority to implement restriction on use like 1025d and the extent to which c ongress intended aphis to regulate who actually uses biological product aside from the legislative history supporting the 1985 amendments to the vsta there appears to be some support in the early legislative history and language of the vsta that it was actually intended to regulate the manufacture of biological products vsta regulations for example may be promulgated to prevent the preparation and sale of wo rthless contaminated dang erous or harmful biological products from this language it may be reasonable to ch allenge as creekstone has done in its lawsuit the extent to which the usda can regulate the use of properly made and licensed biological products42 moreover during 1914 agriculture hearing dr m farrington assistant chief of the usdas bureau of animal industry stated that with the recent production of hog cholera serums it was necessary to supervise the manufacture of these products so that only serums of good quality shall be produced for sale to farmers43 he went on to further note that the vsta was intended to protect the farmer and stock raiser from improperly made and prepared serums toxins and viruses44 indeed the abundant use of the word prepare as defined in the regulations in the vsta and regulations would seem to reiterate dr farri ngtons observations the use of the word prepare in licen sing requirements and regulations may limit the authority of the usda over private companies wishing to use rapid test kits the regulations make clear that establishments qualified to prepare biological products must have valid establishment license and at least one valid biological product license for every biologic to be prepared in the licensed establishment according to aphis regulations prepa re means the manufacture or production of biological product and includes the steps

likely to apply traditional arbitrary and capricious review under 5 usc 7062a s ee analysis under the creekstone case we assume for purposes of this analysis that court would find 1025d reasonable provided court also finds that the usda wa s acting within its congressionally delegated bounds imposition of 1025d on the biological product license and importation permit it could be argued that private company wishing to use rapid test kit would be bound only to the extent it can be shown that it is actually selling bartering exchanging shipping or more broadly pre paring regulated ra pid test kit here however except for perhaps storing the rapid test kits it may be difficult to demonstrate that private company is actually prepari ng biological product as contemplated by the regulations summary the usda appears to have broa d regulatory authority when it comes to the purity safety potency and efficacy of biological products or more generally their preparation manufacture and sale indeed the overall mission of aphis the vsta and its legislative history and some case law all could be argued to support the usdas extensive authority over the production of biological products and could be more broadly interpreted to support usda s oversight over the actual use of the rapid test kits in the alternative given that the vsta and its legislative history do not appear to explicitly address restrictions on the actual use or distribution of biological product court might find that the vsta is ambiguous and could give deference to reasonable aphis interpretation45 accordingly an argument could be made that the use and distribution restrictions on bse rapid test kits are apparently within the bounds of congresss br oad delegations of authority to the usda to issue licen ses and promulgate regulations nonetheless the arguments discussed above also seem to suggest that aphis may not have the proper legal framework in place to support its restrictions on the use and distribution of biological products in addition it could be argued that the main thrust of the vsta and its regulations appears more applicable to the preparation manufacture and production of biological products rather than restricting their actual use however if it can be shown that the vsta does not explicitly make clear congress intention with respect to restrictions on use and distribution ie the stat ute is ambiguous these arguments may not withstand the deference usually accorded an agencys reasonable interpretation of the authorizing statute the creekstone case on march 23 2006 creekstone filed laws uit in the district court for the district of columbia against the usda stioning the departments authority to 1 regulate rapid test kits 2 issue regulations that affect

from the usda as to which permit or license was necessary for it to conduct bse rapid tests usda apparently did not addre ss which specific license or permit was required but rather more broadly rejected cr eekstones request all together court find the usdas regulation of rapid test kits incompatible with the vsta then creekstone would likely be granted so or all of the relief it requests if aphis is found to have the authority to regulate who actually uses the rapid test kits the next inquiry reviewing court is likely to address is whether the agencys discharge of that authority was reasonable such question falls within the province of traditional arbitrary nd capricious review under 5 usc 7062a46 generally the scope of review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is narrow and court is unlikely to substitute its judgment for that of an agency47 nonetheless an agency must articulate satisfactory explanation for its action including rational connection between the fact s found and the choice made normally an agency rule would be arbitr ary and capricious if the agency 1 has relied on factors which congre ss has not intended it to consider 2 entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem 3 offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence be fore the agency or 4 is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to di fference in view or the product of agency expertise48 with respect to the creekstone case reviewing court would likely attempt to determine whether aphiss decision to deny creekstone license to privately test for bse was arbitrary and capricious in light of the evidence presented and congressional intent although we could not confirm exactly which license creekstone applied for pursuant to federa l regulations we be lieve creekstone was attempting to become laboratory appr oved by state and fe deral animal health officials as per notice 040849 as mentioned above c ourts generally provide an agency

reliance on the vsta is arbitrary and capricious 58 usda response at 48because the disease does not appear in younger animals50 aphis also seems concerned with the implied safety aspect si nce it believes that test has been shown to be reliable enough to suppor t use as food safety test51 it has also claimed that the chances of false positive for bse could have devastating effects on the us economy and international trade52 for example during the usdas increase in bse testing early reports of tw inconclusives ie usda pa rlance for rapid test that is not negative for bse apparently had negative impact on cattle markets and consumer confidence53 relatedly for chronic wasting disease the bse analogue in deer and elk aphis has argued that testing must be performed exclusively by federal and state regulatory agency laboratories it buttressed its decision with the claim that the international credibility of the us animal health system was largely predicated on having an estab lished set of g overnment labs54 arguments centered on aphiss role in providing safe and reliable food supply both domestically and internationally are consistent with the usdas overall mission and expertise reliance on some of these findings noted above however may prove inconsistent with the congressional intent for the vsta for instance the legislative history of the vsta ma not support claimed usda authority to maintain domestic and intern ational confidence in us cattle and beef products55 moreover the usdas claim that 100 ra pid tests would have an implied food safety impact may also be inconsistent with the purposes of the vsta which seems more concerned with protecting the farmer and stock raiser and livestock from improperly made biological products aphis has also stated that it does not consider the testing of bovines at slaughte r for bse to be meaningful in the context of either human or animal health56 the lack of an animal health element in aphiss reasoning for its rejection of the creekstone permit would seem to make reliance on the vsta questionable57 in its response the usda now argues that its policy against private testing does promote animal health58

contrary to the facts or other usda practices may also be an issue in court for example aphis has consistently argued that the testing of all animals is not scientifically justif ied however in 2002 and 2003 the usda reportedly tested over 2000 head of cattle younger than 30 months old for bse59 there have also been some reported cases of cattle under the age of 30 months testing positive for bse in europe and japan60 creekstone has argued that the testing of younger animals would actually provide useful negotiating advantage with fore ign countries like japan by disproving the theory that it is necessary to test all animals61 evidence might also be introduced showing the extent to which aphis even considered alternatives or the need for business innovation to keep up with consumer demand creekstone may also try to demonstrate that its marketing bse test program enhances the surveillance aspect of the usdas program and does not have implied consumer safety aspects for example depending on the scientific evidence presented it may be plausible to argue that the testing of animals under marketing program does not necessarily entail treatment as usda regulations contemplate or require the sa level of scrutiny also with respect to marketing the usda apparently certifies many food items for quality assurances that arguably have little to do with food sa fety eg national organic program meat grading and certification beef export verification program and the nonhormone treated cattle program summary the questions raised by the cr eekstone lawsuit appear to be ones of first impression the lack of preced ent coupled with the vstas sparse legislative history and usdas inconsistent statements may make it difficult for the usda to support some of its claims noneth eless courts generally defer to agency decisions that are rationally supported by the evidence as such provided aphis can demonstrate that each of its reasons fo r keeping bse testing within the exclusive purview of federal and state laboratories is rationally justif ied court may uphold aphiss decision
