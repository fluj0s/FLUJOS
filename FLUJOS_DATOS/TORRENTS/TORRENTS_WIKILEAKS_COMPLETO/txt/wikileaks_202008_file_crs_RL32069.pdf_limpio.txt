freddie mac under the federal housing enterpri ses financial safety and soundness act legal analysis by nathan brooksto strengthen the safety and soundness regulation of the enterprises short summary of the administrations views on gse oversight can be found in the final section of this report the current regulatory framework ofheo is an independent agency within hud whose primary mission is to oversee the financial safety and soundness of the enterprises the office was established by congress with the passage of the federal housing enterprises financial safety nd soundness act of 1992 herein refe rred to as the safety and soundness act16 in order to fulfill its mission ofheo is authorized to establish and ensure compliance with capital standard s for the enterprises conduct nnual risk based examinations to assess the management practices nd financial condition of the enterprises and take enforcement actions as specified by the safety and soundness act mission regulation ensuring the enterprises comply with their affordable housing mandates is within the purview of hud ofheo is under the management of director who is appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate for term of five years the office is funded through annual assessments collected fro m the enterprises on semiannual basis unlike other financial regula tors however ofheos assessments are subject to the annual congressiona l appropriations process capital standards the safety and soundness ac t mandated the adoption of three capital level standards for the enterprises 1 the minimum level 2 the critical level and 3 the riskbased level the first two levels are considered static standards where certain amount of capital is required to be held for every dolla r of assets and may vary according to the riskiness of the assets the third level is performance standard derived from stre ss tests these types of capital standards indicate how well the capital on hand functions in keep ing company solvent under variety of adverse economic conditions their wort h depends upon how well the stress tests are structured the minimum level the minimum capital standard requires each enterprise to hold capital equal to the sum of 25 of its onbalance sheet assets plus 045 of the unpaid balance of mortgagebacked s ecurities sold offbook plus 045 of other offbalance sheet obligations the critical level the critical capital standard requires that the enterprises hold capital equal to the sum of 125 of on balance sheet assets plus 025 of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32069crs6 17 congress arbitrarily set the capital standard for management and operations risk at 30unpaid balance of mortgagebacked s ecurities plus 025 of other offbook obligations the riskbased level the riskbased capital standard requires each enterprise to hold enough capital to cover bot h credit and interest rate risks plus an additional 30 for manageme nt and operations risk17 credit or default risk is the risk that borrower will default on the mortgage which the company holds as an asset interest rate risk is the risk of loss should rates ri or fall dramatically this risk arises because funds borrowed by the enterprises may come due and have to be refinanced at new interest rates on diffe rent schedule than the funds received from investments which earn yields set under different market conditions the safety and soundness act specified seve ral of the details regarding the risk based capital standard and directed of heo to adopt financial regulation implementing the standard by december 1 1994 the final regulations however were not issued until september 13 2001 as specified by stat ute the riskbased capital standard involves 10year stre ss period during which severe credit and interest rate shocks occur simultaneously the parameters of the stress test are specified in the law the required level of riskbased capital is determined as the amount that allows the enterprises to rema in solvent in every quarter of the 10year stress period plus an additional 30 for ope rations and manageme nt risk however as result of innovations in handling fina ncial risk the riskbased standards have turned out to be less strict than the minimum standards based on these three capital standards congress defined four classifications with respect to meeting them 1 adequately capitalized if both the riskbased and the minimum levels are met 2 undercapitalized if the minimum level is met but not the riskbased 3 significantly undercapitalized if only the critical capital level is met and 4 critically undercapitalized if none of the levels is met by an enterprise enforcement actions the range of enforcement actions available to ofheo is largely dependent upon the capital classifications for the ade quately capitalized category there are prescribed supervisory actions but ceaseanddesist orders may be issued for c onduct which seriously threatens the enterprises capital base an enterprise in the undercapitalized classification must have capital restora tion plan approved by the office and may not make any capital distributi on that could result in further slippages if plan is approved or an approved plan is not complied with the office is authorized to reclassify the enterprise downward for the significantly undercapitalized class capita l restoration plan and any capital distributions must be approved additional limits may be imposed on growth activities may be restricted new capital may be required and should the restoration plan not be approved

within treasury it can benefit from treasurys financial expe rtise and prominence this action not only can be seen as creating opportunities for c oordination and sharing of ex pertise with ots and the office of the comptroller of the currency occ the two other financial regulators under treasury but also help reinforce th importance of the regulators mission for safety and soundness oversight furthermore it is fundamental principl of financial regulation that the office be independent and at arm s length from the enterprises in 1997 report gao noted that housing gse regulator needs to have the independence and prominence that would allow it to act independently of the influence of the housing gses which are large and politically influential institutions if gse had more political clout and prominence that its regulator it would be that much more difficult for the regulator to implement corrective action19 establishing the safe ty and soundness regulator in treasury allows the office to acquire the immediate level of government prominence that is thought necessa ry for overseeing the enterprises although the benefits of reconstituting the gse regulator within treasury are well recognized there remains consider able debate over how involved treasury should be with the regulatory responsibilitie s of the new office the administration has clearly stated that it will only s upport proposals for reconstituting the gse regulator within treasury that require some degree of policy accountability to the secretary of the treasury20 although hr 2803 would subject the director to the general oversight of the secretary of th treasury hr 2575 the house financial services managers amendment s 1508 s introduced by senators hagel sununu and dole and s 1656 would all prohib it

language found in the ots statute 24 us const art i 9 cl 7funding as previously discussed ofheos ssessments are subject to the annual congressional appropria tions process for many years now ofheo has argued that this process has hindered its ability to conduct effective long term planning and precludes flexibility in resource management for instance during periods when the government has operated unde r continuing resolution ofheo has been forced to cut back on its activities the agency also claims it is unable to respond quickly to important regulatory concerns such as fr eddie macs restatement of income without stretching thin its ability to conduct its primary safety and soundness oversight responsibilities in testimony before th senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs on july 17 2003 the director of ofheo noted that the amount of resources needed to address the issues surrounding freddie macs restatement is straining our resources22 in light of these issues ofheo has recommended that the agency be permanently funded and exempt from the appr opriations process li ke other financial regulators ofheo has said th at permanent funding would per mit the agency to adapt more easily to changes in the ente rprises activity and respond to problems in timely manner the office has asked for assessment language similar to that of the federal reserve ot s occ and fhfb amounts received by the director from assessments under this section may be deposited in the manner provided in section 5234 of the revised statutes 12 usc 192 with respect to assessments by the comptroller of the currency the amounts received by the director from any assessment under this section shall not be construed to be government or public funds or appropriated money notwithstanding any other provision of law the amounts received by the director from any assessment under this section shall not be subject to apportionment for the purpose of chapter 15 of title 31 or under any other authority23 all the bills authorize the director of the new entity to collect annual assessments exempt from the annual congressional appropr iations process however hr 2575 hr 2803 s 1508 as introduced by senators hagel sununu and dole and s 1656 also retain the requi rement that assessments be placed in fund in the treasury the constitution stat that money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law24 thus the bills retain the requirement for appropriations but create permanent appropriation inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32069crs10 these cases the appropriations committees can still cap or otherwise restrict the use of funds by an agency which means that the offices established in these four bills are not removed from the appropria tions process the legisl ative language found in the house financial services managers amendment is similar to what applies to other federal bank regulators and would completely remove the new regulator from the appropriations process s 1508 as pa ssed by the banking committee similarly provides that the assessments collected by the new agency are not to be considered government funds or appropriated monies the bills employ different language as to what costs the assessments are authorized to cover the house financ ial services managers amendment both senate bills and s 1508 as passed by the banking committee state that the annual assessments shall cover all reasonable cost s and expenses of the office while hr 2803 and hr 2575 state that the assessments shall cover the costs of the director with respect to regulation and supervision however it is not clear in the latter case whether for example janitorial staff would be covered under this provision this could potentially expose the regulator to challenges by the enterprises regarding the appropriateness of the assessments also with the exception of the house fi nancial services ma nagers amendment and s 1508 as passed by the banking committee the bills do not address the regulators funding requirement s during crisis in gene ral regulators have found it important to maintain enough working cap ital to carry out elevated supervision in crisis above and beyond normal costs for exam ple in the statute for ots assessments congress authorized working capital fund for emergency circumstances it permits ots to collect fees and assessments in excess of actual expenses to help maintain such fund as the four introduced bills are currently written the safety and soundne ss regulator may find itself without sufficient funding in time of crisis the house financial services managers amendment and s 1508 as passed by the banking committee authorize the gse regulator to maintain working capital fund above and beyond the agencys immediate operating expenses mission approval in the current regulatory environmen t hud has the oversight responsibilities for the housing mission of the enterprises including approval authority for any new program and enforcement of compliance with affordable housing goals the decision to split the oversight functions of mission approval from safety and soundness represented the legislative compromise worked out over the potential conflicting interests that could arise between these two functions for instance if hud had to take responsibility for protec ting taxpayers from the risk of having to make good on gse losses by requiring higher capital then hud could be in the pos ition of simultaneously promoting housing credit and raising its cost alternatively separate and indepe ndent safety and s oundness regulator could set up the possibility of the gses playing the regulators off against each other for example in order to avoid mission change which might lower profitability such as raising goals for specific forms or locations of housing cred it the enterprises might claim it to be unsafe and have the change overruledhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32069crs11 25 damian paletta greenspan give regulator control over gses capital american banker feb 12 2004 despite the separation of these func tions congress included temporary provision in the safety nd soundness act that authorized ofheo to consult with hud in regard to the safety and soundne ss of any proposed new programs this provision expired last year but ofheo and hud continue to maintain open lines of communication in regards to new progra m approval nevert heless there is growing consensus that combining ssion and safety nd soundness regulation would not necessarily create conflict for example other financial regulators such as the federal reserve ots occ and the fdic have been able to successfully oversee both mission compliance and the financ ial condition of banks and thrifts for years in addition the fhfb has combined the two with respect to the federal home loan banks hr 2803 s 1508 as introduced by sena tors hagel sununu and dole and s 1508 as passed by the banking committee would both transfer prior approval authority of new programs to the direct or from the hud secretary under s 1656 new programs must be approved by the director in consultation with the hud secretary hr 2575 proposes to retain prior approval authority with the hud secretary but expand the authority to all new activities rather than just new programs it would also remove th current 45day time limit that hud must meet in order to avoid automatic approval of proposed new program the house financial services managers amendment retains prior approval authority with the hud secretary as well as the 45day time limit but expands the secretarys authority to both new and ongoing program s the hud secretary is also required to consult with the new safe ty and soundness regulator in regard to these programs all the bills however would retain the hud secretarys authority for affordable housing goals andor fa ir housing responsibilities capital standards as previously discussed congress has set in statute the minimum capital level requirements for the enterprises as well as the parameters of ofheos riskbased capital model ofheo does not have the authority to enforce capital requirements based on alternative parameter assumptions or an increase in perceived risk due to unsafe or unsound practices in an appear ance before the house financial services committee on february 11 2003 federal rese rve board chairman alan greenspan argued that regulator must have strong control over capital requirements because without it regulation in my j udgment will be deficient25 hr 2575 and s 1508 as introduced by senators hagel sununu and dole would give the director discretion to apply alternative interest rate scenarios to the riskbased capital model including the assumptions regarding interest rates home prices and new business s 1508 as in troduced by senators hagel sununu and dole also requires that the riskbased capital standard be similar to those used by federal banking regulators similarly thes bills authorize the director to increase the required minimum and critical capital levels for the enterprises by regulation or

exposure and sset growth it could also possibly be interpreted as providing the ability to set capital standards the bill however offers provision to amend the capital standard re quirements currently set out in statute thus current laws specific language pe rtaining to capital may obviate the bills broader construction preventing any changes to the current standards s 1656 mandates that the director review the adequacy of current riskbased capital standards and if n ecessary make recommendations to congress for changes in the statutory levels the bill would also authorize the director to modify the capital level if the current level were determined to be inadequate to ensure safety and soundness the house financial services manage rs amendment and s 1508 as passed by the banking committee would delete the statutory capital levels in current law and authorize the director to establish riskbased capital requirements by regulation or order the director would file periodic re ports with congress describing the risk based capital standard the minimum and critical capital vels and the methodology by which levels were set enforcement authority all the bills except hr 2803 would au thorize the director to reduce the capital classification of an enterprise by one level if the director determines in writing that an enterprise is engaging in conduct th at could result in rapid depletion of core capital or that the value of the property s ubject to mortgages held or securitized by the enterprise has decreased significantly after notice and an opportunity for hearing the director determines whether an enterprise is in an unsafe or unsound condition these bills authorize the direct or to issue ceaseanddesist orders to address unsafe or unsound conditi ons or practices with respect to the enterprises and their affiliates26 hr 2575 the house financia l services managers amendment and s 1508 as passed by the banking co mmittee would also au thorize the director to appoint receiver to liquidate or wind up the affairs of cr itically undercapitalized enterprise under s 1508 however the ppointment of receiver would not become effective unless congress faile d to pass joint resoluti on of disapproval within 45 days in regard to these bills there are two important issues that are worth noting first it is not clear from the legislative language what constitutes rapid depletion of core capital this lack of clarity could prevent the regulator from responding quickly in order to prev ent financial crisis httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32069crs13 27

analytical perspectives pp 8185 29 prepared testimony of treasu ry secretary john w snow p 2 30 prepared testimony of treasu ry secretary john w snow p 3second the determination that an terprise is in an unsafe or unsound condition depends on the potential for deple tion of capital thus the enforcement powers hinge on the enterprises becoming undercapitalized however there are circumstances upon which an enterprise can be considered adequately capitalized yet conducting unsafe or unsound practices in this regard hr 2803 would allow for the same broad enforcement authority as fe deral bank regulators that does not depend on the capitalization of the enterprises the administrations view treasury secretary john snow appeared before the house financial services committee on september 10 2003 and then again before the senate banking committee on october 16 2003 to outline th administrations recommendations for improving gse oversight in his october 16th testimony the treasury secretary emphasized that these recommendations are not wish list of reforms that we would like to see enactedbut ratherthe minimum elements that are n eeded in credible regulatory structure structure that can ensure that our housing finance system remains strong and vibrant source of funding for expanding homeownership opportunities in america27 these same recommendations are outlined in the presidents budget proposal for fy200528 first given that the present gse structure is illequipped to deal effectively with the current size complexity and importance of fannie mae freddie mac and the federal home loan banks29 the administration recommends the creation of new agency to oversee the safety nd soundness of all the housing gses although treasury secretary snow testifie d last year that the administration was not specifically requesting that the new agency be made bureau of the treasury department he noted that it would support such proposal as long as the new agency were established with adequate elements of policy accountability to the secretary of the treasury30 the presidents budget proposal however specifically advocates that the new agency be placed within the department of the treasury the administration views the direct involve ment of the treasury department in providing policy guidance to the new regulatory agency as essential to reduce the risk of regulatory capture and to ensure that the new regulators policies are not reinforcing the market misperception of an implied guarantee according to the treasury secretarys testimony last year the administration requires at minimum that the new agency clear any new regulations and policy statements to the congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32069crs14 31 us department of the treasur office of public affairs joint

treasury department and that the treasury department have review authority over the new agencys budget second in order to strengthen the new ag encys general regulatory supervisory and enforcement powers the administration also recommends the following funding the agency by assessments on its regulated entities that are not subject to the congressi onal appropriati ons process transferring the authority for pproving new activities of the housing gses from hud to the new regulator providing the agency the authority to direct if necessary the liquidation of an enterprises assets and giving the agency broad authority to set both minimum and risk based capital standards finally on separate note the adminis tration also encourages congress to consider eliminating the statutory require ment for the president to appoint five members of the enterprises board of di rectors currently the gses board of directors shall have eighteen members fi ve of whom are appointed annually by the president and the remaining thirteen are elected annually by the common stockholders the administrations proposal would require that all eighteen board members be elected by the shar eholders for oneyear term on april 2 2004 the secretaries of the treasury and hud rel eased statement of opposition to s 1508 as reported by the senate banking committee the statement referred to an amendment adopt ed in
