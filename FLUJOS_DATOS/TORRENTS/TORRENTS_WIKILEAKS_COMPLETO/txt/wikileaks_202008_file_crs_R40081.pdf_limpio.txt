and risk assessment december 3 2008 abstract many members of congress are concerned about the sharp rise in pirate attacks in the strategic waterways in the gulf of aden oﬀ the east coast of africa the hijacking of saudi arabiaowned oil tanker sirius star oﬀ the coast of kenya on november 17 2008 by pirates was another in series of seizures that have focused worldwide attention on economic and humanitarian threats posed by pirates to the global seafaring community and the smooth ﬂow of international trade given the sharp increase in the number of pirate attacks the cost of transporting cargo in international waters could rise dramatically because of the sharp increase in ocean marine insurance rates for ships transiting the gulf of aden commercial insurers for example could require special war risk insurance premium costing an additional ten of thousands of dollars day these additional costs could adversely impact international trade during the current global economic slowdownhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40081g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

may elect to consider adjustments to the federal stat ute title xii of the merchant marine act of 1936 as amended that authorizes the federal government to underwrite marine war risk insurance in circumstances such as piracy title xii administ ered by the us department of transportations maritime administration authorizes the federal government to act as an insurer or reinsurer of last resort to facilitate waterborne commerce should private ocean marine insurance markets not be able to ensure that financial losses due to war risks and piracy will be largely covered policymakers may also elect to maintain the status quo on this statutory authority the property and casualty insurance industry policyholder surplus is calculated to be approximately 505 billion as of june 2008 vessel hull and war risk premiums in the us market paid to insurers totaled approximately 350 million in 2007 and the total value of cargo insurance premiums paid in that year was approximately 833 million

unprecedented number of pirate attacks on merchant ships off the coast of east africa in recent months including the hijacking of saudi arabia oil tanker sirius star carrying 100 million worth of crude the global shipping industry and its insurance companies have called on governments to take immediate action to stop piracy in the gulf of aden and indian ocean1 public attention has now focused on suspected so mali pirates who use sophisticated vessels and highpowered weapons to take control of large oceangoing ships carrying valuable cargoes when pirates seize the ships they usually hold the crew hostage and demand money for the return of the crew tanker and its contents cargo th ere are reports of cruelty or destruction of vessels or the cargo piracy in the international waters off the east coast of africa is arguably becoming viewed by the shippers insurers and pirates themselves as wellestablished practice that functions in business model that includes precise wellestablished calculations of the amount to be paid as ransom and professional assurances of the safety of crew ship and cargo while negotiations proceed shippers generally purchase ocean marine insurance to protect against financial loss or injury to their crew cargo and the ship itself still pirates pose an economic threat to the global seafaring community and the smooth flow of international trade by commercial shipowners and operators also the cost of transporting cargo could rise dramatically because of the sharp increase in commercial shipping insurance rates for ships transiting the area by one estimate due to piracy in the gulf of aden the cost of insuring container went from 900 in 2007 to 9000 in the closing months of 2008 2 these increases could trigger further rises in later phases of manufacturing and production g22g145g142g561g5g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g21g146g157g158g138g157g146g152g151g561

the gulf of aden is considered strategically important international waterway that carries third of the worlds crude oil over 20000 vessels pass through this area each year the gulf of aden lies between yemen and somalia and connects the indian ocean to the red sea and the suez canal other areas of the world that are viewed at risk for ocean piracy include indonesia nigeria bangladesh and india ocean marine insurers have urged shippers to stay at least 200 miles off the coast on november 17 2008 the sirius star saudiowned crude oil tanker was seized in the indian ocean by suspected somali pirates 450 nautical miles off the coast of kenya in the indian ocean the 1 piracy may be defined as an act of violence at sea by passengers who mutiny and rioters who attack the ship from boat

pirates are now in negotiation with the shipper for ransom4 the seizure of the star was an unprecedented attack given its distance from shore 450 nautical miles in the indian ocean and the size of its target supertanker compared to the majority of recent attacks shippers believe they can avoid the pirates by sailing farther offshore but this means more time at sea and extra costs as result ocean marine insurers are considering enlarging the war risk zone decision that would escalate the cost of shipping part of the higher cost would be the extra time and fuel consumed by going via the cape of good hope rather than the suez canal also insurers could require special war risk insurance costing tens of thousands of dollars more per day to cover travel across much greater area of water 5 merchant shippers would also have to incur additional expenses to hire security force to protect their vessels one estimate of the added cost for security ranges as high as 60000 per trip 6 on november 19 2008 pentagon officials released statistics showing that in 2008 there had been 95 reports of piracy attacks on merchant ve ssels in the gulf of aden with 39 of these resulting in the capture of vessels7 the us government has responded militarily to such piracy by sending four us navy warships from the fifth fleet to the gulf of aden off the cost of somalia officials have also expressed an interest in working through the united nations to encourage somalia to curb piracy activities operating from its shores an outcome that would be difficult to achieve since somalia has functioning government the us warships have joined other warships from different countries now patrolling the area 8 according to pentagon officials many attacks were thwarted by the presence of military forces or by defensive measures taken by ship captains us military officials are encouraging merchants to sail with armed guards and to travel within lanes now patrolled by us warships

industry appears negligible given the size of the property and casualty insurance industrys policyholders surplus of about 505 billion as of june 2008 and the relatively low total cost of vessel hull and war risk premiums of approximately 350 million and total cargo premiums written by us marine insurance market in 2007 of 833 million it appears that the insurance industry would be financially

insurance underwriters at the lloyds of london designated the gulf of aden warrisk zone subject to special insuranc premium londonbased ocean marine insurers have raised rates for ships making the voyage through the gulf of aden and the suez canal these levels of increase can only be estimated because of the competitive nature of the ocean marine insurance business one group of london insurance brokers and underwriters estimates extra premiums at 10000 to 20000 per trip through the gulf 9 us rates however apparently have not changed according to representatives of the american institute of marine underwriters aimu us ocean marine insurers have not had to pay ransom for any act of piracy therefore they say hull and cargo insurance rates for vessels leaving the united states remain the same the global shipping industry is most concerned about vessels that carry oil chemicals coal iron ore wheat and other commodities because these vessels tend to be more vulnerable to pirate attacks than container vessels that carry manufactured goods container vessels are considered more difficult to seize by pirates because they ride higher in the water and are more difficult to board and seize from small boat the increase in pirate attacks is occurring at time when the shipping industry is expressing concerns about its financial health one devel opment is that the frequency of hiring dry bulk carriers key industry component has decreased the hire rates have dropped over 90 in the last six months10 in some cases the hire rate has dropped because the financial industry has stopped financing trade due to the global economic crisis11 in addition many ship owners and other key industry participants apparently face severe losses from the global financial market crisis some major dry bulk shippers lost money speculating on the market in shipping derivatives that offered potential for strong investment returns12 shipping derivatives were developed to manage risk stemming from fluctuations in freight rates vessel prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates more effectively in cheaper and more flexible manner many shippers made derivative bets mistakenly on the direction of dry bulk rates during 2008 with respect to the piracy issue besides the sirius star there are an estimated 14 other ships and their crews currently being held by pirates13 londonbased shipping firms usually are at times prepared to pay ransom because the demanded sums are considered low ranging from 500000 to 2 million compared with the value of the ships and its cargo such payments are reimbursed because the hull insurance policies issued in london explicitly cover the peril of piracy14 hull 9 piracy threat hikes insurance premiums insurers to raise rates in highrisk

for the peril of piracy most of the 18 vessels however have cargo valued low enough that shippers likely will not pay the ransom demanded by the pirates the ransom demanded exceeds the value of the cargo one exception is ukrainian freighter currently being held by pirates whose cargo includes military tanks rocketpropelled grenades and antiaircraft guns according to media reports deal has been reached for the ships owners to pay an undisc losed ransom in exchange for the return of the ship15 in this case questions of public safety and threats of civil instability were considered along with financial calculations g4g138g156g146g140g156g561g152g143g561g15g138g155g146g151g142g561g11g151g156g158g155g138g151g140g142g561 marine insurance is coverage for goods in transit and for the commercial vehicles that transport them on water and on land marine insurance is divided into inland marine and ocean marine insurance inland marine insurance covers transportationrelated or transportable property on land and air transportation as well as bridges tunnels and other modes it is insurance for shipment that does not involve ocean transport american ocean marine insurance provides coverage for vessels and their cargo on the high seas lakes or inland waterways there are four basic types of ocean marine insurance hull insurance that covers physical risk to the ship like grounding or damage from heavy seas collision sinking capsizing being stranded fire piracy and jettisoning cargo to save other property cargo insurance that covers the goods transported in the ship hull war risk insurance including automatic termination and cancellation provisions in the event of war and protection and indemnity pi which covers liability involving the crew docks and piers ship owners can purchase separate kidnap and ransom insurance for crew members 16 g10g158g149g149g561g11g151g156g158g155g138g151g140g142g561 hull insurance primarily covers physical damage to vessels hull and the machinery and equipment the insurance also covers collision liability associated with damage to other vessels and their cargoes resulting from collision with the insured vessel the hull insurance policy indemnifies the insured shipowner for these damages most american shippers use the hull insurance form called american institute hull clauses aihc developed by the american institute of marine underwriters trade association for marine insurers 17 the aihc is used primarily for oceangoing cargo and passenger vessels 15 jeffrey gettleman mediator says ransom deal has been reached for pirated ukrainian freighter the new york times december 1 2008 p 16 in addition to hull cargo war risk and pi insurance other marine insurance polices are available to meet special needs these policies include freight insurance loss of charter hire insurance builders risk insurance and ship repairers legal liability policies these policies are not at issue in the piracy threat 17 see american

that traverse american rivers and coastal waters in addition it is customary for some insurance brokers to develop their own marine forms for submission to underwriters this is possible because there is standard form of marine insurance policy recognized by law in the united states american ship owners operators and merchants may also purchase marine insurance overseas especially through the london market which uses its own form the london institute hull form known as the 1983 clauses or institute time clauses hulls explicitly covers loss or damage caused by piracy page 58 of the form 18 there is exclusion in order to provide uniformity great britain codified its marine insurance law in the landmark marine insurance act of 1906 this act established the lloyds form of policy as an example but is not required policy form the approach developed in great britain is to provide constant rules of interpretation so that there would be certainty of meaning and stability in ocean marine insurance transactions with respect to coverage for acts of piracy it is instructive to note that the aihc includes piracy as named peril on line 71 but excludes piracy on line 245 as an insured peril in the event of war recognizing the war risk exclusion us shippers have the option of purchasing separate war risk policy called the american institute hull war risk and strikes clauses which effectively covers the excluded war perils including piracy 19 however even under the hull war risk insurance policy the marine insurer retains the right to cancel the policy at any time in the event the private insurers war risk insurance is cancelled the us department of transportations maritime administrations marine war risk insurance and reinsurance federal backstop automatically provides insurance andor reinsurance to the ocean marine shipping industry see war risk insurance discussion below g17g140g142g138g151g561g5g138g155g144g152g561g11g151g156g158g155g138g151g140g142g561 ocean cargo insurance policies are written as separate coverage from hull insurance because merchants typically ship cargo via vessels owned by others ocean cargo insurance may be classified in two ways policies issued to cover river and harbor cargo and those issued to cover international trade that occurs on the oceans and seas cargo policies may also be classified by whether they are designed to cover particular voyage specific time period or commodity such as grain cotton iron ore or whether they are adapted to cover cargo general in its nature cargo policies may be issued for single cargo risk special or single risk cargo policies and those that cover automatically all shipments of an insured open or floating policies subject to cancellation with 30 days notice
