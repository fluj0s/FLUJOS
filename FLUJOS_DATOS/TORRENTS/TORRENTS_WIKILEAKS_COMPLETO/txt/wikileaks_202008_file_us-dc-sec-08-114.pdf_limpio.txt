since 10 september 2008 of web sites used as quasiofficial dissemination platforms for alqaida and its affiliates and the subsequent increase in jihadist material posted to the video sharing nd social networking site youtube suggest that the site wi ll likely play an increasingly important role in the spread of alqaida video messages all official alqaida videos released since 10 september 2008 have been c opied to youtube often immediately after their release on jihadist web sites currently acting as official diss emination platforms while youtube is not an official platform for the release of videos from alqaida and its affiliates jihadists use of the site to spread official statements and other jihadist video productions has become more systematic and consistent in the wake of the 10 september 2008 outages youtube offers administrative technical and audiencerelated advantages over traditional propagation platforms an osc review of eng lish and arabic language jihadist content posted to youtube over the past year revealed that ever since the web sites used as fficial dissemination points for alqaida and its affiliates became unavailable on 10 september 2008 alqaida releases have been more consistently posted to youtube this trend indicates recognition of youtube as reliable alternative for the spread of official statements and as means to reach broader audience source
