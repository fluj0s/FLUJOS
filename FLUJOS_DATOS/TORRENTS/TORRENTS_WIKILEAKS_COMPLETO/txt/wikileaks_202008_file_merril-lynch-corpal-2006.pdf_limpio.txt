of business process the strategy is to u existing infrastructure and add certain critical components like procedures of bac kup tape testing for restorability ensure sla with vendors identify cold standby sites for restarting equipment andor storage of dr tapes this would be the first level contingency plan for drp the crisis management plan will be tested at regula r frequencies of at least once every three months and staff to be given adequate training and skill upgrade in the areas required copal research now needs to take the way ahead and start putting together the components required for its business functions as of now the identified applications are the windows file services messagi ng services and backup services also other avenues would be explored lik stocking spares

threaten an organizat ion by disrupting the business processes these risks include traditiona l emergencies like fires floods earthquakes and tornados as well as risks f rom physical and cyber terrorism cyber crime computer and telecommunicat ions failures theft employee sabotage and labor strife any one of th can all be very disruptive for the business disaster recovery plan dr can be defined as the processes procedures decisions and activities to ensure that an organiza tion can recover and continue to function through an operational interru ption the aim of dr is to achieve cost effective contingency and recovery s olution that balances the value of potential losses to the business and its ssets against the cost of guaranteeing continuity of critical business proces ses service levels may be reduced due to business interruption but through go od planning minimum level of service can be provided and perception f business as usual conveyed to the customer or client 11 mission and objectives mission to ensure timely recovery of critical business oper ations of copal research after an interruption and return back to normalcy objectives 1 develop cost effective business resumption plan based on the recovery strategy to ensure smooth operation of critical fu nctions 2 define roles responsibilities of dr team membe rs 3 define schedules for training and mock

any reason exceeding predetermined amount of time during these times service delivery would be interrupted minimum allowable downtime defined for critical dev ices at copal research varies from 2 hours to 48 hours for different business functions this is as per the business impact analysis sheet ismsl291c disaster recovery framework downtime of greater than predetermined allowable utage time for the respective business function is defined as disaste r and the recovery procedures would come into effect resumption of time sensitive business operation is dependent on availability of the

components wi th the critical services that they provide and based on that information to cha racterize the consequences of disruption to the system components results f rom the bia should be appropriately incorporated into the analysis and st rategy development efforts for the organizations dr plan 31 contingency planning and risk management process process description risk management encompasses set of activities to identify control and mitigate risks to an it system in the risk assessment process carried out by risk assessment team threats and vulnerabilities existing in the systems were id entified so that appropriate controls can be put into place to either prevent in cidents from happening or to limit the effects of an incident glyph3type of threats addressed glyph3natural eg hurricane tornado flood and fire glyph3human eg operator error sabotage implant of malicious code and terrorist attacks ismsl291c disaster recovery framework glyph3environmental eg equipment failure software rror and telecommunication network outage and electric power failure glyph3identifying and documenting residual risks for whic h contingency plans must be put into place glyph3a thorough risk assessment was conducted to identif glyph3risks threats glyph3current controls in place glyph3the likelihood of occurrence and its impact because risks can vary over time and new risks may replace old ones as system evolves the risk management process must by ongoing and dynamic risk assessment activity should be carried out on periodic basis once in 6 months responsibility the recovery teams should carry out the risk assess ment activity and findings should be conveyed to the dr coordinator 32 key locations key processes and classification the matrix given below table 33 explains copal r esearchs key locations with recovery priority and the critical time frame the optimum point to recover the it system by balancing the cost of syst em inoperability against the cost of resources required for restoring the system this can be depicted using simple chart such as the example in figure 32 the point where the two lines meet will define how long the organization ca n afford to allow the system to be disrupted figure 3 2 recovery cost balancing npil costrecovery estimate npil cost recovery estimate ismsl291c disaster recovery framework as of this document we have used assumptions and q ualitative analysis to arrive at allowable outage times of business functi ons and the recovery strategy the assumed allowable outage time for key business processes are defined in the table 33 criticality matrix these outage tim need to be defined by business heads this information is used as base for defining di saster and recovery strategy since allowable downtime is in the range of 2 48 hours recovery strategy along with base line would be different for diff erent applications depending on the allowable outage times dotted blue lines in the above figure show copal

from the list of functions listed above we conclud the following glyph3priority defined here is the sequence in which the applications need to be brought back up in case of disaster ismsl291c disaster recovery framework 4 recovery strategy one of the most important aspects of disaster recov ery planning for the majority of organizations is in choosing an appropr iate strategy for the back up and recovery of the it based systems the key business processes are matched against the it system and an appropriate speed of recovery strategy is chosen parameters considered while developing the strategy include 11critical assets 12allowable outage time 13operational requirements of copal research 14cost 15commercial contracts with alternate site vendor s 16service level agreements slas with the equipm ent vendors 17power supply backup ups etc 18offsite backup media storage as listed in table 33 criticality matrix allowabl downtime varies in the range of 2 hours to two days based on the current state assessment the planning and groundwork required for recovery strategy suggested for copal research is as follows 11critical assets identification and retrieval pro cess documentation these should be documented and reviewed for changes every 3 months 12back up process based on the criticality of the systemsapplication these should be reviewed every 3 months 13restoration testing of backup tapes should be d one every month 14dr organization structure with welldefined rol and responsibilities the resources should be trained dequately and skilled in all aspects 15testing of the dr processes to be carried out s classroom at least every two months and actual drills every three mon ths 16modification if required after the testing phas budget plan for dr now needs to be prepared the budget plan takes into account costs occurring under various heads costs can be onetime investment or they can be recurring in nature the budget plan should be reviewed and updated on regular basis ismsl291c disaster recovery framework 41 recovery strategy and plan 411 prerequisites glyph3business functions once defined as dr critical and non critical are segregated we now undertake to

disaster recovery framework glyph3we need to put definite times to our procedures fo r processes such as backup and restore we need to ensure they finish w ithin definitive timelines any deviation from the timelines should be viewed seriously and recorded for further investigation glyph3all incidents small and big should be recorded in formal incident response form in accordance with the incident respo nse security policy ismsl291c disaster recovery framework 44 plan testing and exercises plan testing is critical element of viable dr c apability testing enables plan deficiencies to be identified and addressed testin g also helps evaluate the ability of the recovery staff to implement the plan quickly and effectively each dr element should be tested to confirm the accuracy of

glyph3coordination among recovery teams glyph3internal and external connectivity glyph3system performance using alternate equipment glyph3restoration of normal operations glyph3notification procedures the basic format for dr test is classroom exercises participants in classroom exercises often called t abletop walk through the procedures without any actual recovery operations ccurring classroom exercises are the most basic and least costly of th two types of exercises and should be conducted before performing functional exercise guidelines for classroom exercises develop and conduct plan exercises exercises will grow in complexity over time include announced and unannounced events glyph3document the objectives for each exercise individu objectives should include responsibility assignments and measu rement criteria glyph3evaluate the results of each exercise against pres tated measurement criteria and document results along wit h proposed plan enhancements glyph3emergency response exercises should be ongoing qua rterly events using alternate scenarios and should involve every organization within particular facility that may be affected b system disaster oexercises can be conducted in phases such as ophase 1 firstlevel activation of the continuity p lan initial damage assessment and reporting the findi ngs to the team for use in decision making ophase 2 walkthrough of checklists for restoration of critical devices and offsite backup arrangements i n this phase logistics procedures can be verified and note d ismsl291c disaster recovery framework to derive the most value from the test the dr coor dinator should develop test plan designed to test the selected elements against explicit test objectives and success criteria the test plan shou ld include schedule detailing the time frames for each test and test pa rticipants the test plan should also delineate clear scope scenario and gistics the scenario chosen may be worst case incident or an incident most li kely to occur it should mimic reality as closely as possible it is important that an exercise must never disrupt normal operations if testing at the alternate facility the dr coordinator shoul d coordinate test dates and operations with the facility test results and less ons learned should be documented and reviewed by test participants and ot her personnel as appropriate information collected during the test and posttest reviews that improve plan effectiveness should be incorporated i nto the contingency plan 45 training of dr team it is very important that it department members kno w about operations which are not covered in their regular job responsibiliti the training should be carefully planned and delivered on structured bas is training may be delivered either using inhouse resources or extern resources depending upon available skills and related costs skill matrix of copal research it staff members i s to be maintained the skill matrix summarizes resources available in various ca tegories and their skill level objective resources identified in different categories can be given some training so that they can start the recovery proced ures before getting support from vendor or other locations developing expertise for the recovery of critical s ystems identified at copal research recovery teams should be aware of systems recovery process flow at other locations scope it staff members identified in recovery teams to be trained also an agreement regarding the confidentiality of copal research data should be signed with them training needs assessment the plan must specify which person or group of pers ons requires which type of training training materials development schedule once the training needs have been identified it is necessary to specify and develop suitable training materials th is can be time consuming task and unless priorities are given to critical training program all the drp areas will not be cov ered ismsl291c disaster recovery framework 5 dr plan management and administration dr plan administration is the responsibility of d esignated individual such as dr coordinator as the custodian and

management encompasses set of activities to identify control and mitigate risks to an it system in the risk assessment process carried out by risk assessment team threats and vulnerabilities existing in the systems were identified so that appropriate controls can be put into place to either prevent incidents from happening or to limit the effects of an incident type of threats addressed glyph3natural eg hurricane tornado flood and fire glyph3human eg operator error sabotage implant of malicious code and terrorist attacks glyph3environmental eg equipment failure software rror and telecommunication network outage glyph3and electric power failure identifying and documenting residual risks for whic h contingency plans must be put into place thorough risk assessment was conducted to identif glyph3risks threats glyph3current controls in place glyph3the likelihood of occurrence and its impact because risks can vary over time and new risks may replace old ones as system evolves the risk management process mu st by ongoing and dynamic risk assessment activity should be car ried out on periodic basis once in 6 months responsibility the recovery teams should carry out the risk assess ment activity and findings should be conveyed to the dr coordinat or key locations key processes and classification the matrix given below table 31 explains copal r esearchs key locations with recovery priority and the critical t ime frame the optimum point to recover the it system by balancing the cost of system inoperability against the cost of resources required for restoring the system in this document we have used assumptions and qual itative analysis to arrive at allowable outage times of business fun ctions and the recovery strategy the assumed allowable outage time for key business processes are defined in the table 31 criticality matrix these outage times need to be defined by business heads and are used as base for defining disaster and recovery strategy since allowable downtimes are in the range of 2 4 8 hours recovery strategies are different across applications depen ding on allowable outage times key processes and allowable outage times the key functions at copal research and allowable utage time for key business processes are defined in the table 31 criticality matrix table 31 criticality matrix function allowable outage time windows based

processes recovery strategy one of the most important aspects of disaster recov ery planning for the majority of organizations is in choosing an app ropriate strategy for the back up and recovery of the it based systems the key business processes are matched against the it system and an appropriate speed of recovery strategy is chosen parameters considered while developing the strategy include

with the equipment vendors glyph3power supply backup ups etc glyph3offsite backup media storage as listed in table 31 criticality matrix allowabl downtime varies in the range of 2 hours to one day based on the current state assessment the planning and groundwork required for recovery strategy suggested for copal research is as follows 2 critical assets identification and retrieval proc ess documentation these should be documented and revie wed for changes every 3 months 3 back up process based on the criticality of the systemsapplication these should be reviewed every 3 months 4 restoration testing of backup tapes should be don every month 5 dr organization structure with well defined roles and responsibilities the resources should be trained dequately and skilled in all aspects 6 testing of the dr processes to be carried out as classroom at least every two months and actual drills every thr ee months 7 modification if required after the testing phase budget plan for dr now needs to be prepared the budget plan takes into account costs occurring under various he ads costs can be onetime investment or they can be recurring in nat ure the budget plan should be reviewed and updated on regular ba sis recovery strategy and plan prerequisites glyph3we now undertake to build recovery procedures first for the dr critical functions and within this list we start b taking the most critical functions sorted on least allowable outag times glyph3the next step is to identify the it functions which the business functions use here we restrict ourselves to those it functions which are present in the server room the it functi ons here would include server related functions application interfaces and databases essentially we cover access to the servernetwork devices and the applications running on them throwing information back to the users strategy glyph3business processes are prioritized as function of business criticality and the probability and severity of pos sible incidents to the systems on which they rely glyph3full recovery procedures must be planned and docume nted for each incident type and for each business critical p rocess and system these procedures must be tested and impro ved on recurring basis glyph3each incident type must include and action plan call tree and an escalation matrix within the company and with l external organizations eg isps involved in the process glyph3risk mitigation techniques must be used wherever po ssible to decrease the likely impact of catastrophic event where possible fully redundant automatic failover syste ms should be employed glyph3data must be preserved in multiple sites and in mul tiple media with at least one copy of data always kept offline glyph3process owners operations teams and delivery team s must all be familiar with recovery processes and aware of th eir roles in the same glyph3to ensure process improvement proper analysis mu st follow every incident glyph3in case of disaster reputation of the company sh ould be safeguarded only the president or ceo of copal res earch is authorized to communicate to the media risk mitigation mitigation methods should be
