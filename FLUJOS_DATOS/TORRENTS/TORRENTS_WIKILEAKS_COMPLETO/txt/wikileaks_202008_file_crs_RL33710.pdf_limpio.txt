passed the family and medical leave act fmla to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families1 recognizing that many employees had to choose between parenting or caregiving and job security congress sought to enable employees to take reasonable leave for medical reasons for the birth or adoption of child and for the care of child spouse or parent with serious health condition2 when the fmla was enacted it supplem ented approximately 30 state statutes that provided some form of family and medical leave to employees who worked in those states congress did not intend to preempt these laws3 rather congress wanted to establish minimum standards for the availability of family and medical leave particularly in states that did not have statutes extending such leave to their employees congress understood that more favorable leave benefits could be available under some state laws thus ction 401b of the fmla indicates that nothing in the federal law s hall be construed to supersed any provision of any state or local law that provides greater family or medical leave rights than the rights established under the fmla4 although the fmla and state family nd medical leave laws are generally similar with regard to the availability of leave they differ both in terms of coverage and scope for example under the fmla and many of the state family and medical leave statutes and regulati ons only certain employers ar required to provide leave to their employees the fmla applies only to employers engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting commerce that ve at least 50 employ ees who are employed for each working day during each of 20 or more calendar workweeks in the current or preceding calendar year5 in contrast the state family and medical leave
