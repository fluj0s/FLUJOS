these are that free trade agreements ftas in granting tariff advantages to businesses that import co mponents or products from fta countries put companies that import components from third countries not party to an fta at tariff disadvantage critics however say the effects the bill generally seeks to address are the exact intended consequences of ftas the united states extends preferential tariff treatment to components from an fta partner country in exchange for that countrys lowering of its tariff rates on us products the tap proposal would permit certa in businesses to permanently borrowus free trade agreements ftas in order to import components at rates below those they would normally be char ged under us tariff law there would be two stipulations 1 the products using thirdcountry component s would have to be produced in us foreigntrade zone and 2 the product would have to meet the rulesoforigin domestic content re quirements of any fta which could be satisfied by using entirely third country pa rts and us labor without input from any other fta partner country the tap proposal is reportedly being wi dely promoted on capitol hill by its association sponsor the naftz as tool for helping multina tional corporations sourcing from nonfta countries level the playing fi eldto achieve tariff parity with manufacturers sourcing from us fta count ries in addition it has

introduction the national association of foreign tr ade zones naftz has developed the trade agreement parity tap proposal in troduced as hr 6415 by representative william pascrell1 to address claimed unintended consequences of free trade agreements2 these are that free trade agreements ftas in granting tariff advantages to businesses that import co mponents or products from fta countries put companies that import components from third countries not party to an fta at tariff disadvantage to remedy this problem tap would level the tariff playing field by permitting companies operating in foreigntrade zones ftzs to borrow permanently 3 us free trade agreements ftas for their own use to reduce or eliminate tariffs on co mponents from third countries critics of the tap proposal view the unintended consequences tap seeks to address as exactly the intende d consequences of ftas the united states agrees to preferential duty treatment on components coming from an fta partner country in exchange for that countrys lowering its duty rates on us products the effect of the tap proposal would be to provide ft arelated preferentia l duty treatment to components from third countries that have not signed ftas with the united states and have not made compensating reductions in th eir own duty rates on us products under the tap proposal companies with us manufacturin g facilities could apply to the us foreign trade zones ftz board for manufacturing authority with ftz manufacturing authority such corporations would then be entitled to reduce or eliminate tariffs on imported co mponents under the rules of origin and tariff provisions of any free trade agreement4 this means that so long as the product meets the rules of origin us domestic c ontent or value added andor substantial transformation require ments of any fta the tariff benefits of that fta would apply the rules of origin requirement can be satisfied by using any combination ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34688crs2 5 democrats good idea the wall street journal july 12 2008 p a10us andor third country part s and labor exclusively parts labor or input of any kind would need to come from any fta country us foreigntrade zones and subzones are physical areas geographically located in the united states but considered to be outside of us customs territory for purposes of the tariff laws nd customs entry procedures subzones are specialpurpose zones establishe d as an adjunct to zone project for limited purpose for example standalone manufacturing facility ftzs and subzones provide special customs procedures to uslocated facilities using foreign inputs which consist of ftacountry inputs andor third country inputs for items that are processed in ftzs and then exported duties are payable on the foreign inputs til the g ood leaves the zone at the time the merchandise leaves the zone for sale in the united stat ie is entered for consumption the duty may be paid either on the condition of the merchandise as it leaves the zone with authority from the ftz board or on its condition as it was first brought into the zone ftzs help offset customs advantages available to busin esses which produce goods offshore and then import them into the united states for consumption duty free under ftas or preferential tariff progra ms such as the generalized system of preferences gsp the caribbean basin economic recovery act cbera the andean trade preference act atpa and the african growth and opportunity act agoa in recent years growth in ftz activity has continued while average zone savings per facility may be lower the contributory effect from the use of zone procedures on us plants overall cost reduction efforts may be more significant than in the past while the contributory ffect will vary by industry the savings from the use of zone procedures may have an impact on whether the production costs at us facility are competitive with plant abroad many companies maintain manufacturing facilities throughout the worl d and are able to shift production among plants any action taken by the us facility to reduce its costs can have an impact on the maintenance of the activity and associated employment in the united states why is this proposal of interest to congress the tap proposal is of interest to congress for number of reasons it reportedly is being widely publicized and promoted on capitol hill by its association sponsor the naftz as tool for increasing competitiveness and economic development it is reflected in legislati on that has been introduced in congress hr 6415 it has been the subject of an editorial in the wall street journal5 in addition two economic studies have been undertaken on it one is staff study by the ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34688crs3 6 the economic impact of trade agreements pa rity for manufacturing firms operating in us foreigntrade zones study prepared for the national association of foreigntrade zones by dean derosa and gary clyde hufbauer march 27 2008 international trade commission usitc the other is study prepared for the naftz by economists dean derosa and gary c hufbauer6 economic policy and administrative implications the tap proposal is complex issue with potential economic policy and administrative issues and implications economic issues if congress were to approve tap would include 1 the effect of tap on us parts producers and 2 the effect on customs duties collectable major trade policy consideration is that us fta partners agreed to preferential duty treatment for component s coming from the fta partner country in exchange for that countrys lowering its duty rates on us products the effect of the tap proposal would be to provide ft arelated preferentia l duty treatment to components from third countries that have not signed ftas with the united states and have not made compensa ting reductions in their own duty rates on us products identified trade policy issues include 1 th tariff benefit given operations that would ordinarily be required to pa tariffs on imports 2 the extension of fta benefits to nonfta countries 3 the impact of tap on trade and diploma tic relations with fta partner countries 4 the creation of new trade preference program through tap and 5 the impact of tap on the ustrs ability to negotiate future ftas the tap proposal may have implicati ons for the usftz board made up of designees of the secretaries of commerce and treasury an executive director and staff of seven professiona ls the usftz board would be the gatekeeper charged with ensuring on casebycase basis after lengthy process that granting ftz status for tap purposes would not be detrimental to the public interest possible issues include 1 the potentia l that flood of new applications by businesses for ftz status could swamp the us foreigntrade zones board necessitating substantial increase in administrative resources to handle the increased requests for ftz status2 th ftz board staff would take on the new burden of determining whether or not pr ocessing activities in subzones would meet the rules of origin requirements of an fta and whether dutyfree treatment for articles meeting the requirements would be in the public interest 3 the potential that tap could shift certain tariff polic decisionmaking responsibilities from the office of the us trade representative to the us foreigntrade zones board organization of this report the box below is quick reference guide assisting the reader in going

also crs report rl30268 op cit figure 3 p 12were located outside the country for customs purposes us ftzs operate under the direct daily supervision of us customs and border protection cbp in addition us ftzs remain within the jurisdiction of local state or federal governments or agencies because zones exist in many countries worldwide goods in the making can move from zone to zone under strea mlined customs procedures having value and parts added until they are at last complete tariffs ar owed on goods or materials until they exit the zone system at which time the importing company pays any applicable duties the us system of foreigntrade zones consists of general purpose zones which are essentially secure multiuser facilities where activities such as warehousing repackaging labeling quality assurance manufacturing and distribution can take place and special purpose subzones which are singleuse sites which are geographically separated from general purpose zones but affiliated with them for recordkeeping and organizational purposes history and purpose of usftzs the us foreigntrade zone program was created in 1934 by the us foreign trade zones act pl 73978 it was designed to accelerate us trade in the wake of the restrictive impact of the smoothawley tariff act of 1930 which raised us tariffs on imported goods as high as 53 other countries d retaliated similarly and international trade considered major force for economic growth in most countries came to near standstill at the time the ftz concep t was controversial because some feared that it would promot imports of cheaper components in the manufacturing process and thereby put us components manufacturers at competitive disadvantage as result zone activity was initially limited and manufacturing was not pe rmitted in ftzs until 1950 most zones around the world are export pr ocessing zones in that they produce for export abroad while ftzs in the united states were primarily export processing zones between 1982 and 1995 since 1995 they have become primarily import processing zones in that 84 of the imported co mponents end up in the united states 2006 ftz data9 this is due largely to the fact that the united states is the worlds largest market and is the destination ma rket for both goods produced offshore and goods produced at us facilities wh ich compete with offshore facilities the system of us foreigntrade zone s has evolved greatly over its nearly 75 year history envisioned by some as an engine of export growth usftzs have continued to evolve and have become largely system for reversing the invertedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34688crs6 10 crs calculations from data included in the 68th report of the us foreigntrade zones board to congress listed above and the economic report of the president february 2008 11 usitc dataweb lists the total customs value for all imports in 2006 at 1845 billiontariff structures on us imports higher dutie s on imported components than on finished products under the us harmoni zed tariff schedule htsus inverted tariff structures can disadvant age us facilities and can be reversed in ftzs because when assembled goods enter into the cust oms territory of the united states the importer has choice he can choose to pa the lower of either the rate applicable to the imported input or the rate pplicable to the finished article benefits of ftzs today in recent years trade agreements including the multilateral uruguay r ound agreements in 1993 and bilate ral and regional ftas have systematically eliminated many inverted tariff structures as resu lt some observers conjectured decade ago that ftzs would soon become obsolete howe ver in the last ten years usage of the ftz system has continued to grow as share of gdp the value of shipments into foreigntrade zones has grown by two thirds from 22 in 1996 to 37 in 200610 despite the overall reduction in tariff rates and the fact that tariff differentials are lower than in the past global cost co mpetition in many indus tries has increased this means that companies focus more than ever on squeezing small savings from every part of the production and distribution process as result although average zone savings may be lower than in the past their contributory eff ect on us plants overall cost reduction efforts may be more significant than in the past while the contributory effect will vary by industry the savings from the use of zone procedures may have an impact on whether the production costs at us facility are competitive with plant abroad many companies maintain manufacturing facilities throughout the world and are able to shift production among plants any action taken by the u s facility to reduce its costs can have an impact on the maintenance of the activity and associated employment in the united states in 2006 most recent data the total value of imported materials entering the unite d states through usftzs was 159 b illion which represented roughly 9 of the to tal customs value of all imports for consumption for that year11 today businesses use zones to save mone in at least seven ways aside from avoiding inverted tariffs 1 duty deferral duties need not be paid until goods are transferred from the zone to us customs territory for import 2 duty exemption duty is payable on goods exported from zone or scrapped or destroyed in zone 3 duty drawback elimination zones eliminate the need for duty drawback the refunding of duties previously paid on imported and then reexported merchandise 4 tax savings foreign goods and domestic goods held for export in zones are not subject to state and local ad valorem taxes such as personal property tax 5 quota storage quota restrictions do not apply to merchandise admitted to or stored in zone until it exits the zone and is entered into customs territory 6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34688crs7 12 in bond refers to the status of merchandi admitted provisionally to country without payment of

and weekly instead of indivi dual entries on zone deliveries details of the tap proposal13 the tap proposal and hr 6415 are substantively the same tap vs ftas ftas are free trade agreements are c oncluded between the united states and one or more foreign countries to eliminat tariffs and various nontariff barriers over time usually 1015 years on goods traded between or among them tap would permit companies to use existing ftas to import third country components at reduced tariff rates tap is distinct from ftas in that it would 1 permit companies that have applied for and been granted ftz status for this purpose to import specific share of third country component s as permitted under th domestic content requirements of the specific fta into usftzs and 2 substantially transform them into finished goods thus being able to import them into the united states duty free or at substantially reduced rates purpose of the tap proposal as mentioned according to its designer s the main purpose of the tap proposal would be to equalize the unintended consequences of free trade agreements naftz argues that us ftas never intended to put us facilities that import components from third countri at tariff disadvantage relative to companies that source either their components or their final products from fta countries level playing field naftz argues could keep companies from moving abroad in order to obtain tarifffree treatment on third country components14 the tap proposal could then offer co mpanies operating in us ftzs access to the best and cheapest suppliers worldw ide as tonic to domestic manufacturing activity in addition busine sses operating in us ftzs naftz argues should be able to obtain components from foreign sources on terms that are at least as favorablehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34688crs8 15 evaluation of crs memorandum dated june 16 2008 titled proposed naftz changes to the draft us customs reauthorization bill updated comment prepared for the national association of foreigntrade zones july 2 2008 by dean rosa gary hufbauer 16 48 stat 981003 19 usc 81a81u as amended 17 naftz is an organization comprised of 800 businesses public entities and service providers focused on promoting the use of the us foreigntrade zone program 18 congress has approved implementing legislation for free trade agreements with mexico canada israel jordan chile singapore aust ralia morocco bahrain oman peru and the dominican republic costa rica salvador guatemala honduras and nicaragua under the dominicanrepubliccentral america free trade agreement caftadr in addition four us trade preference programs are cu rrently in effect the generalized system of preferences the andean trade preference act the caribbean basin economic recovery act and the african grow th and opportunity actas the terms available to businesse s operating in fta partner countries15 further the provision if adopted could arguably provide reason for some producers to remain in the united states instead of relocating abroad to the extent that tariff rates contribute to decisions on where to locate production overview of tap legislative provisions the tap legislative proposal is in three pa rts part the main part would amend the us foreigntrade zones act of 193416 to correct what the national association of foreign trade zones naftz17 views as problem or inequality in the harmonized tariff schedule f unctionally identical components for manufactured goods in this country ca rry different tariff rates under the us harmonized tariff schedule htsus depe nding on the country or country group from which they are imported components imported from countries with which the united states has free trade agreement or trade preference program18 carry much lower tariff than goods imported from other c ountries to remedy this problem the tap proposal would permit impor ters to pay tariff rates on third country components as if they had been imported from an fta country businesses could qualify for reduced tari ff treatment on casebycase basis if they met two conditions 1 the business would have to apply to and be granted us foreigntrade zone ftz authority by the us ftz board this means businesses would need to go through the appli cation process and convince the usftz board that ftz manufacturing author ity and permission to import under selected fta would not be detr imental to the public interest 2 the finished product produced in the z one would need to meet the relevant rules of origin requi rements of any fta part b of the tap proposal w ould renumber provisions in the north american free trade agreement nafta implementation act pl 103182 to eliminate provision which denies nafta benefits to goods produced in usftzs while thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34688crs9 provision was designed to protect us parts manufacturers from competition from mexico or canada it has ar guably served to encourage certain businesses to drop their usftz status andor relocate to mexi co or canada instead the denial of fta benefits for firms producing in usftzs was not included in subsequent ftas part c of the tap proposal would set an effective date of 15 days after enactment legislative language of hr 6415 the technical language of tap proposal part s b and c is as follows part part of the tap proposal woul d authorize businesses to apply for reduced tariff rates on third country compone nts by adding small provision to the us foreign trade zones act 19 usc sec 81ca af ter the word provided at the end of the paragraph immediately below thus the new language appears in the indented paragraph below that sec 81ca of the us foreigntrade zones act lists activities that may be undertaken on good that has been brought into us foreign trade zone it this section says that good may be sto red sold exhibited broken up repacked assembled distributed sort ed graded cleaned mixed with foreign or domestic merchandise or otherwise ma nipulated or manufactured it may then be exported destroyed or sent into customs territory of the united states subject to the laws and regulations of the united stat affecting imported merchandise provided and then part of hr 6415 reads further that if foreign merchandise is inco rporated into finished good or is processed manipulated or manufactured in zone and complies with the rules of origin under any agreement which affects the rates of duty for merchandise and to which the united states is part then upon authorization under this act such merchandise shall enter the customs rritory of the united states at the rate of duty provided under the harmonized tari ff schedules of the united states for such merchandise that complies with such rules of origin part b part b of the proposed legisl ative language would amend the north american free trade agreement implementation act pl 103182 it would renumber provisions to eliminate language which denies nafta benefits for goods produced in usftzs for importation and cons umption in the customs territory of the united states if the currently existing language included be low were removed naftz users would be eligible to impor t under nafta in the same way that they are currently eligible to import under all other ftas th language which hr 6415 would eliminate reads 19 usc sec 3332a2a r ules of origin foreign trade zones subparagraph b of paragraph 1 shall not apply to good produced in foreigntrade zone or subzone established pursuant to the act of june 18 1934 commonly known as the foreign trade zones act 19 usca sec 81a et seq that is entered for consumption in the customs territory of the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34688crs10 19 there is fee to apply for ftzs and subzones fees are for generalpurpose zones within port of entry 3200 for subzones nonma nufacturing processing or fewer than 3 products 4000 for manufacturingprocessing 3 or more products 6500 expansions 1600 20 us foreigntrade zone regulations cfr title 15 part 40031b1if the above clause were eliminated the currently existing clause below would then govern tariff charges on third c ountry components for goods produced in usftzs good originates in the territory of nafta country if bi each nonoriginating material used in the production of the good i undergoes an applicable change in tariff classification set out in annex 401 of the agreement as result of producti on occurring entirely in the territory of one or more of the nafta countries or ii where change in tariff classi fication is required the good otherwise satisfies the applicable requirements of such annex and ii the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of this section part c finally the amendment would set as an effective date applicable to any merchandise entered into the united states or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption 15 days or later after the date of enactment of the bill the ftz application process under tap under tap in order to import third c ountry components at tariff rates and under domestic content requirement s prescribed under any fta business would need to have ftz manufacturing authority to obtain ftz manufacturing authority business would have to follow normal usft z procedures and apply to the usftz board19 under guidelines set forth in the code of federal regula tions 15 cfr part 400 with information showing why its proposed manufacturing activity would not be detrimental to the public intere st based on two sets of criteria the first set of criteria is threshold factors to meet threshold factors the business would have to convince the usft z board that ftz status for purposes of importing components tariff free under an fta 1 would not be inconsistent with us trade and tariff law or policy formally adopted by the executive branch that 2 ftz status would not seriously prejudice us tariff and trade negotiations or other initiatives and that 3 the ac tivity involves items subject to quantitative import controls or inverted tariffs and the use of zone procedures would be the direct and sole cause of import that but for ch procedures would not likely otherwise have occurred20 the second set of criteria is economic factors under economic criteria the usftz board would consider an applica tion for ftz status based on its net impact on 1 overall employment 2 exports and reexports 3 rete ntion or creation ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34688crs11 21 us foreigntrade zone regulations cfr title 15 part 40031b2manufacturing or processing activity 4 valueadded activity 5 import levels of relevant products 6 import displacemen t 7 foreign competition in relevant products 8 related domestic industry and 9 other f actors including technology transfers and inve stment effects21 the application process for ftz authority is lengthy and involved for both the applicant and the usftz board and typically takes six months to year however the board may determine that it requires additional time based on special circumstances processing any business application for ftz status requires considerable research and preparation on the part of the board which shall be responsible for publication in the federal register of notice invitation for public comment and time for rebuttal by the applicant during the process board examiners must also conduct their own research in addition to that presented conduct hearings as necessary review case records and public comments request evidence develop information and evidence necessary for analysis of the threshold and economic factors and report on their findings an examiners report along with the technical report from the local customs and border pa trol cbp port dir ector is circulated to cbp headquarters and the treasury department for revi ew and concurrence before final action can be taken by the ft z board in the commerce department ftz board regulations provide that in th course of being considered for ftz status the applicant will be permitte d number of opportunities to provide supplemental in formation the applicant may be notified of deficiencies in the application if usftz board decision on the application is unfavorable it shall be considered preliminary the applicant may then provide additional evidence which the board would consider in its review if in its final report the board rules

harmonized tariff schedule htsus22 the tariff rates to be assessed the business on third country components would be determined as follows in the htsus there are three columns representing tariffs assessed to three different groups of countri the first is called column 1 general it shows the general rate often referred to as eith er the most favored nation mfr rate or normal trade relations ntr rate assessed to most countries23 the second is called column 1 special it shows the special rates assessed articles from countries with which the united states s free trade agreements ftas articles from beneficiary countries under various tr ade preference laws ie the generalized system of preferences g sp articles eligib for dutyfree treatment under special programs such as the civil aircraft agreement and articles eligible for the temporary suspension or reduction of duties the third is called column 2 it provides the much higher rate charged to countries to which the united states does not apply ntr rates currently in this list are cuba and north korea24 with ftz status approved businesses woul d then be eligible to pay the reduced tariff rate in column 1 special for the fta they are authorized to import under instead of the current tariff rates under column 1 general potential reallife examples importing without vs with tap the following examples show how business might save money on tariff assessments under tap when importing unde r the applicable fta of its choice example 1 an auto assembly plant importing components from china under the jordan fta as the law currently stands without the tap proposal assume company foreignow ned us based business has an auto assembly plant in the united states and is operating in an ftz to take advantage of the inverted tariff structure for autos the company imports auto parts from chinahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34688crs13 some with duty rate up to 5 and asse mbles the finished vehicle which has duty rate of 25 under ftz procedures the company has the choice of paying the duty on the foreign components in their cond ition as they leave th zone ie as an assembled car rather than as they enter th zone as components in this way it is able to reduce its duty rate on foreign co mponents from 5 to 25 as in all ftz operations currently the duty rate comes from the general column 1 duty rate in the harmonized tariff schedule of the united states under the tap proposal as written compan could seek authority to apply the rules of origin including local c ontent requirements nd duty rate from the us jordan fta to the assembled cars leaving the subzone under the jordan fta the duty rate on the cars would be zero providi ng the company with savings of the 25 tariff it pays currently on the valu of the parts imported from china discussion in the usjordan ft specific rules of origin provision was included for automobiles as result the jordan fta general rules of origin apply this means that company as finished ve hicles would quality for dutyfree treatment under the jordan fta if they contained the minimal amount of 35 us or jordanian content including value added by labor further up to 65 of the value of finished automobile could be compri sed of thirdcountry components and the car would still qualify as originating under th jordan fta thus it is conceivable that car with 65 of its value comp rised of components from china could have 20 us components and 15 value adde d through the assembly process in us factory and then qualify as ori ginating dutyfree automobile under the jordan fta since negotiators of the usjordan fta which was signed in 2000 may not have foreseen that there could be si gnificant number of vehicle imports from jordan the language of the usjordan fta and the rules of origin negotiations may not have taken into account pot ential concerns of the us automobile and auto parts industries the proposed legislation does not require that the parts used in the assembly be from jordan or that compan or the industry have any connection to jordan to qualify under the jordan fta while the tariff effect from one company may appear small the broader impact on u s industry could be significant in addition the specific impact of allowing dutyfree treatment for the industry may not have been evaluated dur ing the fta negotiations company as auto assembly is one example of situation that would be allowed under the tap proposal however the pr oposal would allow for similar duty free treatment in any industry under the rules of any fta example 2 truck assembly plant importing components under the morocco fta as the law currently stands assume that company also has another assembly facility for pickup trucks in the united states assume further that for this facility company is importing some components from japan at duty rate of 5 the general column 1 hts duty rate on the trucks themselves is 25 currently company would not benefit fro m ftz procedures for reversing inverted tariffs since the inverted tariff situation does not exist for trucks because the us tariff rate is higher on completed trucks than on its components therefore

trade zones board to congress of the united states december 2007 p 2658company has chosen not to pursue ftz designation for the factory under the tap proposal however compan could apply for subzone status for its truck assembly operations in this case instead of the jordan fta which maintains 5 duty on the trucks assume that the company decides to use the morocco fta the morocco fta also re quires only 35 us or moroccan content including value added to qualify under its rules of orig in provision in addition the morocco fta also has more favorable dutyfree rate for trucks company has connection to morocco as it had c onnection to jordan in example 1 and none of the parts are imported from morocco further up to 65 of the value of finished truck could be comprised of thir dcountry components and the truck would still qualify as originating under the morocco fta potential winners and losers under the tap proposal the primary beneficiaries of the tap proposal would appear to be foreign multinational corporations especially fo reign motor vehicle producers which could save on their customs duties many fore ign motor vehicle producers are companies which already do or could assemble thei r products in usftzs from foreign parts sourced from countries like japan south kor ea and the european union these are countries with which the united states doe s not have free trade agreements and on whose imports relevant dutie s may typically be around 25 other beneficiaries could in clude some oil companies that operate refineries in ftzs their savings come from an inverted tariff situation on petrochemical products which are generally dutyfree produced fro m imported crude oil which is assessed duty rate of either 525 or 105 cents pe r barrel currently the duty rate on gasoline is 525 cents per barrel however it is duty free under many ftas tap could increase refinery savings by allo wing gasoline produced from imported crude oil to be entered at rate of dutyfree25 us ftzs and various ftz support groups would also stand to benefit from the tap legislation usowned motor vehicle producers might not stand to benefit from this proposal to the same extent as foreig nowned motor vehicle producers because canada and mexico are the principal suppliers of foreign auto parts used to supplement the us made parts used in their us vehicle assembly operations because most of the imported parts used in the assembly plants of the usbased motor vehicle companies enter free of duty under nafta there was little incentive for these operations to maintain their ft z

originating content dutyfree 3 further disadvantages us co rporations operating outside an ftz because the most favor ed nation mfn duty rates on third country imports would still apply to those goods

the tap proposal results of the usitc study suggest that the tap proposal could eliminate almost 90 of actual duties paid by ft z subzone users based on 2005 data the estimate does not take into account ftz processing opera tions that became active in 2006 and 2007 the estimate is based on pub lic information contained in annual reports submitted by operators of ftzs including ftz subzones the usitc study noted that the tap pr oposal may increase the incentive to use dutiable foreign parts and materials in ft z processing operations instead of us parts and materials because the dutiable foreign parts and materials could qualify for facto dutyfree treatment the summary of estimated customs revenue loss by principal sectors based on usitc staff tabulations i ndicates that the sectors responsible for the 437 million estimated total reve nue loss includes motor vehicle assembly 305 million petroleum refining 77 million che micalspharmaceuticals processing 19 million and other

the naftz retained two economists dean derosa and gary clyde hufbauer to produce an economic development study on the impact of tap on the us economy and manufacturing sector the study estimated the potential impact of tap over the medium term at 1 ove r 66 billion in new shipments from the ftzs into the us market 2 the creation of nearly 95000 new manufacturing jobs in ftzs 3 to tal annual gain to the us economy of 530 million 4 higher pay and living standards for manufact uring and other zone workers and 5 clear evidence that the proposal will bene fit the us economy in both job increases and us business growth32 findings and methodology33 the derosahufba uer study bases its estimates on gravity model which predicts bilateral trade flows based on the gdp levels of trade partners and the geogra phic distances between them using this model it assumes that the tap proposal will shift output fro m nonzone to zone production amounting to 13 or 66 billi on increase in shipments from zones in 2006 and counterbalancing decline in shipments from locations outside of ftzs estimates of economic losses customs revenues foregone the derosahufbauer studys gravity model estimates foregone customs revenues to the us economy from the tap proposal at 186 milli on per year or 18 of 2005 customs revenue of which 146 million or nearly 80 similarly to the usitc staff study would be in the motor vehicle sector notably vehicles other transport equipment and related parts and accessories this estimate of custom s revenues foregone at 186 million is less than half the estimate reported by the usitc st aff study of 437 milli on based on 2005 data the different estimates reflect the diffe rence in methodology between the two studies while the derosahufbauer study obtained its estimate from economic modeling based on imports actually arri ving from present and prospective fta partners the usitc staff obtained its numbe rs by sorting through public informationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34688crs19 34 dean derosa and gary clyd hufbauer op cit p 1 abstract 35 this would include 45000 jobs in the tran sport equipment 14000 jobs in machinery production

at httpwwwnaftzorgdocsnewst ap fact sheet from pbnpdf 37 however some wage gains could result if tariff reductions achieved by businesses were passed on to workers contained in annual reports submitted by operators of ftzs and subzones and actually tabulating tariffs pa id on third country components by companies that would be eligible to apply for ftz status under tap this estimate is based on calculations that based on nafta rules of origin the processingassembly in the ftz of third country parts and materials with uso rigin content and labor would qualify the processed or assembled good leaving the ftz for dutyfree entry into the united states under nafta had the processing or assembly occurred in mexico or canada estimates of economic gains the derosahufbauer study mentions three kinds of gains to the us economy job gains to ftzs annual wage gains of 394 milli on and producer gains of 136 million for total benefit to the us economy of 530 milli on it finds th at these gains dwarf estimated foregone customs revenues at 186 million34 job gains the derosahufbauer study estimated that the tap proposal would shift 95000 additional fu lltime equivalent jobs fro m location outside ftzs to location inside ftzs as existing businesses gain zone status35 this number accounts for about 07 of all manufacturin g employment in 2005 it is not clear from the study whether any of these ftz j ob gains would represent actual job gains to the company as opposed to job gains to ftzs which would result from simple switch of the company from nonzone to zone status the derosahufbauer study acknowledges that this shift of workers from non zone to zone status would not change total us employment citing the derosa hufbauer study naftz claims the ddition of 90000 us manufacturing jobs36 wage gains and producer gains derosahufbauer use 95000 figure as the basis for their argument that the tap proposal would result in us wage gains of 7 or 394 million 179 million in the transportation sector and 82 million in the petroleum sector37 derosa and hufbauer arrived at this 7 estimate using research published by lewis and richardson in 2001 incorpora ting data from the late 1980s and early 1990s lewis and richardsons research found that on average workers in export oriented multinational firms with foreign investment backing operating in the us enjoy earnings that are about 7 percent higher than their counterparts in the same ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34688crs20 38 lewis howard iii and richards on j david why global commitment really matters institute for international economics washington dc 2001 p 2931 39 other issues are 1 the research quoted is nearly 20 years old over which time the capital structure of businesses especially multinational businesses has changed considerably and 2 the lewis and richardson study in footnote pointed out that different wage premiums are largely explained by the heavier ca pital intensity of plants backed by foreign investors and that premiums vanish if plants are made comparable in their machinery and equipment per worker as well as in industry and location since the plants are already in existence and there would not necessarily be any capital changed involved as result of shift from nonftz to ftz status and workers themselves would not necessarily change jobs or employers or locations the argu ments for wage increases might not apply 40 derosahufbauer op cit p 18industries38 however derosa and hufbauer pply this 7 wage differential in different way to workers in primarily importoriented firms39 the estimate of 82 million in wage gains in the petroleum sector the second largest set of wage gains is problematical because these projected gains appear to be attached to new jobs in the petroleum sector that the authors suggest are likely not to materialize because anticipated investment and expansion in that sector are unlikely to occur reflecting the complexities of the petroleumbased fuel blends demanded in the us market and increas ingly stringent environmental standards regulating the constructi on of new refineries40 as result projected elimination of the 001 tradeweighted tariff on crude petroleum might not yield sufficient cost savings to promote the investment required to build more petroleum refineries while this might lead to producer gains estima ted at 136 million if these producer gains do not lead to new investment there woul d likely not be significant increases in employment or wages relating to the tap legislation policy analysis of the tap

or zero tariffs on third country co mponents so long as the completed good leaving the ftz met the rule soforigin requirements of any fta the beneficiary company would not need to import any

beneficiary company could meet the rulesoforigin requirements of the selected fta entirely by using us components and labor remaining nondomestic components could come from any fta or nonfta trading

otherwise be entitled the only us gatekeeper regulating or intervening in this practice would be the us foreigntrade zones board ftz board which could restrict or prohibit zone activity that in its

effects of ta p could include the following businesses otherwise required to pay tariffs could obtain large tariff benefit businesses likely to reap the most benefits from reduced tariff obligations under tap would be multin ational corporations headquartered in asia and europe with produc tion operations located in th united states that source components from the home country base d on manufacturing s ubzone activities in 2005 the usitc estimated that subsidiaries of 15 german japanese and korean motor vehicle and parts producers would account for 70 of the revenue lost to the us treasury if the current tap proposal were enacted41 effects on trade and diplomatic re lations with us fta partner countries and third countries if the tap proposal were approved by congress it could affect trade with fta pa rtner countries and third countries ftas negotiated between the united states and various partner countries could be used to allow nonfta countries to reap the benefits of the ftas in terms of dutyfree access to the us market without providing equivalent access to exports from the united states this would reduce the advantage of fta partners in the us market undercutting the value of the agreements that they signed with the united states the tap legislation arguably would be disi ncentive for potential future fta partners to negotiate free trade agreement with the united states tap would be like broad trade preference program if adopted the tap could offer equivalent tariff treatment on certain goods to suppliers in all foreign countries and to all us busin

the executive dire ctor and professional staff of seven tariff reductions without requiring any r eciprocating tariff reductions by other countries and without inves tment protections for us businesses that ftas would carry dilution of ustr authority shifting of some ustr responsibilities to the usftz board tap could decrease the useful ness to ustr of being able to cite the potential elimination or reduction of us tariffs on specific articles as carrot an incentive for trading partners to take action of interest to the united states such action could include improving access for us exports protecting worker rights improving protection of in tellectual property or participating in multilateral efforts to eliminat tariffs on sectoral basi s known as zero for zero agreements responsibility for determin ing eligibility for dutyfree access to the us market through ftz manufacturing au thority would flow to the usftz board located in the department of commerces import administration the ftz board could be swam ped with ftz applications it is not clear how the ftz board would handle its charge to determine whether the use of ftzs in this way would be in the public interest if in fact the 144 companies that the usitc staff report identified as tapeligible manufacturing operations were to immediately assert to the usftz board that dutyfree treatment for imported components used in their ftz operations woul d be in the public interest the task of verifying the assertion coul d overwhelm the small board42 in addition new applications would likely add to this overload as businesses calculate the potential costs and benefits of applying for ftz status to achieve tariff savings on third country components options for congress take action congress has several

eliminat tariffs on components incorporated into goods produced in the united states one possibility is to do it more directly legislation could be cons tructed to eliminate tariffs on components incorporated into other goods in the united states so l ong as the final produc t met rules of origin requirements designed specifically for the gislation these rules could call for flat percent of domestic content eg some where between 35 and 65 or specific domestic content shares for different pr oducts the importer would have to certify to customs and border protection that the valueadded re quirements of such legislation had been met such an amendment might include furt her qualifications for example the legislation could also limit the tap bene fit eligibility to co mponents imported from countries that afford recipr ocal treatment for us co mponents exported to certified assembly operations in the partner country such proposal would 1 not directly involve current fta partners and 2 not overload the usftz board as with all trade legislation however there would still be winners and losers losers could still be the volume of trade with current fta partner countries whose trade with the us could be diverted to other countries losers could also be us parts producers on the other hand opening up the us economy to reduced or zero tariffs on components imported from third countries could stimulate new round of us business process reorganizations as companies look for new ways to cut production costs while maintain ing required level of us value added in parts and laborhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34688crs24 conclusions conclusions regarding the tap proposal can be divided into two groups economic conclusions nd policy conclusions economic conclusions economic conclusions include the following the primary benefit of tap would be tariff bene fits for corporations that source components from third countries loses in customs revenues c ould be between the 186 million estimated by the derosahufbauer study and 437 million estimated by the usitc staff study howeve r neither study projected ahead to take into account the extent to which us businesses might re engineer their products to take dvantage of small tariff savings per item produced savings which on large production scale could end up being considerable in add ition the estimated loss in customs revenue figures were based on exis ting levels of zone activity any shift to ftz manufacturing as exem plified through the shift of an estimated existing 95000 us jobs into zones in the derosa hufbauer study would substantially increase the loss in customs revenue the tap proposal could result in potential decrease in demand for usmade parts as result of any tarifffree benefits for third country components neither the usitc staff study nor the derosahufbauer study addresses this issue or estimates its impact the potential decrease in demand c ould be considerable since it could spread across many industr ies study estimating this impact would be useful estimated employment increases of 95000 in the derosahufbauer study do not represent net gain to the us economy they represent primarily shift among existing plants from nonftz to ftz status some additional job shifts from elsewhere in the economy into plants operating in zones however could result if businesses were to pass cost savings from tariff elimination on to consumers in the form of lower prices estimated wage gains of 7 for certain jobs for total of 394 million nationwide were based on 20year old study which found that workers producing for export from multinational corporations enjoyed higher wages the data are then applied to workers producing primarily for import some producer gains may not mate rialize however profits could increase the derosahufbauer st udy estimate of producer gains ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34688crs25 136 million annually from the tap pr oposal if it were adopted may overstate investment benefits in some firms as the authors acknowledged for example limination of the approximately 001 duty tradeweighted ad valorem equivalent on crude petroleum under tap may not c onvince petroleum refiners to expand their capacity instead the primary economic benefit of tap may be increased profits to foreignbased multinational corporations which would be afforded tariff savings on thirdcountry imports trade policy conclusions among policy conclusions are the following the effects the tap proposal genera lly seeks to address are widely considered to be the intended consequences of ftas the united states extends preferential tari ff treatment to components from an fta partner country in exchange fo r that countrys lowering of its tariff rates on us products tap would give fta benefits to nonfta components with likely effects on trade and diplomatic re lations with fta partner countries and with third countries there could be negative impact on diplomatic relations with fta pa rtner countries since fta benefits would be extended to nonfta pa rtner countries without the permission or knowledge of the pa rtner country whose fta would be used in this way this could put the fta partner country at competitive disadvantage visavis other countries whose businesses would be using the ft without the partner countrys permission to import thirdcountry component s dutyfree conversely third countries which have not negotia ted ftas with the united states could reap the benefits of fta duty rates without any compensating concessions on their duty ra tes for american goods tap could complicate diplomatic relations with fta partner countries since fta be nefits would be extended to nonfta partner countries without necessarily any tification to or
