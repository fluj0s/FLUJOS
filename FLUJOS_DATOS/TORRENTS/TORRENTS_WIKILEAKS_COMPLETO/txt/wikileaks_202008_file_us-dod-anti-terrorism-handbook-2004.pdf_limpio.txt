severi ty of loss linked to rrorist threats risk management assists at decisionmakers in reduci ng or offsetting terrorist attack effects the risk management process is used by commanders to identify assess nd control risks arising from operational factors and helps in making d ecisions that balance ri sk cost with mission benefits commanders can use the risk manage ment process information to determine which assets require the most protection and where futu re expenditure is require d to minimize risk of attack or lessen the severity of the outcome of such an attack risk management does not replace sound decision making nor does it remove risk altogether or s upport zero defect mindset c42 overview it is beyond the scope of this handbook to pr ovide consolidated multiservice process addressing risk management background principles and application proce dures users needing indepth risk manageme nt information should consult the risk management multiservice tactics techniques and procedures for risk management reference r andor applicable servicecombatant commandagency guidance this handbook does provide better general understanding of the risk manage ment concept and process as it relates to the at mission included in the at risk management process ch apters are specific pr ocedures to help any commander or ato reduce or offset at risks in order to enhance opera tional capabilities and mission accomplishment with minimal acceptable loss c43 at risk management processes c431 the at risk management process genera lly follows multiservice tactics techniques and procedures for tactical level risk manageme nt in the planning and execution of operations the process has two levels of application deliberate and cris is action available time to complete the process is the basic factor that sh all determine the level of application deliberate at risk management allows the application of th complete process when time is not critical crisis at risk management is conducted immediat ely previous to or after terrorist attack by doing mental or verbal review of the situation using the basic at risk management process key steps of the risk management process include for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 55 for official use only c4311 identifying threats c431 2 assessing threats to determine threat capabilities nd courses of action c4313 developing controls and making risk decisions c4314 implementing controls c4315 supervising and reviewing c432 in addition to those steps the at risk management process adds steps to determine criticality and vulnerability these steps systemati cally identify and evaluate assets in term of various factors such as the ta rgets mission significance and vulnerability the criticality assessment can be conducted before after or conc urrent to assessing the threat the va shall be conducted after assessing the threat and the criticality to determine what critical assets are most vulnerable all three elements together shall be used to estimate at risk c44 at risk management elements c441 threat assessment ta the ta should identify the terrorist threat for each group that may be threat the assessment provi des information on the groups intent capability and history as well as any specific targeting information that may be available the ta process is further discussed in chapter 5 c442 criticality assessment this is done to determine which assets need to be protected the criticality assessment determines the importance of each asset the effect of terrorist attack on the assets and the recoverabili ty of the asset from attack th criticality assessment process is further discussed in chapter 6 c443 va the va evaluates and determines the vul nerability to terrorist attack of an installation unit exercise port ship residence f acility or other site it assesses each asset and identifies shortfalls or wea knesses that make the asset vulnerable determines if existing countermeasures are effective and prioritizes th vulnerabilities the va process is further discussed in chapter 7 c444 risk assessment the risk assessment combines the criticality threat and vulnerability rating given to each asset and unwanted event it uses the theory that in order for there to be risk each one of the elements criti cality threat and vulnerability must be present therefore risk criticality x thre at x vulnerability risk is ba sed on the value of the asset in relation to the threats and vulnerabilities associat ed with it risk is derived by combining the for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 56 for official use only relative impact of any loss or damage to an asse t criticality with the re lative probability of an unwanted event threat x vulnerability c45 mitigation options c451 to complete the risk analysis mitiga tion options must be identified in order to develop controls make decisions implement controls supervise nd review developing controls and executing the remaining elements are essential followthrough actions of the at risk management process comm anders weigh risk versus benef its and make andor implement decisions to eliminate unacceptable levels of risk after identifying and implementing additional countermeasures or mitigation efforts it is prudent to recalculate the risk c452 the cost and effectiveness of each c ountermeasure should be identified so that the decisionmaker can see the cost and benefit of each option accep table risks should be communicated to subordinates commanders nd all individuals involv ed in the at risk management process then evaluate the effectiv eness of applied contro ls and capture lessons learned c46 at risk management pr ocess application guidelines c461 apply the process in sequence it is not possible to prioritize risk control efforts properly until threats have been identified and assessed and the criticality of assets being determined c462 maintain balance in the process ava ilable time should be located to ensure the process is completed the objec tive is to assess the time and resources available for at risk management activities and allocate them to acti ons in manner most likely to produce the best overall result c463 apply the process as cycle supe rvising and reviewing th countermeasures or mitigation efforts might identify additional threats or prove the controls ineffective the entire at risk management process should be re peated and applied to the new threat c47 relationship and integration of at risk management to overall risk management c471 successful risk management is underwri tten by the chain of command facility that has embedded the risk management process in to facility operations culture organization systems and individual behavior needs to input the at risk management process into the overall mission risk management process the ato should work within the organization to ensure the for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 57 for official use only commander is properly advised of residual at thr eats and risks that remain after implementing all available controls c472 when more than one threat is identif ied terrorists enemy environment diseases etc the overall residual risk must be determin ed the residual risk of each threat shall have different levels depending on the assessed threat probability and the severity of the outcome if it were to happen c473 overall residual risk s hould be determined based on th threat having the greatest residual risk determining overall mission risk by averaging the risk s of all threats is incorrect if the residual terrorist thr eat is high the overall residual risk is high matter how many moderate or low risk threats are present in

warning informationtime date place those involved and method of attackis rarely voluntarily provide d by terrorists careful threat an alysis is required to detect and correctly evaluate preincide nt indicators of terrorist attack so timely warning messages can be issued c532 threat analysis provides the intelligence officer with information upon which to base warnings c533 threat information for

knowledge such as coll ege faculty or cultural organizations local crime or neighborhood watch programs can also be valuable sources of information and can serve as means to keep individuals informed in dispersed and remote areas c53351 local information is often of critical importance as it is collected and passed through either law enforcement andor inte lligence channels to the national intelligence organizations it is frequently invaluable to analysts confirming ne ws media or other open source accounts of terrorist activities it can provide early warni ng of potential terrorist activities allowing law enforcement and combating terrorism measures to be initiated in timely manner to thwart or minimize the effects of terrorist attack c53352 critical element of local information is obtained from individual service members their families and civilian employees at dod facilities who report any suspicious activity they observe it is critical that all thes personnel receive frequent thorough training regarding the recognition and reporting of suspicious activity such reports even those that may appear frivolous must receive immediate investigation by law enforcement and

types of subjective assessments but are not specifically tailored for antiterrorism assessments while the msharpp and carver processes are included in appendix 2 as optional methodologies for those who are familiar with their use both have design limitations and are best used only as an adjunct to the ra and manage ment methodology contained herein c624 the purpose of the criticality assessmen t process is to identif and prioritize all assets on an installation assets include personnel equipment stockpiles buildings recreation areas or transportation systems that are deemed critical as defined by dod antiterrorism force protection installation planning mplate reference x there are many different types of assets critical to mission accomplishment and it is important not to exclude some assets because they are not necessarily missione ssential or physically located on the installation for example telephone switching facility located off base may be essential to communications if alternative systems are not identified there may also be asse ts on the installation which are not critical to the direct operation of the installation but are critical to the department of defense c625 it may also be useful to link identified threat attack means to specific time period or location for example terrorist group opera ting in the proximity of the installation may typically target areas such as schools or the commissary andor exchange that contain large number of people at certain times c626 when determining asset criticality us of the following criteria shall assist in standardizing the process c6261 importance measures the value of the area or assets located in the area considering their function inherent nature and monetary value c6262 effect measures the ramification of terrorist incident in the area considering the psychologi cal economic sociological and military impacts c6263 recoverability measures the time required fo r the function oc curring at

asset is injured da maged or destroyed it may have future value in the accomplishment of other dod missions or be of great symbolic value to the department of defense the us government and the american people consideration should therefore be given to the resources that must be expended to recover an asset and in some cases repair it for return to service with the department of defense in the future c6264 mission functionality measures key positions special facilities specialized equipment etc used to fulfill assigned missions c6265 substitutability are there substitutes availabl for personnel facilities or materiel can assigned missions be performed using substitutes if the substitutes are less capable can the mission still be accomplished successfully c6266 reparability if dod asset is injured or damaged can it be repaired and rendered operable how much tim is required how much woul d it cost could repairs be accomplished in timely manner would repairs degrade asset performan ce and if so can the mission be accomplished in the degraded condition c627 the purpose of critical ity assessment matrix is to termine the cri ticality of each asset which shall also help to prioritize them for each asset the assessment team shall assign values for each criteria based on scale such as one to ten the assessment team must determine what criteria to use table c6t1 is an

va is the process the commander uses to determine the susceptibility of assets to attack from threats identified by the at ta the va answers the question what kind of attack is the asset mostleast vulnerable to reference provides authoritative standards regarding both installation and deploying unit vu lnerability assessments vulnerabilities exist at every installation as result of the terro rist threat faced vulnerabilities are always there matter the policies procedures structures and protective equipment lthough terrorist threats cannot be controlled they can be assessed and the vulnerability of assets to those threats can be mitigated identifying and understanding vulnera bilities is important in dete rmining how well an asset shall be protected from loss vulnerabilities are so the component of overall risk over which the commander has the most control and greatest influe nce by reducing vulnerability the potential risk to an asset is also reduced c72 the vulnerability

attacks found in the ta c7322 recuperability measure of time required to replace repair or bypass the destruction or damage inflicte d on the target recoverability should also consider redundant systems where not all redundanc ies are required for mission acco mplishment such as having five satellite radios but only two are required for mission accomplishment c7323 vulnerability measure of the ability of the threat to damage the target using assets available to the threat consider type of construction and internal placement of assets c7324 effect on population the positive or negative influence on the population as result of the action taken effect considers public relations in the vicinity of the target but also considers the domestic and international reaction as well c7325 recognizability the degree to which target can be recognized under varying weather light and seasonal condi tions without confusion with ot her targets or components camouflage can reduce the vulnerability of an asset by making it harder to recognize for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 82 for official use only c74 vulnerability matrix c741 va matrix is useful to determine the vulnerability of each asset for each asset the assessment team shall assign va lues for each criteria based on scale such as one to ten 10 being most vulnerable and 1 being least vulnerab the assessment team must determine what criteria to use table c7t1 below is an ex ample of va matrix usi ng the carver criteria c742 once all asset values ar tallied they can be rankordere d such that highest score is most vulnerable and lowest score is least vulnerable even though an asset is very vulnerable that does not necessari ly mean that it is the highest risk for example equipment located in storage warehouse near the perimeter of an installation may be very vulnerable to vehicle bomb on an adjacent public access road however the critical ity of the equipment andor likelihood of it

combines cri ticality threat and vulnerability assessments in order to provide more complete picture of the risk s to an asset or group of assets this chapter describes the methodology commanders and civilia n equivalents can use to assess risk c82 ra methodology c821 ra the ra is logical stepbystep thod and shall require the participation of the entire staff in starting the ra process commanders should examine three elements threat criticality and vulnerability c8211 threat the threat is determined thr ough proper and thorough ta the ta should identify the likelihood and seve rity of the terrorist to inflic t injury to person or damage to facility or asset by consid ering terrorist capability intent and objectives to enable commanders to focus their analysis the ta should also specify the type of weapons or acts the terrorist shall use to initiate the event assassination bomb etc c8212 asset criticality critical assets are determ ined by both the term and the measure of importance to the installations ssion areas that encompass multiple critical assets are referred to as critical areas the criticality assessment provides information to prioritize assets and allocate resour ces to special protective actions c8213 vulnerability thorough va shall highlight th susceptibility of person group unit facility or asset to damaging incident vas should so address the capabilities of response elements to plan those activities that pport the installations ab ility to either deter andor respond to terrorist thr eats and incidents for example va might reveal weaknesses in an organizations security systems financial management processes computer networks or unprotected key infrastructure such as wa ter supplies bridges and tunnels c822 during the ra process the commander must consider all of the aforementioned elements to make wellinformed decisions wh planning fpcon meas ure implementation and terrorist incident response meas ures the ra and management process described here does not dictate how to conduct the assessment nor does it discuss how to identify deficiencies and vulnerabilities it outlines what type of information to collect and how to organize and display for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 84 for official use only that information for decisionmaking if the inst allation does not have the resident expertise to conduct an at ra consider using jsiva andor combatant commander or service at assessment reports vulnerabilities and deficienci gathered from these useful reports can be plugged directly into the methodol ogy outlined in this chapter c823 given the resourceconstrained enviro nment in which installations now operate installation commanders or their civilian equivalents require thod to assist them in making resource allocation decisions to protect the in stallation from possible terrorist threats fpcon measure implementation and other mitigation effort s and to most effectively respond should terrorist incident occur respons measures risk management is the process of identifying assessing and controlling risks arising from operational factor s and making decisions that balance risk costs with mission benefits the risk management proce ss allows installation commanders to use representative operational ri sk as one of the principal factors in their decisionmaking process in this context representative risk shows the relative impact on an installations assets given stated attack representative risk is not prediction that terrorist incident shall occur c824 the example below shall focus on vulnera bilities of critical assets this same methodology can be applied to other areas of interest ch as response capability it is also important to emphasize that this methodology is rely tool to assist commanders and civilian equivalents in assess ing and managing risk c83 assessing risk practical exercise c831 this example presumes that comman der has completed the threat criticality and vas chapters 5 through 7 the process begins by creating an asset ra ta ble in addition to isolated assets areas can be assess ed in terms of the criticality of the assets located within it and its vulnerability to specific threats the instal lation assessment team shall rate each asset for every type of threat identified in the ta c832 to complete the ra table begin by determining the asset to be examined create and label the table with the asset and label each column as illustrated in the table c8t1 c8321 attack means method by which asset would be attacked different groups may present several different attack methods based on what weapons they possess and the methods they use sample attack means incl ude small arms fire cartruck bomb chemical weapons biological weapons etc us the

ventilation system is not filtered redunda nt command post exists however several hours would be required before it could be fully opera tional because the command post is necessary to carry out the mission criticality is 9 out of 10 the vulnerability is 1 from small arms fire because small arms are unlikely to penetrate 12 of concrete and windows exist to shoot into the vulnerability from cartruck bomb is highe r because there is tr affic flow control around the building the cw and bw attack means are both high vulnerabilities because the ventilation system is unfiltered table c8t1

order to generally prioritize areas in terms of risk for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 86 for official use only c84 ra c841 table c8t1 gives the final ra for each asset the assets can be prioritized based on the ra the decisionmaker is required to determine the maximum amount of risk that is acceptable c842 the risk can also be represented gr aphically using the ra graph figure c8f1 the graph shall combine the criticalityvulnerab ilityattack means the xaxis and the threat probability the yaxis to repres ent the risk the representative risk is an expression of the relative impact on an asset or planning and resp onse element given stated attack means representative risk does not attempt to forecast risk eg assign predicta bility or likelihood figure c8f1 example of risk assessment for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 87 for official use only c843 standard methodology exists for blishing risk levels and their determination shall vary from installation to installation ba sed on the commanders judgment although this process is subjective commanders can focus thei r decision on where to establish the minimum risk by considering the following questions c8431 what is the instal lations mission how important is that mission to overall us military objectives in the region criticality assessment c8432 what resources are available for at activities on the in stallation va c8433 where are the nearest available res ources that could augment the installation should an incident occur do the commander have tasking authority for those resources va c85 completing the proc ess risk management c851 the end products of the above process sh all be the identification of areas and assets that are vulnerable to the identified attack m eans and the development of associated assessment tables from the information developed from ll assessments criticality threat vulnerability and risk and the ra graph the commander sha ll make decision on how best to employ given resources and force protection measures to deter m itigate or prepare for terrorist incident in accordance with reference installation comma nders should document their risk management methodology c852 there are several ways to reduce ris k the decisionmaker does not easily control two of those methods reducing th threat and reducing the critic ality the one method that is controllable is reducing the vulnerability of an asset c853 looking at the above example and consid ering only the command post it is apparent that the highest risk is from cartruck bomb what are some ways of reducing the vulnerability c8531 set up barriers to control traffi c flow around the command post the further away prospective cartruck bomb detonation the less impact it will have on the intended target another alternative is to control the traffic coming onto the inst allation if several buildings exist that require protection from car truck bombs then cars and trucks can be searched more thoroughly at the entrance to the fa cility if bombs arent allowed to enter the facility then the risk is greatly reduced for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 88 for official use only

less vulnerability due to redundancy c854 at the end of the ra and risk manage ment process the commander must engage and concur with the entire assessment in order to fo cus the next steps in risk

substantial periods c103 fpcon responsibilities c1031 per references and geographi c combatant commanders shall ensure that fpcons are uniformly implemented nd disseminated with their aor c10311 all military commanders and dod ci vilians exercising equivalent authority are responsible for ensuring that their s ubordinates fully understand fpcon declaration procedures and fpcon measures c10312 while there is direct correlation between th reat reporting and fpcons such information assists commanders in maki ng prudent fpcon declarations existence of threat reporting in and of itself should

while much is known about these cat egories of chemical agents terrorists are also capable of using wide variety of toxic in dustrial chemicals and to xic industrial agents planning for this type of attack against unwarned unprotected personnel presents great challenges to dod organizations these toxic in dustrial chemicals tics and toxic industrial materials tims may exist in large quantities onnear military installations and provide potential weapons of opportunity additionally current detection equipment may not be able to adequately warn of an incident or to properl identify the type of substance used medical personnel may not be able to rapidly diagnosis or treat casualties decontamination and contamination control procedures may not ad equately address techniques to minimize and mitigate the effects of the incide nt to minimize the uncertainty of these situations thorough assessment of the range of possible threat agen ts and potential vulnera bilities is essential c11332 for any type of chemical agent att ack procedures must be in place to allow for the rapid recognition and warning of the incide nt unlike biological agents chemical agent exposure generally results in the sudden onset of symptoms emergency responders should be trained to recognize symptoms of chemical contamination emergency medical responders should be trained to recognize nd treat victims of toxic chem ical exposure detection and for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 104 for official use only identification of the agent or agent properties will need to occur at the site and be conducted by an appropriate first response team c1134 biological agents major problem posed by biol ogical weapons is the lack of adequate quantities of responsive and sensitive biological detectors if an area is not covered by detectors there shall be si gnificant lagtime between employ ment and onset of symptoms biological weapons may be more insidious than chemical weapons current biological detectors are detect to treat providing information on the type of agent afte r exposure research development and acquisition rda efforts are u nderway to develop and field detect to warn detectors but deployment of such devices shall not occur for several years once exposure has occurred most of the biological agents have an incubation period of one to seven days before the onset of symptoms potential agents such as anthrax cholera plague smallpox tularemia and viral hemorrhagic fevers such as ebola virus lassa fever and yellow fever have delayed symptoms following initial exposure the g time from employment until detection has the potential to allow for widespread contamination and the dispersion of aff ected personnel across very large area table c11t3 shows some poten tial biological agents their incubation periods and potential lethality table c11t3 example biological agents error index entries found causative agent incubation period days fatalities anthrax bacillus

c11341 one method terrorists may use to spr ead biological agents is through dispersal of the agent as an aeroso lized spray containing bacteria viruses or spores this method is hard to detect and is effective in covering large areas with minimal amounts of agent and equipment other methods of agent dispersal include introdu cing the agent into food and water sources or releasing animals vectors that have been inf ected or are carrying the pathogenic organism detection of attacks is usually delayed allowing for significan t dispersion of the agent and greatly increased casualties the following exam ples demonstrate how terr orists could disperse for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 105 for official use only biological agents using very common means that would be difficult to detect and attract little attention from security personnel c113411 individuals posing as worker s in utility uniforms spraying vegetation along the perimeter fence line of an installation or headquarters the sprayers could contain biological agents that were being aeroso lized by the commercial weed sprayers c113412 small boat passing through port area on slow meandering course commercial generator and compressor could be concealed in the boat and disperse significant quantity of agent material over large area c113413 small commercial aircraft w ith an advertising banner attached flying repeatedly over an outdoor sporting event or ove r housing area the plan could easily conceal spray tank that was dispersing agent over very large area c11342 two key factors limiting the effects of potential biological agent attack are comprehensive vaccination policy and the active medical surveillance program vaccination programs offer the best defense against agent ex posure but are limited by lack of vaccines for all potential agents to help co mpensate for this shortfall it is important to involve medical personnel in assessing the threat from indigenous di seases and establishing an active preventive medicine program in contrast to naturally occu rring diseases in which incidence of the disease increase slowly over period of weeks or months deliberate biological attack shall peak in few days timely identification and communication of the attack is essential in treating and controlling the disease and limiting the effect on personnel an active medical surveillance program is essential to this process c11343 preventive medicine services sh all be in great demand upon the onset of an attack demands for medical support and serv ice shall likely exceed their availability preventive medicine specialists shall be required to assist commanders with identifying safe food and water sources and in determining when to use treatment immunization and other preventive measures preventive medicine personnel must be tinually aware of the biological threat in order to update their database on diseas potential vectors nd the susceptibility of troops to diseases c1135 toxins are relatively new threat and pose difficult problem in detecting an attack toxins are chemical compounds obtained from biological sources botulinum and ricin are in the toxin category as with biological agents medical personnel must provide assistance in identifying and treating personnel that are expo sed to toxin agents toxins may be dispersed for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 106 for official use only by methods similar to those used for biological agents and are more rapid acting other than immediate decontamination there are fielded first aid or treatment options for toxins casualties must be taken to dical facility for diagnosis and treatment table c11t4 lists examples of toxins and the time frame from exposure to onset of symptoms table c11t4 toxin agents and onset of symptoms toxin exposure lagonset of symptoms trichothecene mycotoxins t2 minutes ricin 1824 hours staplylococcal entero toxin b 312 hours botulinum toxin 2436 hours c11351 toxins are nonvolatile and tend to be more toxic than chemical agents for example botulinum toxin is 15000 times more thal than nerve agent gb their volatility means that they would not be persistent batt lefield threat and would not likely be spread by secondary or persontoperson exposures c11352 for toxins both incapacitation nd lethality must be considered several toxins cause significant illness at levels much lower than the level required for lethality and are militarily significant in their ability to incapa citate military force and civilian populations recovery rates for exposed personnel tend to be slow even when they are provided continuing medical treatment c1136 radiological materials while it is unlikely that non st ate sponsored terrorists shall develop nuclear weapons they have shown that th ey can procure radioactive material the most likely source of this material is from industr ial and medical pplications nuclear research facilities nuclear reactors medi cal research and treatment cente rs and construction engineering activities are all potential sources of radioactiv material lowlevel radioactive material and radioactive waste could be used to contaminate food and water sources as well as public areas and facilities equipment to detect radiation is available to most units but normally is not in continuous use because lowlevel exposure to radiation does not have noticeable immediate effect an attack may go undetected an exceptio n to this would be the use of an improvised explosive device to spread radi ation upon detonation radiation regardless of its intensity has the potential to produce harmful effects on unpr otected personnel and have significant for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 107 for official use only psychological impact effects may be the result of external exposure to radioactive source or inhalation or ingestion of radioactive particles c1137 recent events have forced greate r awareness of the vulnerability of us personnel and facilities to attack from terrorist elements both in the us and abroad the suddenness and severity of the atta cks has reinforced the need to anticipate and plan for the threat and consequence of terrorist attacks against us personnel the remainder of this chapter addresses reference standard s to assist in the analysis planning crisis management and consequence management of the possible use of wmd by terrorist organizations c114 potential threat of terrorist use of wmd c1141 the potentially devast ating effect of terrorist use of wmd mandates that organizations conduct thorough anal ysis of the threat in their areas of interest chapter 5 provides detailed discussions on guidelines and pr ocedures to follow when conducting terrorist threat estimates the unique as pects of the terrorist threat to acquire and employ wmd should be considered as distinct element of the overall ta c1142 the combatant commande rs should

diplomatic missions and supporting country teams within their aor they are an excellent source of information on the political and psychological background of cal terrorist organizations c1143 collection plans should address the terroris t capability to acquire and use wmd this information should be part of the commanders essential elements of information eei eei should be integrated into

trad itional military nuclear biological and chemical weapons and agents c1144 new or changing terrorist capability to acquire or deploy wmd must be rapidly disseminated through command channels units should include procedures for immediate reporting of changing terrorist th reats or actual use of wmd notification should be sent through chains of command lines of authority inte lligence agencies

facility commander has ove rall authority and direction over the wmd incident through his on site inci dent commander unless further delegated or assumed by the fbi in the event the fbi assumes jurisdic tion the facility commander retains control of military assets for offfacility cbrne events in foreign countries the dos is designated as the primary federal agency for foreign consequen ce management operations in support of foreign governments c116413 emergency operations center eoc the purpose of the eoc is to provide overall command and control on behalf of the commander of wmd or other type of incident the eoc should be organized and equi pped to coordinate in formation flow between the onscene commander and facility commander standard operating procedures sops should be documented and procedures refined as needed eocs normally have only small staff on duty and shall require immediate augmentati on when an attack occurs eocs may be unmanned and are activated partial

eoc the pao is re presented in both the eoc and media center and prepares media releases and conducts briefings at the media center during the incident using information obtained by the pao and cleared by the eoc and the commander or his or her designated representative the pao must be fully apprised of the situation as it develops the media representatives should not have direct ac cess to terrorists vic tims and communications nets or anyone directly involved in terrorist incident unless the pao has cleared such contact with the eoc dod experience with media repr esentatives has shown that bringing them in early under reasonable conditions an d restrictions commensurate with the risk and gravity of the event and providing them thorough briefings mainta ins dod credibility and preserves freedom of information pa efforts should focus on in forming the public of possible dangers and reinforcing public confidence in the installations capabilities to res pond to an event c116416 training and exercises training is the means to achieve the tactical and technical proficiency that i ndividuals leaders and units mu st have to enable them to accomplish their missions training must focus on the techniques and procedures of integrated response operations exercises should include all response functions to include local state federal or host nation res ources required

aars and used to develop training plans and assess the ove rall effectiveness of the at plan c11642 communications crucial aspect of implementing the wmd plan is establishing and controlling communi cations among the forces in the incident area the eoc and the incident response team irt communicati ons personnel must be able to respond to changing needs during the incident and be able to maintain over prolonged period control of all incoming and outgoing communications as well as the communications channels included in the wmd plan use of appropriate secure emer gency communication equipment

facilities such as tent cities or the temporary construction of shelters and use of similar facilities outside the disasteraffected area should evacuation be necessary there may be need to provide food to victims and emergency workers this can be done through combination of fixed sites m obile feeding units and bulk food distribution c11649 public works public works should ensure all facilities remain operational if possible ensure damage is remedied or mitigated and ensure full recovery of affected elements in timely manner to allow for the recovery of the installation c1165 it is highly recommended that the installation planners prepare responsesynchronization matrix the responsesynchronization matrix consists of response measures that must be carried out in response to wmd incident by each functional area these measures shall be developed into action sets since there are wmdspecific measures commanders civilian equivalents and installation pla nners must create their own for the

respond to terrorist incident or other unique event and restore at capability the primary objective of terrorist incident response management is to limit the effects and number of casualties resulting from terrorist attac k commanders develop response measures to save lives preserve health and safety secure and eliminate the hazard protect property prevent further damage to the instal lation and maintain public confidence in the installations ability to res pond to terrorist incident c1212 commanders responsibility to enfor ce security measures and to protect persons and property is paramount duri ng any level of conf lict as such it is incumbent upon the commander to plan for and be capable of reacti ng to terrorist attack if the attack involves chemical biological radiological nuclear or highyield explos ive cbrne device the number of casualties and the extent of the areas invol ved may quickly overwhelm organic resources this situation is covered in mo re detail later in section c126 c1213 this chapter addresses management of terrorist incident the focus of incident management is on the organic assets of an installa tion ship or base and th ability to cope with the situation using organic assets until outside assistance arrives reference requires all commanders to prepare installationwide terroris t incident response measures and include them in the at plan the terrorist incident res ponse measures should include procedures for determining the nature and scope of incidence response proce dures for coordinating security fire and medical first responders and steps to reconsti tute the installation s ability to perform at measures c1214 there are an unlimited number of potentia l terrorist incidents requiring response developing separate courses of action for each

dod o200012h february 2004 117 for official use only c122 terrorist incident management planning c1221 the establishment of mechanism to re spond to terrorist incident is an essential element of the dod cbt program normally the installation base or unit commander identifies an office or section or designates personnel from various sections who act as the principal planning agency for special thre ats and who comprise the emerge ncy operations center see paragraph c1234 during an actua l crisis one effective met hod for determining what areas should comprise the planning and execution of the response is to use the wmd response functions c1222 there is requirement to have sepa rate terrorist incident management plan however reference requires that the at plan address terrorist incide nt response measures appendix 5 identifies items that should be consid ered for inclusion into the crisis management plan c123 initial response c1231 onset of terrorist incident the onset of terrorist incident begins with the detection of an unlawful act of violence or th reatened violence detection may result from routine surveillance performed by an installation or facility intrus ion detection system guard or security force or aware dodaffiliated persons once detection of criminal act occurs first responding security or law enforcement personn must perform an initial assessment c1232 initial response force c12321 onduty security forcesmilitary police patrols or gua rd personnel usually provide initial response to rrorist attack the initial resp onse force is usually under the control of the onscene senior officer or nonc ommissioned officer assuming responsibility at facilities controlled by the defense agencies th initial response force may be under the control of senior civilian security or dod law enforcem ent official once the initial response force has responded to the incident and determined the circumstances the installation commander should activate required forces and begin notification procedures for military and civilian authorities c12322 the initial response force should immediately identify nd report the nature of the situation isolate the incident and contai n the situation until relieved by the reaction force commander initial response force actions are critical each shift of the daily security force must for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 118 for official use only have trained personnel who are aware of the threat and are capable of reacting promptly to any new development c12323 for example if the attack is bombing ambush assassination or firebombing the terrorists may escape before additional forces arrive in these cases the initial response force should provide medical aid seal ff the crime scene and secure other potential targets in case the initial attack was diversiona ry tactic if the event is hostagebarricade situation the ini tial response force should seal off and isol ate the incident scene to ensure one enters or leaves the area the initial response for ce must also be prepared to locate witnesses and direct them to safe location for debriefing for foreign incidents th initial response force must also be prepared to interface with host nati on police or military forces that may also be responding to the incident c1233 installationbase commander c12331 the installationbase commander depending upon established sops should activate the installations eoc additionally the commander s hould notify specialized response forces and immediately report the incident to the appropriate s

important for the response force to identify the type of incident as quickly as possible if the fbi or host nation assumes control th the response force must be prepared to coordinate the operational handover and assist as needed c12352 the initial or specialized respons forces may be required to provide outer perimeter security as well as be prepared to mana ge the entire event they must also be prepared to turn over responsibility for resolving the incident to host g overnment security forces if overseas or the fbi if within the united states and in the event that the fbi seeks to exercise jurisdiction over the containment and resolution phases of the inci dent these installationbase forces must always prepare for the most re sourcedemanding contingency this level of readiness requires considerable sustainment training c124 followon response the response to terrorist incident varies depend ing on the nature and location of the incident generally there are three distinct phases thr ough which an incident may evolve although many incidents do not develop beyond the first phase c1241 phase i locally available resources phase i is the commitment of locally available resources including available security forcesmilitary police patrols or guards and available backup units civilian co ntract guard services should not be used as part of an initial response force for terrorist incident unless th ere is federal law enforcement or security forcesmilitary police available civilian contract guard services should generally be restricted to perimeter security duties traffic control and crowd control activities ideally all law enforcement or security personnel are familiar with local sops fo r terrorist incidents and have practiced these procedures as pa rt of their unittraining program they must be prepared to secure contain and gather information at th scene until the beginning of phase ii while securing and containing the incident scene response forces must be alert to the fact terrorist incidents often include diversionary tactics the evacuation of thr eatened areas is high priority function for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 120 for official

response force such as special reacti on team srtemergency service team est fbi hostage rescue teams or host nation tactic units on many inst allations the initial response force and the augmentation force are essent ially the same this phase begins when the eoc is activated during this phase either the fbi or the host nation may assume control jurisdiction over the incide nt if that occurs installation fo rces must be ready to support the operation the installation speciall trained response force must be ready for employment in this phase of the operation in any c ountry that terrorist incident against an american facilityunit occurs the dos and the us embassy shall pl ay the key role in coordinating the us government and host country response to such an incident c1243 phase iii commitment of counterterrorist resources phase iii is the commitment of specialized the fbi the departme nt of defense or host nation counterterrorist force in this phase steps are taken to terminat the incident incident termination may be the result of successful negotiations ssault or other actions including the surrender of the terrorists because identifying the terrorists as opposed to the

drill this type of at exercise involves the key leaders and staff officers of an organization or installation gathered in one room or area it is scenario driven discussion led by facilitator and can be used to exercise specific portions of an at plan or the entire plan itself this type of exercise depending on the scenario can be one hour or last full day tabletop exercise should be used when an at plan is new as refr esher training or to familiarize new leaders with the at plan c1323 drills drills are collective training events that focus on selected functions procedures or portions of an at plan example portions of an at plan that can be exercised to achieve limited objectives are command post exercises notification drills first responder drills or evacuation dril ls drills are scenario driven events usually limited to specific organizations or functions in order to test assess and validate specific portions of plan these also can st anywhere from 1 to 8 hours or even longer if

can be as long as several days c133 preparing for an exercise c1331 successful at exercise like any ot her exercise or training event requires thorough planning commanders and their staffs should use their servi ce specific doctrine to plan an at exercise it is im portant to plan the training event far enough in advance as to ensure it is deconflicted with other mission requirement s deployments and training events if the event is to achieve worthwhile training object ives the commander must be involved in key decision points in the planning proce ss the first of which is to ge t the training events placed on the long range training calendar c1332 characteristics of an at exercise c13321 successful tabletop and fullscale at exercises are threat scenario driven guided by white hat controllers and have commander involvement and support c13322 drills may or may not have threat scenario depending on which function or portions of an at plan are being exercised commands must examine which key functions or portions of an at plan are key tasks needing to be figure c13f3 observerscontrollers discuss an exercise with player personnel for official use only dod o200012h february 2004

local threat assessment participation of the local law enforcement co mmunity is essential dod and civilian law enforcement can make significant contributions to scenario and threat development ensuring valuable at injects are develope d is probably the most important task for the identified action officer during the planning phase so that the training audience experiences fluid operation requiring key at staffing and decisions by lead ers the current threat assessment should be utilized to develop realistic scenario for fullscale exercise s commands should consider red team to fill the role of terrorist organi zation identifying the red team early is also critically important so that they can properly prepare and train for the event for official use only dod o200012h february

the vision for the exercise s been established making it happen is the next step this requires grea t deal of logistics and administra tive coordination and is essential to the success of the exercise the staging of the event may require resources not normally on hand or may require initiative to acquire arra ngements for rooms vehicles for oc and key leaders along with other white t requirements need to be locked in staging of events and the logistics associated with terro rist act need to be considered and planned for visualaudio support access control to key oc areas and the control cell

organizations or staff c1335 the scenario should be articulated in to wellwritten exerci directive with identified purposes of clear focused tasks with predefined evaluation cr iteria the directive shall be the foundation of the exercise and must be produced far enough in advance for units to digest plan and train to ensure the exercise is worthwhile c1336 once the scenario and directive have been developed planne rs should create an exercise manual it should contain th schedule the scope objectives inject timelineimplementation schedule ground rules and ru of engagement roe it should also contain scenario materials cont act information for key leaders and participants the exercise directive that task organizations and units and any other forms and record s needed injects and some

ope of the exercise the rules for the exercise safety and the roles of the contro llers control cells need to be briefed and trained to run injects by message phone simulators or other predetermin ed means finally role players need to understand when their roles star t end and the purpose of their roleplaying event c1343 once the briefings are accomplished it is time to start the ex ercise the injects should be initiated according to the timeline and monitored by the exercise controller he shall need assistance in keeping track of time so players are continually challenged the planned timeline may need to be slowed down or even sped up as necessary to keep the players constantly involved and engaged real at even t shall be extremely engaging and the exercise should attempt to

civilian personnel military personnel or contractor personnel the goal of an at program is to protect military service members the dod civilian workforce family mbers facilities and other vital missionrelated assets from terrorists in order for an at program to obtain this goal it is essential to ensure resources are available to execute the at plan and achieve the four ove rarching objectives to deter detect defend and respond however generating resource requirements and acquiring additional resources to mitigate identified vulnerab ilities is an important st ep in the solution to reducing risk it is imperative to continue to educate and incr ease at awareness engage with the local community for assistance and informa tion follow implement and improve existing security tactics techniques and procedures and maximize prot ective benefits from existing resources the at plan must be complete nd effective ta conducted critical assets identified and higher headquarters va

to be analyzed and the likelihood of the threat and the nature and scope of potential harm to all assets people and facilities assessed this analysis lays the foundation for res ource determination and risk management c1612 once resources are determined to be necessary and an unacceptable level of risk exists it is important to ensure appropriate resources manpower operations and equipment are available to execute the at plan and achieve the four objectives mentioned above however before activitiesinstallationsunits can succe ssfully compete and acquire these resources requirements must be documented well defined pr ioritized and clearly articulated once at requirements have been established and appropr iately documented th ere are two principal avenues to obtain funding for required

assess resource re quirements the development of an executable at plan is critical it is important to identify and docum ent in the plan who what when where and how resources are needed to mitigate at threats nd vulnerabilities given limited resources and budgetary constraints the plan s hould provide commanders with alternatives for timely cost effective remedies to allow for tradeoffs well designed integrated systems approach is essential to achieving these tradeoffs typi cal physical security systems approach should include resources capable of pe rforming early threat and weapons detection classification and assessment delay communications and response the physical security measures should be combination of active and passive systems vices and personnel all these resources are necessary to protect designa ted security interests from possible threats c1622 once the at plan is complete ta conducted and critical assets identified va must be conducted to determine the vulnerabiliti of critical assets given the organizations current at effectiveness with regard to ma npower policyproceduresplans equipment and trainingexercises during integrated vulnerability asse ssments higher headquarters vulnerability assessment team joint staff combatant commander component command or service shall provide both procedural and programmatic recommendations to mitigate vulnerabilities and reduce risk the programmatic recommendations should not translate directly into resource requirement based upon the anal ysis conducted by the unitinstallation it is the commanders decision with the assistance of working group to determine how to address these recommendations implementing changing or adding tactics techni ques and procedures may or may not mitigate the risk either way it is understood there is zerorisk environment and it is the commanders decision to determine if the risk is acceptable how to address the issues and resources that are necessary c1623 once threat asset vulnerability and at effectiveness information is gathered the data must be analyzed to assess the likelihood of the threat and the nature and scope of potential harm to all assets people and facilities this analysis lays the foundatio n for risk management the selection and implementation of effective nd affordable security measures that meet prioritized security requirements once this anal ysis is complete the plan is exercised lessons are learned and the level of risk identified then it is time to determine if additional resources are required and appropriately document them if additional resource requirements are necessary the suitable resource must be tied to the plan an d requested in order to provide higher level of protection to meet the at plans ob jectives for

important to understand and use the ppbe process to obtain funding inf ormation on the ppbe process can be found in management initiative decision 913 reference aj however th is process does not guarantee that you shall receive funding adequately articu lating and justifying requirements is crucial without thorough and proper justif ication it is almost certain requirements shall not be addressed nor considered for funding these re quirements must compete with other higher hq service responsibilities and priorities even with welldocumented justification it does not necessarily guarantee fundi ng shall be provided because of th is competition for limited funding however the units chances to effectively compet are substantially impr oved in addition to properly documenting requirement s it is critical that requir ementsfunding information is provided on time and in the format requested if this is not accomplished then it appears the organization requesting the

combatant commanders area of responsibility where significant threat exists those threats include ssaults kidnappings assassinations and attempts to embarrass the us government this chapter is intended to supplement and consolidate information provided in other sections of this handbook with focus on the mission of executive protection other sections of this handbook should serve as the primary reference for many of the concepts discussed here for purposes of this chapter the term executive applies to all persons requiring additional security protection because they are assigned to high risk billets or have been designated as high risk personnel c2164 the specific supplemental security measures that may be furnished to executives are subject to wide range of legal and policy constraints us law establishes stringent requirements that must be met before certain security measures may be implemented dod for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 208 for official use

and foreign government sha ll also limit use of supplemental security measures the us government contracted use of land or buildings for use by the department of defense may also limit applica tion of certain security technique s all of these constraints should be carefully considered when conducti ng security surveys developing plans and implementing additional security measures to protect executives c217 executive protection goals c2171 in the discussion that follows severa l measures are outlined which can afford dod executives additional protection against terroris t acts the primary purpose underlying these measures is to c21711 delay at distance increase the time that elapses between the detection of an imminent terrorist attack and the actual onset of an attack to permit the arrival of response forces or the successful evacuation of executives c21712 delay to permit flight increase the amount of time that elapses between the onset of an attack and terrorist access to executives to permit the ar rival of response forces or the successful evacuation of executives under attack c21713 delay hold and counterattack increase the durati on of an attack by allowing executives their staffs and their familie s to remain secure in safe haven until response force can arrive to repulse the att ack apprehend the terrori sts and relieve the executives and those with them in the safe haven c2172 each supplemental secur ity measure should be applied ju diciously there is clear tradeoff between increasing the level of execu tive office and residence at measures and the need to preserve the anonymity of executives to avoid activity that may point to the executives prominence or criticality c2173 supplemental at measures can be expensive the expense should be measured not just in terms of dollars but so in terms of changes to organi zational routine therefore two primary questions must be addressed prior to the implementation of pot entially bold disruptive and expensive supplemental security enhancements c21731 what are the most costeffectiv means of enhancing the security of executives at risk how many changes in organi zational routines and personal behavior shall for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 209 for official use only have to be made in order for security measures to be effective in reduci ng the vulnerability of executives and the risk of terrorist attacks c21732 what are the anticipated costs of additional security m easures in terms of dollars organizational functionality and mission capability c2174 the security enhancements descri bed in this handbook shall be even more effective if the executives and their families take full advantage of the enhancements and reinforce the security measures if executives do not change their be havior to accommodate additional security and protective measures then their behavior can ffectively defeat the purpose of the additional protection c2175 security measures can be enhanced to deter almost any terrorist threat however there may be point where it is longer ec onomical to add layer upon layer of protective measures to deter threat that is capable of overwhelming available protective measures when facing wellarmed and capable rrorist threat additional securi ty measures coupled with an alternative security posture may provide the greatest deterrence to terrorist attack c218 supplemental security measures for executives c2181 general at principles sound at principles apply to both executive offices and residences the following principles should be reviewed prior to implementing supplemental at measures c21811 thorough physical security surv ey serves as the foundation for strong executive protection program physical security surveys of the offices and residences of dod elements and personnel attached to us embass ies should be performed by the dos cognizant physical security and facilities engineering staffs should perform surveys of other dod facilities c21812 the optimal approach to physical curity site survey is from the viewpoint of potential terrorist the survey should exam ine avenues of approach to the installation facility or residence points of access to the executive offices or residences and how attacks on offices residences or other frequently used facilities could be mounted c21813 technical ta is the next step in evaluating the need for supplemental executive at measures c218131 technical ta provides t horough and detailed assessment of the weapons and tactics terrorists might use to att ack the structure where dod executives work and for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 210 for official use only reside in order to enhance executive at meas ures security engineers and architects need technical threat data or assessments containing the following information c2181311 potential terrori st modes of attack c21813111 standoff weapons mor tar rocket gren ade

threats c2181323 calculate the total amount of delay time that must be achieved through use of camouflage deception barriers nd semiactive security devices this delay time shall permit security forces to respond to the s cene of terrorist attack in time to thwart the attack capture or eliminate the terrorists and rescue executives and their staffs or family members c218133 technical assessment of re sponses provides engineers information on the anticipated performance of the security fo rces responding to rrorist threat and the expected or desired behavior of the protected executives the

quantified and used to develop detailed plans drawings an d at equipment acquisition plans c218135 while at enhancement measures are intended to provide additional protection for executives the primary purpose of th measures is to increase time required by terrorists to penetrate the executi ves office or residence c2182 office the office environment should normally provide executives the greatest degree of at protection at measures guards security chec kpoints office workers aides andor secretaries all serve to insulate the exec utives from potential threats unfortunately the considerable media attention provided to at tacks on executives in government facilities may further entice terrorists hence there may be need to enhance security measures to offset the escalating capability of atta ck on more secure office areas by terrorist groups c21821 the following measures can be sele ctively implemented to enhance executive office at security c218211 increase threat

protectee is critical to the succe ss of the psd mission protectees do have right and responsibility to make their wishes known with respect to their personal security they also have an obligation to listen carefully to the head of the psd who is trained and highly qualified to assist the pr otectee in making reasonable judgments about manageable risks psd members understand their function is inherently intrusive and that protectees can easily resent the loss of privacy that accompanies the protection offered on the other hand psds must accomplish their mission not merely to protect executives but to help safeguard mission critical assetsdod executives c211063 one of the psds most demandi ng functions is to limit the ability of individuals to circulate and appro ach the protectee

circuits and alarm devices activate visible or audible signal in the immediat vicinity of the detect ed intrusion usually on the exterior of the building the alarm tran smission or communication lines do not leave the building response is by local security forces th at may be in the area when the alarm is sounded otherwise the security force sha ll know of the alarm only if pa sserby reports it or if it is found during routine checks the disadvantage of this system is that intruders know exactly when the alarm is activated and can easily elude capture local alarm system should be used only when guards are able to respond in timely manner for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 237 for official use only c22522 central station in this type of system th operation of alarm devices and

personnel monitor the signals and provide the response force to any unauthorized entry into the protected area connection of alarm equipment to the central station is usually over leas ed telephone company lines c22523 police connection in this type of system th alarm devices and electrical circuits are connected via leased telephone company lines to monitoring unit located in nearby civilian police stations an agreement with the cal police department must be arranged prior to establishment of this type of system c22524 proprietary station this system is similar to central station

surveillance information is assessed as threatening or benign visual surveillance systems are usually more limited in detection range than electromagnetic nsors many visual surveillance systems are passive devices their use does not require the emission of ener gy which could alert an intruder to the presence of surveillance systems vi sual surveillance systems have performance limitations due in part to ambient weather c onditions which may require use of additional passive sensors such systems report information in form that may necessitate more complex analysis before the detection of an

hostile to dod assets it may also detect the presence of activity or targets at near or beyond the perimeter barrier which behave in peculiar manner for the most part however it seems unlikely that

if the terrorists undertake an overt act such as clearing windows in the upper stories of buildings across the street from dod facility c22117 on the other hand it is clear that if external survei llance detects the presence of the threat at the perimeter barrier and is able to maintain contact with the threat then classification of the threat and pr eparing an immediate response if the perimeter is penetrated are both easier and quicker c22118 surveillance systems that combine det ection systems registering the presence of threat as well as detection systems that permit direct visual monitoring of the threat provide considerable information to inst allation threatassessment personnel multiple sensors arrayed in grid pattern from the perimeter barrier stretching in toward the center of the facility can provide the security force with informa tion necessary to classify and ch aracterize the threat without forcing the guard force to leave secure positions surveillance systems often have lower life cycle cost they can be hardened against the elements to substantial degree it is not surprising to see more dod components placi ng greater emphasis on id s and other

other facilities collocated on the installation security planners are fully aware of dod re gulations and instructions service regulations and instructions and combatant commander requirements for enhanced physical security protection for many types of munitions stored at dod airfields c22122 in securing structures and facilities however it is important to examine runways and taxiways with great care these are not merely slabs of asphalt and concrete poured on the ground they are intricate complex architectural structures containing all the building elements normally associated with complex highrise office or apartment buildings runways and taxiways are crisscrossed with electrical water and sewer lines often there are petroleum oil and lubricants distribution system s buried adjacent to if not unde rneath portions of runway and taxiway structures constructi ng 2 to 3milelong stretches of pavement often requires substantial reconfiguration of th local topography creating the ne ed for extensive drainage and storm water management systems c22123 therefore airfields abound with utility penetrations not often seen in urban office building environments c22124 airfields are often adjacent to areas with substantial wild life activity exterior intrusion alarm systems are prone to provide much data on movement that is regarded as false that is nonhuman exterior intr usion alarms applied without grea t care to airfield perimeter security barriers can actually degrade security by desensitizing security personnel responsible for classification and assessment of threat informa tion reported high false alarm rates triggered by roaming wildlife can lull guard s and ids monitors into false sense of security c22125 use of multiple phenomenology intrusi on sensors is essential to the effective management of limited security personnel resources at airfields use of line detectors motion detectors mounted on fences and seismic or acous tic sensors sown in patterns are critical multiple phenomenology ids can permit alert center personnel to classify and identify an intrusion by looking at reports from each type of sensor subtle differences are reported between human and animal interactions among different t ypes of sensors by laying out multiple sensors across wide area the differences between human and animal activity can be magnified allowing alert center personnel to determine whether the intrusion is human or animal as well as the intruders direction nd rate of advance this informati on can be used to determine whether for official use only dod

unique aspect of airfield secur ity is the nature of th activity and the type of assets to be found there aircraft genera lly are most vulnerable to mechanical problems human error or groundtoair att ack during landings and takeoff the requirement to maintain lift at low speeds generally restri cts aircraft operation to fairly narrow corridor within few degrees of the direction of the airfield runways the performa nce envelope of aircraft also restricts the volume of airspace in which an aircraft can operate with in few miles of an airfield c22127 the introduction of sophisticated elec

c22128 hence airfields have an excep tional requirement for beyondtheperimeter surveillance they may also have an exceptional require ment for beyondtheperimeter response c221281 consider establishing observation po sts in offbase areas beneath or adjacent to flight paths for landings and takeoffs use of dod personnel for law enforcement and security operations outside the perimeter of dod instal

astrid waterways is an especially challenging task like airfield security t security begins with the basic problem of securing the facility and assets housed or contained therein by erecting appropriate pe rimeters and installing physical security devices to detect attempted or successful perimeter penetrations c22142 the problem of securing the wate rside of dod installation is equally challenging there is substantial difficulty in di stinguishing friend or foe even under the best of circumstances rules of navigation make strict enforcement of perimeters difficult as these rules allow for emergencies tidal and wind actio n and even errors by eager but lessskilled operators of vessels or craft background activity outside the perimeter of dod installation makes detection classification and identifica tion of terrorist thr eats very difficult c22143 securing ports against rrorist attack is further co mplicated by two factors for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 261 for official use only c221431 the quantity of materiel in transit to and from port areas is enormous the quantities are so large that it is physically impossible to in spect each container or bulk cargo shipment for weapons explosives or other terrorist contraband c221432 port facilities are notoriously acces sible from the waterside of the facility hence waterside security must include the establ ishment of security perimeter at the waters edge to detect presence of terrori st threats the security peri meter must be extended into the water if terrorists are assessed as having the capa bility to launch attack s using standoff weapons from boats or other craft c22144 external surveillance must monitor traffic on the surface of the water adjacent to the facility extending from the barrie r to range exceeding that of id entified terrorist threats as illustrated by figure c22f5 the outer limit of the surveillance area extends well beyond the estimated outer range of terrorist waterborne wea pons security zone is established within the surveillance area extending from the highwater mark to di stance at least 1000 meters from shore if possible in some port areas the security zone shall be constrained while in other areas the security zone may be extended farther especially if the terrori st threat includes longerrange standoff weapons such as manportable antitank ssiles within the security zone exists reaction zone here aggressive actions may be u ndertaken to isolate delay and resolve potential threats to dod assets from waterside terrorist action c22145 figure

ructures in shallow water as is the case for airfield navigation aids in bays or rivers c22146 specific recommendations on implementa tion of waterside security measures are described in appendix 17 c22147 it should be emphasized that dod facilities bordering bodies of water should include waterside protective measures as part of th facility physical security plan even if there are active

physical security system is to prevent the loss destruction or compromise of dod assets under some circumstances moving the asset to more secure environment or closing the activity until the threat has abated best achieve this purpose c22162 security personnel should survey th area adjacent to dod installations or facilities to identify potential sites for helicopter nding zones if appropr iate site is available near dod installations for facilities appr opriate alternatives should be identified c22163 in preparing plans for evacuation of dod assets requiring maximum protection the security personnel should consider construction of one or more safe havens in the vicinity of the emergency evacuation site such structur should be well camouflaged and knowledge of their existence kept on st rict needtoknow basis c22164 erecting or constructing special safe havens near emergency evacuation sites should be considered when circumstances are such that helicopter evacuation might require several hours to execute af ter requested plans should be prepar ed that would permit dispersal of dod personnel to several safe havens including those adjacent to emergency evacuation sites before local travel becomes too dangerous relo cation of dod personnel to remote safe havens to await evacuation may be an effective alternativ in some circumstances especially those in which the number of dod pers onnel and dependents is small c22165 curtailing activities require surv ey of all essential nonessential functions performed at the location and d eciding which of those can be mporarily halted without mission degradation examples of activi ties that could be curtailed are base exchange morale welfare and recreation activities and dod schools cu rtailing activities can be linked to fpcon and curtailment procedures can be outlined in the at plan c2217 access controls c22171 access controls are intended to incr ease the amount of time needed to go from one area of facility to anothe r to allow security personnel to sound alarms and take immediate protective actions in the event of attack some access control systems can both delay attackers in reaching protected areas and inhib it egress from facility these systems aid in containing and resolving the incident as well as aid in the apprehension of the perp etrators figure c22f6 illustrates one approach to controlling access to secure area within building depending on the threat the asset to be prot ected and the availab ility of protection nd security resources access control points as illustrated can be

of valuable items or information as well as to protect individuals in the secure area against direct assault or explosive devices left behind by authorized visitors for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 266 for official use only c22172 access control procedures the systems approach to physical security includes an assessment of daytoday opera tions within the secured area in order to maintain adequate security throughout dod installa tion within facility within an activity and within an organization without unduly interfering with day today work it is necessary to permit personnel to move about on the other hand the physical security system has re sponsibility to ensure that protected assets remain protected th roughout the regular workday accordingly the following measures can be implemented to main tain positive control ove r access to protected dod assets c221721 passandbadge system where the area is large or where the number of personnel exceeds number that can be recognized personally by the guard or persons charged with security responsibility for the area pass andbadge identification system should be used security badges shall be used primarily for acce ss control badges shoul d contain picture of the individual who has authorized access and it may contain additiona l information about the individual communicated through such things as badge borders color and photograph background color information that should not be printed on the ba dge includes the home address the specific work location address and telephone number security information and in some areas information identifying the badge hol der as dod or us government employee c221722 an access list system admission of personnel to very highsecurity areas should be granted only to persons who are posit ively identified one approach is to prepare access lists containing the names of those individual s specifically authorized access to facility access lists should be maintained under stringent control of an individual who is formally designated by the commanding officer or mana ger of the facility that person should be responsible for updating and confirming the need for access on regular frequent basis admission of persons other than those on the au thorized access list shoul d be approved by the commanding officer manager or designated repr esentative access lists should always be controlled carefully and never displayed to the p ublic if computerized access list system is used the computer files used to generate such list must be safeguarded against tampering c221723 an exchange pass system the exchange pass identification system may be employed in highly sensitive areas to ensure stri ngent access control it involves exchanging one or more identification media such as badges or passes for another separa type of identifier such as badges or passes this system is partic ularly useful where visitors must gain access to highsecurity facility the process of exchanging passes is personal one permitting security for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 267 for official use only personnel an opportunity to examine all pe rsonnel both upon entering and upon exiting the secured facility c221724 an escort system escorting is method to control visiting personnel within secured facility the escort must remain with the visitor at ll times while within the restricted areas if local writt policy determines that an indi vidual does not require an escort within the area the individual must meet all the entry requirements for unescorted access escorts may be civilian or military personnel empl oyed by or attached to the visited activity and shall normally be from the office of the person being visited major objective in escorting visitors around facili ty is to ensure that all material brought into the facility by the visitor is left with someone who can open and examine the conten ts and that visitors leave packages or other materials behind on their departure c2218 safehavens c22181 the innermost layer of protection wi thin physical security system is the safehavens safehavens are not intended to withstand disciplined paramilitary attack featuring explosives and heavy weapons such structures generally should be expected to provide minimum of 15 minutes of protection against predetermined level of attack using hand attack tools or small arms c22182 the safehaven should be designed such that it requires more time to penetrate by attackers than it takes for the response force to reach the protected area consider equipping the safehaven with minimal food water and medical supplies consult service combatant commander or dod agency at construction guidance for comp lete details on constructing safehaven figure c22f7 represents sample safehaven layout c22183 even though safehaven is not intend ed or designed to provide penetration protection over an extended period it may be nece ssary for occupants to remain in the safehaven for several hours while response forces converge on the site cont ain and resolve the terrorist incident under such circumstances occupants of the safehaven may be more secure and less likely to be injured or to compromise crisis management by remaining in the safehaven until the onscene commander directs them to evacuate or leave the facility c2219 residential physical security

residency selection c221931 there are number of general curity atmosphere factors that should be considered when selecting family residence c2219311 the general character of str eets sidewalks lighting pedestrian and vehicular traffic patterns c2219312 the presence and condition of parks playgrounds recreation areas c2219313 the existence of public or co mmercial enterprises intermingled with residential dwellings c2219314 the existence and condition of fire hydrants and police call boxes c2219315 where the streets are paved well lit broad enough for at least two cars to pass one another and lined wi th sidewalks filled with variet of people there is strong possibility that the neighborhood is fairly secure where these favorable impressions can be reinforced by walk through clean well utilized parks playgrounds and recreational areas walk through clean attractive mixeduse neigh borhoods and areas with visible presence of police and fire services the initial impressi on is likely to hold up to further scrutiny c2219316 in general the overall appear ance of the area may often serve as an indicator of crime levels where property lines are well defined homes ppear well maintained and the landscaping shows an obvious pride in the property crime rates are likely to be low while that may not eliminate the threat of terr orist attack it does sugges t an attractive general security atmosphere c2219317 observe or make inquiries about the frequency and type of police patrols in given neighborhood find out what type of police or which police jurisdiction responds to calls for assistance observe the general appearance of po lice security personnel on the street the police who take pride in their appearance the ppearance of their vehicles and who make themselves visible to the public in the performance of thei r duties can usually be relied upon to provide dependable poli ce coverage throughout the community c2219318 try to determine the attit ude of the government and the populace toward other nationals and particularly american s strong antiameri can attitude could be cause for you to have diminished fa ith in local police responsiveness for

ca n provide specific indi cations about local security conditions look for specific indicators of security precautions taken by local residents such as c2219321 presence of barred window s security grills on doors c2219322 security walls and fences c2219323 security lighting c2219324 large dogs or other watch animals c2219325 presence of private securi ty guards especial ly during the day c2219326 background information on local criminal activity investigate local crime activity in the area to which you are considering moving c2219327 the level of criminal or rrorist activity throu ghout community is rarely uniform street crime can be expected to occur in lower income crowded and congested areas it is generally recomme nded that residences not be sel ected in downtown commercial or especially isolated areas especi ally when local data indicate that such areas are high crime areas c221933 dod personnel assigned to defense attaché offices can contact the embassys regional security office prior to ove rseas deployment for detailed information on high and low crime areas the defense attachés office should also be able to obtain such information to assist personnel being assigned overseas on tdytad status who may require residential housing in lieu of hoteltype accommodations c221934 other dod affiliated personnel may obtain information by contacting the country desk in the department of state washington dc 20520 or on the worldwide web at httpwwwstategov c221935 utilities service and protection explore the reliability of local utility service in order to determine whether or not em ergency or backup power nd utility service shall be required the availability and reliability of utilitie s in any given location should be primary factor in the selection of residential site reliability of ut ilities should be determined and in cases were they are erratic acquisition and use of backup systems should be assumed disruption of utility service particularly electr icity and telephone would facilitate unauthorized access to residence by an intruder for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 271 for official use only c221936 fire protection consider the availability nd effectiveness of local fire protection services in each neighborhood being i nvestigated for potenti residence the proximity of prospective residences to and the effectiveness of th fire protection services are major consideration in residential site selection the availability of water or other substances to fight fire should be determined the locations of fire hydrants or other water sources and means by which they can be accessed and brought to the residence by its occupants before the arrival of the local fire brigade should be considered c221937 physical environment considerations c2219371 investigate potential hazards in the physical environment in and around neighborhoods of potential residential interest c2219372 residential areas under cons ideration should be well removed from known environmental hazards such as flood plains active geological faults and steep slopes of hills subject to mudslides andor brushfires re sidential areas close to breeding areas for disease vectors such as insects or rodents should also be avoided if possible c2219373 sometimes housing availability restricts residential selection to areas at risk from at least some of the environmental hazards noted above if placed in this situation take the following measures plan additional nece ssary precautions to prevent loss or injury from environmental disasters in additi on to potential terrorist actions c2219374 be sure to include access to and storage of emergency rations lighting power communications and backup or alternatives to any other sy stems that could be disrupted as result of an environmental disaster as part of your moving plans c221938 residence access routes select candidate resi dences with access routes that allow many choices of approach or departure it is essential that acces s routes to and from residences allow occupants many choices of appro ach or departure to make detection of arrival and departure patterns difficult and to avoid ambush or attack once it is spotted some considerations should include c2219381 clear delineation of the street or roadway c2219382 sufficient street width to allo w two cars to pass even if vehicles are parked on both sides of the roadway c2219383 sufficient neighborhood night lighting c2219384 unobstructed road view from the residence for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 272 for official use only c2219385 of all considerations when c ontemplating the potential dangers of an access route the most important is to select re sidential location that shall not lock occupants into predictable patterns do not select re sidence located on deadend or oneway street locations such as these provide terrorists ideal opportunities for ambushes that would be almost impossible to avoid c221939 parking c2219391 consider the location and avai lability of parking for privately owned vehicles motorcycles and bicycles when exam ining candidate residences and their surrounding neighborhoods c2219392 in selecting residence c onsideration must be given to securing personal property including means of transporta tion bicycles motorcycles mopeds and other twowheeled vehicles are usually relatively easy to secure often they shall fit in storage shed or can be locked close to the residence where they can be observed c2219393 the family automobile and in some cases official vehicles have been approved for transportation betw een home and office present another problem the best solution is to store the vehicle in garage that can be kept locked at all times carports and driveways within fenced or guarded area are th next best alternative offstreet parking alternatives represent anot her far less desirable alternative personal or official vehicles should not be parked on the street overnight in the vicinity of personal residences c2220 security comparisons betw een single and multiple family residences c22201 after careful review of the general security atmosphere and specific indicators of local crime there may be an opportunity to choose either si ngle family or multiple family residence overall housing costs availability of dependent car or playmates for dependents and location convenience factors noted above ca n be important determinants of residential choice there are some specific security consider ations however that should also be evaluated in choosing between multiple or singlefamily residences c22202 in most cases apartmen ts are generally preferred to singlefamily dwellings when security is primary consideration apartments above the first floor are more difficult to get to usually have only one entrance and provide some degree of anonymity for the resident thus they present more difficult target for the terr orist or burglar and are often less expensive to modify with security hardware living in an ap artment provides benefit of close neighbors in for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 273 for official use only the event of an emergency and loss of communi cations neighbors can often be relied upon to provide assistance at the very least they can call the police if american occupants of apartments cannot c22203 the advantages of an apartment however are often offset by variety of disadvantages that should be consid ered when selecting residence c222031 normally apartments have lim ited number of accesses most commonly there is main entrance through lobby that leads to bank of elevators or an internal stairwell the lobbies elevators and stairwells many times are not secured and ar areas where robberies often occur secondary entrances are often found leading from park ing areas that may be located below ground level or to the rear of the apartment stairwells are often poorly lit and rarely secured c222032 common areas such as laundry ro oms meeting rooms storage rooms and parking garages which provide access to apartm ent areas are usually not secured and could provide access to criminals or terrorists c222033 because many families share the same building strangers have access to the building and it is difficult to challenge their presence c222034 many newer apartments have been built of fire resistant materials reducing the threat of fire however this has eliminated the need for fire escapes as well and limiting routes the occupant can take in the event of an emergency retreat from the apartment on the other hand the presence of fire escape provides an ternate means of access for the intruder c222035 to provide the apartment dwelle r an opportunity to get outdoors without leaving the immediate confines of his apartment newer apartments usually have balconies that are often ideally suited to allow access to an intruder who may crawl across from another balcony or lower himself from higher balcony in many cases the security hardware found on doors leading to these balconies is less than desirable c222036 cooperative compound is the next most secure type of residential housing complex common in many overseas areas number of separate homes are clustered in the same general area american or other foreign families often occupy these such arrangements offer excellent opportunities for c ooperative security rrangements these enclaves may or may not be fenced and the families may share the costs for guards lighting systems and alarm systems described in the preceding chapte r on physical security arrangements for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 274 for official use only c222037 separate residence in subur ban neighborhood can be adequately secured but is vulnerable to intrusion the same can be sa id for single family dwelling in an isolated environment c22204 apartment selection suggestions the following features of apartment living are recommended as part of good security foundation for private residence c222041 features lobby and parking area curity provided by guards closed circuit television or locking devices which can only be operated by the tenants c222042 does not have fire escapes balcon ies or overhangs that could be used to gain surreptitious entry to the building if fire escapes and ba lconies exist they should be properly installed and include in trusion detection or other curity systems to preclude unauthorized access c222043 have only one door for general ingr ess and egress and one door for services and deliveries both have controlled access via guards keys or keycard devices c222044 has well lit hallways and stairwells preferably m onitored by closed circuit television which cannot conceal intruders c222045 although most families usually prefer apartments on higher levels apartments should not be selected above the third floor unless the building has minimum of two completely enclosed fire resistive emergency cape stairwells because most fire department ladder trucks do not reach above the eighth floor do not select an apartment above this level unless the building has minimum of three complete ly enclosed fire resistive emergencyescape stairwells complete fire alarm and detection system inst alled throughout the building is also preferred c222046 if adequate security measures ar not present apartment living affords the opportunity to provide necessary security at reasonable price as shared expense c22205 single family home selection suggestions c222051 although welldesigned and wellma naged apartment is more secure than separate house there are often other reasons th at result in the selection of singlefamily residence by dodaffiliated personnel need for three or four bedrooms to accommodate children or other dependents an exercise area for pets or large areas for official entertaining are examples of considerations that may eliminate an apartment as residential choice for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 275 for official use only c222052 the main ingredient to be used in selecting single dwelling residence is finding an established residential developmen t or neighborhood where income levels and lifestyles are compatible neighbors routinely looki ng out for each other are critical factor in wellprotected residential area good overview of the entire neighborhood such as streets sidewalks lighting home is necessary each of these features affects the security of the neighborhood and therefore the natural protection afforded the residence c222053 in selecting singlefamily residen ce seek out residences with the following characteristics c2220531 has architectural and natural features that provide opportunities for occupants to observe activities on the street th sidewalks adjacent rds and public areas c2220532 is placed in the neighborhood ch that neighbors shall readily observe stranger or potential intruder c2220533 is situated within clearl defined boundaries making an inadvertent intrusion virtually impossible c22206 apartment security enhancements c222061 the apartment should possess good solid door and the doorframe should be well constructed most resi dential security hardware that is suitable for singlefamily dwellings is also suitable for apartments most essential of these is 190degree optical viewer and strong secondary deadbolt ck in the absence of fire escape there are variety of devices sold commercially that sh all facilitate exiti ng an apartment from window the devices include rope or chain ladders nd mechanical rope slings that pr ovide controlled descent to the ground c222062 additional security measures employed in singlefamily residences described below can be added to apartments as well if necessary c22207 singlefamily residence security enhancements most of the common enhancements to single family residence secur ity focus on improving resi stance to intrusion and penetration following the general approach pr esented above with respect to enhancing the security of an installation or faci lity consider the following measures c222071 ensure barrier that clearly lineates the property from adjacent homes surrounds the singlefamily residence an aestheti cally acceptable barrier ch as picket fence can provide good psychological dete rrent to intrusion other fenc ing materials such as split for official use only dod o200012h february 2004 276 for official use only rail boardonboard decorative wi re mesh decorative walls constr ucted of masonry or stone can serve the same purpose c222072 ensure all perimeter barrier penetr ations greater than 10 inches in diameter are secured the perimeter barrier should be designed and constructed such all barrier penetrations in excess of 10 inches in diameter can be closed locked ga ted or otherwise secured against human penetration the mechanisms used to secure such pene trations should be comparable in their resistance to penetration as the perimeter barrier itself c222073 increase the resistance of doors windows and exterior walls to penetration c22208 common security enhancements for residences c222081 do not leave utility connectio ns including telephone terminal boxes electrical service wiring potable water connections natural gas conn ections etc accessible from the exterior of the house consider relocating u tility service or placing the utility connections inside secured enclosures to prevent tamperi ng or unauthorized access add internal backup systems such as batteries bottled gas and tw oway radios consider finding an alternative residence as well c222082 select residential structure that is not vulnerable to fire residences should be constructed from materials that are not read ily combustible furthermore electrical wiring and fixtures as well as and natu ral gas andor propane ovens ra nges water heaters and other appliances should be in good condition be

perform seve ral functions such as establishing boundaries and deterring and intimidating individuals from atte mpting unlawful or unauthorized entry barriers become platforms on which more sophisticated sens ors can be placed to aid in threat detection and classification some barriers at the perimete r of dod installations help shield activities within the installation from immediate direct observation c2312 barriers are also used at the perimeter of dod installations to facilitate pedestrian and vehicle ingress and egress control barrier use channels traffic through designated access control points where pedestrians vessels and vehicles can be monitored and searched for contraband explosives or other th reats as circumstances warrant c2313 barriers are used with in individual buildings on do d installations for similar purposes in addition use of highsecurity doors window glazing and walls can provide building occupants with protec tion against ballistic penetra tions small arms fire bomb fragments and broken glass c2314 table c23t1 presents list of both natural and manmade barriers of potential interest to security program planners table c23t1 security

ballisticresistant glazing c232 installation perimeter barriers c2321 general guidelines c23211 the first line of defense in any phys ical security system is usually some form of perimeter protection system the perimeter of facility is the outermost area that the facility owner has control in many cases simple sign defining an intangible boundary is sufficient to delimit the boundary of dod installation this pproach is often used where the expanse of the facility makes physical demarcation impossible or economically infeasible in other cases elaborate structures such as fe nces or walls are used to mark the outer boundary of dod installation the following discussion is intende d to introduce the range of options available c23212 an unobstructed area or clear zone should be maintained on both sides of and between permanent physical barriers c23213 perimeter protection systems can assu wide range of forms in addition to fences and walls waterways forestations ditc hes berms barricades ve hicle barriers active and passive difficult approaches or exit routes and lighting syst ems are often used effectively in perimeter barrier systems an ids should be considered for the exteri or perimeter to provide the earliest possible notification nd identification of an intrusion for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 281 for official use only c2322 permanent structures c23221 several permanent structures can be used as perimeters around an entire dod installation around enclaves with in dod installation or around an isolated building used solely to house dod activities the followi ng paragraphs describe some of the favored approaches c23222 generally walls and fences provide less than 15 seconds of penetration resistance and cannot be relied on for more than very minimal delay perimeter walls and fences can serve many other functions walls and fences are primarily used to accomplish one or more of the following c232221 provide legal boundary by defi ning the outermost limit of protected area c232222 assist in controlling and scr eening authorized entr ies into protected area c232223 support detection assessm ent and other security function c232224 cause an intruder to make an overt action that shall demonstrate intent to penetrate the protected area c232225 serve as ballistic shield against small arms fire deny visual observation of activities being conducted within the enclosed area and add an increased deterrence to scaling c232226 channel visitors through an opening providing better access control c232227 create standoff distance to protect against bomb blast overpressure effects c23223 wellconstructed perimeter security wall c23224 walls of lesser construction may be worthwhile physical security system additions to dod or us government installations at home or abroad c23225 in using exterior walls to enhan ce security several considerations must be addressed c232251 walls should be positioned far enough away from other structures such as trees telephone poles antenna masts or ad jacent structuresthat may be used as aids to circumvent the barrier for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 282 for official use only c232252 walls should be built in location such that vehicles cannot park immediately adjacent to them thereby affording potential intruders platform from which to mount an attack c232253 additional toppings on walls should be considered these include concertina wire picket fences multiplestrand razo r or barbed wire and other devices to inhibit efforts to vault or go over the top of the wall c232254 bollards or other barricades can be used to establish permanent or temporary barriers to control ve hicle access while allowing pedest rian traffic to flow freely c23226 fences are frequently used to tablish boundaries between perimeter of an installation and its surrounding area fences par ticularly at military facilities are typically standard metal chainlink fences barbed wi re and field fencing are often found at major installations and overseas as well as wood fences c23227 chain link or woven metal mesh fences can be used to establish an outer perimeter chain link fences are excellent plat forms on which to mount surveillance systems and intrusion detection devices c23228 chain link or woven metal mesh fe nces can be stiffened and made somewhat more resistant to penetration by vehicles through seve ral techniques vertical support posts can be installed at 4foot intervals in stead of 8 or 9foot intervals aircraft arresting cables can be installed parallel to the ground at 6 inches and then 30 inch above the ground these techniques can increase the resistance to vehi cle penetration offered by such fences thereby adding to the dela in penetration c23229 chain link fences can be topped w ith concertina wire razor wire or multiple strands of barbed wire such toppings can be usef ul in adding to the psychological barrier effect of fence but are not likely to increase substant ially the amount of dela in penetration to the facility c232210 the use of picket fences especial ly those made of tal are discouraged because fence components can become significant hazard from flying debris their negative blast characteristics may exceed their positive physical deterrence value c2323 temporary barriers c23231 vegetation hedges and natural vegetation ar both economical and aesthetic and blend into their surroundings they provide symbolic but practic delineation of the for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 283 for official use only property line unless hedges are th ick and covered with thorns or pointed leaves they can be easily breached once breached they can provi some degree of cover from exterior observation the main disadvantages of hedges ar the time required to grow them to sufficient size especially if portion dies and their continuing requ irement for periodic maintenance they are more suitable for residences than offi ce buildings however hedges can be used in either situation when appropriate c23232 portable fencing c232321 portable fencing can be used as temporary perimeter to establish psychological barriers and to channe l pedestrian and vehicle movement c232322 several portable fencing mate rials are available among the materials available on the commercial market are the following c2323221 plastic netting c2323222 rolled wooden slat or support wire fencing snow fencing c2323223 fixed panels of chai nlink fencing materials supported by temporary posts anchored with cinder bl ocks or other stab ilizing materials c2323224 fixed panels of board onboard wooden plank fencing or wooden stockade fencing supported by temporary posts anc hored with cinder blocks or other stabilizing materials c232323 other materials available within the department of defense that can be used as portable fences include the following c2323231 coils of concertina wire c2323232 canvas panels supported by tent posts c2323233 plastic sheeting mate rials supported by tent posts c23233 temporary walls or rigid barriers several temporary devices can be employed to establish barriers ag ainst highspeed vehicle approach to dod installations and facilities these structures can be installed along approaches to dod installations or facilities within an installations boundaries to force vehicles to make tight slow turns before approaching gates or building entrances these structures can also be used as mporary barriers to deny access provided additional barriers are placed in front of areas to deny highspeed vehicle penetrations among the device s available are the following for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 284 for official use only c232331 concrete vehicle barriers jersey barriers c232332 concrete or sandfilled oil drums c232333 concrete bollards or planters c232334 steel or steelreinforced concrete posts c232335 sand or waterfilled plastic vehicle barriers jersey barriers c2324 expedient perimeter devices c23241 under certain circumstances it may be necessary to establish perimeter for psychological purposes c23242 to mark perimeter the following materials can be used c232421 painted line c232422 rope cloth rope steel cable chain etc c232423 colored plastic tape commercially available products come in multiple colors and are without letteri ng or contain warnings such as caution construction area danger or police linedo not cross c232424 line of sandbags one or two bags high c232425 saw horses empty oil drums construction barricades etc c232426 jersey barriers or concrete vehicle barrier segments c23243 the purpose of establishing such pe rimeters is usually to channel movement by pedestrians and vehicles as an aid to threat detection us of expedient perimeters can establish security zones within an installation or facili ty thereby facilitating threat identification classification and assessment use of some expedient perimeter devices can add delay to movement within an installati on or facility channeling vehicl and pedestrians through choke points slowing movement and giving security personnel additional time to survey and assess pedestrians and vehicles as they appr oach and proceed through checkpoints c23244 under some circumstances use of expedient perimeters can delay pedestrian threats by changing the configuration of an appro ach to building erecti ng trip wire barriers in front of doors to be secured after hours or in stalling waterfilled oil drums in random pattern along vehicle or pedestrian approach to buildi ng can disorient or impede an intruder who has for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 285 for official use only been unable to make lastmoment observations on changes to the approaches to the targeted dod asset c23245 vehicles in all sizes and configurations can also be used as expedient barriers parked bumpertobumper vehicles provide an effective barrier to personnel engaged in routine activity most people shall not attempt to vault line of vehicles parked such that their bumpers touch nor shall they usually attempt to pass unde rneath such line rge constructiontype vehicles or armored vehicles can be very ffective as supplemental barriers behind gates to installations or faciliti vehicles parked randomly on open st raight expanses of road aircraft taxiways or runways can in terfere with unauthorized use of those facilities c233 vehicle barriers c2331 vehicle barriers systems in recent years all agencies and departments of the us government have taken active meas ures to restrict the ability of explosivecarrying vehicles to reach buildings housing government personnel the destruction of the khobar towers complex in dhahran saudi arabia in 1996 as well as the bombing of the us embassies in nairobi kenya and dar salaam tanzania in 1998 eff ectively sensitized the department of defense to the need for vehicle barriers to hold potential threats away from critical structures the dos is responsible for the approval of ve hicle barriers and maintains da tabase of approved barriers vehicle barriers are available in several different systems th following are several types of systems c23311 active barrier systems barrier systems are considered active if they require action by personnel or equipment to permit entry systems that move solid masses beams gates tire shredders and fences nd those that create pits or ramp s are active barriers vehicles trucks bulldozers etc are active barriers if us ed in that mode in the access control system c23312 passive barrier systems barrier systems are passive if their effectiveness relies on their bulk or mass and they have mo ving parts such syst ems typically rely on weight to prevent entry into restricted area sandbags highway medians jersey barriers angled posts tires and guardrails are examples of passive barrier systems c23313 fixed barrier systems barrier systems are fixed if they are permanently installed or if heavy equipment is required to move or dismantle the barriers hydraulically operated rotation or retracting systems pits and c oncrete or steel barriers are examples fixed barrier systems can be either active or passive for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 286 for official use only c23314 movable barrier systems may be tr ansferred from place to place they may require heavy equipment or personnel to assist in the transfer highw ay medians sandbags large numbers 55gallon drums fille d or vehicles are typical examples c23315 portable barrier systems are used as temporary barriers movable system can be used but may take more time money and effort than desired examples of portable barriers are ropes chains cables ve hicles or tirepuncture systems c23316 expedient barrier systems comprise one or more articles or vehicles normally used for other purposes that have been presse d into use on temporary or interim basis examples of expedient barrier systems are th use of heavy earthmoving or engineering equipment armored personnel carriers or tanks as perimeter gates or perimeter gate barriers c2332 vehicle barrier design considerations c23321 location vehicle barriers can be locate d in different areas facility entrances enclave entry points gates or select ed interior locations that is entrances to restricted areas headquarters and other primary gathering facil ities exact locations vary among installations however in each case the barrier should be located as far from the critical resource as practical when possible gates and perimeter boundary fences should be positioned outside the blast vulnerability envelope or repositioned within the installation to more secure area it is more costeffective to secure sp ecific critical resource than an entire facility consolidating critical resources into one central area may height security but is also reduces the number of target areas for the aggressor to attack c23322 aesthetics the overall appearance of ve hicle barrier plays an important role in its selection and acceptan ce many barriers are now made with aesthetics in mind so that fortress effect can be avoided c23323 safety vehicle barrier system should be respected as tool capable of wielding deadly force even wh properly installed to perform its intended purpose it can kill or seriously injure individuals as result of acc idental or inadvertent activation caused by either operator error or equipment malfun ction proper warning signs light s bells and adequate colors should be provided to identify th barrier to ensure personnel safety further specific employment instructions and opera tor training is essential qu estions such as the following should be addressed to manufacturer s and current users to identify pot ential safety considerations affecting the selection of barrier system wh at happens when power is lost is there an emergency stop switch is lighting adequate wh at safety options are available from the for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 287 for official use only manufacturer once installed vehicle barriers should be wellmarked nd pedestrian traffic channeled away from unsafe areas c23324 reliability many vehicle barrier systems ve not been in production long enough to have developed reliability history some systems are placed in environments not envisioned by the manufacturer while others ve developed problems not anticipated by either the manufacturer or the user many manufacturer s indicate remarkable willingness to resolve problems and work effectively with users back up generators or manual operating provisions are available spare parts and supplie s also should be maintained on hand to facilitate ra pid return of the barriers to full operation c23325 maintainability many manufacturers provide aesthetics diagrams maintenance schedules and procedures for their systems they should also have spare parts available to keep barriers in nearly conti nuous operation manufacturers should be asked for maintainability requirements in the form of training operation and maintenance manuals if these requirements are not available the agency that purchases the vehicle barrier must develop maintenance instructions for the user in addition for periods of vehicle barrier maintenance the user should consider providi ng alternate traffic routes c23326 cost traffic in restricted or sensitiv areas should be minimized and the number of entryways limited reducing traffic flow and the number of entryways may provide increased security and lowered costs for the vehicl barrier system instal lation costs that may be excessive and the cost of operating the sy stem should be addre ssed during the barrier selection process complexity and lack of st andardized components can incur higher costs for maintenance and create long costly downtim periods reliabilit availability and maintainability data on the system also affect costs c23327 active barrier operations barrier is active if it requires action by personnel or equipment to operate it should allow for continuous operation with minimal maintenance and downtime so that it may be employed during normal and emergency conditions emergency procedures must be available to operate the barrier in case of system breakdown or power failure selection of normally open or closed option shou ld be evaluated in lig ht of experienced or expected traffic evaluate system failure modes to ensure that the barrier fails in either the open or closed position as dictated by security and operation consid erations barrier employment criteria should be linked to use of force and or rules of engagement training for security personnel for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 288 for official use only c23328 clear zones barriers installed in clear zones must be designed so that they shall not provide terrorists with protective hiding place or shield c23329 operating environment the environment of the facility must be considered when selecting vehicle barrier or barrier options hinges hydraulics or surfaces with critical tolerances may require heaters to resist freezing temperatures and ice buildup or they may require protection from dirt and debris if options that protect against environmental conditions are not available the system may become inoperative c233210 installation requirements the vehicle barrier selected must be compatible with the location in which it is installed the available power sour ce and its reliability and other security equipment protection of primary and alternate power sources and hydraulics must be considered c233211 operator training most users recommend operator training regardless of the simplicity of the system operator training pr events serious injury and legal liability as well as equipment damage caused by improper syst em operation manufacturers do not always provide information on possible op erator problems the user ma have to develop individual checklists for normal and emergency operating procedures to avoid experiencing serious problems c233212 manufacturer options manufacturers offer additi onal features with their systems in the form of options or optional equipment some options enhance system performance while others facilitate maintenance or safety options increase system cost and may increase maintenance requirements because options vary among manufacturers each company should be consulted to determine whic h options are offered and their cost c2333 other vehicle barrier considerations the following should also be considered when assessing vehicle barri er requirements and options c23331 avoid installing sunken undergroun d barriers unless th excavation can be drained water collection shall cause corrosi on and freezing weather may incapacitate the system c23332 avoid providing vehicle barrier s at entrance gates without providing equivalent protection along the pe rimeter of the protected area for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 289 for official use only c23333 avoid expending large amounts of funding for soft protection of the installation perimeter it is generally more costeffective to provi heavy protection of individual buildings or z ones within the perimeter c23334 avoid providing perimeter vehicle barri ers that are not patrolled or frequently observed most types can be overcome qui ckly with simple tools or ramps c23335 avoid placing guard posts next to barriers c23336 if separate barriers are used for ex its and entrances avoi d controlling only the entrance while leaving the exit barrier open require positive contro l for the exit also c23337 avoid long straightaway road to crashresistant barrier system where this cannot be avoided provide passivetype barri er maze to slow traffic prior to arrival at the vehicle barrier figure c23f1 illustrates moving vehicle

control as previously discussed vehicle barriers should be placed outside the installation perimeter or outside an installation interior perimeter the following discu ssion addresses vehicle access to an installation or facility once the vehicle is past the vehicle barri ers described above c2341 installation vehicl access control measures c23411 restrict installati on vehicle entryexit points to minimum to maximize traffic flow and economize physical security re quirements only two regularly used vehicular entryexit points are necessary both should be similarly constructed and monitored the use of the entry points should be dictated by the size of the vehicles requiring entry this shall compliment the employment of vehicle barriers and other physical and procedural security requirements in advanced security postures one entry point should be designed to accommodate large andor oversized vehicles and the other for normal sized vehicle traffic for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 291 for official use only where possible tertiary gate can be planne d for contingencies depending on the size and nature of the facility gate for emergency vehi cular and pedestrian egress should be installed outside the perimeter to increase the setback of the buildings in ei ther case design and placement of bollards or other an tivehicular devices should be considered in the early planning stages c23412 protect all vehicle access points against reverse entry and ramming attacks all entryexit points should be secured with heavyduty sliding steel iron or heavily braced chainlink gate equipped with heavy locking vice approaches to all vehicle exit points should be aligned such that highspeed approach from outside the perimeter is not possible the goal of such realignment is to ensure to th maximum degree possible that intruders cannot simply enter the facility by going against the flow of exiting vehicle traf fic passive vehicle barriers described above can be incorporated into the road an d pedestrian access designs to accomplish this goal c23413 all entryexit points should be c onstructed with protection against ramming vehicle attack passive vehicle barriers described above can be incorporated in ingressegress designs to make ramming attacks difficult ve hicle perimeter penetration gates can also be designed to be highly resistant to ramming attac k additional vehicle barriers can be installed behind the gates to provide defense in depth against such attack c23414 all gates not in use and under dir ect supervision should be locked it should be verified that only security personnel could operate the lock s emergency gates should be securely locked and randomly checked during ach shift security personnel should physically lock and relock all gates or othe r penetrations secured with locks to verify that the locks in use belong to the security department and not some other activity on the in stallation or wouldbe intruders any lock found inoperable by the s ecurity personnel should be removed immediately and security department lock substituted in its place control over keys is essential c23415 storage lanes protected guard pos itions and hard points for security guard booths should be included on plans for revised vehicle access to permit multiple vehicle inspections for explosives weapons or cont raband outside the installation perimeter c234151 some of the measures impleme nted at dod facilities in response to terrorist threat may result in si gnificant traffic congestion at vehi cle entry gates such congestion can be reduced if storage lanes can be included in installation access alignments during periods of rigorous vehicle inspection s ecurity personnel can inspect vehi cles and their occupants in for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 292 for official use only groups vehicles waiting their rn for inspection can be held in storage lanes ad jacent to the installation this approach to vehicle inspection and insta llation access shall ease traffic congestion for those not seeking access to the dod installation it shall also place vehicles and their operators waiting inspection in an area where they can be monitored for indications of potentially threatening behavior c234152 be sure that vehicle barriers storage lanes secu rity booth tie down points and protected positions for backup security fo rces are considered as an integrated security package doing so shall ensure that vehicle barrie rs do not obstruct fields of vision or fields of fire for the backup security forces responsib for protecting guar ds conducting vehicle inspections c2342 vehicle access control systems c23421 primary entrances to facility should have booth for security personnel during peak traffic periods and automated system s for remote operations during other periods vehicle search bay exterior to the access control gate and confi gured to inhibit damage from explosive laden vehicles is optimal c23422 the following capabilities are recommended for vehicle access control systems c234221 electrically operated gates to be activated by security personnel at either the booth or security control center or by badge reader located in convenient place for driver c234222 cctv with the capability of di splaying the fullfacial features of driver and vehicle characteristics on m onitor at the security control center c234223 an intercom system located in convenient place for driver to communicate with the gatehouse an d security control center c234224 bollards or other elements to protect the security booth and gates against car crash c234225 sensors to activate the gate to detect vehicles approaching and departing the gate to activate cctv monitor displaying the gate and to

low and dense shrubbery fences and walls c23423 vehicle perimeter access barriers an d gates should be controlled by key card or remote operation by the central security office when the gatehouse is not staffed an intercom and cctv camera with lowlight and area scan ca pability should be provided to facilitate communication between the central security office and personnel in vehicles seeking entry when the access point is closed th access point should be sufficiently illuminated such that all vehicle occupants can be seen via cctv systems c23424 overwatch vehicle entry control points cps with weak or nonexistent barriers should be augmented at higher fpcons with an overwatch posi tion the overwatch for an ecp is manned position that provides obser vation and the ability to employ deadly force against vehicles that attempt to bypass ram or otherwise run through an ecp the overwatch should be equipped with weapon that can stop ve hicle by disabling it or killing the driver this weapon should be smaller than 762mm medium machine gun rules of engagement and command and control between the overwatch position and the ecp must be planned in detail c2343 perimeter security office booth c23431 at the vehicular entryexit secu rity officer booth should be constructed to control access at facilities not having perime ter walls the security officer booth should be installed immediately inside the facility foyer c23432 the security officer booth should be completely protected with reinforced concrete walls ballistic doors and ballisti c windows the booth should be equipped with security officer duress alarm and intercom system both annunciating at the facility receptionist and security officers office this security officer would also be responsible for complete operation of the vehicle gate if necessary pa ckage inspection and visi tor screening may be conducted just outside of the perimeter security officer booth by an unarm ed security officer equipped with walkthrough and handheld metal tectors provisions for environmental and personal comfort should be cons idered when designing the booth for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 294 for

perimeter fences to thos composed of little more than aesthetically attractive landscaping c23512 exterior ids sensors are not recommended for the perimeter protection system of most office buildings unless personnel and vehicle access is to be controlled at the perimeter entrance gate or th building is required to be secured during nonduty hours to protect sensitive assets where acces s control is to be administered at the entrance gate exterior sensors should be activated around the remai nder of the perimeter during working hours c23513 when ids sensors are installe d around the perimeter cctv should be utilized in support of ids to allow re mote assessment of alarm activation c2352 exterior doors limit the number of doors to the bare minimum necessary for emergency evacuation ideally permit normal entry and egress through only one door because of their functional requ irements construction and methods of attachment doors are less attack resistant than adjacent walls and frequently provide soft spot in an otherwise attackresistant structure for this reason the number of doors to facility or residence should be reduced to an absolute minimum and in cases where more th an one door exist only one should be provided with outsidemounted locks and entry hardware all others should wher practicable present blank flush surfaces to the outside to reduce their vulnerability to attack c2353 windows windows of various sizes and confi gurations are required in the walls of most structures for the passage of light ventilation and observati on windows are always significant weak points in an in dividual facility protection system because of their low penetration resistance further window glazi ng represents significant flying debris hazards from an explosive blast special precautions should be taken to harden windows from both penetration and blast c2354 utility access careful inspection of the struct ures exterior must be made to locate any utility openings in conventi onal building designs u tility openings manholes tunnels airconditioning ducts fi lters or equipment access panels can provide vulnerable entrance route with significant delay if such openings cannot be elimin ated their delay times must be increased security screens or grates can be installed over utility access openings the for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 295 for official use only techniques described to secure window or skylig ht using bars grates or mesh can be used to restrict access to structur via utility penetrations c2355 duress alarms duress alarms are devices that can be activated manually in the event of an unauthorized penetration attempt an audible alarm can be sounded locally in an attempt to frighten off the intruder silent alar m can also be sent to th organizations security center or other location where the alarm would summon immediate assistance duress alarms can be placed in inconspicuous locations and can even be disguised as common office objects or home decorations duress alarms can also be incorporated into home or office furnishings c2356 communication systems telephones are needed at all times and secure means of communication are essential be tween secured area and its dedicated response force telephones in many parts of the world are unava ilable unreliable and as in many conus locations exposed and vulnerable to terrorist ttacks the security planner often has little knowledge and control over where or how the lephone lines are routed or whether they are even minimally secured telephone systems re quired for security and safety of executive personnel must use secure dedicated lines wh ere this is not possible secure radio communication link must be established port able handheld radios can assure backup communication when other commun ication links are severed c2357 ids as discussed earlier in this chapter incorpor ation of ids into the overall physical security system shall help to mitigate the vulnerabilities identified above c236 interior barriers c2361 barriers may be used within the interior of facilities to accomplish the same functions as are performed by an installations access barriers interior barriers establish boundaries or lines of demarcation of different activities and differi ng levels of security within facility they deter and intim idate individuals from attempti ng unauthorized entry as in the case of installationlevel barriers they are pl atforms on which intrusi on detection sensors or surveillance systems can be mounted barriers may be used within facility to channel pedestrian and service vehicle traffic c2362 barriers are used with in individual buildings on do d installations for similar purposes in addition use of highsecurity doors window

of material s and construction tec hnique is constrained by the strength and loadbearing capacity of the f acility itself the specific construction site conditions may also constrain or limit barrier construc tion within facility the requirement to access utility lines fireprotection systems or specific emergency ingress or egress routes may dictate use of movable barriers as opposed to fixed anchored barrier s perceived terrorist threat capabilities construction costs local building codes and limita tions on tenant construction for leased facilities also constrain or limit the sel ection of materials and type s of barrier construction undertaken the following discussion identifies selection of mate rials and techniques that may be appropriate for enhancing the secu rity and protection

at any location and may take many forms an understanding of the range of threat possibilitie s especially type of aggressor tactics and asso ciated weapons tools or explosives is essentia l to design appropriate protective measures for many reasons dod personnel are at increasi ng risk of harm from terrorism while terrorists have many options available to them they frequently use explosive devices when they target large numbers of dod personnel many buildings dod personnel utilize daily are inadequate to protec t against such attacks in order to mitigate this risk dod decisionmake rs can longer

should they occur for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 305 for official use only c2425 building design strategies the philosophy of at build ing standards is to build greater resistance to terr orist attack into all inhabited buildin gs in general the majority of terrorist incident deaths result from building coll apse progressive failure and severe injuries occur because of flying debris especially gla ss building design has traditionally emphasized aesthetics and openness the more glass the bette r protecting occupant s from standard loads people equipment building walls and floors during normal operations anticipated naturally occurring events snow cold heat hurricanes an d earthquakes and limited criminal activity theft available construction methods and mate rials to appropriately m itigate terrorist threats are only starting to influence cu rrent construction practices ccordingly the primary methods to achieve this outcome are to maximize standoff distance to construct perstructures to avoid progressive collapse and to reduce flying debris hazards the design strategies identified below work together to help focus synchronize and in tegrate available personnel and resources so that effective measures can be identified implemented and refined for each inst allation and activity c24251 maximize standoff distance site planning the best way to reduce the risk of harm from explosive effects due to terrorist attack is to keep terrorists as far away from inhabited buildings as possible however even with adequate space standoff must be coupled with appropriate operational security procedures in order to be effective allowances for standoff distance also provide opport unities to upgrade buildings in the future to meet increased threats or to accommodate hi gher levels of protection c24252 prevent building collapse structural design even when large explosion causes extensive damage to structural elemen ts of building proper selection of building systems and careful design and detailing can he lp minimize the extent of major damage provisions relating to preventi ng building collapse and building component failure for taller structures go farthest to protect the lives of bu ilding occupants in addition structural systems that provide greater continu ity and redundancy among structural components shall help limit collapse in the event of severe structural damage from unpredictable terrorist acts c24253 minimize hazardous flying debris architectural design in past explosive events where there was building collapse hi gh number of injuries resulted from flying glass fragments and debris from walls ceilings and fixtures nonstructural features the glass used in most windows breaks at very low blast pressu res resulting in hazardous daggerlike shards minimizing those hazards has major effect on limiting mass casualtie s and increasing the chance that building occupants can immediately evacuate after the in itial shock in addition to limiting the size and number of windows of individual buildings where possible window and for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 306 for official use only door designs must treat glazing frames connections and the st ructural components to which they are attached as an integrated system laminated glass and other glass technology advancements can be designed to reduce flying glass injuries hazardous fragments may also include secondary debris such as those from concrete barriers and site furnishings c24254 provide effective buil ding layout architectural design effective design of building layout and orientati on can significantly reduce opportuni ties for terrorists to target building occupants or injure large number s of people in the event of an attack c24255 limit airborne contaminati on electrical and mechanical design effective design of heating ventilation and air conditioning systems can significantly reduce the potential for chemical biological and radi ological agents bei ng distributed througho ut buildings should they be used only fully functioning collectiv eprotection shelter can provide total protection systems should be turned off to reduce or elimin ate contaminants from spreading if detected c24256 provide mass tification general design providing timely means to notify building occupants of threat s and what should be done in re sponse to those threats reduces the risk of mass casualties this strategy can be implemented using fairly lowtech well practiced procedures however in practice this strategy is extremely difficult for most installations and buildings to achieve c24257 facilitate future upgrades general design many of the provisions of these standards facilitate opportunities to upgrade bui lding protective measures in the future if the threat environment changes c2426 assumptions all plans are based on key assump tions that must be identified made explicit and understood if the personnel re quired to execute them are to recognize when the changing threat environment or realities at particular location differ emerging information that challenges the baseline assumptions upon which protective measures are based must be reviewed to ensure updated information is appr opriately addressed several general assumption categories are listed below c24261 threat as shown in figure c24f1

weaponstoolsexplosives cbrne c24262 levels of protection situations vary but the degree to which an asset is protected against injury or damage from an attack must be decided ufc 401001 reference aw prescribes levels of protection for new existing and expeditionary temporary construction for example the dod standards provide low level of protection for billeting and primary gathering buildings and very low level of pr otection for other inhab ited buildings greater protection is desired for primar gathering buildings and bill eting because of the higher concentration of personnel and the more attractive nature of the target c24263 controlled perimeter installation and buildi ng at plans and related protective measures are based on assumptions as to whether procedures are implemented that would limit the likelihood that ve hicle or other mode of transpor t carrying specific quantities of explosives could penetrate controlled perime ter undetected similarly provisions to reject vehicles at entry control point s without penetrating the controlled perimeter must also be reviewed c24264 building categories an assessment of installation assets shall determine which buildings may require higher level of prot ection or which may be adequately protected individual buildings are constructe d of variety of materials that influence appropriate protective measures expeditionary and temporary structures are commonly built in combinations of metal frames and fabric or wood frames and rigid walls all dod minimum at building standards that are unique to expeditionary and temporary stru ctures pertain to site planning operational logistic and security requirements must be integr ated in the overall conf iguration of structures equipment landscaping parking roads and other features the most costeffective solution to mitigating explosive effects on any structure is to k eep explosives as far away as possible most expeditionary and temporary struct ures cannot be

distances the ability to maintain an adequate distance between potential location for an explosive det onation and the closest point on the exterior of any inhabited building is key measure designed to safeguard personnel inside the buildings from terrorist attacks specific minimum st andoff distances were developed to provide survivable structures for wide range of c onventional buildings and expeditionarytemporary structures these buildings range from tents and wood framed build ings to reinforced concrete buildings reference aw illustrates specific at construction standard standoff requirements within controlled perimeter in the absence of controlled perimeter and for expeditionary and temporary structures ufc 401002 reference ax contains minimum standoff distances c2427 policies and procedures policies and procedures ar critical adjunct to any construction standard unless indicated otherwise it is usually assumed that there are means to control access to controlled perimeters undergro und parking and other locations where vehicle access should to be limited it may be further assumed that unusual packages or containers or improperly parked vehicles shall be recognized as potential terrorist th reats and appropriate reactive measures shall be implemented to reduce the potential for casualti finally it may be assumed that policies and procedures shall be veloped to support these nd other related issues and that those policies and proce dures shall be incorporated into antiterrorism plans training and exercises c2428 training although key to success it may not be safe to assume that key security and facility personnel shall receiv training in security engineer ing antiterrorism and related areas there are many sources for training ch as the security engineering working group website wwwsewgnwousacearmymil or this handbook several assumptions related to training include that all dod personnel have been trained in basic antiterrorism awareness in according to reference that they are able to recognize potential threat s and that they know the proper courses of action should they detect potential threat c2429 design codes while it is not easy to deconflic t every requirement that exists key assumption is that any provision in dod or local at construction standards shall be coordinated with all other appl icable building and design codes and federal building policies nothing in those standards shoul d be interpreted to supercede the provisions of any other applicable building or design code where other codes mandate more stringent requirements it is assumed that the provisions of those codes sh all be followed depending on the age existing for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 309 for official use only buildings do

terrorist attacks targe ting buildings or portions of buildings owned leased privatized or otherwise occupied mana ged or controlled by or for the department of defense these standards provide baseline level of protection in buildings much like sturdier car frame and safety glass enhances protection in moving car and are gene rally least costly to incorporate before construction while

execution the intent of these standards can be achieved through prudent master planning real estate acquisiti on and refined construction pr actices the master planning implications of these standards are not intende d to be resolved overnight they should be considered to be blueprint for facilities and in stallations that shall be implemented over decades as those facilities and installations

shall use the methodology to determine terrorist options against specific targets and us them as examples of protection strategies discussed in this handbook the suggested tools offered below ve their strengths and their weaknesses as with all tools there is right tool for the job at hand as an example carver is not specific ally tailored for at assessments although it can be used likewise msharpp is targeting analys is tool geared more clos ely to assessing personnel vulnerabilities assessment team members should be cognizant of potential gaps when choosing one methodology over another the use of the jo int staff cvamp shall assist commanders and atos in managing their commands vulnerabiliti and associated funding requirements ap22 msharpp ap221 the purpose of the msharpp matrix is to analyze likely terrorist targets consideration is given to the local threat like ly means of attack available to the enemy and variables affecting the dispositi on eg attractiveness to enemy potential psychological effect on community etc of potential targets this document provide s an example of how to use msharpp ap222 after developing list of potential ta rgets use the msharpp selection factors to assist in further refining your assessment by associ ating weapontactic to potential target to determine the efficiency effectiveness and plausi bility of the method of attack and to identify vulnerabilities related to the ta rget after the msharpp values for each target or component are assigned the sum of the values indicate the hi ghest value target for particular mode of attack within the limits of the enemys known capabilities ap223 mission mission focuses mainly on the thre at to the situations activities capabilities and resources on an installation that are vulnerable to terrorist attack the mission components consist of the equipment information facilities andor operati ons or activities that are necessary to accomplish the installations mission ap2231 when assessing

function occurring at that area to be restored considering the av ailability of resources parts expertise and manpower and redundancies ap2232 mission criteria scale assess points to the targ et equipment information facilities andor operations or act ivities scale of 15 5 being wo rst in this area based upon the degree of mission degradation if attacked by terrorist ap22321 one destroying or disrupting this asset would have effect on the ability of the installati on to accomplish its mission ap22322 two the installation could continue to carry out its mission if this asset were attacked albeit with so degradation in effectiveness ap22323 three half of the mission capability remains if the asset were successfully attacked ap22324 four ability to carry out primar mission of the installation would be significantly impaired if this asset were successfully attacked ap22325 five installation cannot continue to carry out its mission until the attacked asset is restored ap224 symbolism consider whether the target repr esents or is perceived by the enemy to represent symbol of targeted group eg symbolic of us military christianity government authority etc assess points in this area based upon the sy mbolic value of the target to the enemy ap2241 symbolism criteria scale ap22411 high profile direct symbol of target group or ideology asset is perceived to be vital to th mission of the installation ap22412 low profile direct sy mbol of target group or ideology ap22413 low profile andor obscure symbol of target group or ideology for official use only dod o200012h

history and capabilities ap2251 symbolism criteria scale ap22511 strong history of att acking this type of target ap22512 history of attacking this type of target but none in the immediate past ap22513 little to history of attacking this type of target ap226 accessibility target is accessible when an operational element can reach the target with sufficient personnel and equipmen t to accomplish its mission target can be accessible even if it requires the assistance of knowledgeable insiders th is assessment entails identifying and studying critical paths that the operat ional element must take to achieve its objectives and measuring those things that aid or impede access the enemy must not only be able to reach the target but must also remain there for an extended period ap2261 the four basic stages to cons ider when assessing accessibility are ap22611 infiltration from the staging base to the target area ap22612 movement from the point of entry to the ta rget or objective ap22613 movement to the targets critical element ap22614 exfiltration ap2262 accessibility criteria scale ap22621 easily accessible st andoff weapons can be employed ap22622 inside perimeter

operational element andor in telligence collection nd reconnaissance asset under varying conditions weather s an obvious and significant impact on visibility yours and the enemys rain snow and ground fog may obscu re observation road segments with sparse vegetation and adjacent high ground provide ex cellent conditions for good observation distance light and season must be considered other factors that in fluence recognizability include the size and complexity of the target the existence of distinctive target signatures the presence of masking or camouflage and the t echnical sophistication nd

from distance requires little or training for recognition ap22712 target is easily recognizable at smallarms range and requires small amount of training for recognition ap22713 target is difficult to recognize at night or in bad w eather or might be confused with other targets requires training for recognition ap22714 target cannot be recogni zed under any conditionsexcept by experts ap228 population population addressed two factors quantity of personnel and their demography demography asks the question w ho are the targets depending on the ideology of the terrorist group s being member of particular demographic group can make someone or some group more likely target ap2281 when assessing points in this ar ea determine whether or not the group s have history of or ar predicted to target ap22811 military personnel ap22812 family members us citizens in general ap22813 civilian employees of the u s government include local nationals ap22814 senior officers or other highrisk personnel ap22815 member of an ethnicity ra cial religious or regionally defined ap2282 quantity addresses the number of people that would become victims if particular target were attacked going on the as sumption the intent of the attack is to kill or injure personnel it follows that the more densely populated an area facility is the more lucrative target it makes all other things being equal ap2283 population criteria scale ap22831 densely populated prone to fre quent crowds facility routinely contains substantial numbers of personnel known to be targeted by the enemy an dor the population is comprised of personnel deemed vital to th accomplishment of the installations mission for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 324 for official use only ap22832 relatively large numbers of people but not in close proximity ie spread out and hard to reach in single attack cont ains known target group but rarely in large concentrations population has special segment necessary for mission accomplishment ap22833 sparsely populated prone to ving small groups or individuals little target value based on dem ographics of occupants ap229 proximity is the potential target located near other personnel facilities or resources that because of their intrinsic value or protected status nd fear of collateral damage afford it some form of protection g near national monument s protectedreligious symbols etc that the enemy holds in high regard ap2291 it is important to consider whethe r the target is in close proximity to other likely targets just as the risk of unwanted collateral damage may decrease the chances of attack targetrich environment may increase the chances of attack ap2292 proximity criteria scale ap22921 target is isolated chan ce of unwanted collateral damage to protected symbols or personnel ap22922 target is in close enough proximity to place protected personnel facilities etc at risk of inju ry or damage but not destruction ap22923 target is in close proximity serious injury dama ge or deathtotal destruction of protected pe rsonnelfacilities likely ap2210 figure ap2f1 is an example msharpp worksheet values from 1 to 5 are assigned to each factor based on th associated data for each target five represents the highest vulnerability or likelihood of attack and 1 the lowest accordi ngly the higher the total score the more vulnerable the target because this analysis is highly subjective some analysts prefer simple stoplight charts with red yellow and green markers representi ng descending degrees of vulnerability the msharpp analysis must consid er both the present fo rce protection posture and enhanced postures proposed for escalating fpc ons specific target vu lnerabilities must be combined with exploitable perimeter control

bridges and power plants it is believed that our enemies overt and covert employ sim ilar method to target our facilities they all though seek soft unprotected targets ap232 carver is very useful tool for determining that your critical assets might indeed offer an enemy good or soft target if you employ the very same carver analysis to every asset it shall yield good estimate as to th attractiveness of those assets to an enemy specifically commanders shall then know whic h targets require hardening or otherwise increased protection ap233 carver is an acronym with each letter representing the following ap2331 criticality the importance of system subsystem complex or component target is critical when its struction or damage has signifi cant impact on the output of the targeted system subsystem or complex and at the highest level on the units ability to make war or perform essential functions criticality depends on several factors ap23311 how rapidly shall the

terrorist element can physically infiltrate the asset or the asset can be hit by direct or indirect fire as reminder assets can be people places or things the use of standoff weapons should always be considered when evaluating accessibility survivability of the attacker is usually most relate d to targets accessibility accessibility asks the question how easily can an enemy get access to or have their weapons reach the asset ap2333 recuperability measure of time required to replace repair or bypass the destruction or damage inflicted on the target recuperability varies with the sources and ages of targeted components and with the availability of spare parts the existence of economic embargoes and the technical resources of the installation shall influence recuperability recuperability asks the question how long would it take you to repair or replace the asset ap2334 vulnerability measure of the ability of th terrorist to damage the target using available assets people and material ta rget asset is vulnerable if the terrorist has the means and expertise to successfully ttack it vulnerability depends on ap23341 the nature of the construction of the target ap23342 the assets

to addressing the local politicalsocial environment examples follow for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 349 for official use only 1 the installation is vulnerable to theft pilferage sabotage and other threats the installation is also vulnerable to wmd attack 2 an act of terrorism involvi ng wmd can produce major conseque nces that will overwhelm almost immediately the capabilities of the installation 3 security personnel both military and civilian may be insufficient to provide total protection of all installation resources therefore the principal owner or user of facility resource or personnel must develop adequate unit awareness and safeguard measures 4 single unit on the installation possesses the ex pertise to act unilaterally in response to wmd attacks 5 if protective equipment is not available responders will not put their own lives at risk 6 local nonmilitary response forces will arrive within time of notification 7 units specializing in wmd response will arrive onsite within number of hours based on installation location of notification 8 the hn is supportive of us policies and will fulfill surge requir ements needed to respond to wmd incident iaw moasmous f intelligence enter the person staff or unit responsible for intelligence collection and dissemination the installation commander must have system in place to access current intelligence this can be included in annex b intelligence nationallevel agencies combatant commanders and intelligence systems provide theater or country threat levels and threat assessments in the us and its territories local installations must obtain the local terrorist threat information by querying the fbi through the installations law enforcement liaison local law enforcement or other federal agenciesobtain these assessments as they will serve as baseline for the installations tailored assessment the installation should have process in place for developing the installations tailored threat assessment or local threat picture the installations tailored threat assessment should be continuously evaluated updated and disseminated as appropriate and as directed by the installation commander the commander should determine the frequency and the means of dissemination of the installations tailored at product note commanders cannot change the threat level which is developed at the nationallevel although they can declare higher fpcons than the baseline 2 mission enter clear concise statement of the command s mission and the at purpose or goal statement supporting the mission the primary purpose of the at plan is to safeguard personnel property and resources during normal operations it is also designed to deter rrorist threat enhance security and at awareness and to assign at responsibilities for installation personnel 3 execution commanders intent commanders vision on how heshe sees the execution of the units at program refer to service planning doctrine for assistance b concept of operations enter how the overall at operation should progress this plan stresses deterrence of terrorist incidents through preventive and response measures common to all combatant commands and services during daytoday operations the installation should stress continuous at planning and passive defensive operations this paragraph should provide subordinates sufficient guid ance to act if contact or communications with the installation chain of command is lost or disrupted 1 the installations at concept of operations shou ld be phased in relation to preincident actions and postincident actions at planning and execution requires that staff elements work with much greater degree of cohesiveness and unity of mission than that required during the conduct of normal base sustainment operations the for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 350 for official use only at mission and the unpredictability of its execution requires very specific how to implementation instructions of dod fpcon measures and in what manner these actions mu st be coordinated this how to element is not normally included in the concept of operations paragraph however the necessity to provide how to guidance in the at plan requires different manner of data presenta tion to ensure brevity and clarity the implementation instructions are put into the form of action sets and can be displayed in the form of an execution matrix preincident action set matrix 2 in postincident planning the installation should focus on its response and reconstitution responsibilities upon notification of terrorist inci dent and the procedures for obtaining technical assistanceaugmentation if the incident exceeds the inst allations organic capabilities nationallevel responders federal emergency management agency fema red cross and federal bureau of investigation fbi may not be immediately accessible or available to respond to an inst allations needs therefore each installation must plan for the worstcase scenario by planning its response based on its organic resources and available local support through moamous 3 the situation may dictate that the installation not only conduct the initial response but also sustained response operations many installations do not have onboard wmd officers or response elements this paragraph will include specific implementation instructions for all functional areas of responsibility and the manner in which these actions must be coordinated the implementation instructions can be put in the form of actions sets and displayed in the form of synchronization matrix p

provides guidance for commanders and atos to stress the importance of overt terrorist surveillance detec tion efforts by military police forces to deter terrorist surveillance activities ap712 the recent increase in reporting of spicious individuals conducting surveillance of us military and civilian sites in the ited states and overseas indicates possible pre operational targeting by terrorists and merits ttention by commanders at all levels the persistent stream of reports necessitates commanders and security planners to understand the purpose of terrorist surveillance know what terrorists look for and know how they conduct surveillance operations with this basic knowledg commanders can then implement protective countermeasures comply with dod standardized reporting procedures and in the end deter detect disrupt and defend agai nst future terrorist attacks ap72 terrorist surveillance ap721 vulnerability assessment terrorists conduct surveillan ce to determine targets suitability for attack by assessi ng the capabilities of existing s ecurity systems and discerning weaknesses for potential exploitati on terrorists closely examine security procedures such as shift changes access control and roving patrols ci tizenship of security guards models and types of locks presence of closedcircuit cameras and guard dogs after identifying weaknesses terrorists plan their attack options at the point or points of gr eatest vulnerability ap722 terrorist surveillance techniques the basic methods of surveillance are mobile and fixed or static ap7221 mobile surveillance entails active partic ipation by the terro rists or operatives conducting surveillance usually following as th target moves terrorists conduct mobile surveillance on foot in vehicl or by combining the two mobile surveillance usually progresses in phases from stakeout to pick up and then through follow phase until the target stops at this point operatives are positioned to cover logical routes to enable the surveillance to continue wh the target moves again for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 371 for official use only ap7222 terrorists conduct fixe d or static surveillance from one location to observe target whether person building facility or installation fixe d surveillance often requires the use of an observation point to maintain constant discreet observation of specific location terrorists establish observation pos ts in houses apartments offices stores or on the street mobile surveillance unit such as parked car or van can also serve as an observation post terrorists often park outside build ing facility or installation to observe routines of security and personnel coming and going terrorists also us various modes of transportation to include buses trains or boats or move by foot to approach and observe installations ap723 protective countermeasures ap7231 the incorporation of visible s ecurity cameras motion sensors working dog teams random roving security patrols varying size timing and routes irregular guard changes and active searches including xray machines and explosive detection devi ces of vehicles and persons at entry points shall improve facilities situational awareness an d present robust force protection posture that dramatically inhi bits terrorist surveillance efforts ap7232 the emplacement of barriers roadblocks and entry mazes that are covered by alert security forces shall provide additional deterrence as these measures increase standoff and improve security force reaction time in the event of an attack ap7233 the implementation of unannounced random security measures such as 100 percent identification of all personnel entering th facility or installa tion conducting inspections and searches of personnel and vehicles and visi ble displays of vehicles mounted with crew served weapons shall increase uncertainty and thus the risk of failure in the minds of terrorists ap724 surveillance detection because terrorists must c onduct surveillance often over period of weeks months or years detection of their activities is possibl regardless of the level of expertise terrorists i nvariably commit mistakes know ing what to look for and being able to distinguish the ordinary from the extr aordinary are keys to successful surveillance detection for these reasons ove rt surveillance detec tion in its most basic form is simply watching for persons observing personne l facilities and installations ap7241 the objectives of ove rt surveillance detection asures are to record the activities of persons behaving in suspicious manner and to provide this information in format useable by the appropriate law enforcement or intellig ence officials it is important to note that overt surveillance detection emphasizes the avoi dance of interpersonal confrontations with suspicious individuals unless exigent situat ions necessitate otherw ise depending upon the for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 372 for official use only circumstances or trends commande rs and senior law enforcement officials in coordination with intelligence experts through installa tion threat working groups may determine the need for more specialized covert countersurveillance meas ures to assure installation protection ap7242 for surveillance tection efforts to achieve positive results military policesecurity forces should immediately re port incidents of survei llance and suspicious activities by providing detailed desc riptions of the people the tim of day the locations the vehicles involved and the circumstances of the sightings to their respective criminal investigative services or counter intelligence elements for incor poration into reports such as usaf talon or the ncis suspicious incident report the incident reports are important pieces of information that over time combined with other similar sightings allow investigators to assess the level of threat agai nst specific facility insta llation or geographic region ap7243 the emphasis of surveillance tection is on indicators and warnings of terrorist surveillance activities surveillance detection efforts should focus on recording then reporting incidents similar to the following ap72431 multiple sightings of the same suspicious person vehicle or activity separated by time di stance or direction ap72432 possible locations for observation post use ap72433 individuals w ho stay at bus andor trai n stops for extended periods while busestrains come and go ap72434 individuals who carry on long conversations on pay or cellular telephones ap72435 individuals who order food at restaurant and leave before the food arrives or who order without eating ap72436 joggers who stand and stre tch for an inordinate amount of time ap72437 individuals sitt ing in parked car for an extended period of time ap72438 individuals who dont fit in to the surrounding environment by wearing improper attire for th location or season ap72439 individuals draw ing pictures andor taking tes in an area not normally of interest to standard tourist or showing in terest in or photographing security cameras guard

such as staring or quickly looking away from individuals or ve hicles as they enter or leave signated faciliti or parking areas ap724311 terrorists may also employ aggressive surveillance by false phone threats approaching security checkpoints to ask for directions or innocently attempting to smuggle nonlethal contraband thro ugh checkpoints clearly the terrorists intend to determine firsthand the effectiveness of search procedur and to gauge the ertness and reaction of security personnel ap7244 it is important to highlight that the above surveillance in dicators are recorded overtly and while performing normal military polices ecurity forces activities the intent is to raise the awareness of our military policesecurity forces to record and report the unusual during the course of routine law enforcement and security duties ap725 reporting terrorist surveillance indicators implementing effective security countermeasures and employing overt surveillance detection principles shall deter terrorist surveillance however regardless of the capabilit ies of facility or in stallation to resource antiterrorism protective measures good working rela tionships with local state and federal law enforcement agencies are essential to establishing cohesive timely and effective responses to the indicators of terrorist activity ap7251 installation commanders and nior law enforcement officials should coordinate and establish partnerships with local authoritie s ie installation threat working groups to develop intelligence and information shar ing relationships to improve security for the installation and the military community at large ap7252 for those occasions when the indi cators of terrorist rveillance continue despite well executed overt secur ity countermeasures the objectives should be to provide detailed reports of the indicators of surveillance to the appropriate law enforcement agency or intelligence activity as reports of suspicious ac tivity increase and the trends clearly indicate preoperational terrorist surveillance it may be necessary for installation commanders in coordination with senior law enforcement nd intelligence officials to implement more sophisticated uniquely tailored c ountersurveillance so lutions and assets to investigate the circumstances for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 374 for official use only ap7253

psds ap151 introduction ap1511 the use of psds is policy decision th ere are pros and cons to their use the employment of large numbers of psd members to protect few nior officers or dod officials may deter all but the most determined terrorist at tack on the other hand the use of one or two psd members may attract attention to the protected person that might otherwise not be given to that individual ap1512 dod personnel can be their own bod yguards if they follow the selfprotection strategy outlined in this handbook supplemented by chauffeur trained in defensive driving and other security techniques dod executives sh ould be relatively safe in most situations ap1513 in high crisis situations in areas where kidnapping is rampant and during period of direct threats use of psds for highri sk personnel should be strongly considered ap1514 it is critical that members of psds be thoroughly tr ained to do their job psd training is intensive and cannot be done overnight nor can indi viduals who have been trained retain levels of proficiency in driving firear ms and close combat wit hout continuous training the psd members must be physically and menta lly fit so that their bodies and minds shall respond positively in crisis situations ap1515 since psd members must both protec t protectees and be their companions in personal and professional situations they mu st be particularly honest and discrete ap1516 the training of bodyguards should begin by defining their role both as technical aid to the executive they serve and as an individual who can di rect the executive they protect to selfhelp in an attack psd members may be killed or incapacitated in their protective roles psd members should be constantly teaching protectees to protect themselves to avoid attack to respond to an attack and to conduct themselves properly if captured ap152 psd member training objectives ap1521 members of psds should be instructed in the following areas ap15211 history of

actions ap15215 destruction of government and governmentrelated facilities ap15216 the psychology of criminals and extremists ap1522 it is particularly important that the general instruction rece ived as part of the general and professional military training of psd members be supplemented by local information such information should emphasize terrorist activity in the area of operations where psd members are to prov ide protection to senior fficers and dod officials ap153 target characteristics ap1531 in developing strategy for the use of psd members to provide additional protection it is essential that protectees examine their persona l roles missions functions and lifestyles to assess their individua l and dependents risk and vulnerab ility to terrorist attack the following considerations should be weighe d in developing psd protective plan ap15311 official role ap153111 psds should be assigned to highrisk personnel ba sed on their duties responsibilities risk vulnerabili ty and importance or criticality to dod missions and functions the following questions should be considered in determining the need for assignment psd to senior officers or dod officials ap1531111 what is the public prof ile of the officer or dod official ap1531112 what is dod comb atant command or embassy protection policy ap1531113 what are the strengths and weaknesses of the physical security system ap1531114 what are local dod or embassy security procedures ap1531115 what coordination occu rs between local host nation law enforcement officials and us government the

ap154211 psd members must be skilled in negotiation with protectees their families their colleagues and their acquaintances over the proper balance between security considerations on the one hand nd family social and business ac tivities on the other they must retain their composure at all times even if protectees and t hose around them do not especially over matters of appr opriate security arrangements fo r home official business away from the office and recreational activities ap154212 psd members must also be skilled in remaining focused on the need for protection regardless of the behaviors or personal practice s of protectees in addition psd members shall have an opportunity to observe seni or officers dod official s and their families in close personal situations as there are often significant diff erences between public and private personalities psd members may be placed in pos itions where their ideals personal values expectations and preferences di ffer significantly from the person or people they are protecting ap154213 psd members must be prepar ed to perform other duties as may be required to preserve their anonymity on the one hand and the anonymity of the protectee on the other if protectee is schedul ed to attend meeting for which secretary might be used to take notes member of the psd team may be assigned the task of note taking thereby keeping the size of the protectees entourage small by pe rforming secretarial dutie s in connection with psd assignment the psd member does not reve his or her special training to outside observers in addition he or she does not reveal us government concerns about the risk or vulnerability of the protected person to terrorist attack ap15422 appearance ap154221 psd members must appear to be part of their protectees entourage they must fit in with the protectees functions roles and lifestyles as noted above they may be asked to perform other duties not directly related to security in order to disguise their primary security duties for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 409 for official use only ap154222 psd members should dress groo m and act as part of the protectees environment consider longer hairstyles f unctional jewelry lowkey manicures and even civilian attire for psd members assigned to senior dod official s consider more mature members of psd details for assignment to senior fficers as aides or assistants as well as younger members of psds as drivers and couriers ap15423 organizational secur ity plans and contingencies ap154231 psd members need to be ke pt informed of physical security and personnel security arrangements as they develop and change it is esse ntial that psds know the location of response forces and backup response fo rces the communications links to reach such forces communication links with local municipal and host c ountry security resources as necessary psd members should be given detail ed information on the location of safe havens presurveyed evacuation sites presurveyed evacuation routes and identified backup or alternatives ap154232 psd members should be invited to observe and to pa rticipate in crisis management training and exercises so that they can appreciate the roles and responsibilities of their protectees and id entify positions from which they can continue to perform their responsibilities without interfering with other members of the crisis management team ap15424 tools and techniques psd members bring wi range of tools and techniques to their responsibilitie s of protecting senior officers nd dod officials at the same time protectees and their organizations need to be sensitive to some of the requirements or special considerations that psd s may have in order to carry out their assignments the following

however critical assets are attacked and disabled destroyed or killed then such an attack would be as damaging as explosive laden small boat attack terrorist hijacking hostage taking vips aboard ship vips ashore and innocents who happen to be in the wrong pl ace at the wrong time substantial di fference in the consequences of hijackinghostage taking at sea political consequences may be more noticeable as ships are generally assumed to be more difficult to seize than other facilities ashore ap1713 this appendix also builds on the co ncept of physical security system intended to protect

fundamentally different than terrorist attacks from the landside of an installation or facility the waterborne terrorist attack poses some di fficult challenges for the physical security system designed to protect the dod asset from attack in the following section the physic security system functions are reviewed and some of the differe nces between waterborne and landside terrorist attacks are identified and discussed ap172 security system functions ap1721 security system functions performe d in the protection of landlocked dod installation or facility must so be performed when the insta llation has an in terface with body of water or is itself surrounded by water thr eat detection classifica tion and identification response delay and incident resolution must be performed ap1722 the medium of water presents uniqu challenges and some opportunities for the physical security system the principal problem in protecting dod assets from terrorist attacks from the water is detecting classifying and respo nding to the threat dete ction is often difficult because it is difficult to establish security peri meters and keep legitimate users from wandering into the security zone by accident classification of an intrusion as hostile is difficult because there are myriad of legitimate reasons that might account for the presence of craft or persons in declared security zone such as mechanical failu re disorientation wind or current drift or even illness ap1723 the medium of water makes stre ssful demands on physical resources and equipment used to build physical security syst em

isolating incident from press additional supporters and logistical support is somewhat easier for incidents afloat than on land recovery of vessel platform and victims can be very difficult ap173 waterside physical curity system components ap1731 barriers barriers on the watersid of dod installation fa cility or asset afloat perform many basic functions performed on land such as establish boundary isolate activity and discourage visitors and impede passage by boat or swimmer ap17311 some of the functions perfor med by barriers on the landside of dod installation cannot be readily pe rformed on the waterside barri ers on the waterside to obscure activities on land are difficult to erect on the wate r they can be installed at the landwater interface or at the mean highwate r mark similarly intrusion dete ction devices cannot be easily installed on most barriers used to establish boun daries of dod installation or facility when those boundaries extend seve ral hundred meters to more than 1000 meters into the water some intrusion detection devices can be mounted on fixe d installations that extend into the water such as wharves or piers or navigation aid platforms ap17312 the fact that the barriers ve to work on the surface and beneath the surface against wide variety of threats wit hout harming benign intrusions complicates the design and implementation of barriers for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 445 for official use only ap1732 boundaries ap17321 several devices can be used to establish boundarie s separating the dod installation facility or asset from the surrounding or borde ring waters among the devices that can be used to establish boundary are the following ap173211 buoys or floats ap173212 nets where allowed ap173213 anchored or pile mounted navigation aids an d signaling devices ap173214 log booms blue barrels 55gallon drums dunlops ap173215 barges ap173216 gigboats whaleboats nd other small workboats at anchor ap173217 roving patrols by security boats ap17322 once boundaries are established th ey can be used to provide areas of operation for floating security patrols as well as contact and escort c services and tactical reaction activities ap17323 it must be emphasized that rule s of navigation allow for inadvertent and innocent penetration of certain type s of barriers as may occur with small craft engine failure sail boats and in some waters weekend sailors wh ose enthusiasm for wate r sports exceeds their navigational and operational skill unlike fe nces around dod installations penetration of floating or fixed perimeter barriers on the wate rside of dod installa tion or facility cannot immediately be assumed to be hostile ap1733 isolate activity and restrict access ap17331 some of the barriers noted above ca n be used to restrict waterside access to dod installations for example use of floating ne ts where allowed espe cially those made of wire mesh and anchored to the floor of the body of water can be used to deny access to swimmer delivery vehicles small commercialtype submarines or divers barges can be used to create physical barrier of considerable penetration resi stance to small craft the barges should be secured bow to stern with the lead and aft barges being secured to the pi er or landside mooring point the primary purpose for deploying barrier of this type is to absorb large portion of the blast from an explosive laden vessel that has managed to elude initial defenses for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 446 for official use only ap17332 use of patrol boats is probably the most effec tive means of isolating dod activity and discouraging uninvited visits from benign or curious intruders effective use of patrol boats require the establishment of perimeter surveillance of activity beyond the perimeter to identify potential intrusions and di spatch of c boats to the intruder at some distance away from an inner zone reaction zone which is the range of weapons thought to be in the hands of terrorists as general rule it is recommended that boats be allowed closer than 500 meters to dod asset bein g protected from terrorist attack ap1734 impede passage ap17341 several of the barriers describe d above can be used to slow or impede access to dod facilities by boats or swimmers nets where allowed are among the best barriers for this purpose wellmarked partially submer ged objects can also be used there are legal implications regarding the emplacement of barriers which constitute hazard to navigation such devices should be employed only after exha ustive consultations wi th appropriate legal authorities ap17342 again patrol activity by c boats or tactical reaction boats can be very effective ap1735 surveillanceintrusion detection

ubstantial reduction in surface activity occurs as result nighttime surveillance of waterside activity can rely on active measures such as radar with comparatively good success in locating and partially identifying potential problems ap1736 classificationidentification ap17361 as in the case of landside secu rity systems once potential intruder has been detected it must be classified and identified in order to ensure that proper security measures are undertaken waterside security measures respond to the detecti on of threat by trying to gain more information in some instances detected intr uders can be identified as either swimmers or vessels such identification is not sufficient information upon which to base response ap17362 there may be many benign reas ons to account for the presence of swimmer or vessel in an area that is not usuall open for such intrusions lost sailors and swimmers mechanical failure curiosity seekers currents tides winds etc can be as much responsible for barrier penetrati on as hostile intent being able to classify detected targets quickly in terms of hostilityben ign is critically important ap1737 response ap17371 establishment of security zones ap173711 waterside security is enfor ced by establishing at least two zones of activity the area extended from the mean high wate r mark to the outer edge of zone of control is termed the security zone within this area security forces notify vesse ls craft and swimmers that they are entering restricted waters and should alter course to take them away from protected dod assets security forces may stop and sear ch intruders if necessa ry although as general rule such engagements in the security zone are not high priority security zones usually extend for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 448 for official use only at least 1000 meters from the nearest dod asset in some port areas this large security zone is not possible and smaller securi ty zone must be adopted ap173712 within the s ecurity zone extend ing from the high water mark to distance beyond the maximum range of anticipated wa terborne threats is reaction zone within this zone security forces shall stop and challenge intruders taking all ac tions necessary to stop potential threat ap173713 the zone closest to protected assets extended from the asset to the maximum range of anticipated threat weapons h undreds of yards for small arms and rocket propelled grenades to several thousand yards for manportable antitank weapons is keep out zone security forces should endeavor to pr event the entry of hostile craft or vessels into this zone local defenses may be engaged if host ile craft or vessels ente r this zone techniques described below may be used to disrup t swimmer attacks within this zone ap17372 response forces in general ap173721 three types of waterborne s ecurity forces are employed to maintain perimeter security and enforce security zone re strictions depending on the location of the dod installation the nature of the waterside facilities and activities and the jurisdiction under which waterside security is conducted security forces may be provided by the us coast guard state or local police hostgovernment forces if overs eas other dod security forces or composite forces as appropriate ap173722 patrol force is deployed to cruise the security zone provide detection and identification information to cen tral command post and to aid other security forces as necessary the patrol force may be dicated to patrol or ma perform other security services as directed ap173723 ce force is deployed in the outer security zone this force is responsible for making initial contact with intruders posi tioning the ce boats between intruders and protected assets and providing navigational assistan ce and escort services to ensure that intruders leave the restricted waters of the security zone as quickly as possible ap173724 tactical response boat trb force is deployed close to or within the reaction zone this force is responsible for engaging intruders and terminating incidents before intruders reach the keep out zone if at all possible for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 449 for official use only ap173725 in addition to the three fo rces outlined above it is recommended that waterside security force planners include t actical response command boat that can perform command and control functions during engageme nts conducted by c boats or tactical response boats the command trb shadows the t rb and should be the largest vessel assigned to the security operation in addition to radar the comma nd trb should have illumination pyrotechnics aboard in support of perimeter nigh t operations its station shall be at the 500 meter mark or less from the protected asset although available to addre ss an aggressor if the trb needs assistance or additional directed fire its primary respons ibilities are to coordinate and direct vessel responses if the command post does not have clear observa tion point over the area of operations to serve as backup command pos t and to engage second aggressor when observed and hostile intent is c onfirmed in the event of lim ited boat resources the command trb may also be used as relief boat for the other patrolling vessels wh refueling or changing out crews ap173726 it is also recommended that security force equipped with vehicles communications equipment and personal protecti on equipment be deployed to patrol the land water interface it is esse ntial that command control and communications systems used by waterside security forces be fully integrated with landside security forces table ap17t5 provides list of equipment that should be provided to all boa ts performing supporting security forces table ap17t5 patrol boat security equipment ¾ compatible communications betw een boats and shore elements ¾ signal and illumination pyrotechnics ¾ night vision equipment ¾ standard boarding firearms and associated equipment ¾ body armor ¾ loud hailers installed or portable ¾ flood lights install ed or portable ¾ blue light and siren ap173727 boats and craft employed as tactical response boats may also be equipped with crewserve weapons ie machine guns or other similar armaments as appropriate for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 450 for official use only ap173728 the primary source of sm all boat communication is of course the vhffm radio if available secure communica tions should be used if not available authentication tables must be used to avoid co mpromise also when working with dod forces additional or alternate communica tion equipment must be shared to provide compatible means of communication between forces single primar tactical frequency should be designated for small boat security operations this freque ncy should not be one routinely used by non operation forces in the area ap173729 boarding should be conducted by patrolling small boats or any other vessels assigned to the security zone if boarding becomes necessary it should be conducted by the contactescort vessels if employe d local or state law enforcement officers or by designated boarding teams trans ported to the scene by standby vessel in all cases the boarding should take place outside the security zone at secure location ap174 security system component integration ap1741 patrol techniques ap17411 resource allocation ap174111 designate sectors divide the water approaches to the asset into sectors utilizing sector boundary line s that converge at the asset each sector should be lettered ap174112 number of sectors required normally more than 4 sectors are necessary in the inner perimeter the number of sectors within the s ecurity zone need not necessarily coincide exactly with those in the reaction zone it may vary accordingly with the number of small boats available for patrol ap174113 patrol areas small boats should patrol the outer boundary of the zone within the sector to which they are assigned ap174114 patrol boat designations the patrol boats should be referred to using basic numbering system ie boat 1 boat 2 etc randomly changing call signs is not tactically necessary and shall on ly confuse crews conduc ting tactical operations most security zone enforcement is conducted with one or tw small boats patrolling the perimeter the techniques for patrolling security zone are as follows ap1741141 oneboat security zone in oneboat security zone enforcement the security boat shall ma intain position near th centerline of the zone at the outer boundary for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 451 for official use only this position allows maximum visibility for obs erving the established security zone and for warning local vessel traffic ap1741142 twoboat security zone in twoboat security zone enforcement the zone should be divided into tw halves with each security boat maintaining position near the centerline of their assigned half at the outer boundary if either boat must leave their assigned position the second security boat s hould move to the centerline of the whole zone at the outer boundary as in oneboa t enforcement the second boat should return to its original assigned position only after the prev iously engaged security boat has returned to its original assigned position ap174115 intercept procedures if the security boat leaves its position to intercept an incoming vessel to escort vessel transiting the zone or to inform vessel without vhffm radio communications of security zone re strictions the coxswain should return to the centerline position as soon as possible to allow for full monitoring of the zone ap174116 maneuvering if safe and practical all turns should be made to the outside of the zone so that th boat crew never has its back toward the outer boundary of the zone and can maintain survei llance of the zone boundaries ap174117 moving security zone in moving security zone protected asset underway twoboat minimum is recommended additional security vessels may be used if the threat indicates need ap1741171 position the first boat preferably the largest assigned shall maintain position directly forward of the prot ected asset the sec ond boat preferably the fastest assigned shall take positi on directly aft add itional security vessels if and when needed shall support fore and aft security vessels by deploying on the assets port and starboard beam ap1741172 duties the first boat leads th moving zone through visual presence flashing blue lighto fficial us coast guard mark ings and communications with compliant vessels the second boat is responsi ble for intercepting any vessels attempting to enter or interfere w ith the moving security zone the second boat shall maintain 360 visual and radar lookout at all times ap174118 security zone enforcement at anchorage the tactics previously discussed in these paragraphs may be adapted for 360 coverage of assets at anchorage in heightened threat environments tactic s discussed may also be adapted for 360 coverage for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 452 for official use only ap174119 defensive boat tactics defensive measures provide response mechanism for actively intercepting and neutralizi ng an identified incoming hostile threat this section shall provide guidance on how small boats ca n be used to protect designated asset the asset can be ship pier waterfr ont facility or any area or object vital to national security that requires protection from waterborne threat thes tactics were developed for use primarily in low intensity conflict lic environment howeve r the tactics may be used at any level of fpcon in support of security zone enforcemen t by modifying the use of force and rules of engagement roe to meet the current threat ap1741110 security operations in hos tile environment without declared war require extraordinary measures to separate fr iend or neutral from foe in conus lic environment the dod components as well as othe r us government agencies and departments participating in security operations must contin ually maintain law enforcement posture that recognizes the constitutional rights and privileges of the citizenry to use the waterways of the nation ap1741111 peacetimewartime security operations against an adversary once identified are the easiest part of the equation the following ta ctics are designed to assist friendly forces in determining friend from foe ap1741112 the first level of response w ith this tactical doctrine is to notify transiting vessels of the security zone and to termine their intentions nonaggressors shall simply be escorted out of the area the utiliza tion of these tactics in security zone enforcement shall ensure that system shall be in place to effectively respond to wide range of threats without them the department of defense and ot her us government security forces and the protected asset may suffer unnecessary casua lties with devastating consequences ap1742 boat intrusion response ap17421 screen vessel contact with intruder ap174211 screen vessel responsibilities the vessel patrolli ng the sector being penetrated in the outer most zone ie the r eaction zone for twoboat operations the security zone for three boat operations sh all intercept the incoming vesse l at the outer boundary of the security zone directly on line between it and the asset the intercepting vessel known as the screen vessel is charged with the responsibility of determining if the incoming vessel is hostile or not this process shall be disc ussed later if the incoming vesse l is determined to be hostile the screen vessel shall then clear the field of fire by turning at 90 degree angle to the course for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 453 for official use only of the incoming vessel this turn shall always be to the outside of the assigned sector away from the center line so as not to cross into th field of fire and to deliver supporting fire if necessary the direction of turn may be changed if on scene cond itions and zone configuration so dictate ap174212 screen vessel tactics these tactics have been developed around the realization that the command deci sion to designate an intruder as hostile and to use appropriate force to neutralize the threat shall be extremely difficult and the evaluatio n time is likely to be limited to 1 to 2 minutes ap174213 screen vessel movements the approach to the inbound vessel by the screen vessel should initially be head on uti lizing siren blue light radioloud hailer and floodspot light into the cabin as the incomi ng vessel turns to avoid head on situation the screen vessel should turn in the same directi on on parallel course st aying between the inbound vessel and the protected asset the screen vessel should herd the incoming vessel out of the security zone never allow the potential aggressor clear line of progression to the asset this is another method of screening out th innocent boater and further st ep in the identif ication of the intruder vessel as having hostile intent the ob vious actions of fully marked and identified us coast guard boat or similar hostnation vess if overseas with blue light weapons at the ready and sirenloudhailerradio calls in the blocking of an incoming vessels trackline is positive indication of coast guardhost nation enforcement or interdiction action if the aggressor evades the screen and proceeds toward the asset the screen vessel must immediately communicate with the command center and clear the trbs field of fire in the manner previously discussed if so directed by the command center if there is clear field of fire and if warning both loudhailer and radio has been given the screen vessel may take the hostile inbound vessel under fire in support of the trb ap17422 trb response to intrusion ap174221 initial reaction while the screen vesse l is maneuvering the trb patrolling the reaction zo ne shall be stationed directly on line between the aggressor and the asset at the outer boundary of th reaction zone this shall provide stationary weapons platform for directing fire on the hostile vessel shoul d the command center direct once the screen vessel is clear the trb may take the aggressor under fire if necessary and approved by the command center if any degree of doubt exists as to the status of the intruder he can be kept under observation of the trb and fired upon if hostile intent is confirmed keep in mind that at for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 454 for official use only this point the potential aggresso r has been well screened and been given ample warning if the screen vessel must break off hostile intent by the inbound vessel is likely ap174222 trb response techniques once the screen vessel has initiated contact with an inbound vessel the designated trb shall assume station along the reaction zone boundary directly between the screen ve sselsinbound vessels location and the asset ap174223 trb aspect the aspect that the trb assumes in relation to the incoming vessel shall vary depending upon the type of small boat used ie head on for small utility boat broadside for larger u tility boat or patrol boat the im portant factor is that the small boats weapons usually m60s must be able to cover the incoming vessel wherever it maneuvers ap174224 trb movements once in position the trb should come deadin thewater diw and maneuver only to maintain position between the incoming vessel and the asset this is simplified by the fact that rger course changes by the incoming vessel can be compensated for by relatively small movements along the zone boundary attempting to bring the aggressor under fire from moving platform is not recommended experience and testing have shown that accurate weapons fire is extremely difficult from moving small boat ap174225 comm and trb response single boat if available shall be retained in close proximity to the protected asse t this boat command trb shall be held in reserve to engage followon aggressors in ctor already engaged w ith aggressors and to perform other command trb functions as may become necessary ap17423 night operations night operations vary from daylight operations in the method of locating and identifying potential aggre ssors unless sufficient boats are available to allow patrolling of the entire boundary of the secur ity zone the movement of the screen vessels must be controlled by central co mmand radar system eg ships radar due to the limitations of small boat radar the screen vessels should be directed by an established command center to intercept approaching vessels observation pos ts should be employed along the shoreline at strategic locations to prevent aggressors from making contact along the shoreline all screen vessels should be equipped with parachute illumination flares for use during hostile activity to illuminate aggressors night vision devices should also be used to assist in visually acquiring incoming vessels ap17424 swimmer deterrence and countermeasures the threat to

viable one swimmers present method by which aggressors may conduct wide range of terrorist andor lic operations without the use of complex hardware it is important that while committing resources to surface craft and waterside threats the underwater threat is not forgotten ap174241 general swimmer capabilities the nominal speed for swimmer depending on distance and equipmen t carried is 1 knot even minor current shall cause the swimmer to limit his attack direction swimmers shall take advantage of currents to reach their targets this should be taken into considera tion when orienting defense however if intelligence indicates that hostili ties are sophisticated enough to have swimmer delivery vehicles or swimmer propulsion units 360 defense including under pier areas should be maintained ap174242 swimmer countermeasures security patrols in support of swimmer defense should be conducted as follows ap1742421 waterside patrols the alert port security patrol is an important element in defending against swimmer attack properly equipped the port security patrol offers the most sophisticated detection clas sification and neutraliz ation capability yet developed they can operate in daylight or dark ness are capable of kill or capture depending on the roe and can alert others to swimmer threat patrol effectiveness is determined by location equipment understanding of the threat nd alertness port security personnel should patrol in darkened areas shielded from artificial lighting and as far forward in the area of threat as possible to eliminate background noise and othe r detection obstructions when applicable and available binoculars night vision devices andor thermal imagers should be utilized to assist in detection anything that appears to be moving toward the protected asset should be treated as possible attack drifting debris is often used to camouflage swimmer or mine and should be immediately investigated ap1742422 waterside patrols if there is an identified swimmer threat boats should be assigned to the swimmer defense mission they should patrol li kely launch points for both surface craft and allterrain vehicles deliv ering hostile swimmers the random presence of vessel with turning screws and an alert crew is respectable deterrent to unsophisticated divers if the threat is high and believe d to be from accomplished divers the boats assigned to swimmer defense should drag heavy lines with attached grapple hooks or large fishing hooks the area or district commander may only authorize the us of draglines for swimmer defense within

indicates the pier area should be inspected by divers for any pr epositioned explosive devices us navy explosive ordnance disp osal eod units if available should be used for this mission however if they are not available many local state police and host nation agencies have similar capabilities throughout the vessels port stay in the established security zone the pier area and the ships hull s hould be inspected peri odically by both landside personnel and waterside patrols eg coast guard in conus ap17424232 other structures that ma be at risk of terrorist attack such as navigation aids bridges utility cable towe rs tunnels etc should also be inspected for underwater explosive devices on pe riodic basis frequency of inspections should be increased based on the current threat information ap17424233 use of concussion grenades the use of concussion grenades is extremely effective in swimmer fense operations the kill range of standard concussion grenade is approximately 5 feet th stun range reaches out 25 to 30 feet in diameter from the concussion blast although th kill range is not large the random use of concussion grenades in several locations around th protected asset shall force most swimmers out of the area care must be taken to ensure th at recognizable time pattern is not established to be an effective deterrent maximum discha rge intervals in the ra ndom pattern should not exceed 10 minutes ap17424234 additional measures if the protected asset is ship or if ship is moored near the protec ted asset turning the ships sc rew maintaining sea suction and shifting the rudder on random basis can be an ef fective deterrence however these methods are generally effective only against unsophistic ated swimmers establishing lighting around the protected asset that does not inte rfere with the curity personnels vision or give away their positions or movements is effective in locating surface swimmers and bubble trails from open circuit scuba divers portable lighting searchspot lights and illumination flares should be available for emergency responses periodic activa tion of the ships sonar can be an effective deterrent through delivery of its

identify vantage points outside the control of personne l in the targeted building and either eliminate them or provide means to void exposure to them means to avoid exposure may include actions such as reorienting the build ing or shielding people or assets in and around the building using such measures as reflectiv glazing walls privacy fencing or vegetation ap18213 visitor populations activitie s with large visitor populations provide opportunities for potential aggressors to get near buildings with minimal controls and therefore limit opportunities for early tection maximize separation distance between inhabited buildings and areas with larg nondod visitor populations ap18214 commercial transpor tation nodes avoid sites fo r inhabited buildings that are close to railroads ports airfields nd major road networks where any of these transportation nodes are in the vicinity of existin g buildings provide adeq uate standoff distances from inhabited buildings require d to controlled perimeters wh ere those standoff distances are not available and since moving things such as existing ra ilroads may be difficult and prohibitively expensive ensure that there are pr ocedures in place to prohibit trains or other similar transportation vessels from stopping in the vicinity of i nhabited structures ap18215 unobstructed space aggressors wi ll not generally place ssets in areas near buildings where their explosive devices could be visually detected by building occupants observing the area around the build ing obstructions within 10 meters 33 feet of buildings should not be permitted that allow for concealment from observation of explosive devices 150 mm six inches or greater in height this does t preclude the placement of site furnishings or plantings around buildings it only requires conditions such that any explosive devices placed in that space would be observable by building occu pants unobstructed space also addresses electrical and mechanical equipment and equi pment enclosures to eliminate opportunities for placement and concealment of explosive devices ap1822 vehicle considerations ap18221 vehicle access the first line of defens in limiting opportunities for aggressors to get vehicles close to dod buildings is at vehicle access points at the controlled perimeter to parking areas and at driveupdrop off points keep the number of access points to the minimum necessary for operational or life sa fety purposes that will limit the number of for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 469 for official use only points at which

driveupdropoff and access roads some facilities require access to areas within the required standoff distance for dropping off or picking up people or loading or unloading packages and other objects examples that may require driveup drop off include but are not limited to medical faciliti exchanges and commissaries childcare centers and schools here consideration is given to marking unattend ed vehicles access control and location of the driveupdropoff and access roads to prevent unauthorized vehicles from being parked and left unattended or located under any inhabited portion of building additionally locate these points away from large glazed areas of the building to minimize the poten tial for hazardous flying glass fragments in the event of an xplosion the driveupdropoff poi nt should be coordinated with the building geometry to minimize the possibility that explosive blast forces could be increased due to being trapped or otherwise concentrated ap18224 parking beneath buildings parking beneath buildings makes building occupants highly vulnerable and this parking should be eliminated where possible where very limited real estate makes parking beneath buildin gs unavoidable the following measures should be incorporated into the design for new buildings or mitigating measures should be incorporated into existing buildings to achieve an equivalent level of

sproportionate to the original localized damage collapse or create hazardous debris ap1831 progressive collapse avoidance progressive collapse is considered to be significant risk for buildings of three stories not including base ment stories or more the superstructure can be designed to sustain local damage with the structural system as whole remaining stable and not being damaged to an ex tent disproportionate to the original local damage an arrangement of the structural elements can provides stability to the entire structural system by transferring loads from any locally damaged region to adjacent regions capable of resisting those loads without collapse this shall be accomplished by providing sufficient continuity redundancy or energy dissipating capacity ductility or combination thereof in the members and connections of the structure to verify the design structure must be analyzed in number of ways additionally all floor s need improved capacity to withstand load reversals caused by blast effects by designing them to withstand net uplift at least equal to the dead load plus onehalf the live load for example some existing buildings have been outfitted with steel beam systems to reinforce the existi ng structure to provide an appropriate level of protection ap1832 exterior walls significant number of dod buildings have unreinforced masonry exterior walls that woul d likely crumble with fairly small explosive without adequate standoff as result with inadequate sta ndoff unreinforced mas onry walls should be prohibited for the exterior walls of inhabite d buildings buildings should have adequate reinforcement of at least minimum of 005 pe rcent vertical reinforcement with maximum spacing of 1200 mm 48 in or have mitigating m easures to provide an equivalent level of protection there are many available ways to re inforce exterior walls to provide adequate protection for building occupants ap1833 structural isolation where there are areas of buildings that do not meet the criteria for inhabited buildings design the supe rstructures of those areas to be structurally independent from the inhabited area this will minimize the possibility

overhangs avoid building overhangs with inhabited spaces above them where people could gain access to the area underneath the overhang where such overhangs must be used measures should be incorporated into th design for new buildings or mitigating measures should be incorporated into ex isting buildings to achieve an equivalent level of protection so that roadways andor parking areas are not unde r overhangs that floors beneath inhabited areas will not breach from the tonation underneath the overhang and that all structural elements within and adjacent to th overhang will not suffe r progressive collapse ap184 architectural design there are many aspects of building layout and othe r architectural design issues that significantly enhance building occupant safety and security w ith little increase in cost and should be fully explored and leveraged for all inhabited buildings ap1841 windows and glazed doors to minimize hazards from flying glass fragments glazing and window frames are key components for all inhabited buildings windows and frames should work as system to ensure that th eir hazard mitigation is effective and apply even if adequate standoff distances are met specific measures are available to further mitigate glazing and window frames hazards where stan doff distances are not met additionally whenever window or door glazing is being replaced in existing inhabited bu ildings as part of planned renovation it should meet the same guidelines ap1842 building access the areas outside of installa tions are commonly not under the direct control of the installati ons people entering and exiting the buildings are vulnerable to being fired upon from vantage points discussed in site planning outside the installations ap18421 main entrance to mitigate those vulnerabilities in new buildings ensure that the main entrance to the building does not face an installation perimeter or other uncontrolled vantage points with direct lines of sight to the entrance for existing inhabited buildings where the main entrance faces an insta llation perimeter either use different entrance as the main entrance or screen that entrance to limit the ability of potentia l aggressors to target people entering and aving the building ap18422 exterior doors for all new and existing buildin gs ensure that all exterior doors into inhabited areas open outwards by doing so the

personnel and critical equipment to minimize xposure to direct blast effects and potential impacts from hazardous glass fragments and other potential debris ap18444 external hallways because doors can become hazardous debris during explosive blast events because doors designed to resist blast effects are expensive and because external hallways have large numbers of doors leading into inhabited areas avoid exterior hallway configurations for inhabited structures ap18445 mailrooms as mail bom bs are frequent methods employed by terrorists protective measures need to address th location of rooms to which mail is delivered or in which mail is handled in inhabited buildings the measures involve limiting collateral damage and injuries and facilitating futu re upgrades to enhance protection should they become necessary by locating the mailroom on the building perimeter there is an opportunity to modify it in the future if mail bomb threat is identified where mailrooms are located in the interior of buildings few retrofit options are available for mitigating the mail bomb threat mailrooms should also be located as far from heavily populated areas of the building and critical infrastructure as possible this measure will go far toward minimizing injuries and damage if mail bomb detonates in the mailroom where the ma ilroom is not specifically designed to resist that threat

explosives or chemical biological or radiological agents there or otherwise threatening buildi ng occupants or critical infras tructure for new buildings eliminate all external roof access by providing access from internal stairways or ladders such as in mechanical rooms for existing buildings elim inate external access where possible or secure external ladders or stairways with locked cages or similar mechanisms ap1846 overhead mounted architectural feat ures for all buildings ensure that all suspended ceiling systems and other overhead m ounted architectural feat ures are mounted to minimize the likelihood that they will fall and inju re building occupants for example in the dod at construction standards all such systems w ill be mounted such that they resist forces of 05 times the component weight in any directi on and 15 times the component weight in the downward direction but this stan dard does not preclude the need to design architectural feature mountings for forces required by other criteria such as seismic standards ap1847 minimize secondary debris eliminat unrevetted concrete barriers and site furnishings in the vicinity of inhabited structures that are

utility systems can suffer significant damage when subjected to the shock of an explosion some of these utilit ies may be critical to safely evacuating personnel from the building or thei r destruction could cause damage that is disproportionate to other building damage resulti ng from an explosion where possible route critical or fragile utilities such that they ar not on exterior walls or on walls shared with mailrooms to minimize the possibility of the above hazards where redundant utilities are required in accordance with other requirements or criteria ensure that the redundant utilities are not collocated or do not run in the same chases this minimizes the possibility that both sets of utilities will be adversely affected by single event ap1853 equipment bracing mount all overhead utilities and other fixtures to minimize the likelihood that they will fall and injure building occupants for example dod at construction standards require ll equipment mountings to be signed to resist forces of 05 times the equipment weight in any directi on and 15 times the equipment weight in the downward direction but they do not preclude the need to sign equipment mountings for forces required by other criteria such as seismic standards ap1854 under building access to limit opport unities for aggressors placing explosives underneath buildings ensure that access to craw l spaces utility tunnels and other means of under building access is controlled ap1855 mass notification all inhabited buildings should have timely means to notify occupants of threats and instruct them what to do in response to those th reats the capability enables realtime information to be provided to building occupants or pe rsonnel in the immediate vicinity of the building during em ergency

rs and personnel should remain vigilant for notsotypical indicators if suspicious envelope or parcel is located personnel should perform the actions lis ted at the end of this appendix ap192 indicators of suspi cious envelopes and parcels ap1921 the following are typical indicators that highlight suspicious envelopes and parcels ap19211 unknown or strange postmark th mail may be postmarked from strange or unknown place usually outside your normal channels of correspondence ap19212 lack of return address this ma be an attempt by the terrorist to reduce the amount of evidence on an envelope or to avoid spicion by using what could be determined to be an erroneous address ap19213 excessive amount of po stage it is risky to ask mail clerk to weigh letter bomb for the exact amount of postage postal personnel normally know what to look for and may be able to determine that the package contains bomb therefore it is safer for the terrorist to add additional postage rather th an risk being caught with the bomb ap19214 abnormal or unusual size or shape the envelope or package may be of an abnormal excessive or unusual size because of the construction of the firing device and other bomb parts inside ap19215 protruding strings aluminum foil or wires strings or wires may protrude from or be attached to the item the bomb maker may have constructed the device in sloppy manner causing unsecured wires to work loose the more likely reason for an exposed wire is that it is an arming wire that the courie r did not remove fearing it would detonate instantaneously for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 476 for official use only ap19216 misspelled words misspelling on the envelope or package could occur because the writer is simply not familiar with military ranks or unit designations ap19217 inconsistency between the return address and the pos tmark the return address and the postmark may be different eg the return address may indicate the item was mailed from oregon whereas the postmark may indicate frankfurt germany ap19218 handwritten labels foreign handw riting or poorly typed addresses handwriting that appears to be foreign may indica that the bomber or whoever addressed the item is from another country ap19219 unusual odor the item may exhi bit an unusual odor such as shoe polish almonds or marzipan sweet almond paste us ed predominately in germany for candies heavily perfumed packages or envelopes may also indicate device is present note intentionally smelling an envelope or package to determine existence of an unusual odor is not advised deliberate smelling of envelopes and packages may expose personnel to chemical or biological agents the intent of this indica tor is that unusual odors may be detected under normal operating conditions and without close scrutiny ap192110 unusual weight the item may be unusually heavy or li ght for its size normal envelope weighs 1 to 2 ounces compared to letter bomb measur ing onefourth to one half inch thick it may appear to contain sma ll report or pamphlet rath er than few sheets of paper package may be unusually light if it co ntains only the firing device power source and explosive rather than whatever is listed on the exterior of the package such as books or other materials ap192111 unbalanced weight the balanc of the item may be uneven because of the way the explosives are placed or beca use they have shifted to one side ap192112 springiness in the top bottoms or sides this may result from the bomb having pressurereleasetype sw itch also the wires used to construct the device may cause the springiness ap192113 inflexibility the envelope may be inflexible if the firing device and other contents have been mounted on material to pr event shifting around while traveling through the mail system if the internal components have simply been glued or mounted to the sheet explosive the envelope may stay in flexed or semiflexed position when bent for official use only dod o200012h january 2004 477 for official use only ap192114 crease marks discoloration or st ains crease marks or stains such as those from potato chips or french fries may show on the outside this happens because many explosives sweat or exude the oil used in th eir manufacture such as motor semtexh or vegetable c4 oil ap192115 incorrect titles or title but name often spect envelopes or packages are addressed to figureheads such as commande r or director and not colonel jones or mr smith ap192116 excessive security material such as masking tape string etc to prevent inadvertent compromise of package contents exce ssive security material is used to ensure package integrity during transit ap192117 ticking beeping or other sounds seldom used analog timers are still possibility digital timers may em it faint beeps or other sounds ap192118 marked with restrictive endorse ments such as personal rush do not delay or confidential restrictive endorseme nts ensure suspect envelope or package is opened only by the target individual ap192119 evidence of powder or other contaminants chemical or biological contaminants can escape through envelope or package seams ap193 preventative measures ap1931 to minimize exposure to chemical or biologicalladen envelopes and packages mail handlers should use gloves when handling mail and have several large sealable bags nearby for isolating suspicious mail and discarding all cl othing worn when in contact with suspicious parcel surgical masks or prot ective masks and change of cl othing should also be kept in mailrooms powder coated gloves should be avoi ded as the powder may be associated with chemical or biological cont amination from the mail ap1932 commanders should be aware that i ndividual protective masks are commercially available which provide significa nt level of protection against i nhalation of certain biological agents high efficiency particulate air filter ma sks are relatively inexpensive available and effective discretionary use is advi sable to mitigate risk of exposure ap1933 personnel should be instructed on th location security procedures and process for disabling
