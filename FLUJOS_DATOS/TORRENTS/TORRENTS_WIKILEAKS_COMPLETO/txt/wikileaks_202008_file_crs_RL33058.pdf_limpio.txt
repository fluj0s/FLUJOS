school reform to expand the requirements of child left behind act of 2001 nclba at the high school levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33058crs3 1 adult education often has been included as part of k12 education presumably because the educational services are similar to those provided in regular elementary and secondary education programs in fy2006 the department of education ed began to classify adult education funding in an other education category however the office of management and budget omb continues to maintain such funding in the k12 category this report follows current omb practice and previous ed practice that includes adult education funds in the k12 category totals for k12 ducation funding in this report therefore differ from current ed totals which now exclude such fundingaccording to the february 6 2006 table of the department of education ed budget service the last time federal k12 funding decr eased from one year to the next was from fy1995 to fy1996 aggregate k12 funding in fy1995 was 146 billion the fy1996 amount was 144 billion for title i grants to leas special education and vocational nd adult education programs annual funding was most recently reduced in fy2006 both vocationa l and adult educati on were also reduced in fy2005 however the last reduction pr ior to fy2006 for special education was in fy1996 and for title i grants to

assistance act in ddition supplemental appropriations were enacted in fy2006 for k12 hurricane recovery programs to respond to the 2005 gulf coast hurricanes ed administers all of these programs nclba and esea funding provisions questions are regularly asked regarding the amount of funding provided by the nclba the nclba itself does not authorize or fund any program rather the nclba amended and extended other education laws primar ily esea annual funding for esea programs is easily tracked in the appropriations process funding for some nonesea programs amended by nclba however is not availabl on comparable basis in particular some nonesea programs are bureau of i ndian affairs bia programs operated by the department of the interior doi wh ere discretionary funding levels for some activities that were amended by nclba can be determined only following the close of the fiscal year because the esea accounted for 99 of the fy2002 appropriations for programs amended by nclba this

since the enactment of nclba in 2002 there has been continuing discussion regard ing the appropriations promised and the resulting shortfall when the enacted appr opriations are compared to authorization levels some would contend that the ea authorizations of appropriations as amended by nclba represent funding commitment that was promised in return for legislative support for the new adminis trative requirements made of state and local educational systems they would contend that the authorized levels are needed for implementing the new requirements and that the differences between promised and actual funding levels as shown in table 5 represent shortfall of billions of dollars for example the fy2006 appropriation was 120 billion less than the authorized amount and the accumulated tota l appropriation for the fiveyear period fy2002fy2006 was 392 billion less than the ma ximum authorized others would contend that the authorized funding leve ls represent more than appropriationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33058crs10 ceilings and as such are different from authorizations for most education programs that is when the authorizati on amount is specified it represents
