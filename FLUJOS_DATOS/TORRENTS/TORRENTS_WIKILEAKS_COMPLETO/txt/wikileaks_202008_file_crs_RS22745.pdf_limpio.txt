prohibits discriminatory treatment of employees on the basis of their religious beliefs and requires employers to make reasonable accommodations for employees religious practices religious organizations however may be exempt from some of the prohibitions of title vii congress regularly has proposed legislation that would amend the definition of religion under title vii and has introduced proposals to clarify which actions would qualify as religious discrimination under the act at times legislative proposals that would not directly affect title viis prohibition on religious discrimination raise questions related to the protections provided for religion therefore legislative proposals that would amend other parts of title vii may lead to interest in the current

g4g142g149g146g142g143g561g561 section 701 of title vii defines religion to include all aspects of religious observance and practice as well as belief unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employees or prospective employees religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employers business 3 this definition of religion forms the basis of requirements for employers under title vii under the statutory definition employers cannot use an employees or applicants religious observance or religious practice against the employee if the employer can reasonably accommodate the observance or practice without undue hardship on the business if an employer does discriminate based on religious observance or practice that can be reasonably accommodated the employer may be in violation of title viis prohibition on discrimination on the basis of religion sometimes whether particular observance or practice is religious is disputed religious practices and observances are generally considered to include moral or ethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with the strength of traditional religious views4 the belief does not need to be accepted by any religious group and does not need to be accepted by the religious group to which the individual belongs in order to qualify as religious under title vii5 courts have upheld this understanding that religious belief does not need to meet objective 1 42 usc 2000e et seq 2 for more information on title vii see the eeoc we bsite

practices under the cra this section prohibits employers from using religion as basis for hiring or discharging any individual it further prohibits employers from discriminating with respect to his compensation terms conditions or privileges of employment because of the individuals religion7 the section also prohibits employers from limiting or separating employees or applicants in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee 8 title vii generally prohibits employers from treating employees of one religion differently from the way they treat employees of another religion employers cannot consider religion when scoring results of employmentrelated tests9 cannot use religion as motivating factor for any action even if other factors also motivated the action10 cannot retaliate against any individual who opposed an employers action that is unlawful under title vii or participated in the investigation of the unlawful action 11 and cannot publish or advertise any preference based on religion unless that preference is based on bona fide occupational qualification12 the discrimination prohibited by title vii includes rassment that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victims employment and create an abusive working environment13 furthermore an employee cannot be required to participate in any religious activity as part of his or her employment14 g7g161g142g150g153g157g146g152g151g156g561 title vii does not apply to all situations of religious

the carrying on by such corporation association educational institution or society of its activities15 however the statute does not define religious corporation ssociation educational institution or society court decisions appear to indicate several factors relevant to deciding whether an organization qualifies for the exemption courts have considered 1 the purpose or mission of the organization 2 the ownership affiliation or source of financial support of the organization 3 requirements placed upon staff and members of the organization faculty and students if the organization is school and 4 the extent of religious practices in or the religious nature of products and services offered by the organization 16 title vii also provides two more specific exemptions one separate but similar exemption applies specifically to religious educational institutions that exemption allows such institutions to hire and employ employees of particular re ligion if the institution is in whole or in substantial part owned supported controlled or managed by particular religion or by particular organization or if the curriculum of the institution is directed toward the propagation of particular religion 17 the other exemption provided in title vii allows employers to discriminate on the basis of religion sex or national origin if those factors are bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise18 this exemption based on bona fide occupational qualifications has been construed narrowly19 accordingly courts have deemed valid discriminatory qualifications to arise only in situations where religion plays an extremely significant part of the work environment including for example jobs where employee safety is threatened because of the employees religious affiliation20 exemptions for religious organizations in the context of title vii are not absolute once an organization qualifies as an entity eligible for title vii exemption it is permitted to discriminate on the basis of religion in its employment decisions the exemption does not allow qualifying organizations to discriminate on any other basis forbidden by title vii thus although religious organization may consider an employee or applicants religion without violating title vii the organization may still violate title vii if it considers the individuals race color national origin or sex 21 furthermore the exemptions in title vii appear to apply only with respect to 15 42 usc 2000e1a the us supreme court unanimously upheld this exemption allowing religiously affiliated nonprofit entity to make employment decisions based on religion even if the position related to non religious activity of the organization see corp of the presiding bishop v amos 483 us 327 1987 faithbased service providers are also eligible for the exemption but if they receive government funding the funds cannot be used to directly advance the organizations

based on religion once an organization makes decision to employ an indi vidual the organization may not discriminate on the basis of religion regarding the terms and conditions of employment including compensation benefits privileges etc in other words religious organizations that decide to hire individuals with other religious beliefs cannot later choose to discriminate against those individuals with regard to wages or other benefits that the organization provides to employees22 it is important to note one more exemption relevant to title viis prohibition on religious discrimination religious organizations right to choose spiritual leaders is protected under the constitutions free exercise clause even before title vii granted an exemption to religious organizations hiring decisions generally the us supreme court recognized that the freedom to select the clergy has federal constitutional protection as part of the free exercise of religion against state interference 23 title viis prohibition on use of religion in employment decisions would appear to interfere with this constitutional freedom specific to clergy the judicially created ministerial exception as this protection has become known reconciles title vii with the free exercise clause by allowing religious or ganizations to select clergy without regard to any of title viis restrictions but requires that employment decisions made regarding other positions within the organization comply with title viis requirements or exemptions24

practices only if they can be reasonably accommodated without undue hardship on the employers business in other words the employer may discriminate on the basis of observances and practices that cannot be reasonably accommodated without undue hardship 25 eeoc regulations provide guidelines for what constitutes reasonable accommodation and undue hardship once an employee requests religious accommodation the employer must consider whether the requested accommodation is reasonable or what reasonable alternatives might be continued religions teachings the employee claimed that the action was unlawful sex discrimination based on her pregnancy if the court determines that the employers action was taken in response to the resulting pregnancy rather than because of violation of the faithbased policy the organization may be held in violation of title viis prohibition on sex discrimination in such cases if the court determines the discharge was based on religious teachings the organization can claim title vii exemption see boyd v harding academy of memphis inc 88 f3d 410 6 th cir 1996 22 eeoc notice n915 september 23 1987 23 kedroff v st nicholas cathedral 344 us 94 116

causing undue hardship the eeoc determines the reasonableness of the chosen accommodation by examining the alternatives considered by the employer and the alternatives actually offered to the employee27 if more than one manner of accommodation would not cause undue hardship the employer must offer the alternative which least disadvantages the individual with respect to his or her employment opportunities28 employee requests for accommodation arise most often because religious practices conflict with work schedules eeoc guidelines suggest three possible accommodation alternatives in such situations first the employer may permit voluntary substitute policy under which employees can find substitutes to cover their tasks during the conflict second employers may create flexible work schedule including flexible arrival and departure times floating holidays flexible breaks use of lunch time for early departure nd staggered work hours third the employer may consider lateral transfer for individuals whose religious practices cannot be accommodated in their current position 29 another common scenario in which employees request accommodations is under provision in collective bargaining ag reements that the employee must join labor organization or pay an amount equivalent to dues to that organization when an employee objects to this requirement on religious grounds the eeoc recommends that the organization make an exception for that employee or allow the employee to donate the equivalent of the amount due to charitable organization 30 requests for accommodation may also arise when an employees religious beliefs conflict with work requirement such as performing abortions treating gay patients or complying with dress codes31 in order for these accommodations to be appropriate under title vii they must not cause undue hardship to the employer employers cannot claim undue hardship on mere assumption that many more people may also need accommodation 32 the regulations provide two general bases that may justify undue hardship cost and seniority rights an employer may refuse to accommodate an employees religious practice if the accommodation would require more than minimis cost33 the eeoc determines whether an accommodation exceeds minimis cost by evaluating the cost incurred to the particular employer and the number of employees that will need the accommodation 34 generally administrative costs of rescheduling are considered minimis costs35 an employer may also refuse to accommodate because the accommodation would interfere with the preference guaranteed by seniority system36 because seniority systems create neutral way of minimizing the number of occasions when an employee must work on 26 see 29 cfr 16052 27

that seniority systems must give way when necessary to accommodate religious observances37 g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151g138g149g561g11g151g157g142g155g142g156g157g561 congress regularly has proposed legislation that would amend the definition of religion under title vii and has introduced proposals to clarify which actions would qualify as religious discrimination under the act38 at times legislative proposals that would not directly affect title viis prohibition on religious discrimination raise questions related to the protections provided for religion for instance the scope of title viis exemption for religious organizations has been significant in the debate for other nondiscrimi nation legislation the proposed employment non discrimination act of 2007 enda would have prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation39 because several religious organizations hold religious beliefs that prohibit homosexuality the bill led to debate regarding the continued applicability of title viis exemption therefore legislative proposals that would amend other parts of title vii may lead to interest in the current interpretation and protections offered to religious groups g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 cynthia brougher legislative attorney cbroughercrslocgov 7 9121 37 hardison 432 us at
