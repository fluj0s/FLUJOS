government and finance division nonna noto specialist in public finance government and finance division internet taxation issues and legislation summary congress is involved in issues of state and local taxation of internet transactions because commerce conducted by parties in different states over the internet falls under the commerce clause of the constitution currently the internet tax moratorium prohibits 1 new taxes on internet access services and 2 multiple or discriminatory taxes on internet commerce the moratorium was created by the internet tax freedom act itfa of 1998 112 stat 2681 and has been extended twice the original moratorium expired on october 21 2001 congress extended the moratorium through november 1 2003 with the internet tax nondiscrimination act pl 10775 the moratorium was extended for an additional four years through november 1 2007 by the internet tax nondiscrimination act pl 108435 on october 31 2007 pl 110108 the internet tax freedom act amendments act of 2007 was passed extending the moratorium through november 1 2014 generally taxes on internet access that have continued in place since before october 1 1998 are protected by grandfather clause an issue previously raised in connection with the internet tax moratorium concerned states streamlining their sales taxes in order to gain remote tax collection authority in the 110th congress s 34 and hr 3396 would grant states that comply with the streamlined sales and use tax agreement the authority to require remote sellers to collect state and local taxes on interstate sales another related issue is whether and how to have congress set the nexus standards under which state is entitled to impose business activity tax bat eg corporate net income tax franchise tax business and occupation tax gross receipts tax on company located outside the state but with some business activities in the state in the 110th congress s 1726 and its twin hr 5267 would establish

xi of division c of pl 105277 the omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act 19991 the itfa placed threeyear moratorium on the ability of state and local governments to 1 impose new taxes on internet access or 2 impose any multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce the act grandfathered the state and local access taxes that were generally imposed and actually enforced prior to october 1 1998 this initial internet tax moratorium expired on october 21 2001 the internet tax nondiscrimination act pl 10775 enacted on november 28 2001 provided for twoyear extension of the prior moratorium through november 1 2003 the moratorium was extended for an additional four years through november 1 2007 by the internet tax nondiscrimination act pl 108435 enacted on december 3 2004 taxes on internet access that were in place before october 1 1998 were protected by grandfather clause the 2004 pl 108435 extension also grandfathered prenovember 1 2003 taxes mostly on digital subscriber line or dsl services through november 1 2005 and excluded from the moratorium taxes on voice or similar service utilizing voice over internet protocol voip these services were not as prevalent at the time the original moratorium was enacted as part of compromise negotiations in the 108th congress the grandfathering protection for internet access taxes in wisconsin was limited to three years through november 1 2006 instead of four and the ability of texas municipalities to collect franchise fees from telecommunications providers that use public lands was protected the 2004 act included several modifications and refinements to the original itfa specifically the 2004 act extended the internet tax moratorium for four years retroactively one year to november 1 2003 and forward three years until november 1 2007 the moratorium barred state and local governments from imposing any new taxes on internet access or imposing any multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce clarified that the term tax on internet access applies regardless of whether the tax is imposed on provider or buyer of internet access 1 title xii was also part of s 442 105th congress the underlying itfa legislation titles xi and xii 112 stat 2681719 through 728 1998 title xi is codified as the itfa in 47 usc 151 note title xii is codified as 19 usc 2241 note crs2 made explicit that tax on internet access does not include tax levied on net income capital stock net worth or property value provided that the terms internet access and internet access service do not include telecommunications services except to the extent such services are purchased used or sold by provider of internet access to provide internet access this permits some portion of telecommunications services to be included under the tax moratorium extended the grandfather protection from november 1 2003 until november 1 2007 for state and local governments which taxed internet access prior to october 1 1998 an exception was made for state telecommunications service tax in wisconsin for which protection was extended only until november 1 2006 protection was extended only until november 1 2005 for taxes on internet access that were generally imposed and actually enforced as of november 1 2003 this provision applies mainly to taxes on digital subscriber line dsl services explicitly protected the texas municipal access line fee this provision is intended to protect the ability of texas municipalities to collect franchise fees from telecommunications providers that use public lands included new accounting rule that charges for internet access may be subject to taxation in cases where they are aggregated with charges for telecommunications services or other charges that are subject to taxation unless the internet access provider can reasonably identify the charges for internet access stated that nothing in the act prevents the collection of any charges for federal or state universal service programs for telephone service or for state or local 911 and e911 emergency call services nor does it affect any federal or state regulatory nontax proceeding such as fcc regulatory proceedings clarified that the moratorium does not apply to taxes on voice over internet protocol voip services this section does not apply to services that are incidental to internet access such as voicecapable email or instant messaging and provided for the gao government accountability office to study the effects of the internet tax moratorium on the revenues of state and local governments and on the deployment and adoption of broadband technologies for internet access throughout the united states including underserved rural areas the study was to compare deployment in states that tax broadband internet access service with states that do not the comptroller general was to report the findings conclusions and any recommendations from the crs3 study to the senate committee on commerce science and transportation and the house committee on energy and commerce by november 1 2005 the report was published in january 20062 issues the five main issues surrounding internet taxation and ecommerce that congress may address before the 2014 expiration are as follows whether or not to extend the moratorium on internet access taxes and if so temporarily or permanently whether if the moratorium were to be extended to continue to grant grandfather protection for states that imposed taxes on internet access before the original moratorium was enacted how to better define internet access and discriminatory taxes to the satisfaction of all stakeholders whether to grant states the authority to require remote sellers to collect use taxes if the states adopted streamlined sales tax system and if congressional codification of guidelines is needed for establishing whether or not business engaged in interstate commerce has nexus in jurisdiction for purposes of business activity tax bat eg corporate income tax franchise tax business license tax liability these issues remain similar to those considered in 2004 and 2007 the two most recent times the internet tax moratorium was temporarily extended growth in internet technology and electronic commerce however may generate new policy questions before 2014 the moratorium permanent vs temporary extension the intent of the internet tax freedom act enacted in 1998 was to prevent state taxes on internet access to ensure that multiple jurisdictions could not tax the same electronic commerce transaction and to ensure that commerce over the internet would not be singled out for discriminatory tax treatment supporters of extending the moratorium contend that the internet should continue to be protected from the administrative and financial burdens of taxation in order to further advance of internet technology and associated economic activity3 opponents of extending the 2 us government accountability office internet access tax moratorium revenue impacts will vary by state gao06273 jan 2006 3 us congress committee on commerce science and transportation internet tax non continued crs4 moratorium contend that federal moratorium infringes on the states independent authority to levy taxes and further that internet transactions and services should not be afforded preferential tax treatment supporters of permanent extension of the moratorium maintain it would eliminate the need for congress to revisit the issues surrounding internet taxation when temporary moratorium expires permanent extension presumably could also provide both the producers and consumers of internet services greater certainty about state and local taxation of the internet opponents on the other hand say permanent extension would not address the underlying issue of federal restrictions on state taxation nor would it clarify the definition of internet access opponents of permanent extension of the moratorium point out that temporary one would allow congress to periodically review the conditions of the moratorium and the effect of the moratorium on the states reassessment could then be made in the context of developments in computer technology and business organization as well as state and local government tax administration temporary extension could also provide more time for the states to further simplify their sales and use taxes see the discussion below on streamlined sales taxes and remote collection authority allowing the moratorium to sunset would permit states to tax internet access although in practice the trend has been for states to repeal their internet access taxes as internet technology continues to change the telecommunications industry however state and local governments will likely modify how the industry is taxed sunset of the moratorium could induce states to address the taxation of telecommunications more broadly grandfathering of existing access taxes the internet tax freedom act exempted from the moratorium taxes on internet access that were generally imposed and actually enforced prior to october 1 1998 when itfa legislation was being considered in the spring of 1998 10 states and the district of columbia were already applying their sales tax to internet access services4 subsequently connecticut iowa tennessee and the district of columbia eliminated their tax on internet access and south carolina has not enforced the collection of its tax during the federal moratorium these developments left six states imposing sales tax or equivalent tax on internet access as of january 2006 new mexico north dakota ohio on commercial use only south dakota texas on monthly charges over 25 and wisconsin5 in addition hawaii levies its general excise

through november 1 2003 the act further extended the grandfathering protection for preoctober 1998 taxes through november 1 2007 second grandfathering issue arose in 2004 as states began to tax internet access provided through digital subscriber lines dsl highspeed telephone service dsl is considered telecommunication service and was exempt from the original moratorium and thus taxable itfa grandfathered prenovember 2003 taxes mostly taxes on dsl service through november 1 2005 the last extension discontinued the grandfathering protection for grandfathered states that had repealed or stopped enforcing collection of the sales tax on internet access services7 in its cost estimates for hr 49 and s 150 in the 108th congress the congressional budget office cbo determined that eliminating the grandfathering protection for internet access taxes would impose an intergovernmental mandate as defined in the unfunded mandates reform act umra 2 usc 150115718 according to cbo the prohibition of taxes on internet access that were then collected in up to 10 states in 2003 at the time of the cbo study more states had internet access taxes and few local jurisdictions in six states would cost these jurisdictions approximately 80 million to 120 million per year this estimate alone exceeded the umra threshold of 59 million in 2003 in the case of hr 49 and 64 million in 2007 adjusted annually for inflation in the case of s 150 cbo noted that additional state and local revenues could be lost if more telecommunications services and information content were redefined as internet access definitions as noted earlier the itfa tax moratorium prohibits new taxes on internet access and multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce the acts definitions of internet access and of discriminatory tax in particular have been the source of some concern and legal uncertainty for state and local governments providers of newtechnology internet access service

universal service programs and companies with dotcom subsidiaries taxation of internet access the taxation of internet access most commonly refers to the application of state and local sales and use taxes to the monthly charges that retail subscribers pay for access to the internet these payments may go to traditional dialup internet service providers isps or to the local telephone or cable tv company according to the federation of tax administrators the tax may also take the form of sales and use tax or excise tax levied specifically on telecommunications information services or data processing services the definition of which encompasses charges for internet access pl 108435 clarified that tax on internet access applies regardless of whether the tax is imposed on provider or buyer of internet access9 pl 110108 further refined the definition of internet access to include homepage electronic mail and instant messaging services10 telecommunications industry concerns telecommunications carriers were concerned that internet access offered through primarily telecommunications technologies such as dsl or wireless services might not be treated as exempt from tax while access offered over other technologies such as cable modem would be exempt in an attempt to address these concerns both pl 110108 and pl 108435 provided that all forms of telecommunications services used to provide internet access would be exempt from state and local taxes under the moratorium11 state and local government concerns before enactment of pl 108 435 state and local governments were concerned that the tax moratorium could be interpreted to go far beyond retail internet access ultimately pl 108435 made explicit that the term tax on internet access would not include tax levied on net income capital stock net worth or property value it extended the grandfather protection for existing internet access taxes until november 1 2007 with the exception of wisconsin where protection ended on november 1 2006 it explicitly protected the texas municipal access line fee this protects the ability of texas municipalities to collect franchise fees from telecommunications providers that use public lands pl 110108 clarified further the types of taxes that were outside of the moratorium in addition state and local governments were concerned that with the growth of internet telephony voice over internet protocol voip there would be less traditional telephone service or plain old telephone service pots remaining in the tax base currently state and local taxes on voice telephone services produce 12 9 recent gao op cit jan 2006 p 23 report concluded that isp acquired services are not protected by the moratorium 10 see section 42 of pl 110108 11 for more information see us

first sentence of the definition of internet access shown above gives rise to concern on the part of state and local revenue departments that the taxprotection of internet access may extend to bundled products and services that might otherwise be taxable if purchased on their own these could include data and information services cable television books magazines games music and video on demand for example these types of products and services can be offered online and sold as part of an internet access service14 pl 108435 included new accounting rule which addressed the bundling issue under this rule internet access service may be taxable if access fees are aggregated with fees for otherwisetaxable telecommunications services if the internet access provider can reasonably identify the charges for internet access then the internet access however is not taxable funding universal service some members of congress were concerned about protecting the financing source for the universal service fund usf15 the usf is administered by the universal service administrative company an independent notforprofit organization operating under the auspices of the federal communications commission fcc the usf is financed by mandatory contributions from interstate telecommunications carriers16 companys usf contribution is percentage of its interstate and international enduser revenues17 12 michael

carriers for their states universal service fund18 supporters of the universal service programs were concerned that efforts to protect internet access and associated telecommunications services should not reduce the funding base for universal service the moratorium does not prevent the federal government or the states from imposing or collecting the fees or charges on telecommunications that are used to finance the universal service program nor does it prevent states or local governments from collecting fees or charges to support 911 or e911 emergency services nor does it affect any federal or state regulatory proceeding that is not related to taxation multiple taxes the ban on multiple taxes prohibits more than one state or more than one local jurisdiction at the same level of government ie more than one county or one city from imposing tax on the same transaction unless credit is offered for taxes paid to another jurisdiction however the state county and city in which an electronic commerce transaction takes place could all levy their sales taxes on the transaction discriminatory taxes in practice the ban on discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce means that transactions arranged over the internet are to be taxed in the same manner as mailorder or telephone sales under the current judicial interpretation of nexus as applied to mailorder sales state cannot require an outof state seller to collect use tax from the customer unless the seller has physical presence in the taxing state19 use tax is the companion tax to the sales tax applicable to interstate sales congress or the supreme court would need to act to grant or approve the states ability to require outofstate tax collection whether the transaction was arranged over the internet or by mail order telephone or other means the second part of the itfas definition of discriminatory tax lists conditions under which remote sellers use of computer server an internet access service or online services does not establish nexus these circumstances include the sole ability to access site on remote sellers outofstate computer server the display of remote sellers information or content on the outofstate computer server of provider of internet access service or online services and processing of orders through the outofstate computer server of provider of internet access service or online services some businesses have taken advantage of these nexus limits in the itfas definition of discriminatory tax to establish what are referred to as internet 17 continued on the financing needs of

operations are free from sales and use tax collection requirements critics object that these methods of business organization are an abuse of the definition of discriminatory tax streamlined sales taxes and remote collection authority in earlier congresses the debate surrounding legislation to extend the internet tax moratorium was linked to the states quest for sales and use tax collection authority the issue continues to be whether congress is willing to grant states the authority to require remote outofstate sellers to collect use taxes on interstate sales conditioned on simplification of state and local sales and use tax systems bills were introduced in conjunction with an extension of the moratorium that enumerated criteria for simplified sales and use tax system and procedures for congress to grant tax collection authority in contrast in the 108th congress and continuing into the 109th and 110th congress the sales tax issue has been pursued separately from the moratorium remote collection issue under current law vendor with substantial nexus usually defined as physical presence in its customers state collects the state and local sales tax on sales arranged over the internet or by telephone mail order or other means in contrast an outofstate vendor without substantial nexus in the customers state is not required to collect the sales tax20 technically the customer is required to remit use tax to his or her state of residence21 in practice however use tax compliance by nonbusiness purchasers is low because of this low compliance many states have long wanted to require outofstate vendors without physical presence in the respective states referred to as remote sellers to collect the use tax from the customer this would apply to all interstate sales whether arranged over the internet or by mailorder catalog telephone or other means the streamlined sales and use tax agreement ssuta acknowledging administrative complexity as major obstacle to remote collection authority the states began concerted effort to simplify state and local sales and use tax through the streamlined sales tax project sstp22 the project commenced in march 2000 midway through the initial itfa moratorium october 1998 october 2001 as of february 27 2008 17 states were designated as full members for having approved model interstate agreement to simplify their sales tax systems 20 in 1967 and again in 1992 the supreme court invited the congress to take action on this issue see the following decisions national bellas hess inc v illinois department of revenue 386 us 753 1967 and quill corp v north dakota 504 us 298 1992 21 the use tax is the companion tax to the sales tax created to ensure that crossborder transactions are not favored in the state tax code 22 for more on the streamlined sales and use tax agreement see crs report rl34211 state and local taxes and the streamlined sales and use tax agreement by steven maguire crs10 known as the streamlined sales and use tax agreement ssuta23 the agreement establishes uniform definitions for taxable goods and services and requires that participating state and local government have only one statewide tax rate for each type of product another five states are associate members for partially complying with the ssuta each state would retain the power to define which products are taxable and establish its tax rate in the 110th congress s 34 enzi and hr 3396 delahunt would grant states that comply with the ssuta the authority to require remote sellers to collect state and local use taxes on interstate sales business activity tax bat nexus standards the possibility that states could be authorized to require remote vendors to collect sales and use taxes on interstate sales raised concerns that states would then attempt to impose income and other business taxes on those vendors in response some multistate businesses asked congress to clarify nexus standards for state and local business activity taxes bats24 past court decisions and the landmark pl 86272 enacted in 1959 15 usc 381 et seq clarified nexus by identifying those activities which would not establish nexus generally soliciting the sale of tangible goods in state for shipment by common carrier from locations outside the state would not be sufficient to trigger nexus proponents of federally defined nexus standards contend that current federal law does not sufficiently define substantial nexus the issue before congress is whether to codify nexus rules for intangible property and services not just tangible goods as provided for in pl 86272 currently each state independently implements rules that establish nexus for economic activities that are not covered by pl 86272 although state rules are very similar for many services and activities there is still significant variation among states on the threshold for establishing nexus in theory congress could establish uniform federal standards for imposing state business activity taxes on outofstate businesses some representatives of state and local governments however are concerned that enacting federal nexus guidelines could restrict their ability to levy corporate income taxes or other bats on business activities conducted in their state for example if congress implemented thresholds at the midpoint level of all existing state nexus rules by definition many states would lose taxpayers that did not meet 23 the states are arkansas indiana iowa kansas kentucky michigan minnesota nebraska new jersey north carolina north dakota
