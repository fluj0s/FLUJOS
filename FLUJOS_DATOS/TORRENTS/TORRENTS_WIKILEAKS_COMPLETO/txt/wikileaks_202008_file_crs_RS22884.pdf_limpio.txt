interstate compact agencies state and local governments and even individuals the constitutionality of such delegation and of the exercise of such power by even private delegatees is today beyond dispute however among delegatees with both federal and private characteristics there is some subjectivity to deciding which to list in report limited to nonfederal entities for delegatees of federal eminent domain power listed here delegations since 1920 have primarily been to amtrak hydroelectric facilities for dams and reservoirs and entities engaged in the movement of electricity gas and petroleum the last one expired and for interstate bridgeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs228841 as in england whence the concept derives the power of eminent domain has always been regarded by us courts as inherent in the nature of sovereignty boom co v patterson 98 us 403 406 1878 as such it requires constitutional recognition thus the federal eminent domain power may be thought of as existing in absolute and unlimited form were it not for the two constraints imposed by the fifth amendment takings clause nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation emphasis

expire d and for interstate bridges introduction as sovereign government the united st ates has the power of eminent domain the right to take private property for pub lic use upon payment of just compensation1 the judicial procedure for formally invoking this power is known as condemnation congress routinely delegates eminent domain power to executive branch agencies for their use in carrying out federal programs that require the acquisition of property interests among executive branch agencies engaged in condemnation most frequently in recent times are the department of ho meland security in connecti on with construction of the usmexico border fence and the us army corps of engineers and general services administrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22884crs2 2 see eg united states v 24322

pass scrutiny under the public use clause 4 id at 240 quoting berman v parker 348 us 26 33 1954 5 the text sentence is an implicit reference to the supreme courts highprofile decision in kelo v city of new london 545 us 469 2005 at issue ther was the fifth amendment takings clauses requirement that eminent domain be ex ercised only for public use the court held 54 that this publicuse requirement was not violated by local redevelopment agencys attempting to condemn private land for transfer to private developer solely for purposes of economic development pursuant to properly adopted areawide plan promoting economic development is public purpose the court made clear and under prior precedent public purpose may be equated with public use at least that is how the fivejustice majority saw it the four remaining justices generally regarded as conservative took narrower view of public use one that excluded compelled privatetoprivate transfers solely for economic development the addition of new conservative justice to the court could transform this dissent in to majority view nonetheless most of the kelo dissenters as suggested by the principal dissent by justice oconnor seem amenable to privatetoprivate condemnation when essential for important national purposes then too the kelo decision is only three years old and the cour t has often but not always been averse to overturning recently established precedent 6 see eg united states v eight tracts of land in town of brookhaven 270 f supp 160 163 edny 1967less frequently congress delegates the federal eminent domain power to entities outside the federal government our topic here the ability of congress to do so is today beyond dispute moreover congress has fr ee hand in choosing the delegatee and may confer the power on public and private corporations agencies created by interstate compact state or local govern ments and even individuals2 notwithstanding that the fifth amendment takings clause requi res that condemnations be for public use condemnation by private party meets this demand by being part of congressional scheme having public purpose3 which is to say any congressional scheme within congresss constitutionally granted powers4 the fact that private benefit to the delegateecondemnor is mixed in with the public benefit is not constitutionally fatal even should the conservative bloc on the supr eme court be enlarged by the appointment of new justices it is unlikely that the constitutionality of eminent domain delegations to private parties will soon be called into questi on merely on that ground5 unsurprisingly private delegatees of fe deral eminent domain power are subject to the same constitutional constrai nts as public delegatees grants of condemnation power also may be subject to any c onditions congress deems necessary6 if acting within its statutory mandate the delegatee of federal eminent domain power whether federal or nonfederal stands in the same position as congress in that the delegatee may determine all questions that are legislative rather than judicial in nature that is whether when and the extent to wh ich eminent domain may be used in the event of statutory ambiguity however the private delegatee is at disadvantage first grantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22884crs3 7 national rr passenger cor p v two parcels of land 822 f2d 1261 126465 2d cir 1987 united

exerci sed through dc code 630104a 12 federal condemnation power exercised throug h dc code 2121919 an argument could be made that in contrast with the district of columbia redevelopment land agency the corporation is sufficiently nonfederal to be listed here see eg dc code 2121902 the national capital revitalization corporation is established as body corporate and an independent instrumentality of the district with legal existence separ ate from that of the district government emphasis added owing to congresss pervasive authority over the district however we ve opted not to list it parenthetically the corporations power of eminent domain is actually redelegation of the federal power from the united states to the district of columbia to the corporationof eminent domain power are strictly construed against private grantees of the power they do not receive the deference acco rded governmental condemnors7 second where the proposed use of land by nongovernmental grantee would interfere with an existing public use court may deny the power of condemnation unless the legislature has authorized it either expressly or by nece ssary implication nor do we find any instances where congress has authorized purely privat delegatees to use the quick take mechanism available to federal condemnors by which the condemnor may obtain title and possession of land expeditiously without aw aiting the conclusion of the condemnation trial8 the restriction in the report title to nonfederal entities calls for some definition entities that have been granted federal eminent domain power run the gamut from purely federal executive branch agencies and the architect of the capitol to purely private eg natural gas pipeline companies nd hydroelectric companies close to the purely federal end of this spectrum hence excluded from the nonfederal entities list that follows is the national capital planni ng commission which includes some members appointed by the district of columbia mayor9 also close to purely federal and excluded from the list is the district of columbia government10 and its agencies and instrumentalities such as the district of columbia redevelopment land agency11 and the national capital revitalization corporation12 the district of columbia is so intimately connected with the federal government as to effectively be an agency thereof the washington metropolitan area transit authority is listed here because its delegated federal power of eminent domain applies not only in the dist rict but also in maryland and virginiahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22884crs4 13 49
