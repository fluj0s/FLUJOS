tactical aide memoire aatam issue 50 jan 05 the purpose of the insert is to provide useful set of aides and headings for all personnel deployed in iraq structure and use the design of the insert is such that it can be fitted alongside the aatam and service pocket books in the ring binder provided several subjects are included which should be found in the aatam however that is not due for republication until 2008 it is intended that common areas will migrate from this insert at that stage ie reports patrolling actions on tasking eod heli drills mine awareness vcps indirect fire sp ecas media replacementextra copies commanders should note that once the initial distribution of the insert has been made to their formationunits it is not intended that any further issues should be made during the subsequent tour msn sp gp will maintain and control small stock of reserves in case of need but application to replace or increase the initial distribution will need to have proper and adequate justification passed to so1 msn sp for considerationvii restrictedrestricted edition 6 nov 07this aide memoire is for guidance only detailed advice can be obtained from mndseapplication through leadership although doctrine and tactics techniques procedures ttps provide practical guidance on the conduct of operations their publication alone will not sufficiently add to operational success unless soldiers understand doctrine are well trained in ttps and are sufficiently motivated to carry out their tasks to the best of their ability their effectiveness on the battlefield as individuals or as part of team will be limited it is leadership which ensures that training is effective and that drills are learned and followed correctly it is leadership which drives effective action and motivates soldiers to give their utmost to achieve the common purpose it is leadership which turns the bald statements of fact in this publication into life saving or battle winning action and moreover it is strong leaders who recognise that doctrine writers do not have monopoly on wisdom and adapt and develop this guidance to win in the contemporary operating environmentviii

to the associated dangers from conducting this coa setting css up for future attacks providing guarantee of the disruption of the ied potentially leaving the rest of daisy chain ied still ready to function etc this aide memoire does not give authority to carry out projectile attack of susieds aim to advise commanders on the safest method of carrying out projectile attack if their co has authorised the specific attack aim of projectile attack to cause an ied to detonate projectile attack may break up device or cause it to burn or deflagrate burn very fast detonation is the desired result because it gives reliable indication that the targeted object has been destroyed if the device breaks up there is guarantee that it is longer threat if the he starts to burn it may burn to detonation the charge can still detonate for up to 30 min after all signs of burning have disappeared and potentially still create an efp effect77 restrictedrestricted edition 6 nov 07general guidance do not approach the susied do not attempt to get closer to take photos remember remote observation and confirmation where possible can 4cs op be instigated and an iedd team tasked if not assess if there is an alternate route bypassing the ied is preferable to projectile attack remember to mark the position of the susied and report it to hq before by passing the device if alternate route do you have authority to attack the susied only the bg co bde cos or deployed ato can authorise projectile attack of ieds give your hq as much informationdetail about the susied in order for them to determine whether they should authorise this form of attack assume the ied will detonate when subjected to projectile attack take appropriate precautions to preserve life both mnf and civilian consider appropriate cordon distance 100 200 or 400m cordon size identify appropriate hard cover and ensure everybody is out of line of sight from the device aim for the centre of mass of the susied observe the outcome of projectile attack from undercover78 restrictedrestricted edition 6 nov 07 report the outcome to hq once content that the danger from the susied has been negated continue with your mission selecting position to carry out the attack where possible never attack an ied from less than 100m away possibility of directional charge efp claymore which way is it pointing normally across an obvious contact point are friendly forces within that arc safety trace of the ammunition being used are friendly forces within the trace attack from different direction find an unpredictable site to attack the susied from somewhere off the road do not set patterns aif will watch analyse and target your patterns if the attacking vehicle is confined to the track vary the distance to the ied when carrying out attacks do not set pattern of bg always attacking ieds from predictable distance 100m vary the distances by bounds of at least 20m do not set patterns aif will watch analyse and target your patterns79 restrictedrestricted edition 6 nov 07selecting weapon to carry out the attack 30 mm he rounds are the best round for projectile attack they have the best chance of detonating the ied main charge 762 mm can be used with single aimed shots chain gun is an area weapon and is unlikely to cause the main charge to detonate chain gun can often make the ied even more unstable and dangerous chain gun is last resort post attack if the susied detonates search from distance for other charges in possible daisy chain before progressing if the susied ignites attack again and try to cause the susied to detonate if it continues to burn and will not detonate do not approach or drive past for at least 30 min after the last sign of burning it could still explode if the susied breaks up continue attacking until certain that the components are separated before searching from distance for other charges in possible daisy chain never approach the site of the susied carry on with your previous task do not stop to take photos 710 restrictedrestricted edition 6 nov 07back at base location ensure that the report in soi 325 is completed and forwarded to s02 j3 eod conclusion if it is

the thickness is required b block joints concrete block joints must be staggered as the blocks readily crumble at their edges c fill material well graded aggregate should be used in preference to sand where possible both however are preferable to topsoil d single vs multilayers single layer of material provides more protection than the equivalent thickness in multiple layers eg 10mm thick steel plate prevents more fragments than 2 x 5mm thick steel plates724 restrictedrestricted edition 6 nov 07sandbag wall construction sandbags are filled 34 full and their necks called chokes tied with the string attached when laid they need to be compacted normally beaten with shovel or pick helve into standard sized rectangular block 050 x 025 x 0125 m if they are not compacted they will not provide the expected protection and are likely to collapse b chokes must be are tucked under the bag to prevent bursting and neither chokes nor side seams should be placed in the outer face of wall because these are the places where they tend to burst the corners of each bag should be tucked in as they are laid c sandbags are laid in horizontal courses like bricks the bottom course consists of sandbags laid head on headers while the next course consists of sandbags laid lengthwise along the wall stretchers subsequent courses are composed alternately of headers and stretchers it is important to maintain the bonding when the wall turns corner figure 1 illustrates how this is achieved at point should the joints between the sandbags be aligned with joint on the course above or below therefore preventing any weak points725 restrictedrestricted edition 6 nov 07d where sandbag wallsbunkers are built on top of existing buildings or structures royal engineer advice should be obtained at the first opportunity to determine if the building needs to be reinforced to take the extra weightcourse 1 3 5 etc course 2 4 6 etc small 34 length of normal sandbags726 restrictedrestricted edition 6 nov 07bolthole construction where there is high threat of indirect fire successful method to mitigate the effect of ground burst is to construct bolthole 6 blocks long and 3 blocks wide around an individuals sleeping area using 400 x 200 x 200mm high density concrete blocks obtained through the royal engineers this will protect the occupant from the fragments from an adjacent ground bursting rocket or mortar nb the blocks are heavy 38kg and need firm base and to be handled with care side view elevation plan overhead end view elevationedition 6 nov 07common abbreviations ansar islam apr
