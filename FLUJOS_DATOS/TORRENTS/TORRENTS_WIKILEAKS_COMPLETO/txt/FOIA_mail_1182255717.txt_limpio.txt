from thomasrkarl thomasrkarlnoaagov to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re fw retraction request date tue 19 jun 2007 082157 0400 cc weichyung wang wangclimatecestmalbanyedu thanks phil we r now responding to former tv weather forecaster who has got press he has web site of 40 of the ushcn stations showing less than ideal exposure he claims he can show urban biases and exposure biases we are writing response for our public affairs not sure how it will play out regards tom phil jones said the following on 6192007 422 am weichyung and tom the climate audit web site has new thread on the jones et 1990 paper with lots of quotes from keenan so they may not be going to submit something to albany well may be just agreed to review paper by ren et for jgr this refers to paper on urbanization effects in china which may be in press in j climate i say may be as ren isnt that clear about this in the text references and responses to earlier reviews have requested jgr get copy copy of this in order to do the review in the meantime attaching this paper by ren et on urbanization at two sites in china nothing much else to say except 1 think ive managed to persuade uea to ignore all further foia requests if the people have anything to do with climate audit 2 had an email from david jones of bmrc melbourne he said they are ignoring anybody who has dealings with ca as there are threads on it about australian sites 3 ca is in dispute with ipcc susan solomon and martin manning about the availability of the responses to reviewers at the various stages of the ar4 drafts they are

director asrcsunyalbany dr keenan the only valid scientific issue described in your june 11 2007 emailed pdf file attached here as reference concerning our 1990 grl paper is the station histories while others are strictly your own opinions and therefore irrelevant to your inquiry so let elaborate further on this issue digitization of the hard copies of station histories was prepared in 198990 by ms zhaomei zeng iapcas only for the 60station network while the station histories of other stations including those we used in 1990 urban warming study were available in paper form as i have already indicated in my 43007 email to you therefore the use of the word fabrication in your document is totally absurd concerning the current status of these hard copies of station histories ms zeng told when i was in beijing in april 2007 that she longer has the access to these information because it has been long time since 1990 and also iap has moved office but if you are interested you can make an inquiry to the china meteorological administration using the web site 4http2111471625ywwzaboutcmaphp i believe that i have made it very clear what we had done with regard to the station histories in 1990 urban warming study what and how you are going to proceed from now on is entirely your decision wcw dr weichyung wang professor of applied sciences atmospheric sciences research

zhaomei 12zzmteaaccn sent monday 30 april 2007 614 subject re retraction request dr keenan the discussion with ms zeng last week in beijing have reaffirmed that she used the hard copies of station histories to make sure that the selected stations for the study of urban warming in china have relatively few if any changes in instrumentation location or observation times over the study period 19541983 regards wcw 4222007 446 pm email wang to keenan dear dr keenan i was really surprised to see your email below after i logged into sunya webmail in nanjingchina after several days of disconnection from internet while travelling in central china i flew to china early morning on 414 the day after your call to my office when i was in meeting my understanding was that you are going to call again but you never did in any case becuase of 414 trip to china i origionally plan to respond to your 411 emailed questions when i return to albany the end of this month to answer your questions more accurately i need to look into the file if i can find it since it has been long time and also contact the coauthor ms zeng who brought the data and visited sunya as visiting scientist from the institute of atmospheric physics chinese academy of sciences during that time regards wcw original message from dj keenan 13dougkeenaninformathorg date friday april 20 2007 831 am subject retraction request dear dr wang regarding the chinese meteorological data analyzed by wang et grl 1990 and jones et nature 1990 it now seems clear that there are severe problems in particular the data was obtained from 84 meteorological stations that can be classified as follows 49 have histories 08 have inconsistent histories 18 have substantial relocations 02 have singleyear relocations 07 have relocations furthermore some of the relocations are very distantover 20 km others are to greatly different environments as illustrated here 14httpwwwclimateauditorgp1323comment102970 the above contradicts the published claim to have considered the histories of the stations especially for the 49 stations that have histories yet the claim is crucial for the research conclusions i emailed you about this on april 11th i also phoned you on april 13th you said that you were in meeting and would get back to i have received response i ask you to retract your grl paper in full and to retract the claims made in nature about the chinese data if you do not do so i intend to publicly submit an allegation of research misconduct to your university at albany douglas j keenan 15httpwwwinformathorg
