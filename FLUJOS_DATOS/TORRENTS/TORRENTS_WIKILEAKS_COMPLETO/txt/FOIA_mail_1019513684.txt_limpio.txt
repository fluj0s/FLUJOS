should he be renominated anyway why should not an indian scientist chair ipcc one could argue the cc issue is more important for the south than for the north watson has perhaps thrown his weight about too much in the past the science is well covered by susan solomon in wgi so why not get an engineereconomist since many of the issues now raised by cc are more to do with energy and money than natural science if the issue is that exxon have lobbied and pressured bush then ok this is regrettable but to be honest is anyone really surprised all these decisions about ipcc chairs and cochairs are deeply

summary issue today april 19 2002 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc plenary voted for dr rajendra pachauri as the sole chair of the ipcc dr pachauri an economist and engineer will replace dr robert watson an atmospheric chemist as chair of the ipcc this outcome was actively sought by the bush administration at the behest of the most conservative elements of the fossil fuel industry this development threatens to undermine the scientific credibility and integrity of the ipcc and may weaken the job this extraordinary body has done to bring the worlds attention to one of the most pressing environmental problems action monitor your local paper and respond to news stories with lettertotheeditor main message given the bush administrations consistent opposition to climate change mitigation it is especially imperative at this time that the scientific community and dr pachauri work together to ensure that the ipcc remains strong and credible scientific process deadline as soon as possible after the story runs in your paper preferably the same day but later than day or two after the issue according to report by associated press today appended below dr rajendra pachauri was elected as chair of the ipcc at plenary meeting in geneva as you would be aware from our earlier ssi alerts of the past several weeks this follows on from intense lobbying of the us government by the fossil fuel industry to remove dr robert watson as chair although reports from geneva are still sketchy our sources on the ground tell us that there was intense behindthe scenes lobbying by saudi arabia with assistance from don pearlman well known oil and gas lobbyist with strong connections to industrybacked organizations opposed to climate change mitigation through their maneuvering the cochair compromise approach comprised of former chair dr robert watson and dr pachauri was not considered as result of this election there is considerable concern in the climate science and environmental communities reinforced by the intensive lobbying from fossil fuel interests on this decision that the bush administrations lack of support for former ipcc chair dr robert watson signals more general lack of support for the ipcc as credible international scientific assessment process that provides governments with sound information on climate science impacts and solutions by supporting dr pachauri for primarily political purposes the bush administration has seriously threatened the scientific credibility of the ipcc process the conservative fossil fuel interests should be exposed for their role in influencing the us governments stance on this issue and the ipcc process must remain scientifically credible and nonpoliticized process the next ipcc climate change assessment is due out in five years and it is the chairs role to oversee this complex process the scientific communitys voice is important in this issue to ensure that the ipcc process remains strong under the leadership of dr pachauri and that the bush administration does not erode the effectiveness of this important international body the action monitor your local paper and

description of your scientific expertise your involvement with the ipcc process or the importance of the climate issue to your community for the past 10 years the ipccs science has been the foundation for sound policymaking on the climate issue the ipccs unique intergovernmental approach to scientific consensus has worked amazingly well but is now threatened it is disturbing that the bush administration sought and received advice from the fossil fuel industry on the leadership of an important scientific body such as the ipcc politicized ipcc threatens the integrity and credibility of the scientific process there are fears that it will now be easier for the us to distance itself from the ipcc process you may point out that the us already rejected the kyoto protocol last year it is vital that the scientific process for the next assessment report due out in another five years not be compromised so that the ipcc continues to produce sound science on climate change the credibility of the ipccs third assessment report tar findings were strongly affirmed by the us national academy of sciences nas which published its supportive report in response to president bushs request for an independent assessment on the state of climate science supplemental information dr rajendra k pachauri is an indian engineer and economist pachauri formerly one of the five vice chairs of the ipcc is
