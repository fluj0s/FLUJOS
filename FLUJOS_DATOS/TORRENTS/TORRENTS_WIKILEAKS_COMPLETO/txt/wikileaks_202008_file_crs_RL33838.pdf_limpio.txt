the creation of forum to reach agreement on an interoperable communications plan congress has not passed legislation howev er regarding how the soontobereleased spectrum should be used there are currently three major initiatives to develop plans that could incorporate spectrum at 700 mhz in solu tions for public safety communications to improve interoperabilit and resiliency one initiativ is congresss mandate to dhs to bring together diverse body of ex perts and develop national emergency communications plan that would rely at least in part on shared networks second an initiative by the administration to improve spectrum efficiency gives responsibility to the national telecommuni cations and information administration ntia3 to provide policy recommendations that include spectrum uses

mhz assigned to public safety for shared network that would operate under its regu latory supervision4 the fccs proposal includes many elemen ts favored by majority of public safety participants5 but by taking over the mana gement of public safety radio channels at 700 mhz it woul d apparently minimize the ro of the department of homeland security dhs in planning fo r interoperable communications some of the unresolved policy choices brought into focus by the fcc proposal are direction of nationa l planning for emergency communications control of network operations joint management by agencies regulatory vs legislative authority spectrum management congressional jurisdiction funding sources and distribution the schedule set for rulemaking means th at the fcc could move forward in the creation of an interoperabl network as early as spring 2007 congress may change the terms of the debate by setting its own timetable objectives and parameters for creating national authority to manage public safety network at 700 mhz options for congress that have been suggested by public safety experts include requiring the department of homeland security to ex pedite its own plans requiring greater participation of the fcc in the dhs planning process curtailing the right of the fcc to regulate network development for public safety and turning over management of spectrum used for public safety to the ntia there are also other efforts and proposals some of which are summarized in this report that congress may consider background importance of spectrum radio frequency spectrum is used for all forms of wireless communications spectrum licenses are allocated within bands of designated frequenc ies divided into bandwidths or channels licenses are assigned as is the case for state and local public safety agencies or auctioned to commercial entities as new wireless tools are developed to help emergency responde rs the demand for spectrum increases finding appropriate spectrum to carry these vital transmissions as well as finding ways to use spectrum more efficiently are among the policy decisions to be addressed as part of the national effort to deve lop robust interoperable emergency communications capability httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33838crs3 6 estimated at approximately 97 mhz in testimony of michael k powell chairman federal communications commission at hearing of senate committee on commerce science and transportation spectrum for public safety users september 8 2004 7 broadband refers to the capacity of the radio frequency channel broadband channel can transmit live video complex graphics and other datarich information as well as voice and text messages whereas narrowband channel might be limited to handling voice text and some graphics pricing spectrum access for all users or auctioning all spectrum and creating property rights are marketdriven met hods for allocating spectrum that could maximize economically efficient use in the case of public safety however demand may be inelastic and substitution difficult w ith the result that the cost to the public is increased without any compensating gain s the need for spectrum capacity among first responders and other emergency workers is variable when radio communications are routine public safetys demand for spectrum is modest in times of crisis demand for spectrum exceeds ava ilability identifying spectrum that public safety can share with commercial users for example is also considered possible means to use valuable spectrum more efficiently although cumulatively radio frequenc ies designated for nonfederal public safety total over 90 mhz6 the characteristics of these frequencies are dissimilar requiring different technolog ical solutions although the fragmentation of spectrum assignments for public safe ty has some advantages for voice communications it is significant barrier to achieving needed broadband capacity for the future it is one of the technical problems th at plague public safety co mmunications such as outof date equipment proprieta ry solutions network cong estion and interference among systems providing new spectrum at 700 mhz for broadband communications capabilities7 including interoperable connectivity is viewed by many as the optimal solution for overcoming problems caused by incompatible radio frequencies and technologies as well as for enhancing communications capacity for public safety because 700 mhz is viewed as highly desi rable for consumerori ented applications some believe that means should be f ound for public safety and commercial users to share radio frequenc ies in this band technologydriven choices influence policy decisions as noted above the fcc has proposed the building of network accessible nationwide that would require standardized interfaces this model which mirrors the organization of commercial wireless service in the united states represents significant departure from existing public safety radio operati ons like most public safety support services radio communications have historically been built primarily for local operations often with proprietary solutions that limit interoperability with

they are inefficient users of spectrum since single message is using two or more frequency assignments gateways can provide interfaces for modern systems but not for ol der obsolete radios although gateways typically use internet protocol ip to connect to information technology systems some components are proprietary and have limited interoperability with rival gateway solutions early gateway

building of network on spectrum assigned to public safety is significant policy decision affecting not only the daily sa fety of the public but also the security of the nation some of the administrative regulatory and legislative considerations that have been brought to the forefront by the fcc proposal are composition of and network operations control by the proposed notforprofit entity if the cost of building network is offset by allowing commercial use will the network operator show preference for solutions that mesh with commercial interests or will it give priority to deve loping interfaces that support other federal and state programs for emergency communications noncommercial interoperable communications need s might for example extend to 911 call centers emergency

fema the department of homeland security the national response plan and ot her federal authorities with responsibilities for establishing and maintaining emergency communications regulatory and legislative actions the fcc is using its regulatory authority over spectrum use to take action in an area improvement to public safety communications where congress has assigned responsibility to dhs should congress seek means to coordinate the fcc plan with pl anning efforts at dhs or take some other action to assign responsibility for planning and implementation spectrum management what are the best policies to encourage efficient use of spectrum by public safety marketdriven pricing has been proposed by the fcc among others if this is applied only to usage at 700 mhz would it be eff ective policy to have twospeed regulatory framework for public safety spectrum licenses with one set of rules for 700 mhz and diffe rent rules for other spectrum holdings congressional jurisdiction in the law that created the office of emergency communications congress specified that in reviewing interoperable emergency communi cations plans the emergency communications director would ex clude the review of spectrum allocation and management64 congress has yet to make decisions about jurisdiction for programs planned and funded by dhs that operate on spectrum managed by the fcc and the ntia funding funding of 1 billion expressly for interoperable communications is mandated for 200765 this would be in the form of distribution from the digita l television transition and public safety fund

safety participation in managing the proposed network is not specified but half the network is to be available for commercial use 71 the reorganization plan that dhs must s ubmit to congress that includes the office of emergency communications is due on ma rch 31 2007 pl 109295 sec614 there is required date when the office must begin operationsinteroperability with communications systems that can utilize66 spectrum at 700 mhz67 new federal fundi ng for interoperable communications is under consideration68 many propose that the cost of new network built on pub lic safety spect rum be funded with access fees from users how will existing and planned federal funding programs be pplied to include private operator for the key interoperable network in the light of these and other questions congress may decide to revisit emergency communications policy and mana gement at the federal level through hearings and oversight as well as to clarify congressional priorities and goals regarding interoperability possible outcomes this report has described three separate policy initiatives from different sectors of the federal government th at appear to be moving in different directions this situation can be attributed in part to the division of jurisdictional and institutional responsibilities in both the executive and legi slative branches of government and in part to the absence of any recent crisis that would raise the profile of emergency communications needs without guidance from congress or the administration it is possible that these three initiatives will continue to deve lop along dissimilar paths with little or apparent coordination if so what would be the likely impact on emergency communications policy of the three initiatives the proposal by the fcc which is sponsored by the public safety and ho meland security bureau it created in 200669 seems to be the most far reaching although it is possi ble that the fcc will extend the time for public comments and also deliberate extensively it could move to allocate the spectrum to quasicommercial entity70 in 2007 for development by 20102011 this could possibly preempt any decisions or recommendations from the ntia and dhs which are operating within unspecified but apparently longer time frames71 in different scenario the fcc might provide bridge connecting the regional emergency communications coordination recc working group that dhs is to create to regional planning committees like those the fcc originally formed tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33838crs15 develop the 700 mhz band plan and agreemen ts on interoperability the fcc could then bring to the recc table the benef its of regional representation technical expertise and broad samp of public opinion from its rulemaking efforts network not unlike the one now proposed by the fcc might be the result but with potentially wider participation and acceptance such network might be administered by the office of emerge ncy communications not through fcc regulations another possibility is that dhs might cede responsibilities and requirements stated in pl 109295 for developing public sa fety networks to the fcc this could diminish the scope of the new office of emergency communications in that scenario dhs might focus on continuing its policy of assisting cities and other areas in setting up gateways adding access to the 700mhz systems the advantage of spectrum efficiency through sharing freque ncies at 700 mhz would likely be lost to public safety users but not to commercial users in the absence of clear authority and di rection many routes are possible it remains to be seen whether these routes will be coordinated or whether they will collide at the crossroads
