proposed regulatory language delineating methods for demonstrating compliance with the upper payment limit on outpatient hospital services provided in private outpatient facilities currently there is congressional moratorium on this final rule provision in the american recovery and reinvestment bill of 2009 that was approved by the house energy and commerce committee on january 22 2009 includes such moratorium that moratorium would prohibit the secretary of health and human services from taking any action until june 30 2009 through regulation regulatory guidance use of federal payment audit

settings such as outpatient departments clinics and ambulatory rgery centers under various organizational and ownership arrangements these outpatient facilities may be located on or off the hospital campus or in satellite facilities range of different health care professionals and practitioners treat patients in these settings simply the way that the various health care services are categorized covered and reimbursed will vary by payor under the medicaid program outpatient hospital oph services are mandatory benefit for most beneficiaries 1 in fy2006 expenditures for outpatient hospital services totaled roughly 115 billion or 39 of total medicaid spending about 2990 billion2 current medicaid regulations broadly define hospital outpatient services to include preventive diagnostic therapeutic rehabilitative or palliative services provided under the direction of physician or dentist in the hospital states use number of different reimbursement methods for different types of services provided in outpatient hospital departments and clinics for example some states pay flat per visit rate for clinic visit use fee schedule for surgery and pay on costbasis for certain specialized services in 2002 about half of the states based their oph reimbursement largely on hospitalspecific costs eg actual costs or prospective rates based on historic costs with limit on annual increases or paid fixed percentage of actual costs 3 in addition more recent 2006 data indicate that 11 states used medicare groupings andor methodologies for determining reimbursement rates for some oph services4 finally in general medicaid payments for institutional services eg hospitals and nursing homes cannot in the aggregate and within three provider categories state government non state government5 and private exceed reasonable estimate of what medicare would pay for the same services this is called the medicaid u pper payment limit upl rule this upl rule is applied separately to inpatient and outpatient care under the medicare program hospitals are paid for certain services provided to outpatients through medicares outpatient prospective payment system opps which uses fixed payment rate that reflects expected resource use for specific ambulatory patient classifications or apcs which groups sets of hospital outpatient diagnoses and procedure codes into broader categories which are reimbursed by specified medicare payment amounts generally the opps payments cover the facility costs associated with procedure performed in an outpatient department other services are provided by hospitals in outpatient settings that are not paid under opps these include professional services provided by physici ans and health practitioners eg psychologists 1 medicaid statute identifies mandatory services eg inpatient and outpatient hospital services that must be covered by all states and optional services that states may choose to cover eg physical therapy psychologist

g15g142g141g146g140g138g146g141g561 the proposed rule 72 federal register 55158 september 28 2007 would limit the definition and scope of medicaid outpatient services in hospital clinic hospital facility or rural health clinic federally reimbursable medicaid outpatient services would include only those facility services 1 that medicare would pay for under its opps or recognized by medicare as an oph service under an alternate payment methodology 2 provided by an outpatient hospital facility including only those entities that meet standards for providerbased status as department of an outpatient hospital as defined in medicare rules and 3 not covered under the scope of any other medicaid benefit category under the proposed rule the upl for privately operated outpatient hospital facilities would remain tied to reasonable estimate of what medicare would pay for the same services however the calculations used to demonstrate compliance with this upl would be required to include only services that 1 may be covered under the new medicaid outpatient services definition and 2 are reimbursable under medicare ie appear on outpatientspecific medicare cost report worksheets with respect to the second criterion states would be required to base this upl calculation on the hospitalspecific ratios costtocharge or paymenttocharge as reported in the most recently filed medicare hospital cost report or an equivalent state cost report different upl calculation would apply to privately operated clinics that are not part of hospital for these entities states would choose one of two upl methods 1 defined percentage not to exceed 100 of what medicare pays under the nonfacility fee schedule or 2 comparison by individual procedure code of medicare payment amounts for equivalent medicaid services when medicaid reimbursements are based on specific fee schedule or encounter rate for this second method the calculation may be conducted in the aggregate for clinic type or by specific facilities for end stag renal disease ambulatory surgical centers etc services for which the medicaid statute defines separate upl eg clinical diagnostic laboratory services 8 must be excluded from this clinic upl finally for dentists providing services in such clinics the upl calculation may include payment amounts that medicaid would otherwise pay outside the facility cms stated that it cannot determine the fiscal impact of this proposed rule because of lack of available data however cms believes this rule would not significantly alter current practices in 6 see crs report rl30526 medicare payment policies by paulette c morgan et 7 42 cfr 41365 contains the current providerbased classification requirements 8 the upl on clinical diagnostic laboratory tests is based on what medicare would pay for such tests for individuals enrolled in medicare part b httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22852g15g142g141g146g140g138g146g141g561g138g151

outpatient hospital reimbursement methods submitted by 32 states ov er fouryear period and only 1 state not named used methods that may be minimally affected by the rule cbo estimates that this rule will reduce federal medicaid outlays by 03 billion over 5 years and 07 billion over 10 years9 recent congressional report indicates that this rule would result in loss of roughly 21 billion over the next five years in four states that could provide such estimates10

hospital services in regulations overlaps with other covered medicaid benefits so that identical services are sometimes paid higher amount under the outpatient hospital benefit than would otherwise be available under other medicaid benefit categories cms also finds the current definition to be overly broad including services over which outpatient hospital departments have oversight or control and can include services outside the normal responsibility of outpatient hospital departments eg nonfacility physician and practitioner services and nontraditional oph services such as schoolbased and rehabilitation services cms noted that some states may need to move services that would longer meet the new definition of outpatient hospital services to other appropriate coverage categories and payment methodologies under the state plan cms noted that number of states requested that the agency clarify in regulation the requirements for calculating medicare comparable upls on outpatient and clinic services in calculating the upl for hospital and clinic services in private facilities cms argued that the current regulation does not indicate how this estimate should be made and it does not address treatment of services that are not comparable to those provided under medicare eg dental services in addition cms indicated that some states have used their own statespecific hospital cost reports to determine compliance with this upl and such reports may not represent finalized data or accurately reflect medicare payment andor charge ratios cms considers the medicare cost reports or equivalent state cost reports to be more accurate measure of this upl g17g153g153g152g156g146g157g146g152g151g561g157g152g561g157g145g142g561g18g155g152g153g152g156g142g141g561g20g158g149g142g561 cms has received number of comments on this proposed rule11 examples of some of those comments are summarized here first under current law states make certain supplemental payments to selected providers that treat large number of lowincome and medicaid patients for their uncompensated hospital services federal statute establishes ceiling on such disproportionate share hospital or dsh allotments for each state states must identify hospitals qualifying as dsh hospitals and must specify dsh payment formulas opponents argue that the proposed rules new definition of oph services would exclude many of the costs that 9 for proposed rules cbo generally assigns weight of 50 in its baseline to refl ect the uncertainties of the administrative process after regulation is final cbo fully incorporates the

turn limit such payments to hospitals other arguments highlight the potential negative impact of the proposed rule on medicaid children and childrens hospitals first one argument notes that while medicare serves as benchmark for this new rule medicare covers very few children and would not cover preventive and screening services provided under early and periodic screening diagnostic and treatment services epsdt mandatory medicaid benefit for most medicaid beneficiaries under the age of 21 12 the commenter also concludes that the regulation directly contravenes the medicaid epsdt provision by excluding federal matching dollars for oph programs that provide required epsdt diagnostic and treatment services that may not be covered under medicare more generally other commenters observed that the oph services longer permitted under this rule may continue to be provided by hospitals in other ways albeit at reduced payment rate second with respect to the rules requirement to use medicares costtocharge and paymenttocharge ratios in calculating the upl for private providers other opponents of the rule argue that hospitals with significantly different patient mix from medicare such as childrens hospitals would not have their costs appropriately accounted for in the new upl childrens hospitals that submit lowvolume cost reports and other hospitals with nontraditional charge structures may not readily be able to comply with the new upl requirements other commenters raise additional concerns that the new definition of oph services under the proposed rule will exclude coverage of various services previously offered through this benefit which may limit beneficiary access to such services in some states oph services are mandatory benefit under medicaid and are likely to include for example physical therapy pt for outpatients while medicare also covers pt in oph settings these services are not reimbursed under the opps and thus would be excluded from the new definition of oph services for medicaid outside of epsdt pt may be otherwise available under medicaid but as an optional benefit data from 2005 show that eight states do not offer this optional pt benefit 13 concerns about the proposed calculations for demonstrating compliance with the upl for private facilities were also expressed one comment letter noted that it was unclear whether compliance with the upl for oph services must be demons trated in the aggregate for each individual provider andor at the cost center level different descriptions of the proposed upl calculations in both the preamble and the new regulatory language in the proposed rule contributed to this confusion several commenters argued that specific provisions in the proposed oph rule violate the one year moratorium in pl 11028 on implementation or further action on two other rules 1 the final rule establishing medicaid cost limits for public providers 72 federal register 29748 may 29 2007 and 2 the proposed rule on graduate medical education gme expenditures under medicaid 72 federal register 28930 may 23 2007 specifically the proposed oph services rule incorporates the new definition of hospital categories that was adopted in the final rule regarding cost limits on public providers which eliminates references to provider ownership status commenters argue that including this language directly contravenes the moratorium on implementing any provision of the public provider rule commenters also argue that the oph 12 sara rosenbaum jd cms medicaid regulations implications for

proposed upl calculations use medicare cost report calculations that have excluded gme costs14 other procedural concerns have been noted specifically commenters objected that the proposed rule was more than clarification of existing policy and that implementation of the rule would impose substantial administrative changes on state medicaid programs and significantly decrease hospital revenues cmss determination that regulatory impact analysis was necessary was considered by commenters to be inaccurate and did not constitute appropriate notification or provide sufficient data to the affected parties this shortcoming was compounded by the length of the comment period 30 days and not 60 days which also undermined the ability of interested parties to submit informed comments certain commenters raised substantive technical objections to the proposed upl methodologies for instance upl calculated using the medicare paymenttocharge ratio established from the cost report worksheets referenced in the proposed rule would not include the beneficiary co payment and coinsurance amounts which constitute at least 20 of medicares allowed payment amounts under opps the other upl calculation that would potentially limit medicaid payments for oph services to costs was challenged as well the statement by cms that the costtocharge ratio would produce the highest amount that cms would pay for hospital outpatient services was seen as inaccurate because under the medicare opps efficient hospitals are allowed to retain apcbased payments above service costs also cms did not address the application of this proposed rule to critical access hospitals which receive medicare payments based on 101 of their allowable costs finally the proposed methodology to establish the upl for freestanding clinic services was criticized because it did not recognize the prevalence of costbased reimbursement for private clinic services by dicaid and would result in significant access problems for these services

the final rule issued on november 7 2008 73 federal register 66187 made major change to the proposed rule as noted above commenters on the proposed oph rule argued that because it incorporated the new definition of hospital categories adopted in the final rule regarding cost limits on government providers this rule violated the moratorium on implementing any provision of the rule on cost limits for government providers in light of these views and given this moratorium cms elected to exclude from its final oph rule the proposed regulatory language delineating methods for demonstrating compliance with the medicaid upper payment limit on outpatient hospital and clinic services provided in privately operated facilities
