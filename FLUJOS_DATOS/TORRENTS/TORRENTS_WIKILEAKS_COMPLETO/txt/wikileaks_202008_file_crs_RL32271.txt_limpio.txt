legislation the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act pl 108173 addresses the importation of prescription drugs for all us consumers not just for medicareeligible individuals these provisions are rooted in consumer and congressional concern with the high cost of prescription drugs in the united states international comparisons of drug prices have confirmed that american consumers particularly the elderly and uninsured often pay more for prescription drugs than do citizens in other countries the importation of lowerpriced prescription drugs is one strategy to reduce us consumer spending the new act despite being structured as replacement to the importation provisions in the medicine equity and drug safety meds act of 2000 does not effectively change us prescription drug importation policy the details it adds will not be implemented unless the secretary of health and human services hereafter referred to as the secretary certifies to congress that such imports do not threaten the health and safety of the american public and do provide cost savings that certification requirement continued from prior law has effectively halted implementation of existing import provisions because secretary has been willing to provide the required certification the act changes the law in four basic ways it 1 directs the secretary to allow imports from canada only the meds act had allowed imports from specific list of industrialized countries including canada 2 includes shift in approach to the importation of prescription drugs by individuals by codifying the discretion in enforcement that the food and drug administration fda has exercised to allow the personal use imports of prescription drugs 3 eliminates the prohibition against manufacturers entering into agreements to prevent the sale or distribution of imported products and 4 includes mechanism based on evidence by which the secretary can terminate the import program following enactment of the medicare bill in december 2003 some members of congress have moved to amend the importation of prescription drugs provisions some states and localities have set up websites to facilitate individuals purchase of prescription drugs from canadian pharmacies fda has responded in letters to state officials fda has warned that states could face tort liability suits and charges of assisting in criminal activity if citizens suffer injury from these drugs fda via the department of justice has gone to the courts to stop the canadian and us distributors of drugs imported from canada contents

its manufacturer the fda has maintained lenient enforcement policy that lets individuals bring small amount of nonfda approved drugs into this country for their own use4 called personaluse or compassionateuse policy this fda discretion has made it easier for patients with lifethreatening diseases such as cancer and aids to bring medicines into the country and be treated by their own doctors the policy as described on the fda website does not cover commercial imports nor does it cover individual imports of fdaapproved drugs available in the united states5 drug import provisions in current law the new medicare legislation6 entirely replaces the language in section 804 of the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca that had been inserted by the meds act of 2000 the following summarizes the prescription drug import provisions in the new act provisions definitions section 804a importer is defined to mean pharmacist or wholesaler pharmacist to mean person licensed by state

its toxicity or other potentiality for harmful effect or the method of its use or the collateral measures necessary to its use is not safe for use except under the supervision of practitioner licensed by law to administer such drug shall be dispensed only upon written prescription of practitioner licensed by law to administer such drug crs3 regulations section 804b the secretary after consultation with the united states trade representative and the commissioner of customs must promulgate regulations permitting pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from canada into the united states limitation section 804c the regulations must ensure that all imported prescription drugs meet the same safety and efficacy standards as drugs approved in the united states and that the importer comply with all information and reporting requirements the secretary is permitted to adopt such rules as necessary to safeguard public health or as means to facilitate the importation of prescription drugs information and records section 804d drug importers must provide information that includes the name and amount of the active ingredient of the drug the dosage form of the drug the date the drug is shipped the quantity shipped and information about its origin and destination the importer must also supply the price paid by the importer the importers name address and license number the original source of the drug and the amount of each lot received from that source and the manufacturers lot or control number also the importer or manufacturer must certify that the drug is fdaapproved properly labeled not adulterated and not misbranded and provide laboratory records of authenticity testing including data and evidence that testing was conducted in an approved us laboratory the importer is required to provide any other information that the secretary determines is necessary to ensure the public health records regarding imported prescription drugs must be provided to the secretary and then kept for such time as the secretary determines to be appropriate for prescription drug imported directly from the first foreign recipient from the manufacturer there must be documentation indicating that the drug came directly from the manufacturer that the amount being imported is not greater than the quantity that was originally received that the drug was subsequently shipped by that recipient to the us importer and verification that each batch of the drug has been statistically sampled and tested for authenticity and degradation prior to importation samples of subsequent shipments of these drugs must also be tested for authenticity and degradation for prescription drug not imported directly from the first recipient in the foreign country there must be documentation demonstrating that each batch of the drug has been statistically sampled and tested for authenticity and degradation prior to importation testing section 804e the importer or the manufacturer must conduct the required authenticity testing at qualified us laboratory if the importer conducts these tests the manufacturer must give the importing pharmacist or wholesaler the information needed to authenticate the product and confirm its labeling also testing information must be kept in confidence and used only for this required import testing or to otherwise comply with this act the secretary may adopt rules to protect trade secrets and commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential registration of foreign sellers section 804f any canadian establishment engaged in the distribution of prescription drug imported or offered for importation into the united states must register its name and place of business crs4 with the secretary the canadian establishment also must register the name of its us agent suspension of importation section 804g if the secretary discovers pattern of counterfeit or violative products the agency must suspend importation of that specific prescription drug or that specific importer the suspension must stay in effect until the fda investigates and determines whether the public is being adequately protected from counterfeit and violative drug products under existing regulations approved labeling section 804h drug manufacturer must give the importer written authorization to use at cost the approved labeling for the prescription drug charitable contributions section 804i section 801d1 of the ffdca which allows only the us manufacturer of drug to import it into the united states will continue to apply to product donated by manufacturer of drug to charitable organization or foreign government8 waiver authority for importation by individuals section 804j congress declares that the secretary should use discretion when enforcing the current legal prohibition against persons importing drugs or devices the secretary should focus enforcement on cases where the importing may pose significant threat to public health when the importation is clearly for personal use and the prescription drug or device does not appear to present an unreasonable risk to the individual the secretary should exercise discretion to permit the importation by the individual the new law specifies two waiver procedures to allow individuals other than pharmacists and wholesalers to bring prescription drugs into the united states for their personal use the first deals with drugs from canada the secretary is required to publish regulations that grant waivers for an individual to import for personal up to 90day supply of drug from licensed canadian pharmacy the drug must also be in final dosage form be made in an fdaregistered facility come from registered canadian seller be accompanied by valid prescription and be imported under conditions the secretary determines are necessary to ensure public safety 8 with many drug samples being imported illegally in the early 1980s congress decided to restrict such imports the 1988 prescription drug marketing act pl 100293 established among other things requirements for the distribution of prescription drug samples the regulations 21 cfr part 203 addressed the practice of licensed practitioners to donate unused prescription drug samples to charitable institutions such as free clinics nursing homes and other charitable health care entities for dispensing to patients or for further donation to another charity here or overseas for dispensing to its patients these requirements also say that drug sample donated to charitable institution must be inspected by licensed practitioner or registered pharmacist and that drug sample receipt and distribution records must be kept by the institution for minimum of three years these record keeping requirements were intended to deter illegal reimportation see fda website at httpwwwfdagovcderguidance4932dfthtm crs5 the second addresses drug imports from any other country here the law gives the secretary the option rather than requirement to issue regulations allowing imports from countries other than canada if the secretary were to publish such regulations the law requires the secretary to also publish guidance specifying the conditions under which individuals would be able to import drugs for personal use construction section 804k nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the secretarys authority relating to the importation of prescription drugs other than with respect to section 801d1 which allows only the manufacturer to import prescription drug commencement of program section 804l the drug import program described above can begin only if the secretary first certifies to congress that its implementation would pose additional risk to public health and safety and would result in significant reduction in the cost of covered products prescription drugs to american consumers termination of program section 804l once an importation program is implemented the secretary can move to terminate it under specified conditions if the secretary certifies to congress between 12 and 18 months after the regulations are implemented that based on substantial evidence in the opinion of the secretary the benefits of the implementation of the import program do not outweigh any detriment drug imports under the section would cease 30 days after the certification is submitted9 however the secretarys certification may not be submitted unless after public hearing the secretary finds it is more likely than not that implementation will result in an increased risk to the public health identifies in qualitative and quantitative terms the nature and causes of the increased risk considers whether measures can be taken to avoid reduce or mitigate the increased risk and if those measures would require additional statutory authority to report to congress describing needed legislation identifies in qualitative and quantitative terms the benefits that would result from the program including reductions in the cost of drugs to us consumers which would allow them to obtain needed medications without foregoing other necessities of life and in specific terms compares the detriment with those benefits and determines that the benefits do not outweigh the detriment authorization of appropriations section 804m the new law authorizes to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out this section conforming amendments section 1121b of the medicare prescription drug bill replaces references to covered product in sections 301aa and 303a6 in the federal food drug and cosmetic act with prescription drug study and report on importation of drugs section 1122 requires the secretary in consultation with appropriate government agencies to conduct study on the importation of drugs to the united states pursuant to section 804 of the 9 this certification required only in the context of the secretarys intent to end the program differs from the certification the secretary must make to initiate the program crs6 federal food drug and cosmetic act as added by section 1121 of the conference agreement the secretary shall submit the report to congress not later than 12 months after the enactment of this act study and report on trade in pharmaceuticals section 1123 requires the presidents designees to conduct study and report on issues related to trade and pharmaceuticals discussion of enacted legislation import provisions it is doubtful whether the secretary will implement these import provisions given the act contains the provision that led both secretaries shalala and thompson to decline that provision requires that the secretary certify that imported drugs would be safe and at reduced cost before implementing import regulations although significant changes were considered the new law changes very few elements of the meds act of 2000 effectively until the secretary makes certification regarding safety and cost the law allows one other than the us manufacturer of the drug to legally import prescription drug10 therefore until an hhs secretary certifies to congress that the implementation of this section will pose additional risk to the publics health and safety and b will result in significant reduction in the cost of covered products to the american consumer11 drug imports are illegal unless imported by the manufacturer of the drug neither pharmacist nor wholesaler may import prescription drugs the law does not allow an individual to import drug for personal use12 if the hhs secretary were to certify to congress the required safety and cost savings certification then all the mechanisms of section 804 would go into effect in that case pursuant to regulations that the secretary must promulgate by law and according to regulations pharmacist or wholesaler could import prescription drugs from canada personaluse imports by an individual from any other country would remain illegal unless the secretary chose to issue regulations allowing them and the laws restrictions on personaluse imports would be waived so an individual could import 90day supply of prescription drug from canada 10 fda has published descriptions of its personaluse import policy which is based on the secretarys discretion in how to enforce the regulations the meds act had provision for personaluse waiver see fda information on importation of drugs and fda coverage of personal importations regulatory procedures manual office of regulatory affairs fda jan 11 2003 at httpwwwfdagovoracompliance_refrpm_new2 ch9pershtml 11 section 804l2 of the ffdca 12 the law does not specifically address state as an importer see below for more information crs7 studies and reports unrelated to whether the secretary certifies safety and cost savings the medicare act mandates two studies with reports to congress study and report on importation of drugs the law directs the hhs secretary within 12 months of enactment to study and report on the importation of prescription drugs into the united states pursuant to section 804 of the ffdca as added by section 1121 of this act the conference report provides the detailed instructions for that study these include consideration of the pharmaceutical distribution chain anticounterfeiting technologies and their costs the scope volume and safety of unapproved drugs participation of foreign

intellectual property rights study and report on trade in pharmaceuticals the new law also directs that the presidents designees shall conduct study and report on issues related to trade and pharmaceuticals here too the conference report provides detail not stated in the bill including the naming of the secretary of commerce the international trade commission the hhs secretary and the united states trade representative as responsible for the conduct of the study and report topics to be covered include how other countries use price controls and what this costs us consumers the impact of price controls and intellectual property laws on price innovation generic competition and research and development and whether these are appropriate topics for trade negotiations with other

bills in the 108th congress leading to the medicare bill conference agreement in june 2003 the senate and the house each passed drug importation provisions as part of their medicare bills both the senatepassed prescription drug and medicare improvement act of 2003 s 1 and the housepassed medicare modernization and prescription drug act of 2003 hr 1 would have required the secretary of hhs to issue regulations allowing pharmacists and drug wholesalers to import prescription drugs from canada into the united states these two bills were sent to conference one month later the house voted 243 to 186 to adopt the pharmaceutical market access act of 2003 hr 2427 which contained broader provisions such as permitting qualifying individuals ie consumers as well as pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drug products from 25 industrialized countries including canada this bill introduced by representative gutknecht differed strikingly from the thencurrent law and the subsequently enacted medicare legislation in that it would have eliminated the provision that requires the secretary to first certify that importation would pose additional risk to public health and safety and would lower the cost of prescription drugs for us consumers hr 2427 would also have required drug makers to incorporate various counterfeitresistant technologies in the packaging and shipping containers of all prescription drugs the bill would have created new section in the law called counterfeitresistant technologies it would have required that all prescription drugs not just those being imported be packaged to incorporate overt optically variable counterfeitresistant technology or technologies that have an equivalent function of security provide with those technologies visible identification of the product be similar to those used by the bureau of engraving and printing to secure us currency be made and distributed in secure environment and integrate nonvisible security features with forensic capability13 postpassage activity drug importation is attracting attention in the legislative executive and judicial branches of government states and municipalities because expenditures for pharmaceuticals continue to increase and are taking larger portion than previously of public funds used for health care some states are 13 by requiring manufacturers to incorporate the technologies into multiple elements of the packaging for prescription drugs the shipping containers for drugs would have had to incorporate technologies into labels so inspectors could verify the authenticity of the shipment crs15 trying various ways to legally import lower cost prescription drugs from canada in order to control the rate of growth of this portion of the state budget government officials from several states have petitioned hhs secretary tommy thompson to grant waivers from the current law prohibiting imports allow pilot projects or promulgate regulations as would be allowed under the new section 804 of the ffdca if the secretary issued the required certification to authorize programs for the safe importation of prescription drugs from canada they cite potential savings in one case of over 90 million year14 coinciding with the national governors association meeting in washington dc bipartisan group of governors accompanied by bipartisan group of members of congress held february 24 2004 hearing preceded by press conference in which they spoke of collective action to take advantage of lower priced pharmaceuticals from canada15 food and drug administration the fda which is charged with ensuring the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs sold in the united states has responded swiftly rather than single out individuals for punishment for breaking the law the agency has sent warning letters and has sought to close down the websites and facilities that are illegally supplying prescription drugs16 in january 2004 fda reported on its second blitz examination of import courier hubs it found that 87 of the almost 2000 examined parcels containing prescription drugs mostly from canada contained unapproved drugs because by law any prescription drug
