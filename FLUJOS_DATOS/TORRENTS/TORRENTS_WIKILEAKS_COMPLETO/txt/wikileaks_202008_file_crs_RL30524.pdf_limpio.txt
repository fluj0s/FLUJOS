constitution article ii section 2 empowers the president to nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate appoint the principal officers of the united states three distinct stages mark the appointment processnomination confirmation and appointment in the nomination or first stage the president selects the nominee and sends the nomination to the senate for positions located within state us attorney us marshal and us district judge the president by custom normally nominates an individual recommended by the senator or senators from that state if they are from the same party as the president if neither senator is from the same party the president normally defers to the recomm endations of party leaders from the state occasionally the president solicits recommendations from senators of the opposition party when they hold key senate positions before making nomination whether at the state or national level the president must consider how it will fare in the confirmation process nomination to position does not give the nominee legal authority to assume the duties and responsibilities of the position that authority comes only after the nominee is confirmed and appointed while awaiting confirmation nominee often is hired as consultant and may act only in an advisory capacity nominee serving in an acting capacity see below however has full authority to exercise the duties and responsibilities of the position in the confirmation or second stage the senate alone determines whether to approve or disapprove nomination how the senate acts on nomination depends largely on the importance of the position involved existing political circumstances and policy implications generally the senate shows particular interest in the nominees views and how they are likely to affect public policy4 how closely their personal and professional qualities are examined will also depend on whether or not the presidents party controls the senate and how involved he becomes in supporting the nomination although the senate confirms most nominations president can safely assume that all of his nominees will be approved routinely rarely however does rejection occur on the senate floor nearly all rejections occur in committee by either committee vote or committee inaction rejections in committee occur for variety of reasons including opposition to the nomination

additional information on recess appointments see us library of congress congressional research service recess appointments legal overview by richard c ehlke crs report 87832 washington oct 19 1987merits of the nomination between 1981 and 1992 the senate confirmed 90 of all nominations to fulltime positions in the executive departments5 the first two stages of the appointment process may be summarized by the view that while the president proposes the senate disposes in the third or final stage the confirmed nominee is given commission signed by the president with the seal of the united states affixed thereto and is sworn into office at that point he or she has full authority to carry out the responsibilities of the office recess appointments the process also enables the president to make an appointment without the need for it to be confirmed by the senate when that body is in recess either during session intrasession recess appointment or between sessions intersession recess appointment recess appointments expire at the end of the next session of congress6 presidents have occasionally used the recess appointment power to circumvent the confirmation process in response congress has placed additional restrictions on the presidents authority to make recess appointment under 5 usc 5503a if the position to which the president makes recess appointment fell vacant while the senate was in session the appointee may not be paid from the treasury until he or she is confirmed by the senate the salary prohibition does not apply 1 if the vacancy arose within 30 days before the end of the session 2 if nomination for the office other than the nomination of someone given recess appointment during the preceding recess was pending when the senate recessed or 3 if nomination was rejected within 30 days before the end of the session and another individual was given the recess appointment recess appointee falling under any one of these three exceptions must be nominated not later than 40 days after the beginning of the next session of the senate7 for this reason when recess appointment is made the president generally submits new nomination for the nominee even when an old nomination is pending temporary appointments congress has also provided limited statutory authority for the temporary filling of vacant positions requiring senate confirmation under the federal vacancies reform act of 1998 pl 105277 division c title i section 151 to be codified at 5 usc 33543359d an advice and consent position in an executive agency thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30524crs5 becomes vacant may be filled temporarily in one of three ways 1 the first assistant to such position automatically assumes the functions and duties of the office or 2 the president directs an officer in any agency who is occupying position requiring senate confirmation to perform those tasks or 3 the president selects any officer or employee of the subject agency who is occupying position whose rate of pay is equal to or greater than the minimum rate of pay at the gs15 level and who has been with the agency for at least 90 of the preceding 365 days the temporary appointment is for 210 days but the time restriction is suspended if first or second nomination for the position is pending in addition during presidential transition the 210day restriction period does not begin to run until either 90 days after the president assumes office or 90 days after the vacancy occurs if it is within the 90day inauguration period the act does not apply to positions on multiheaded regulatory boards and commissions and to certain other specific positions which may be filled temporarily under other statutory provisions nominations and appointments during 106th congress table 3 below lists in
