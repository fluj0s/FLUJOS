fy2004 deficit estimate at 445 billion above the 307 billion deficit estimate in the original budget february 2003 but below the fy2004 deficit estimate of 521 billion included in the fy2005 budget february 2004 cbos september 2004 baseline deficit estimate of 422 billion was larger than its january 2003 estimate of 145 billion and below its march 2004 estimate of 477 billion the actual deficit for the year was 413 billion pending revision the original proposals from the president february 2003 included speeding up and making permanent many of the tax cuts enacted over the last two years along with new tax proposals for economic stimulus tax incentives and expiring tax provisions cbos first fy2004 budget report january 31 2003 estimated the baseline deficit at 145 billion deficit for

undetermined additional costs arising from ongoing operations in iraq extending beyond 2003 omb midsession review july 15 2003 p1 over 80 of the increase in cbos baseline deficit estimate resulted from spending bills and tax cuts adopted between march and august 2003 in the fall of 2003 congress bogged down in passing the 13 regular appropriation bills three had become law at the start of the

early in each calendar year the bush administration released its fy2004 budget the fiscal year 2004 budget of the us government on february 3 2003 the multiple volumes contained general and specific descriptions of the administrations policy proposals and expectations for the budget for fy2004 and for the years through fy2008 with information on the revenue changes through fy2013 and section on longterm fiscal issues facing the nation the full set of budget documents budget appendix analytical perspectives historical tables among several others contain extensive and detailed budget information including estimates of the budget without the proposed policy changes current service baseline estimates historical budget data detailed outlay and receipt data selected analysis of specific budget related topics and the administrations economic forecast in addition to its presentation of the administrations proposals the budget documents are an annual basic reference source for federal budget information the administrations annual budget submission is followed by congressional action on the budget this usually includes the annual budget resolution appropriations and possibly reconciliation bill or bills during the months of deliberation on budget legislation the administration often revises its original proposals because of interactions with congress and changing circumstances in the economy and the world the current situation the treasury released final budget totals for fy2004 on october 14 2004 with the release of the final monthly treasury statement of receipts and outlays of the united states government for fy2004 receipts were 1880 billion outlays were 2292 billion and the deficit was 413 billion receipts in fy2004 were larger than in the previous year for the first time since fy2001 outlays continued growing rising 5 above the fy2003 level 2159 billion the deficit increased from its fy2003 level in dollars by 35 billion and remained almost unchanged as percentage of gross domestic product gdp rising from 35 in fy2003 to an estimated 36 of gdp in fy2004 these numbers are likely to undergo some revision by the time they appear in the presidents fy2006 budget documents expected to be released in early february 2005 in the spring of 2004 the president requested 25 billion reserve fund to support operations in afghanistan and iraq after amending the request congress crs2 adopted it as part of the fy2005 defense appropriation making the funds available immediately in fy2004 budget totals table 1 contains budget estimates for fy2004 from the congressional budget office cbo the administration the office of management and budget omb the revisions produced by omb and cbo throughout the year as they became available the results of congressional budget deliberations and the actual totals for the year differences in totals from the various sources and times occur because of differing underlying economic technical and budgetestimating assumptions and techniques as well as differences in policy assumptions most policy generated dollar differences between the administration and congressional proposals or assumptions for an upcoming fiscal year are often relatively small compared to the budget as whole and sometimes almost nonexistent these small differences may grow sometimes substantially producing widely divergent budget paths over time budget estimates should be expected to differ over time from those originally presented by the president or congress the war on terrorism the 2001 recession and the slow economic recovery until it speeded up in the fall of 2003 changes in policies tax cuts spending increases and changes in the technical assumptions underlying budgeteconomic relationships have all contributed to the deterioration in the budget outlook since early 2001 under current policies and even more so under policies proposed in the presidents fy2005 budget there is little expectation that the budget will reach balance over the next 10 years budget proposals and estimates cbos first budget report for fy2004 the budget and economic outlook fiscal years 20042013 january 2003 contained baseline estimates and projections for fy2003 through fy20131 cbos report showed that under baseline assumptions the budget would remain in deficit through fy2006 16 billion before showing small surplus in fy2007 the baseline showed small surpluses beginning in fy2007 and would grow rapidly in fy2011 through fy2013 as revenues increase quickly with the then scheduled expiration by the end of calendar year 2010 of the tax reductions from the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 egtrra pl 10716 june 2001 extending the expiring tax cuts would delay the return of surpluses by reducing receipts until at least fy2008 and would have much slower growth in the surplus over the subsequent years 1 baseline estimates provide foundation from which to measure proposed policy changes they extrapolate current policies and other specified conditions into the future based on expectations of future economic conditions other factors that affect the budget and rules set by congress that cbo must follow in creating baseline estimates they are not meant to predict future budget outcomes because they continue existing policy the baseline estimates repeat spending that was intended for only one year and exclude generally expected but notyetenacted policy changes crs3 table 1 budget estimates for fy2004 in billions of dollars deficit receipts outlays surplus actual

the senate be outlook the budget and economic outlook cbo president bushs fy2004 budget called for additional tax cuts and both increased and decreased spending as measured against ombs baseline estimates depending on the activity the proposed policy changes raised the fy2004 deficit to 307 billion from ombs baseline deficit estimate of 158 billion ombs current service baseline estimate moved into small 5 billion surplus in fy2006 while the presidents proposals would produce projected deficit of 201 billion in that year the proposals would keep the budget in deficit through at least fy2008 the last year of the administrations estimates2 the administrations budget did not include any cost estimates for the then future war in iraq expected but unspecified additions to homeland security funding or for nonwar defense related spending on march 24 2003 the president asked 2 the longrun outlook for government policies existing at the time of the budget submission that are found in the budget p 41 indicate that without substantial changes from existing policies the budget is likely to remain in deficit through much of this century crs4 congress for 75 billion supplemental appropriation for fy2003 some of which would produce outlays in fy2004 the administration argued that its proposed tax cuts were needed to boost the lagging economy and that the acceleration of economic growth resulting from the tax cuts would lead to the recovery of much of the lost revenue over future years in contrast the presidents council of economic advisors in its annual report stated although the economy grows in response to tax reductions because of higher consumption in the short run and improved incentives in the long run it is unlikely to grow so much that lost tax revenue is completely recovered by the higher level of economic activity3 both ombs and cbos original fy2004 budget documents were produced prior to the completion of final work on the fy2003 appropriations this forced both agencies to estimate the discretionary spending levels congress would approve and that the president would agree to for fy2003 the yeartoyear budget comparisons suffered from this uncertainty cbos march report an analysis of the presidents budgetary proposals for fiscal year 2004 recalculated the administrations fy2004 budget proposal using cbos assumptions and budget estimating methods4 these recalculations produced results similar to those in the presidents budget with little cumulative difference in the projections cbo estimated cumulative deficit of 12 trillion under the presidents policies over the five years fy2004fy2008 compared to the administrations estimate of 11 trillion5 cbos 10year projections of the administrations proposals cbo extrapolated the presidents policies over the second five years showed larger deficits or smaller surpluses compared to the cbos own revised march baseline in each of the years covered cbo estimated that about twothirds of the increases in the deficits in its reestimates of the presidents proposals excluding higher net interest costs resulted from the lower revenues that would occur from the adoption of the presidents tax cut proposals the march 2003 revised cbo baseline incorporating the effects of the consolidated appropriations resolution fy2003 car 2003 pl 1087 february 20 increased the projected baseline deficit by 47 billion in fy2003 and by 55 billion in fy2004 over the january estimates cbo attributed 22 billion of the 55 billion increase in the deficit in fy2004 to legislative changes since january almost all from car 2003 the remainder of the increase was attributed to technical changes 3 council of economic advisers economic report of the president feb 2003 pp 5758 4 the cbo report came out before the adoption of the fy2003 supplemental appropriations pl 10811 april 6 and therefore did not include any effect that legislation would have on fy2004s outlays and deficit 5 ibid p 1 crs5 over the 10year period covered in the march cbo report cbo wrote for the 20042013 period cbo has reduced its projection of the cumulative surplus by 446 billion dropping it from 1336 billion to 891 billion nearly threequarters of which derives from enactment of the omnibus appropriation act in february6 the deterioration in the budget outlook between january 2003 and march 2003 resulted in cbos revised baseline estimate pushing back the budgets return to surplus by one year from fy2007 to fy2008 the fy2004 house budget resolution hconres 95 march 21 included the presidents request for 726 billion economic stimulus tax cut only portion of the total tax cut outlined in the resolution was included in reconciliation instructions the senatepassed resolution sconres 23 march 26 contained reconciliation instructions for 350 billion tax cut the conference agreement on the resolution hconres 95 hrept 10871 april 11 included different reconciliation instructions for the relevant house and senate committees the house instructions included tax cuts of 550 billion the senate instructions included tax cuts of 350 billion the resolutions deficit was 385 billion in fy2004 becoming small 10 billion surplus in fy2012 and rising to surplus of 37 billion in fy2013 assuming the expiration of the tax cuts by 2010 the reconciliation legislation that congress passed the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act pl 10827 may 23 2003 contained 350 billion in tax cuts and small amount of spending increases over the period fy2003 through fy2013 the midyear budget reports from omb july 2003 midsession review and cbo august 2003 the budget and economic outlook an update projected larger deficits for fy2004 and subsequent years than they had in their respective earlier budget reports in 2003 omb estimated that the fy2004 deficit would rise to 475 billion 168 billion above its january 2003 estimate7 policy changes that differed from those originally proposed by the president produced 73 billion of the change the largest share 95 billion resulted from differences in the economic and technical assumptions underlying the two projections these changes raised the estimated cumulative deficit for fy2004 through fy2008 by 372 billion above the cumulative amount in the earlier estimate cbos august 2003 report raised the fy2004 baseline deficit to 480 billion 280 billion larger than its march estimate legislative changes tax cuts and spending increases raised the estimated deficit by 227 billion while economic and technical revisions raised it by another 52 billion the fiveyear fy2004fy2008 projected cumulative deficit increased by 1083 billion between cbos march and august estimates from 362 billion to 1445 billion cbos tenyear projection for 6 congressional budget office an analysis of the presidents budgetary proposals for fy2004 march 2003 p 3 7 ombs current services baseline deficit rose from 158 billion in january to 458 billion in july the report showed the cumulative deficit for the five years fy2004fy2008 rising to 949 billion from the cumulative deficit in january of 114 billion crs6 fy2004 through fy2013 included cumulative change in its deficit projections between march and august of an estimated 2287 moving the budget balance from an estimated cumulative surplus of 891 billion in march 2003 to an estimated cumulative deficit of 1397 billion the august estimate incorporated as did the march estimate the assumed expiration of most of the recently adopted tax cuts it also included the assumed continuation of all the spending increases adopted since march including the fy2003 supplementals pl 10811 and pl 10869 that are unlikely to be repeated annually throughout the forecast period neither ombs nor cbos summer 2003 projections reflected particularly in the years after fy2004 the effect of likely policy changes such as modifications to the alternative minimum tax amt the costs of the ongoing efforts in iraq and afghanistan the possible repeal of the scheduled expirations of the tax cuts and the possible adoption of medicare drug benefit the budgetary cost of these policy changes is very large over time and could according to cbo estimates add another 1 trillion to 3 trillion to the cumulative deficit over the fy2004 through fy2013 period see pages 1114 in the update for cbos discussion of budget projections under alternative scenarios cbos baseline projections indicated that the budget has fundamental imbalance that will not be remedied by full economic recovery the projections imply that only through policy changes that cut spending andor increase revenues can the deficit be made to shrink and surpluses be restored the appropriation process bogged down in the fall of 2003 three of the 13 regular appropriations were enacted by the start of the fiscal year another three became law before congress recessed for the year after thanksgiving 2003 series of continuing resolutions crs on appropriations were adopted from the beginning of the fiscal year october 1 2003 through the fifth and final cr which became law pl 10884 hjres 79 on november 22 2003 and provided funding through january 31 2004 congress put together an omnibus appropriation bill of the seven remaining appropriation bills they were combined in the agriculture appropriation hr 2673 the house passed the conference report hrept 108 401 on the appropriation on december 8 2003 the senate cleared the conference report on january 22 2004 it became law pl 108199 with the presidents signature on january 23 uncertainty in budget projections all budget estimates and projections are inherently uncertain their dependence on assumptions that are themselves subject to substantial variation over short time periods makes budget estimates and projections susceptible to fairly rapid and dramatic changes the last couple of years have demonstrated this volatility the original proposals and estimates for fy2002 made in early 2001 dramatically changed over the 20 to 21 months of congressional and presidential action on the budget the budget estimates in the omb and cbo budget documents for five to 10 years in the future are subject to even greater variability the early 2001 estimates for fy2002 estimated surplus of 231 billion to 313 billion the year ended on september 30 2002 with deficit of 158 billion the september 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states the legislation adopted in response the bursting of the stock market bubble the weak economy and shift in critical underlying budget relationships all contributed to large change in the years budget outcome crs7 from the originally proposed or estimated amounts there is little reason to expect this volatility to be greatly diminished in the current or future budget projections8 information in chapter 5 the uncertainties of budget projections of cbos budget report the budget and economic outlook fiscal years 20042013 january 2003 discussed how significantly the budget outcome can be altered by changes in economic and related technical factors that underpin the budget estimates9 the chapter included optimistic and pessimistic alternative scenarios to its baseline projection the optimistic scenario assumes that favorable economic and budget conditions continue throughout the forecast that the increase in productivity persists and that mandatory spending is lower than in the baseline the pessimistic scenario assumes that less favorable economic and budget conditions occur that the economy grows more slowly and that mandatory spending is higher than in the baseline the optimistic scenario produces cumulative surplus 3 trillion larger than the baseline while the pessimistic scenario produces cumulative deficit 3 trillion below the baseline estimate both over the fy2004 through fy2013 period the presidents fy2004 budget february 2003 includes in the section charting course for the federal budget the statement that fiveyear projections are fraught with uncertainty the error in projecting the surplus or deficit since 1982 has been 90 billion average absolute forecasting error for the first year alone 90percent confidence range for 2008 would stretch all the way from 281 billion surplus to 661 billion deficit range of nearly 1 trillion10 budget projections are very dependent on the underlying assumptions about the direction of the economy and expected future government policy and how these interact along with other factors such as changing demographics that affect the budget any deviation from the underlying assumptions used in the budget estimates such as faster or slower economic growth higher or lower inflation differences from the existing or proposed spending and tax policies or changes in the technical components of the budget models can and usually do have substantial effects on moving the budget outcomes away from the earlier budget estimates and projections 8 some things are known with relative certainty about the direction of future budgets demographics can partly determine the shape of future budgets the upcoming retirement of the baby boom generation will rapidly drive higher the spending for social security and medicare as well as other federal spending or tax breaks for the elderly in the next decade because almost all those that will become eligible for these benefits are alive today estimating the growth in these programs is relatively straightforward 9 cbos fy2005 budget report the budget and economic outlook fiscal years 2005 2014 jan

budget reports for fy2004 in late january and early february 2003 respectively cbos report provided baseline estimates for fiscal years 2003 through 2013 ombs documents provided estimates for fy2004 through fy2008 with few instances of cumulative estimates for fiscal years 2004 through fy2013 these were limited to revenues and provided almost data for the individual fiscal years after fy2008 the presidents budget also provided current services baseline estimates for the same years the joint committee on taxation released its estimates of the revenue effects in the presidents proposals on march 4 2003 they showed 10year fy2004 fy2013 revenue reductions of 1535 billion the presidents budget estimated its revenue proposals would reduce receipts by 1307 billion over the 10 years in midmarch 2003 cbo released its report an analysis of the presidents budgetary proposals for fy2004 which used the joint committee on taxations tax estimates modified as the basis for its analysis of the revenue effects of the presidents proposals cbos estimate showed the proposals reducing receipts by 1455 billion over the same 10 years the house and senate budget committees adopted their own differing versions of the fy2004 budget resolution hconres 95 sconres 23 in mid march 2003 the house after the republican leadership had to modify the committeepassed resolution to assure enough support for passage passed 215212 its version on march 21 it contained reconciliation instructions for 550 billion multiyear tax cut the senate spent more than week considering its resolution after adopting and rejecting numerous amendments the senate adopted the resolution on march 2611 one of the amendments adopted limited the size of the reconciliation taxcut to 350 billion over 11 years from the committeeadopted level of 698 billion the resolution moved to conference committee april 1 2003 the conference reported its agreement on april 10 hrept 10871 the agreement included different tax cut reconciliation instructions for the house and senate the house reconciliation instructions included tax cuts over 11 years of up to 550 billion the senate reconciliation instructions limited it to tax cuts of 350 billion without other constraints this would have allowed 550 billion tax cut to emerge from conference on the tax cut legislation the 550 billion would have been protected from senate filibuster by the reconciliation rules to make sure the budget resolution conference report could clear the senate the senate leadership agreed that any eventual tax cut legislation would not exceed 350 billion the house and senate passed the conference report on april 11 2003 the house ways and means committee reported the reconciliation tax cut legislation hr 2 hrept 10894 on may 8 the

agreement was reached resolving the differences between the two versions of the taxcut legislation the jobs and growth tax relief act of 2003 it provided 350 billion in cumulative tax cuts and small spending increases from fy2004 through fy2013 the agreement was formalized by the conference committees report hrept 108126 on may 22 the house adopted the agreement in the early morning hours of may

president signed the legislation into law pl 10827 on may 28 2003 on july 7 2003 the president requested second supplemental of 19 billion for fy2003 portion of the request 984 million cleared congress hr 2859 in late july and became law pl 10869 on august 8 most of the spending outlays from this legislation would occur in fy2004 and subsequent years work on the appropriations for fy2004 began in the spring of 2003 and continued through the summer when congress returned after its summer recess in september 2003 the house had passed 11 of the 13 regular appropriations and the senate had passed 4 none of the appropriations had become law by september 9 the house had passed its versions of all the appropriations the senate had passed seven of the appropriations by the end of

remaining appropriations by november 21 the senate had passed its versions of 12 of the 13 appropriations12 total of four appropriations had become law and two more had been sent to the president in an effort to assure passage of the remaining appropriations congress began working on an omnibus appropriation for the year that was initially expected to contain the 5 remaining regular appropriations four that were not expected to pass individually commerce justice state the district labor hhs ed and va hud were added to agriculture hr 2673 the omnibus expanded to include the other remaining two foreign operations and transportationtreasury after their enactment as separate bills became less certain in postthanksgiving session the house passed the legislation on december 8 the senate meeting the next day deferred its consideration of the omnibus until january 2004 some members of congress had suggested that if the omnibus fails to pass the senate congress would have adopted cr for the rest of the fiscal year providing fy2003 spending levels for these activities in fy2004 the ongoing delays in completing the work on appropriations resulted in the need for fourth cr on november 21 2003 congress passed the fourth cr hjres 79 which provided funding through january 31 2004 the president signed it into law pl 108135 on november 22 fifth cr pl 108185 containing special provisions for two programs under the federal housing administration and the federal aviation administration but otherwise unchanged from the fourth cr and included the same january 31 2004 end date

senate cleared the supplemental hr 3289 s 1689 on october 17 and sent it to conference various contentious provisions in the legislation lengthened the negotiations and prompted veto threat from the administration the differences were resolved resulting in the 875 billion supplemental appropriation clearing congress on november 9 the president signed the legislation into law on november 6 pl 108106 just before congress broke for thanksgiving it passed and the president signed on december 8 changes to medicare pl 108173 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 that would add an estimated at that time 400 billion to the programs cost over the next ten years on january 22 2004 after additional delay the senate passed the omnibus appropriation bill which the president promptly signed on january 23 2004 pl 108199 the january 2004 revised estimates from cbo changed little from the august 2003 estimates dropping the deficit from 480 billion in august

broad categories of spending budget functions showed varying rates of growth the health budget function increased at an annual average rate of 79 the medicare function increased at an annual average rate of 78 and net interest increased at an annual average rate of 96 over these years1415 these three functions accounted for over 53 of the total 14 budget functions combine budget data according to

the relatively low growth in some budget functions agriculture 08 education training employment and social services 12 general government 12 and natural resources and environment 15 growth that is lower than the expected rate of inflation will reduce these functions spending both in real terms and as shares of total spending the january 2003 cbo baseline which like the administrations current services baseline estimates assumed changes from existing government policy forecast fy2004 outlays of 2199 billion fy2008 outlays of 2583 billion and because cbos estimates extended through fy2013 fy2013 outlays of 3167 billion17 as should be expected the cbo baseline estimates were similar to the administrations current services baseline estimates for the same years fy2004 fy2008 the revisions in cbos march 2003 report raised estimated fy2004 baseline outlays by 25 billion to 2224 billion mostly because of the inclusion of the effects of adopting the consolidated appropriations resolution 2003 pl 1087 in february 2003 each of the subsequent years outlays were larger in the cbo march estimates than they were in cbos january baseline cbos march estimates of the presidents policy proposals raised outlays 16 billion above the fy2004 amount proposed by the administration by fy2008 cbos reestimates pushed total outlays to 2739 billion 28 billion higher than in the administrations budget for the same years covered by the presidents budget fy2004fy2008 cbos reestimates raised outlays close to 30 billion year above the administrations estimates except for the 16 billion difference in fy2004 by fy2013 the administrations outlay proposals under the cbo reestimates reached 3279 billion the house and senatepassed budget resolutions contained different levels of spending for fy2004 and subsequent years and differences in the components of that spending the house resolution included 2232 billion in outlays for fy2004 while the senate amount was 2246 billion less than 1 difference by fy2013 the house resolution had outlays of 3289 billion and the senate resolution had outlays of 3338 billion 15 difference the house included instructions to cut spending in wide selection of many mandatory programs stating that there should be enough waste fraud and abuse in the programs affected to avoid diminishing 15 continued average rate of 183 but since it only makes up 004 of total outlays in fy2004 and 007 of outlays in 2008 it has little effect on the overall change in outlays 16 the two budget functions allowances and undistributed offsetting receipts were excluded from the total number of functions 17 these projections followed very similar rules as those used by the administration to produce its current services baseline estimates cbo and omb used different budget models and number of different underlying assumptions which generated much of the difference in the two estimates crs14 their effectiveness the senate resolution restricted growth in nondefense non homeland security discretionary spending in the second five years of the period the conference report on the fy2004 budget resolution hrept 10871 included outlays of 2268 billion in fy2004 and 3387 billion in fy2013 in addition the conference agreement required most of the authorizing committees in the house and senate to report the amount of waste fraud and abuse within the programs under their jurisdiction to their respective budget committees by september 2003 very few did the july 2003 mid session review msr reflecting the legislation adopted since the february budget release raised fy2004 current services baseline outlays to 2252 billion from the original baseline outlays of 2189 billion 3 increase outlays under the administrations policy proposals some of which had been modified since the original proposal grew to 2272 billion from the originally proposed 2229 billion 2 increase some of the change resulted from the differences between the legislation adopted by congress and what the president originally proposed outlays under the proposals in the msr reached 2706 billion in fy2008 slightly below the amount originally projected 2711 billion cbos august 2003 baseline raised estimated baseline outlays by 81 billion from its march baseline estimates 2224 billion to 2305 billion for fy2004 an almost 4 increase by fy2008 baseline outlays would rise to 2761 billion 140 billion above the march estimates the effects of legislation adopted since march 2003 accounted for 92 billion of the increases in fy2004 estimated outlays 54 billion of the 92 billion change came from legislated increases in defense spending the january 2004 cbo budget report for fy2005 revised fy2004 baseline outlay estimates reducing them to 2294 billion 11 billion below the august 2003 estimates the expectations of better economic conditions produced most of the improvement in subsequent years fy2005fy2013 the january estimates were slightly larger than the august estimates the administrations fy2005 budget proposal february 2004 included revised estimates and proposals for fy2004 outlays the budget raised fy2004 outlays to 2319 billion 65 billion higher than the administrations previous estimate in july 2003 the unfinished appropriations at the time that cbo and omb released their reports early in 2004 for fy2005 increased the uncertainty about the level of spending in fy2004 and subsequent years senate action was needed on the omnibus appropriation conference report hr 2673 hrept 108401 the house passed it on december 8 2003 containing the remaining 7 regular appropriations for fy2004 the activities funded by these 7 appropriations were funded in january 2004 by the fifth and final continuing resolution on appropriations pl108185 hjres 82 for fy2004 legislation adopted during 2004 had little effect in changing the fy2004 outlay estimates between march 2004 and the release of actual totals in october 2004 crs15 receipts the administrations fy2004 budget included proposals for tax cuts that the administration claimed would boost the economic recovery and to speed up and make permanent many of the tax changes enacted over the last two years the administration divided its revenue proposals over fy2004fy2008 period into an economic growth package 390 billion in reductions over fy2004fy2008 tax incentives 72 billion tax simplification which would increase receipts by 13 billion extending expiring tax provisions 40 billion and miscellaneous changes which would increase receipts by 2 billion the total proposal would reduce receipts from current services baseline levels by 493 billion between fy2004 and fy2008 and by 1461 billion between fy2004 and fy201318 according to the administrations budget these changes would slow the overall growth in receipts but would not stop them the presidents fy2004 budget showed receipts growing from 1922 billion in fy2004 to 2521 billion in fy2008 cbos january 2003 baseline included fy2004 receipt estimates of 2054 billion using somewhat different set of underlying assumptions than what the administration had used for its current service baseline estimates the cbo estimates also assumed that the automatic expiration of the tax cuts of egtrra would occur as scheduled the reversion to previous tax law under the baseline assumptions particularly after 2010 calendar year produced large increase in projected revenues in the following fiscal years in fy2010 extending the tax cuts produces total estimated receipt that are 32 billion below the baseline estimates in fy2011 the level of receipts would be an estimated 156 billion below the baseline estimates and by fy2013 they would be an estimated 260 billion below the baseline estimates cbo estimated that extending all the egtrra tax provisions that are set to expire before fy2013 would reduce cumulative revenues over the fy2004fy2013 period by 785 billion from cumulative baseline revenues of 27923 billion19 cbos march 2003 revised baseline estimated revenues fell by 20 billion to 30 billion below the january baseline for the years fy2004 through fy2006 after which the january and march baseline estimates were very similar cbo attributed the change to technical factors the cbo revenue estimates of the presidents proposals were somewhat less than the amounts in the presidents budget 15 billion to 30 billion for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 for subsequent years cbos 18 these estimates are from the treasurys general explanations of the administrations fiscal year 2004 revenue proposals the presidents budget showed 441 billion revenue reduction from baseline estimates for the fy2004fy2008 period and 1307 billion reduction for the fy2004fy2013 period the treasurys estimates were produced after the release

by the end of 2005 with reversion to previous law cbos august 2003 budget report the budget and economic outlook an update update estimated that jgtrra would lower receipts in fy2004 by 135 billion from cbos baseline estimate the law would also increase outlays by 12 billion over the fy2004 through fy2008 period cbo estimated that jgtrra would reduce receipts compared to cbos baseline which did not include the administrations original tax cut proposal by 264 billion21 the next budget report from cbo in january 2004 the budget and economic outlook fiscal years 20052014 reduced fy2004 baseline

scheduled to expire after calendar year 2004 or after calendar year 2008 these expirations kept the budgetary change from exceeding the 350 billion limit set by the agreement extending the provisions through 2013 would raise the estimated cost of the legislation compared to the baseline estimates close to 1 trillion over the 11 years 21 because most of the provisions were designed to expire after fy2005 cbo estimated that the 10year cost of the tax cut would be only slightly larger by 7 billion to 271 billion than the fiveyear cost 264 billion crs18 to underlying technical components of the estimates for most of the subsequent years cbo attributed the reductions to changes in the economic outlook the presidents budget for fy2005 february 2004 called for extending and making permanent many of the expiring tax changes and had slightly larger receipts by 4 billion for fy2004 than in its previous estimates from july 2003 the february 2004 estimates had smaller receipts for fy2006 through fy2008 than in the july 2003 estimate the cbo march 2004 report analyzing the presidents fy2005 budget proposals an analysis of the presidents budgetary proposals for fiscal year 2005 did not change the fy2004 baseline revenue estimate the baseline revenue estimates and projections in subsequent years were slightly larger than those in cbos january report the tax legislation adopted later in the year to extend at least some of the expiring tax cuts had little or effect on fy2004 receipts the july 2004 mid session review msr from omb and the early september budget and economic outlook an update from cbo estimated higher receipts for fy2004 by 76 billion and 54 billion respectively than they had in their previous reports both omb and cbo attributed most of the net change in fy2004 from their earlier 2004 reports receipts to changes in underlying economic assumptions and technical reestimates rather than the effects of legislation actual receipts for fy2004 from the treasury october 14 2004 were 1880 billion less than 10 billion increase from either the omb or cbo estimates in their respective midyear budget reports the number is likely to be slightly revised by the time it appears in the presidents fy2006 budget expected in february 2005 deficits and surpluses surpluses and deficits are the residuals left after congress and the president set policies for spending and receipts surpluses reduce federal debt held by the public which leads to lower net interest payments deficits increase government debt held by the public increasing net interest payments assuming

fy2004 falling to 197 billion in fy2008 and becoming surplus of 211 billion in fy2013 after the scheduled expiration of various tax cuts at the end of 2010 the cumulative fy2004fy2008 baseline deficit was 1445 billion in the cbo report the 10year period fy2004fy2013 had cumulative baseline deficit of 1397 billion smaller than the fiveyear cumulative deficit because of the forecast return to surpluses in the second fiveyear period the january 2004 cbo baseline estimates for the fy2005 budget cycle included revised deficit estimates for fy2004 through fy2014 cbo estimated the baseline deficit for fy2004 at 477 billion the deficits in subsequent years were larger than cbo had estimated in august 2003 with the budget never returning to surplus throughout the period the cbo march 2004 revisions slightly increased deficits throughout the projection period beginning in fy2005 the administrations fy2005 budget february 2004 included larger deficit estimates for fy2004 and subsequent years that reflected the effects of the administrations policy proposals the budget included fy2004 deficit estimate of 521 billion up from the 475 billion level in the july 2003 midsession review the administration arbitrarily reduced its fy2004 revenue estimate by 20 billion in the budget thereby raising the fy2004 deficit by 20 billion cbos march 2004 estimates of the presidents proposals produced deficit of 477 billion for fy2004 although the presidents budget estimated that the deficit would fall to 237 billion in fy2009 half the amount that the administration expects in fy2004 almost all of the reduction occurs between fy2004 and fy2006 after fy2006 the deficit in dollars changes very little through fy2009 the last year of detailed projections in the administrations budget in addition to the reestimates the presidents proposals cbo march 2004 report included updated baseline estimates there was change in cbos fy2004 baseline deficit from the one in january 2004 the march baseline deficit estimates for subsequent years were somewhat larger than they had been in cbos january 2004 budget report the 2004 midyear reports from omb july 30 and cbo september 7 contained smaller deficit estimates for fy2004 than had their earlier 2004 budget reports omb estimated that the deficit would be 445 billion for fy2004 while cbo estimated that the deficit would be 422 billion the actual deficit as reported by the treasury in october was 413 billion cbo attributed much of the deficit 22 omb midsession review july 15 2003 p1 crs21 reduction since its march report to higher receipts than expected earlier mostly from the effect of changed economic conditions and technical changes neither legislation nor any changes in outlays had much effect on these final deficit estimates cbos alternative policies not included in the baseline cbos summer report august 2003 also included estimates of the budgetary effects of policy alternatives not included in cbos baseline the alternatives include policies that have high probability of being enacted or seriously debated they included extending expiring tax provisions the reform of the alternative minimum tax amt medicare reform including prescription drug benefit which had not yet been adopted and increasing discretionary spending at the growth rate of nominal gdp or at the average rate of discretionary spending growth from fy1998 through fy2003 the alternatives are all fairly costly running from 112 billion for amt reform for fy2004 through fy2008 to 608 billion for increasing discretionary spending at its recent historical growth rate for the same years during the 10 years fy2004fy2013 these costs become much larger ranging from 400 billion for both amt and medicare reform to 1564 billion to extend the expiring provisions to 2833 billion for increasing discretionary spending at the recent historical rate combining these effects and excluding the cost of increasing discretionary spending at the rate of nominal gdp growth with the baseline deficit estimate and projection raises the fy2004 deficit to 510 billion the fy2008 deficit to 577 billion and instead of becoming 161 billion surplus in fy2012 the alternatives produce deficit of 765 billion in that year and deficit of 826 billion in fy2013 under these alternative policies the cumulative deficit for fy2004 through fy2008 rises from 1455 billion in the baseline to 2577 billion under the alternatives for the 10 year period fy2004 through fy2013 the cumulative deficit rises from 1397 billion in the baseline to 6193 billion with the alternatives included adoption of these alternative policies moves the budget further into deficit with indications of it moving towards balance the longer run over longer period one running decades into this century the administration indicated in its fy2004 budget that it expects under existing policies and assumptions large and continually growing deficits beginning sometime in the next decade the retirement of the baby boom generation beginning in large numbers within 15 years will rapidly drive up spending on social security medicare and other programs for the elderly doubling these collective programs size as percentage of gdp their growth under current policy will raise the deficit or reduce the surplus if there is one and put severe strain on both the budget and the economy the tax cuts and spending increases of the last few years intensified the already existing longterm budget pressure crs22 the budget and the economy the budget and the economy affect each other unequally small economic changes have more significant effect on the budget than the effect of large policy changes on the economy the worsethanexpected recent economic conditions that lasted into 2003 played substantial role directly or indirectly in the deterioration of the budget outlook over those years and affected the outlook for fy2004 after fy2004 the budget projections from 2003 assumed that the economy has returned to its normal rate of growth under policies that are in fiscal balance return to normal economic growth should reduce or eliminate deficit or produce surplus the budget balance using cbos august 2003 alternative assumptions does not improve over the next several years this implies that the budget has an underlying fiscal imbalance that the current policies of the government are producing outlays that are too large or receipts that are too small to produce balanced budget or one in surplus during periods of normal economic growth the positive budget outlook forecast in early 2001 was substantially based on the favorable future economic conditions that were then expected along with policies that would continue producing surpluses the outlook continued the overall improvement in the budget situation since the early 1990s much of the improvement had come from strong and sustained economic growth and the rest from policy changes to reduce the deficit when those favorable economic conditions faltered as they did in 2001 so did the string of positive forecasts of the budget outlook what good economic conditions give bad economic conditions can take away the unexpectedly lengthy economic weakness into 2003 the start of recession in march 2001 the lengthy fall in the stock market the policy responses to the september 2001 terrorist attacks along with negative changes in the technical components of the budget estimates raised outlays reduced receipts beyond policy changes and eliminated the previously expected surpluses the fy2004 presidential budget documents and cbos january 2003 budget report included information of the expected economic outlook and the budgets sensitivity to changes in selected economic variables both reports included tables showing the budgets sensitivity to changes in selected economic variables it was found in chapter 2 of the analytical perspectives volume of the presidents fy2004 budget and in chapter 5 of cbos january 2003 budget report the effects of the variables are generally symmetrical higher rate of real economic growth than assumed in the budget proposal has approximately the same effect on the budget as samesized lower rate of economic growth has but in the opposite direction if 1 lower rate of economic growth reduces the surplus or increases the deficit by 30 billion in fy2004 from the omb table table 26 p 32 the budget of the united states government fiscal year 2004 analytical perspectives 1 higher than expected rate of economic growth would reduce the deficit or increase the surplus by approximately 30 billion changes in other variables generally have smaller effects on the budgetary balance than changes in real gdp sustained changes in the underlying economic variables tend to produce larger changes in the budget numbers than the effect of one or two year change crs23 for additional reading us congressional budget office the budget and economic outlook fiscal years 20042013
