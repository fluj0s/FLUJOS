natural gas pipelines also connect to 113 liquefied natural gas lng storage sites which augment pipeline gas supplies during peak demand periods7 pipeline safety record taken as whole releases from pipelines cause few annual fatalities compared to other product transporta tion modes oil pipelines reported an average of 22 deaths per ear from 2003 through 2007 gas transmission pipelines reported an average of 12 d eaths per year during the same period8 accidental pipeline releases result from variety of causes including thirdparty excavation corrosion mechanical failure control system failure and operator error natural forces such as floods and earthquake s can also damage pipelines according to the department of transportation dot there were 105 oil pipeline accidents and 76 gas transmission pipeline accidents in 20079 although pipeline releases have caused relatively few fa talities in absolute numbers single pipeline accident can be catastrophic for example 1999 gasoline pipeline explosion in bellingham washington killed two children and an 18yearold man and caused 45 million in damage to city water pl ant and other property in 2000 natural gas pipeline explosion near carlsbad new mexico killed 12 campers including four children10 in 2006 damaged pipelines on the nort h slope of alaska leaked over 200000 gallons of crude oil in an environmen tally sensitive area such accidents have generated substantial scru tiny of pipeline regulation and increased state and community activity related to pipeline safety11 pipeline security risks pipelines are vulnerabl to

the agency had made number of changes in its enforcement strategy with the potential to improve pipeline safety the report concluded however that the ffectiveness of the strategy could not yet be

improvement act of 2002 require s that natural gas pipelines operators subject to the act perform integrity management reassessments at least every seven years after an initial baseline assessment 14a some pipeline operators believe that this reassessment interval may be too prescriptive and may not be appropriate for all pipelines operators argue that assessing pipelines too frequently is costly and inefficient diverting limited safety resources from other uses with greater pipeline safety benefits99 based on assessments conducte d through 2005 and the generally safe condition of gas tran smission pipelines the gao concluded in 2006 that the seven year reassessment interval appears to be conservative100 the gao recommended that congress permit pipeline operators to reassess gas transmission pipelines at intervals based on risk factors technical data and engineering analyses the agency believed such revision would allow the ops more flexibility to establish longer or shorter reassessmen t intervals as warranted by pipeline conditions101 according to ops testimony in june 2008 the secretary of transportation has corresponded with house energy and commerce committee
