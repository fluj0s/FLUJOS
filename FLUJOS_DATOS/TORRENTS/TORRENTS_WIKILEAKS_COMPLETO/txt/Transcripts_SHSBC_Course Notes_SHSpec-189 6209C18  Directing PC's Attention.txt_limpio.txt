6209c18 shspec189 directing pcs attention instead of reaching for an argument reach for an emeter to straighten out arguments put the person or persons on meter pull missed withholds on nattery person just sit him or her down as though natter had occurred and ask what have we failed to find out about you what have i failed to find out about you in this session have i missed withhold on you etc when you use an emeter get something done you can do great deal with it so use it to get somewhere the rules of auditing are to keep you from doing ineffective things men have been talking to men for thousands of years and the general result of these discussions has been nil how can we use talking in auditing to get something to happen the rules by which you audit are the rules of an effective path to an accomplishment of reaching someone bettering someone reaching an agreement and improving existence but it is highly circumscribed path there have been almost numberless efforts in the past to cure people or make them better almost all schools of healing have involved talking or listening there is an effort to reach axiom 10 applies throughout we can now make this same talk effective auditing has to do with the comm formula this is the most fundamental fundamental of scientology when someone says something and someone acknowledges it if the statement is true and the acknowledgment is received mental charge can blow deintensify eraser be eradicated it is on this fact alone that auditing works it isnt what is said it is axiom 10 the cycle of auditing follows this pattern 1 the auditors question or command directs the pcs attention to certain area of bank causing momentary restim 2 the pc perceiving the area of bank that has been restimulated responds by verbalizing 3 when he is acknowledged and receives the acknowledgment he knows that he has responded 4 that area of the bank blows most auditing rules exist to maintain the purity of the auditing cycle the tech exists to determine what should be restimulated in what sequence if you have done the auditing cycle right and you know what buttons should be hit and what responses should be given then you only need add repetitive question and response and the proper sequence of questions each followed by the same cycle to obtain the state of release clear theta clear or ot that formula is the only reason anyone gets out there can be numberless departures from the auditing cycle other activities like selling and teaching have their own cycles which are different from the auditing cycle if the auditor has spent lifetimes being salesman he may use the wrong sort of comm cycle and end up selling the pc an engram or you may get someone who thinks forgiveness of sins makes people better this person wont use the proper auditing comm cycle he will do something else auditing is basically cycle of command that operates as an attentiondirector eliciting response from the pc and getting the pc to asis the restimulated area the pc knows he has done so when he receives an acknowledgment from the auditor that it has occurred that cycle all by itself is sufficiently powerful to get gains matter what words or process is used the mere fact of directed attention and the acknowledgment that the pc has directed his attention that fact by itself is therapeutic there need be significance in the command the repetitive action adds duplication to the formula this increases the effectiveness of the communication the person will become aware of the existence of another being he will become aware of mass and of whether his attention is easy or hard to shift his awareness will increase and his attention will become freer in essence those are your cchs it is the nonsignificance of directed attention the cchs present different ways of directing the pcs attention with minimal significance your worstoff pc does well on these because he discovers that there is matter energy space time and another being in the universe this can be great shock to him how does the great criminal live with himself by knowing that he is the only one that there is one else in the universe you cant tell someone in that condition to think of the significance of this or that because the significance would never arrive he cant duplicate it he can duplicate the fairly nonsignificant action of simply directed attention this is new idea in the communication cycle communication without significance beyond the significance of what the pcs attention is directed to linguistic analysts refer to the performance aspect of language apart from the mere significance of the words many an activity has directed attention but has not done so duplicatively that is one of the secrets of scientology processing and why it works this was not discovered before scientology because earlier practitioners couldnt duplicate you could run duplicative process on one object but two is better because it makes space and adds duplication you need to have two things to use you need two to make space we live in twopole universe you cant make space with just one spot you also need two things to have duplication this applies to op pro by dup the two points book and bottle give you space i dont care how you run op pro by dup run it you could direct attention repetitively in duplicative fashion or in almost any fashion and achieve renewed awareness on the part of another being of yourself and the world around him theres further significance than that and that is the whole result of the process this increased awareness improves iq alertness etc wherever you have communication line set up you have some kind of response system on this line and it will go through some kind of cycle knowing that different cycles of action exist you will see that the auditing comm cycle is unique and you will realize that the question or command directs the pcs attention by pulling his bank up around his ears the auditing comm cycle operates independent of the intention of the pc it is more responsive to the practitioner than it is to the pc any outsider has more control over the persons reactive bank than the person himself its on that fact that auditing is based the common denominator of the reactive bank is otherdeterminism so auditing requires an auditor separate from the pc to be very effective and when the auditor isnt following through the cycle of action of auditing then nobody else will adjust the bank for the pc an auditor who wont help the pc out by adjusting the bank for him is leaving him in the soup the auditor must control the pcs attention if the pc is to be able to asis anything in the bank otherwise the pc obeys the bank and auditing is not occurring there are good pcs and bad pcs there are only good and bad auditors the good ones know and keep in the cycle of auditing if the auditing cycle isnt followed auditing doesnt occur pc whose attention cannot be controlled cannot be directed into areas of significance that reactively dont want any attention directed there say the pc has goal never to look if you cant control the pcs attention you will never find it because the bank has more authority over the pc than the auditor does all goals lists contain goals of this character if you look over the goals list of pc whose goal is being easily found you will find an absence of those goals that command the pcs attention to go the other way you will find never to look or to be silent these goals cause trouble until they are located the pc whose attention can be directed by the auditor on the other hand will have great many of these there are good or bad pcs only auditors who do or dont use the auditing comm cycle and get it executed sometimes an auditor has to work harder than at other times thats all you should look over your auditing with the question is the pcs attention being directed by and can i count upon the fact that it is if you do this you will learn lot about your auditing and what is going on with that pc and the relationship between your auditing and what is going on with the pc
