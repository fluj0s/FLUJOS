hormonetreated meat charles hanrahan senior specialist in agricultural policy resources science and industry division summary the european union eu continues to ban imports of meat derived from animals treated with growth hormones despite rulings by world trade organization wto dispute settlement panels that the ban is inconsistent with the uruguay round agreement on health and safety measures used to restrict imports the sanitary and phytosanitary or sps agreement us retaliation authorized by the wto in the form of 100 duties on 116 million of eu agricultural products remains in effect while negotiations to resolve the dispute continue thus far eu offers of compensation trade concessions for lost us meat exports in lieu of lifting the ban have been rejected by the united states this report will be updated as events warrant use of hormones in meat production growthpromoting hormones are used widely in the united states and in other meat exporting countries in beef production in the united states they are used on approximately 63 of all cattle and about 90 of the cattle on feedlots in large commercial feedlots their use approaches 100 livestock producers use hormones because they speed up growth rates and produce leaner carcass more in line with consumer preferences for diets with reduced fat and cholesterol growthpromoting hormones manufactured in the form of implants to be placed behind the animals ear approved for use in the united states are compounds that either naturally occur in an animals body or that mimic naturally occurring compounds the us food and drug administration fda and the us department of agriculture usda cooperate in regulating the use of implants these agencies maintain that hormones in beef from an implanted animal have physiological significance for humans at all congressional research service the library of congress crs2 the eu hormone ban the eu commission enacted its ban on production and importation of meat derived from animals treated with growthpromoting hormones in 1985 the ban however did not take effect until january 1 1989 the commission justified the ban as needed to protect the health and safety of consumers from the illegal and unregulated use of hormones in livestock production in several european countries during the 1980s there were widespread press reports of black market sales of hormone cocktails by hormone mafia as well as several reports of serious health effects from consuming meat from animals thus treated political and economic considerations reinforced consumer concerns about the use of hormones and may have contributed to the commissions decision to ban the their use beef has benefitted from both high domestic subsidies in the form of price supports and high tariffs to protect it from import competition under the eus common agricultural policy cap this policy resulted in the accumulation of large costlytostore beef surpluses generous export subsidies complement high domestic price supports and tariff protection by 1985 beef surpluses were so large that eu policy makers were supportive of any measure that would limit beef imports likely to compete with domestic production and interfere with the operation of the cap many european livestock producers support the hormone ban in part because they are concerned about competition from possibly cheaper imported beef from the united states and other beef exporting countries consumer resistance to hormone use also creates concerns among livestock producers about maintaining eu beef demand affected in europe as in the united states by preferences of many consumers for diets low in fat and cholesterol beef demand in the eu has also been reduced by more dramatic circumstances such as the outbreaks during the 1990s in british cattle herds of bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse fatal brain disease commonly known as mad cow disease scientifically established links between bse and creudzfeldtjakob disease cjd the human variant of bse add to consumer distrust about the safety of the meat supply discovery of bseinfected cattle in number of european countries in late 2000 has contributed further to an unfavorable political economic and social environment for resolving the meat hormone dispute although bse has nothing to do with hormones many european beef producers are fearful of doing anything like using hormones that would give consumers another disincentive to buy meat in addition eu agricultural policy makers are resistant to policies that might accelerate the contraction of the agricultural sector and the move of agricultural producers and workers to urban areas where rates of unemployment are high in response to us threats to challenge the ban in the wto in early 1996 the european parliament voted unanimously to keep it the parliamentary resolution cited consumer worries questions of animal welfare meat quality and effects of hormones on the eus beef and milk sectors eu farm ministers also responded to the us threat on january 22 1996 by voting 14 to 1 to maintain the ban only the minister of agriculture of the united kingdom who argued that there was scientific basis for maintaining the ban voted to end it on may 11 1999 two days before the may 13 1999 deadline to bring the hormone ban into compliance with wto rulings the eu commission voted unanimously to continue the ban more recently may 24 2000 the eu commission announced legislation to ban one of the listed hormones indefinitely and the others provisionally in accord the commission crs3 said with article 57 of the sps agreement which permits such provisional bans while information on risk is assessed1 us reactions during 19861988 the united states challenged the ban in the committee on technical barriers to trade under the standards code of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt the eu however succeeded in blocking resolution of the issue in the committees deliberations when the ban entered into force on january 1 1989 the united states retaliated by imposing tariffs high enough to prohibit 100 million of eu exports to the united states these tariffs were applied to number of eu agricultural products including tomatoes citrus fruit pasta and hams neither the united states nor the eu appeared to want the hormone dispute to erupt in an expensive trade war or to disrupt uruguay round negotiations which had begun in 1986 to prevent these adverse consequences useu task force was created in february 1989 with 75day deadline to find solution us and eu negotiators reached what was termed an interim agreement on may 3 1989 under the agreement the eu agreed to set up certification system that would generate list of us producers of hormonefree beef who would qualify to export to the eu animals would arrive at us slaughterhouses accompanied by affidavits to support the producers claims of hormone free beef the food safety and inspection service fsis of usda would insure that animals came from producers certified by the eu system us retaliation on eu products would be reduced on an annualized basis by the amount of any beef or beef products shipped to the eu under the interim measure although not entirely satisfactory to us beef producers the interim agreement prevented the outbreak of trade war and provided for measured responses from both sides during the 1990s both sides looked to the uruguay round negotiations on food safety measures to provide some new basis for deciding the issue us livestock and meat producers and exporters continued to press the administration to challenge the ban using various trade remedies and following negotiation of the uruguay round agreements to challenge the ban on the basis that it violated the 1994 uruguay round sps agreement following its successful challenge of the ban on grounds that it violated the sps agreement the united states since early 1999 has been pressing the eu to lift the ban or as an interim measure negotiate compensation for lost us beef sales the uruguay round agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary measures the difficulty of speedily and effectively resolving disputes like the one over the use of hormones in meat production was one reason the united states negotiated vigorously in the uruguay round for stronger rules for dispute settlement and the use of sps measures to restrict trade countries often apply such measures to imports based on considerations of food safety or protection of the health of people animals and plants 1 article 57 of the sps agreement provides for provisional measures if scientific evidence is not available but also that members shall seek to obtain the additional information necessary for more objective assessment of the risk and review the sanitary and phytosanitary measures accordingly within reasonable period of time crs4 however there are concerns that these actions are often driven by protectionist sentiments not the welfare of consumers not only did the united states and other participants in the round seek clarification about the use of sps measures in trade they also sought speedier and more effective dispute settlement mechanisms for all trade disputes the sps agreement which took effect in 1994 prescribes rules that require scientific basis for measures that restrict imports on the basis of health or safety concerns each country may set its own food safety and animal and plant health standards based on risk assessment and its determination of an acceptable level of risk alternatively countries may use international standards the sps agreement recognizes the right of countries to maintain standards that are stricter than international standards however stricter standards should be justified by science or by nondiscriminatory lower level of acceptable risk that does not selectively target imports the sps agreement provides that the new dispute settlement procedures under the wto apply also to disputes about food safety and health measures as under the earlier gatt system the wto dispute settlement process begins with consultations between the affected parties and then proceeds to panel of experts if necessary under both old and new rules other parties may join in lodging complaint if they have material interest in the proceedings in the case of the us challenge to the eus hormone ban australia and new zealand joined with the united states in challenging the meat hormone ban canada which separately contested the eu ban also won favorable judgment from the panel established to adjudicate its challenge under the new procedures and in contrast to previous gatt procedures party cannot block the formation of panel and strict time limits are imposed on each step of the process once panel has issued its report party to the dispute may block its adoption however one new aspect of the process is the right to appeal the panels decision on questions of law or legal interpretation one of the most significant changes in the process is that the complaining party automatically has the right to retaliate if the offending party does not implement the panels recommendations within the agreed or arbitrated time limits the offending party may still provide compensation in the event it does not withdraw the traderestricting measure but if satisfactory compensation cannot be agreed upon the prevailing party may at that point invoke the new retaliation rule the entire process if followed through from initiation of consultations through appeal to implementation of panel report could take from 12 to 18 months or longer if arbitration results in granting an offending party reasonable period of time during which to implement wto decisions many trade analysts agreed that the united states had strong case against the hormone ban based on the new wto rules that require sps restrictions to be based on risk assessment and have scientific justification the us case also was reinforced by one of the major conclusions of an eu conference on the use of hormones in meat production held in brussels in late 1995 the conference concluded that on the basis of experience and published data there was evidence of human health risk arising from the controlled use of five hormones oestradiol beta 17 progesterone testosterone zeranol and trenbolone the conference did warn that illegal use of hormones was global problem and that stricter controls were needed scientists in attendance also concluded that there was need to coordinate better national control systems target surveillance systems and improve the efficacy of methods of detecting growth promoting substances whether used crs5 legally or illegally additional support for the us complaint came earlier in 1995 july when the codex alimentarius commission an international organization that recommends food safety standards voted to approve the use of natural hormones in meat production as recently as february 1999 joint united nations world health organization and food and agriculture organization scientific committee reexamined and confirmed the safety of three of the hormones used in cattle as it had done for five others in 1987 the wto panel decisions the wto panel deliberating the us challenge initiated in april 1996 to the eus meat hormone ban ruled august 1997 that the ban violated several provisions of the sps agreement first the panel ruled that the it was not based on risk assessment as required by the sps agreement article 51 of the sps agreement secondly the eu by adopting arbitrary or unjustifiable distinctions in the levels of sanitary protection it considers to be appropriate in different situations which result in discrimination or disguised restriction on international trade has acted inconsistently with the requirements of the sps agreement article 55 and thirdly the panel concluded that the eu is acting inconsistently with respect to the sps agreement by maintaining sanitary measures not based on existing standards without basing them on scientific justification article 31 the eu appealed the ruling and on february 13 1998 the appellate body of the wto found that the eu ban did contravene the eus obligations under the sps agreement but left open the option to the eu of conducting risk assessment of hormone treated meat wto arbitration panel ruled subsequently that 15 months ie until may 13 1999 from the date of the appellate bodys decision would be reasonable period of time during which the eu would bring its meat hormone ban into conformity with the panels ruling following both the panel and appellate decisions the united states called for the immediate lifting of the ban the eu however has kept the ban in place while it conducts its risk assessment on may 13 1999 the deadline by which the wto had said the eu must comply with its ruling on the ban the eu indicated that the ban would continue in force the eu indicated that it could not complete the scientific studies in its risk assessment before the end of the year apparently as justification for continuing the ban the eu commission offered what it said was evidence that one of the usapproved hormones is carcinogenic us trade and veterinary officials rejected the eu study however its findings they said ignored and contradicted numerous scientific studies including some by european scientists that show absolutely human risks associated with consumption of beef from animals treated with growth promoting hormones the eu offered to negotiate compensation but the united states held to its position that compensation would be acceptable only as an interim solution until the eu lifted the ban trade policy officials in both the united states and the eu are under enormous political pressure from various interest groups to hold to their positions on the meat hormone ban us meat producers and exporters are concerned about the continuing loss of the eu as an export market for meat especially beef and the prospect that other countries might adopt meat import measures similar to those of the eu in the eu opposition to hormonetreated meat continues unabated crs6 during the 106th congress the african growth and opportunity act pl 106200 included socalled carousel retaliation provision which requires the administration periodically to rotate or change the types of products targeted for trade retaliation it is aimed primarily at maintaining pressure on the eu to resolve the meat hormone dispute and another useu dispute over banana trade2 by penalizing wider range of foreign products and countries3 negotiations on compensation have been complicated the eus approach focuses on increasing the existing 11500 metric ton quota for nonhormone treated beef and reducing the 20 inquota tariff us exports have filled about 6500 tons of this quota under compensation scheme us retaliation would be reduced by the amount of the increased value of exports of nonhormone treated meat the eu seeks sanctions relief especially for french exports particularly hard hit by us retaliation the united states has continue to insist that compensation is an interim measure to be ultimately replaced by ending the ban compensation negotiations were slowed by related disputes over detection of the presence of eulisted hormones in us shipments of presumably nonhormone treated beef and disagreements over tests required in the eu but not in the united states for additional chemical residues both these disputes were resolved and raised hopes that compensation package might be negotiated however us beef producers became disenchanted with the compensation negotiations when may 24 2000 the eu commission announced that it was banning outright one of the hormones and that the ban on the others would be maintained provisionally these new regulations would become effective july 2001 meat industry representatives expressed concerns that such an approach meant that the eu would in the future ask for wto approval to remove the us retaliation and thereby end the compensation because the ban would then accord with wto rules4 the prospect of ending compensation without lifting the ban according to the meat industry representatives would be disincentive for the industry to invest in the additional production of nonhormone treated beef needed to fill an expanded quota resolution of the hormone dispute could remove critical irritant to the overall us eu trade relationship5 how it is resolved will have important implications for future wto disputes involving the use of sps measures to restrict trade the wto meat hormone decision the first to deal with sps measures is strong affirmation of the uruguay round sps agreement and its requirements that countries base their sps measures on scientific justification and risk assessment beyond that this case is critical test of the durability of internationally agreed upon rules and procedures that are in conflict with popular concerns and national political decisions 2 the useuropean union banana dispute crs report rs20130 3
