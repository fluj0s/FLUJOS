ballistic and cruise missiles and terrorist groups are considered likely means of delivering these weapons of mass destruction against vulnerable cities this report discusses us policies on complex security issues relating to these weapons and provides information and analysis regarding the current threat and trends in nuclear biological and chemical weapons and

foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30699nuclear biological and chemical weapons and missiles status and trends summary the united states has long recognized the dangers inherent in the spread of nuclear biological and che mical nbc weapons and miss iles this report which analyzes nbc weapons programs poten tial threat patterns around the globe is updated as needed the total number of nuclear biological and chemical weapons in the world is shrinking as the major powers scale back their inventories through unilateral reductions and arms control but other countries and groups still try to acquire these weapons there are five established nucl ear weapon states c hina france russia the united kingdom and the united states india and pakistan declared their nuclear weapons capability with nuclear tests in 1998 as did north korea in 2006 israel is also widely believed to have nuclear weapon arsenal about dozen countries have offensive biological weapons bw programs and the same number have chemical weapons c w programs that number could grow as new technologies are deve loped and the international flow of information goods expertise and technology c ontinues while the united states and russia eliminated intermediaterange missiles and are reducing their intercontinental missile inventories china is modernizing and expanding its missile force north korea iran israel india and pakistan are bu ilding short and mediumrange missiles and are developing longerrange missiles doze ns of countries have or are developing shortrange ballistic missiles and more ar likely to buy them over 80 countries have cruise missiles about 40 manufacture or have the ability to manufacture them and terrorists continue their efforts to acquire nbc capabilities elements in north korea russia chin india pakistan and other countries continue to export weapons technology the potential for secondary proliferation markets has grown and concern about th ability of individual actors like the pakistani nuclear scientist aq khan to peddle nuclear technology has grown considerably the number of countries or groups th at will acquire or produce nbc weapons may decrease if diplomacy arms control treaties nonprolifera tion regimes and security and assistance strategies are ffective nbc wea pons and missiles will remain potential threat for the foreseeable future but most observers readily agree that even if nonproliferation policies alone are insufficient to halt nbc programs such measures can slow those programs until states are persuaded that nbc weapons are not in their national security interesthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30699contents background 1 i m p l i c t i n s f r u s p l i c d c i s i n s 2p r l i f r t i n n d r i s k f u s

nuclear and biological weapons can cause massive casualties and other damage the effects of chemical weapons are generally c onfined to smaller geographic areas and cause fewer casualties but can create panic in poorly protected population although radiological weapons are sometimes consider ed in the wmd category they are covered separately 3 office of the secretary of defense report to congress proliferation threat and response november 25 1997 hereafter ptr 1997 nuclear biological and chemical weapons and missiles status and trends background1 in the mid1990s the primary threat posed by nbc weapons to the united states shifted from an allout usrussian strategic exchange to less overwhelming but more numerous and perhap s less predictable threats2 the dissolution of the soviet union had turned some russian weapons of mass destruction wmd strengths into weaknesses and the f ear of loose nukesprompted the us government to help shore up the safety nd security of russian wmd infrastructure around the same time inspections uncovered iraqs massive nbc weapons programs and crisis erupted over the rth korean nuclear weapons program it could longer be assumed that the united states would face symmetric or parallel threats paradox of the new strategic environment according to thensecretary of defense william cohen wa s that american conven tional military superiority actually increases the threat of nuclear biological and chemical attack against us by creating incentives for adversaries to challenge us asymmetrically3 accordingly congress has been concerned about the c ountries and groups that have nuclear biological and chemical nbc weapons are developing or trying to acquire them and about those who have or seek missile delivery systems the heightened sense of vulnerability to terrorism since the attacks in september 2001 coupled with reports of qaeda pursu ing research on chemical biological radiological and nuclear weapons has fo cused attention on the connection between terrorism and wmd in march 2002 presiden t bush stated that every nation in our coalition must take seriously the grow ing threat of terror on catastrophic scale terror armed with biological ch emical or nuclear weapons the unpredictability of terrorist efforts to ac quire nbc weapons and potentially higher probability of use pose serious challenge to global stability and security in particular the bush adminis tration has singled out stat sponsors of terrorism withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30699crs2 nbc weapons programs as particular secur ity threats us and allied leaders and analysts continue to debate the exact nature and extent of the wmd threat the status of nuclear che mical and biological weapons worldwide has changed only slowly over time in absolute numbers stockpiles are actually decreasing some us and foreign analysts emphasize the positive impact of the demise of the soviet union and progress made in usrussian arms control and international arms control others emphasize the negative impact of the nuclear tests by india pakistan and north korea missile tests by north ko rea iran india and pakistan continuing transfers of dangerous technology by states such as china russia and north korea the activities of clandestine procurement networks and growing interest in nbc weapons among terrorists this report fo cuses on the current threat and trends in nuclear biological and che mical weapons and missiles implications for us policy decisions potential nbc weapons threats to us security interest s affect important national security and foreig n policy decisions including the size and nature of the us military force structure us weapons and equipment acquisition us doctrine and strategy for homeland defense and military operations abroad including us training for nbc environments foreign policy and economic policy toward countri of proliferation concern and their neighbors in addition th status and trends of these weapons are key factors in national and international debates regarding the character of the threat to us security posed by nuclear chemical and biological weapons delivered by terrorists missiles aircraft or ships whether states or groups are ac quiring nbc weapons and missiles to deter or to attack regi onal powers or the united states whether intelligence estimates s hould be based on the capability andor intent of countries and terrorist groups to use nbc weapons and missiles whether us intelligence collection and analysis resources areadequate whether the united states should

equipment because the norms against use are not so clearly defi ned see crs report rl30427 missile survey ballistic and cruise continuedin the last decade the us government has taken many st eps to address nbc weapons proliferation4 for example in decembe r 2002 the white house released the national strategy to combat wea pons of mass destruc tion which divided relevant policy into three pillars c ounterproliferation to combat wmd use strengthened nonproliferation to combat wmd proliferation and consequence management to respond to wmd use counterproliferation efforts include interdicting wmd materials expertise and technology to hostile states and terrorist organizations as well as deterrence fense and mitigation according to the 2002 strategy these efforts also include preemptive actions to detect and destroy an adversarys wmd assets before these weapons are used5 strengthened nonproliferation includes active diplomacy multilateral regimes threat reduction assistance nuclear material and export controls and nonprolif eration sanctions finally consequence manage ment entails homeland defe nse against wmd threats proliferation and risk of use several factors appear to facilitate the spread of dangerous technology to additional countries and groups these same factors also might increase the likelihood that nbc weapons will be used either militarily or for blackmail technological developments i n nbc computer and production technology increasingly free flow of information people and goods growing disparities in c onventional military capabilities growing disparities in strategic defenses continued prestige of nuclear power growing prestige of missile capabilities perceived utility of nbc threats to deter us intervention perceived disdain by major powers for certain arms control agreements and internationa l cooperation on nonproliferation threat assessments are highly debated exercises and necessarily subjective because they must assess not only technical capabilities quantity and quality of weapons and control thereof but also th intentions of the state or group that possesses the weapons including options nd thresholds for use the connection between the existence of the technology or weapon and risk of use is not always clear one school of thought is that the risk of use is directly proportional to the size of stockpiles or diffusion of technology or material an opposing view is that the weapons themselves are manag eable on casebycase basis6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30699crs4 6 continued missiles of selected foreign countries by

general terms the reduction of globa l and regional tensi on helps reduce the perceived need for weapons of mass destru ction economic and political integration are also thought to reduce incentives for pr oliferation the strong and credible us deterrent capability might weaken the lik elihood that some hostile countries will acquire or use wmd analysts debate whether us development of national missile defense system would deter the proliferation and use of wmd or would incite further proliferation the nbc threat emanating from terrorist groups is even more complicated to assess it is frequently argued that terrorist groups will find it easier to cross thresholds of nbc use than even some rogue states and that they will not adhere to traditional notions of deterrence presid ent bush stated in march 11 2002 speech some states that sponsor terror are s eeking or already possess weapons of mass destruction terrorist groups are hungry for these weapons and would use them without hint of conscience and we know that these weapons in the hands of terrorists would unleash blackmail and genocide and chaos7 the strong connection between the further spread of nbc capabilities to states and potential availability of technology to terrorists is not new in the national security strategy for new century 2000 the clinton administration noted that the proliferation of advanced weapons nd technologies threatens to provide rogue states terrorists and international crime organizations with the means to inflict terrible damage on the united states our llies and us citizen s and troops abroad two years later the us special repr esentative for nuclear nonproliferation remarked to the npt preparatory committee that the spread of nuclear weapons to add itional states not only increases the risk of nuclear war among nations but also in creases the risk of nuclear terrorism the nuclear weapon program of proliferating state from the design of weapon to its assembly offers new opportunities for exploitation by terrorists new stockpiles of weaponsgrade nuclear material present tempting target nations seeking nuclear weapons who also harbor terrorists represent particularly severe threat to the civilized world8 on the other hand analysts debate whethe r rogue states themselves plan to use wmd against the united states some an alysts doubt these countries would overtly attack the united states with wmd because of the us ability to conduct an overwhelming counterattack but others contend nbc w eapons might nevertheless be seen by these countries as useful to limit us military options and as weapon of last resort particularly wher regime survival is at stake the united states government works hard to decrease the risk of wmd use the spread of such weapons and capabilities nd the us vulnerability to the weaponshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30699crs5 9 for explanations of these agreements see crs report rl33865 arms control and nonproliferation catalog of

observers have expresse d concern that the united states is abandoning its arms control and nonprolif eration leadership and that the us emphasis on freedom of action will translate into other states seeking the same eg russia to the detriment of the in ternational nonprolif eration regime11 missile defense advocates argue that ssile defense strengthens deterrence and keeps rogue states from being able to blackmail the united states its friends or allies by threatening missile attack additionally they note that missile defense weakens the incentive to develop test produ ce and deploy missiles

capability is or what its ultimate objectives might be these variables would have significant impact on threat assessments of wmd capability in numerical terms nbc weapons miss iles and programs ve not grown much in the last decade as proliferation by few countries has been offset by reductions in weapons by others however some countries are actively building nbc weapon stockpiles and they are improving capab ilities to deliver these weapons taking advantage of increasingly available missile technology these states are seeking or have developed indigenous production cap abilities and some have themselves become suppliers of nbc weapon or miss ile technologies some of these new suppliers either support terrorism or have terrorist activities on their soil the potential for additional

sufficient materials and knowhow to grow handle store and disperse biolog ical agents to have largescale lethal effect53 with time however as biotechnol ogy becomes more widely accessible some terrorist groups particularly those w ith significant state sponsorship could be able to mount more ccessful bw effort it should be noted that even small volume of biological agent or toxin if

international peace why us allies do not see missile threat september 21 2000appendix risks of nuclear conflict the risk of nuclear weapons use can be roughly estimated using such factors as the existence of nuclear weapons and delivery systems in various countries information on the readiness of those weapons for useweaponization deployment alert status evidence indicating that the conditi ons for using nuclear weapons in countrys strategy and doctr ine were close to being met the level of conflict between nucleararmed state and its adversaryies the level of frustration with long confrontation that was inflictingheavy casualties draining national resources and patience and challenging the leaders credibility even if not threatening national integrity it is possible that as more countries acquire nuclear weapons or expand their nuclear arsenals the likelihood they will use nuclear weapons will increase the acquisition of nuclear weapons by countri with inadequate command and control systems vague strategic doctrine or ggressive operational doctrine and poor intelligence on enemy capabilities and intentions could particularly increase the risk of nuclear warfare table 3 highlights some key events since the development of nuclear weapons that analysts use to assess the risk of nuclear warfare many national security analysts agree that the risk of nuclear warfare rose in the early 1950s and probably peaked during the cuban missile crisis tensions remained relatively high through the 1960s leading to high risk of si nosoviet confrontation in 1969 the early 1980s saw renewed risk of usussr nuclear warfare but that risk declined precipitously with gorbachevs opening of the ussr with the addition of new facto nuclear weapon states new risks have emerged in the middle east south asia and on the korean peninsula the clash in kargil and ongoing indian and pakistani tensions probably present the greatest risk of nuclear war since the end of the cold war several european and canadian defe nse experts expressed the view in 2000 that the threat of nuclear war has diminis hed substantially over the past decade and their feeling of safety has increased 76 views that the threat has diminished may reflect the probability that future nuclear war is more likely to occur in asia or the middle east although the nuclear arsenals of china india and pakistan are now considered primarily to be deterrent fo rces some analysts are cerned these countries may behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30699crs27 77 for further discussion of deterrence see crs report rl30623

squassoniadopting doctrine calling for the tactical use of nuclear weapons under dire circumstances in regional conf licts others worry that the very existence of nuclear weapons in the arsenals of antagonist countries raises the probability of nuclear war through miscalculation or desper ation if not in response to national doctrine other analysts contend the possession of nuclear weapons by one country in conflict is likely to deter other countries from using their own nuclear weapons or generally attempting to conquer the nucleararmed country77 the tense situation along the line of control in kashmir has generated significant media coverage about what might trigger nuclear war in south asia78 in addition the fact that future nucl ear attack may consis t of small number of detonations rather than catastrophi c exchange of hundreds or thousands of nuclear warheads may lead some to feel the threat is reduced other observers regard any developments that make nuclear weapons more usable ie smaller yields less radiation fallout or tailored for specific missions as potentially destabilizing this perspective underlined much of the recen t criticism of leaks surrounding the new us nuclear posture review resumpti on of nuclear testing would probably also be viewed by observers in that camp as destabilizinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30699 crs28 table 3 key
