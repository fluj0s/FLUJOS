operational platform the 747 along with its multimegawatt chemical oxyge n iodine laser coil is being designed to destroy missiles in the stratosphere above 40000 feet 12 kilometers within one to two minutes after launch at ranges of up to several hundred kilometers km the 1991 gu lf war raised concerns about the destructive capacity that small nations can possess in the form of short range missiles capable of carrying highl destructive warheads this capability motiv ated the u s military to seek an effective means of defense against missiles of s hort to intermediate range the socalled theater ballistic missiles tbm the abl program is currently in its program definition and risk reductio n pdrr phase the pdrr is intended to produce fullscale system with half power laser however the fy2001budget proposal includes significan t restructu ring of the abl program which if approved by congress would delay the abls first attempt to shot down missile from fy2003 to fy2005 under th current budget proposal funding for the abl program would be cut 903 millio n between fy2001 and fy2005 the current estimated cost of the abl is 11 billion includin g 16 billion for the pdrr if the proposed restructuring is approved b congress these costs would increase the air force contends that the abl utilizes mature technology capable of destroying enemy tbm at ranges up to hundreds of km others including the ai r force scientific advisory board have characterized abl key technologies s experimental the congressionally mandate d independent assessment team iat identified number of technical challenges facing the abl including laser powe r generation laser beam pointing and tracking capabilities p rediction and compensation of atmospheric distortion and the use of enemy counter measures to defeat the abl the iat also indicated that the air force re vised pdrr testing plan to address these challenges should reduce the risks and narrow uncertainties of the abl program congressional concerns about the abl have been expressed since its inception in fy1999 these concerns centered around two main issues the first is the belief that the air force had not adequately demonstrated the feasibility of the necessar technology to begin such significant investments needed to complete pdrr and second that testing necessary to make important decisions about the technological viability of the abl program will not ccur until fy2003 just prior to abl entering emd one year after the air force is scheduled to order second unmodified 747 the air force conducted number of additi onal tests in 1999 to address number of these congressional concerns the results of these tests are discussed in the reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30185contents introduction 1 brief

airborne laser antimissile program introduction air force restructures the abl program as part of its fy2001 budget the administration has proposed significan t restructuring of the abl program which if approved by congress would delay th abls first attempt to shot down ssile from fy2003 to fy2005 under the current budget proposal funding for the abl program would be cut 903 million betwee n fy2001 and fy2005 the air f orce requested 1486 million for the abl in fy2001 92 million below the planned level of 241 million co ngress appropriated 309 million for abl in fy2000 the abl is des igned to shot down theater ballistic missiles during their boost phase the 113 billion program is currently in its pdrr phase 16 billion and wa s scheduled to move into an emd program in march of 2003 if congress were t approve this proposal which is likely to receive considerable opposition in both th house and senate it is likely that the program would not enter emd until after 2005 further according to the air force programmatic delays will result in significant cost increases for the entire abl program the air force has placed the abl on its unfuded priority list upl that i s submitted to congress this list consists of service programs in order of priority that the they would fund if congress ap propriated more for defense spending than originally requested by the administration the fy01fy05 abl upl request restores 87 3 million of the proposed 903 million reductio n the air force 241 million plan request for abl the pdrr plane has recently begun its 18 month modificatio n to

implemented all of the major programmatic milestones dates contained i n this report will be delayed by minimum of two years the air force is currently attempting to build and install high powered airborne laser abl in modified boeing 747 to destroy theater ballistic missiles in thei r boost phase as an operational system the 747 with its multimegawatt chemica l laser is designed to destroy

their technological expectations modified abl is scheduled t achieve its first shoot down of missile in fy2003 the 1991 gulf warraised concerns about the destructive capacity of shor t range missiles often referred to as scud missiles capable of carrying highl destructive warheads t he growing possibility that developing countries may be able to deliver chemical biological or nuclear weapons has motivated the united states to seek an effective means of defense against missiles of short to intermediate range the socalled theater missiles each of the three services is developing theate r missile defense systems the army and navy are developing five theater air an d missile defense tamd systems to counter lower tier or short range missile s within the earths atmosphere and upper tier long range missiles above the earth s atmosphe re or in the upper atmosphere under the ballistic missile defens organization bmdo while the abl program is managed and funded by the air2 force it is coordinate d with bmdo from an operational perspective it is designed to be integrated with the other services tamd systems the abl has veral characteristics which are unique with respect to the other tamd systems first the abl is designed to destroy its missile in the boost phase within approximately the first two minutes of flight for reasons that will b discussed in the report unlike other tamd weapons the abl laser is unable t destroy missile once the boost phase is complete second the abl will be capable of detecting and locating the missile from the moment it is launched under idea l conditions eg minimal cloud cover and throughout the boost phase while the abl is being designed to coordinate its effort with the other services theater defens activities the abl would be capable of operating independently of the othe r services tamd systems third the abl also serves as surveillance vehicle its precision tracking and projection of target destinations of missi and aircraft can be passed on to the army andor navy theater operations command for use with other missile defense assets fourth the abl could be designed to attack other airborne threats such as aircraft and antiaircraft miss iles and ground base threats using optical sensors for detection and guidance finally given the planned mobility of the abl the air force contends it can be deployed to an area or region of potential conflict within 24 hours an d quickly repositioned as the conflict shifts in direction or extent thus the air forcehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30185crs3 directed energy weapon kills its target by delivering energy to it at or near the speed f3 light includes lasers and particle beam weapons spending estimates from official air force documents4views the abl as highly flexible weapon that can also help attain its core mission of securing and maintaining air superiority during conflict the actual success of directed energy weapon depends on the killing range3 of the weapon in this case high powered chemical laser other critical parameters of the abl are the accuracy with which the laser can be pointed the length of time the laser stays on target and the energy the laser can place on the missile while the air force has long history in xperimenting with laser weapons the abl would be the first fully integrated computer controlled system for ta rget detection tracking and firing multimegawatt laser as an antimissile weapon three advances in technology since the early 1980s have increased th possibility that successful abl can be built 1 the increased power and speed f microprocessors needed for the evaluation of complex algorithms mathematica l formulas for systems operations and control 2 steady improvements in th development of adaptive optics to insure the arrival of the sufficient laser power on the target and 3 the steady improvements in the development of an efficient ligh t weight chemical laser without all three of these developments this program would not now be feasible however there remain some complex technical challenges that must be overcome in order for the abl to be built and successfully tested responding to congressional concerns and the recommendations of th congressionally established independent assessment team iat th air force added risk reduction activities and significantly expanded the pdrr test program an d revised its estimat lifecycle cost of the abl program this estimate includes 16 billion 300 million increase for the current program definition and ris k reduction pdrr 11 billion for the engineering and manufacturing development emd phase 36 billion for the production phase and 44 billion for 20 years of operations and support if the air forces pdrr activities meet its technologica l expectations pdrr protot ype abl is scheduled to achieve its first shoot down of test missile in late fy2003 if this shoot down is successful the program will move to two year emd program in fy2004 as suming that

power level of the coil laser is classified information7a brief history of weapons at the speed of light5 the department of defense dod has been exploring the possibility of using lasers as both offensive and defensive weapons since the early 1960s by the mid 1960s all three services had established task forces to study the use of lasers s potential future weapons in the early 1970s the air force contracted with general dynamics corporation to build an airborne laser laboratory all and with hughes aircraft to design and build airborne pointer tracker laser in 1983 after nearly ten years of research the air force announced that the all had managed to destro or defeat five aim9 sidewinder airtoair missiles and bqm34 drone6 these tests did demonstrate that highpowered laser but with much s power than the abl laser mounted in an airplane could destroy missile further the all us human to initiate the separate computer controlled pointing an d tracking system shot at range of only

takes to build an abl the abl is complex system of stateoftheart technologies it utilizes three powerful lasers variety of infra red sensors and delicate precision optics powerful computers and complex software control its operation the abl is composed f several major subsystems which address the functional requirements of detection tracking aiming and adjusting the lethal laser beam and destruction of the missile final challenge involves integrating the subsystems into working weapon on board specially modified aircraft the term abl designates an aircraft carrying multimegawatt laser and a7 complex optical system to direct and refocus the laser beam as it travels through the atmosphere towards the target the abl system is designed to cruise in safe table 1 brief history of air

chemical lasers produce power as highenergy beam of concentrated light derived fro m9 chemical reactions in this case between excited oxygen and iodine atoms most of the following descriptions are taken from official air force documents10zone of combat theater behind friendly li nes where it can detect track and fire the high powered laser to destroy theater ballistic missiles tbm launched from th enemy territory for technical re asons missile destruction must take place during the boost phase of the missile and above the clouds at elevatio ns in excess of 40000 feet below this altitude atmospheric visibility can be obscured by clouds and th atmosphere has great deal of turbulence these two conditions can hinder th detectio n and precision tracking of the missile early in its boost phase thereb limiting the lethality of the chemical oxygen iodine laser coil9 one of the advantages of early destruction of the missile is that the warhea d with its payload is likely to fall onto enemy soil older tbms eg scuds have range of about 200 km 300 km while new tb ms have ranges that can exceed 1000 km dependin g on the payload and the material the missile is made from ie aluminum or steel as previously indicated the abl is designed to be completely autonomous in that it can detect locate and destroy missile without assistance figure 1 shows layout of the abl in the aircraft the multimegawa tt coil laser is positioned in the rear portion f the fuselage the lethal beam travels in helium filled tube to th beam control unit in the nose of the aircraft the beam control unit compensate s focuses the beam and projects the beam through window in the nose of th aircraft directing it at target hundreds of kilometers distant in addition there are infrared sensors and trackers for detecting and locating additional missiles while the abl is engaging an identified target the abl wi ll have to carry the chemical laser fuel on board the aircraft figure 1 the air force estimates that the current laser fuel carrying capacity wil l allow the high powered laser an estimated 2 0 to 40 shots at number missiles before requiring the plane to return to base for refueling the weapon however capacit could be less than 20 to 40 shots depending on the duration of each shot which i s expected to last number of seconds depending on range and atmospheri c disturbances the following

sensors design ed to detect the heat radiated by the exhaust plume from the rocket or alternatively satellite or other surveillance vehicles that can detect and locate the firing of rocket in the theater of action or war zone the abl aircraft will carr several infrared search and track sensors irsts which will allow the tracking of more than one missile launch irsts is used to detect signal characteristics of hot missile exhaust once the launched missile has bee n located these irsts establish an initial coarse track of the missile trajectory s informa tion on the trajectory accumulates it will be conveyed to the main ab l computers the detection and coarse tracking equipment employs matur technologies which have been used on military aircraft and satellites for number of years the chemical oxygen iodine laser coil the coil is dualline multimodule laser operated as single unstabl resonator continuous beam with the cavity mirrors installed midship and pair of turning prisms at the rear to complete the beam pat h see figure 1 located near the exit mirror deformable mirror cleans up the beam profile as it leaves the laser chemicals for fueling t he laser along with the plumbing are stored in the central and rear portions of the fuselage according to the air force the coil laser provides fficient power to destroy missiles up to several hu ndred kilometers under various atmospheric conditions the initial pdrr demonstration aircraft will use six lasers 2 rows 3 lasers in each row to producing mo re than megawatt mw of power the actual operational system will have 14 lasers 2 rows 7 lasers in each row which will produce severa l megawatts of power see figure 2 this is significantly higher level of power than has been produced with continuous or semicontinuous ground bas ed chemical laser lasers are inherently inefficient devices in that they convert only small fraction of the input energy into laser li ght energy most of the energy is dissipated as heat the limited availability of electrical power on an aircraft precludes using electricall powered lasers of the megawatt size the chemical laser uses the energy resultin g from the chemical reaction of sever chemicals to power laser without massive use of electrical power the coil chemical energy is supplied by the reaction f hydrogen peroxide and chlorine to obtain its destructive power this laser mus t sustain high power output for number of seconds and produce high quality beam designing and constructing the high power er for installation aboard an aircraft are some of the more difficult engineering challenges for this project precision tracking this section and the following two sections on adaptive optics and the mounted turret describe the beam

pdrr to emd source figure provided by the air forcehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30185crs10 mach 1 is equal to the speed of sound or approximately 1150 feet per second at sea level11complex optical system which tracks the missile the atmospheric compensatio n subsystem and the 15 meter laser beam steering mirro r mounted in the rotating nose turret with the 174 meter window see figure 2 the abl system uses the coarse tracking data from the i rsts sensors to initiate the precision tracking system to direct the lethal laser the tracking unit operates as separate laser radar system powerful pulsed laser is dire cted at the target some of the light is reflected off th target missile and returns to the tracking unit on board the airplane detector collects this light and computer pro cesses the sensor signals to form an image of the missile the tracking laser locks onto this image to track the trajectory of the missile this is time critical ope ration the abl must lock onto the missile within several seconds depending on the range of the missile the abl system requires this tracker to locate within tens of centimeters the front of the missile at distances of several hundred kilometers the need t concentrate the energy from the lethal laser onto the body of the missile drives thi s high precision requirement mo reover when the tracking system first locks onto the missile it may only be traveling at mach 1 but by the time the system is ready to fire11 the coil laser the missile will be traveling at mach 2 or faster and continuall accelerating until burnout or destruction the tracking subsystem consists of number of mirrors including the outpu t mirror 15 meters in diameter that directs the lasers at the target the mirrors ar mounted on special bench that keeps them in precision alignm ent the coils beam is directed through some of the same optics to the missile the tracking laser has slightly different wavelength than that of the coil and thus the tracking lase r operates independently of the coil adaptive optics system aos as the coil beam propagates through the atmosphere to the target missile i t encounters turbulence water droplets ice crystals and temperature variations which can distort the beam and cause it to lose focus on the missile see figure 1 very common phenomenon such distortion can be seen by viewing d istant object through air rising off hot pavement if the coil beam encounters atmospheric turbulence it will if uncorrected lose focus and become ineffective in destroying the missile the purpose of the aos is to compensate for t he beam distortion to ensure the beam has sufficient coherent energy to destroy the missile here is how it works separate beacon laser generates string of rapid light pulses which scatter off the missile in the same manner as the tracking laser th aos collects and analyzes the scattered pulses to measure the distortion produced by the atmosphere the aos utilizes this measurement to reshape special computer controlled deformable mirror which distorts the outgoing coil beam to compensate for the distortion resulting from atmospheric turbulence experience wit h astrono mical applications and other laboratory studies have shown that this bea m compensation will focus more energy on the missile target maintaining its lethalit yhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30185crs11 instead of losing it because of d ispersion in the atmosphere the ratio of the focused power in the actual beam to that of perfectly focused beam is known as the strehl ratio sr however i t is important to note that if the initial beam produced by the coil is insufficient in terms of power andor coherence the aos will not be capable f correcting what the coil was unable to produce initially the nose mounted turret another crucial component of the abl is the approximately 12000 pound turret in the nose of the modified 747 aircraft the turret carries both the 174 mete r window and the 15 meter pointing mirror the latter is mounted on gimbal tha t rotates the mirror to point the laser beams at the target the turret field of regar d covers the forward hemisphere of the aircraft and the aft portion almost to th wingsthe nose window is critical optical component for abl all three lase r beams the passive image of the missile plume for the plume tracker and the return signals for the fine tracker and the atmospheric compensation s ubsystem pass through this window aside from purely structural engineering the window has several system level requirements 1 the shape location and installation must minimize the exterio r boundary layer turbule nce around the window so as to minimize optical distortion in the coil beam 2 beam distortion birefringence due to mechanical and therma l strain in the window must be minimized and 3 there must be low absorption an d scattering of the laser light as it passes through the window and is reflected off th target back to the abl optical system systems integration boeing is the prime contracto r and is responsible for overall management of the abl program including the sign ificant challenge of systems integration boeing has developed plans to modify 747400 aircraft for the abl besides accommodating the coil and t he bcfc two major components of boeings aircraft modifications are 1 the rotating nose window which also carries the 15 meter pointing mirror and 2 the laser gas exhaust system since the interior of the aircraft will be noisy particul arly when the lasers are operating boeing is investigating the need fo r enhanced communication equipment among the flight crew and abl operators the abl computer controlled command and control center must coordinate all the activit ies of the three lasers on board this includes acquiring the initia l information on the location of the missile launch initiating the pointing laser th precision tracking laser and the subsequent follow on activities of the tracking laser beam adaptive optics system aos concluding wi th the firing the coil all of this must take place in 30 seconds or less as the missile accelerates to high velocity in its boost phase to aid in the systems integration tasks boeing is using the catia sophisticated computer design tool used in building its commercial aircraft thi shttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30185crs12 compute r design tool allows boeing or any other abl contractor to make blueprint change in one abl subsystem that will automatically be reflected in other subsystem drawings if necessary the softwa re engineering makes use of the existing boeing open system architecture and all builds are tested in virtual abl facility at boeing general systems operations cruising in safe fly zone probably behind the battle lines the abl is capable of operating as an autonomous platform designed to detect target and destro theater missiles aimed at local military assets abl relies on either its onboar d detecting equipment or standard airborne or satellite detection equipment now i n service to detect missile launch once located the abl initiates its laser rada r tracking subsystem to lock on to the moving missile and track its position to hig h accuracy the aos utilizing second laser sends and receives signals from th target to measure the atmospheric turbulence in the path of the laser beams th aos converts these measurements into corrections that help re focus the power of the coil beam on the ta rget in matter of seconds the multimegawatt coil is focused on the missile for sever seconds depending on the distance to the target to destroy the missile below an altitude of 125 kilometers about 41000 feet atmospheric visibility can be obscured by cl ouds and atmospheric turbulence these two conditions would greatly hinder the detection and precision tracking of the missile early in its boos t phase and they can limit the lethality of the system consequently the genera l consensus among the engineers and the air force is that the best time to attack the missile is as it enters the stratosphere above the clouds where there is s atmospheric turbulence and before the boost phase terminates notably the latte r part of the boost phase also coincides with large acceleratio n and stress on the missile the abl is designed to destroy the missile during the boost phase because 1 the rocket is highly vulner able to disruption while it is under power 2 it is relatively easy to detect and track its exhaust plume and 3 the laser beam destroys b destructive heating of the stainless steel missile body figure 3 displays the characteristic fe atures of typical short range missile the main body of the missile between the conical warhead and the engine at the base of the missile is mostl fuel tanks the warhead is about two meters in length and the engine comprising turbo pumps and combustion nozzle occupie s about two meters at the base of the missile at take off 7580 of the weight of the rocket is l contained in thin metal casing the six to eight meters of the main body carries the fuel oxidizer and guidance system it is considered the most vulnerable region for the laser focusing the tracking laser on the warhead provides the informatio n needed to guide and focus the lethal laser httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30185 crs13 6 because an enemy missile ma have chemical or biological sub munitions goal of boostphas defense is to have it fall as close s possible to the attackers territory

articles in ieee spectrum september 1997 and private communication with geoffre forden at the congressional budget officeon the missile body in an effort to penetrate one of the fuel tanks as the laser heats the missile casing to high temperature t he combination of internal fuel pressure and axial stress on the missile from the thrust of the engine may cause one or more of the following the internal fuel pressure may rupture the tank and the fuel will leak out at minimum the rocket would premat urely terminate its boost phase and fall short of its target destination the launching forces on the rocket under acceleration may collapse th body of the rocket causing it to fragment and the warhead would veer off and possibly fall in the vicinity of the launch site less likely leaking fuel may detonate and destroy the rocket and it s warhead it is important to note that destroyin g the missile does not automatically destroy the warhead its ultimate fate is largely speculative at this time the reason for this is in the dynamics of launching ballistic missi which is similar to firing rifle the launch begins with an explosive burst of energy for minute or two the boost phase followed by four or five minutes of coasting to the target the rocket launche s verticall about onethird of the way through the boost phase it has attained th velocity of mach 1 and an altitude of more or less five kilometers at this point the rocket thruster shifts to aim the rocket at the target the boost phase continues for another 30 or 40 seconds at which point the miss ile is traveling many times the speed of sound and is climbing through an altitude of 30 or 40 kil ometers 1824 miles the missile or warhead coasts on the remainder of its trajectory to the target some long range ballistic missiles may have the capability of small midcourse corrections an d some detach the warhead from the rocket at the end of the boost table 2 approximate values for scud missiles currently fielded12 parameter

the missiles currently in the field also it is possible to reduce the payload in order to obtain marginal extension of the range the air force also sees the abl performing other def ensive and offensive tmd missions in the theater operations besides destroying the missiles the air forc contends abl could track them with high precision providing essential information to the army and navy terminal defense operations and warn the target areas of the impending attack the air force is currently analyzing t he potential of abl to defeat airborne threats ie aircraft and missiles for self protection and the protection f other high value airborne assets in the immediate combat area there are many thousands of older scud missiles deployed around the world with range of 300 km or less which according to the air force the abl is well designed to attack and kill while some critics consider that long range missiles will be inaccessible to the abl the air force contends that the abl could provide n additional capability against these missiles and essential information on thei r trajectories abl technical challenges as previously noted the basic requirement for the abl is to destroy missile from range of several hundred kilometers within couple of minutes after launch at shorter operational ranges distances less than half of the expected ab l operational range it is likely that the air force can build an airborne laser system13 that would knock down missile shortly after it was launched under reasonably ideal conditions but can syste m be built that will deliver energy to missile at ranges of several hundred km sufficient to destroy the missile this is the essential questio n that defines the systems efficacy why is the range parameter chosen although the air force emphasizes the existence of thousands of short range scud missile s scattered around the world table 2 shows an evolving trend towards longer rang and high thrust missiles for theater ope rations this implies that either the abl must penetrate into enemy territory or destro the missile from long range in addition to range the lethality of the abl during combat depends on other parameters such as the variety of atmospheric conditions in which it will operate the variety of counter measures that could be employed and the systems ability to respond to rando m events such as the launching of several missiles simultaneously the following sections xamine performance estimates and technical challenges for the major subsystems as well as over all systems integration the

operational aspects of the abl program system is capable of destroying missile in its boost phase at ranges of up to several hundred kilometers bfcf tracker and adoptive optics system aos as part of the beam control fire control bcfc system the tracker and th adaptive optics system aos uses relatively new technology that has been widely implemented in modern astronomy but has never been employed with high powe r lasers such as the coil the air force has performed number of experiments on aos components to dete rmine how atmospheric turbulence affects the propagation of laser beam one such experiment the firepond experiment involved shor t range 54 km closed loop tracking test on static target at the mit lincol n laboratory which demonstrated that the strehl ratio srlevel of beam coherence for an uncompensated beam can be increased by factor of four with an aos this demonstration simulated the abl conditions for range of 218 km in th stratosphere it is also important to note that the target was not moving one of the key components of the aos is the deformable mirrors whic h modulate the laser beam to compensate for atmospheric distortions the final aos optics bench will utilize three 30 cm deformable mirrors with 261 computer controlled actuators 10 cm version of this mirror with the appropriate number of actuators and special optical coating to prevent the mirror

iat indicated that atmospheric compensation has t yet been demonstrated14 at operational flight altitudes the iat report noted that while the initial detection of the missile launch plume should not be difficult the steps leading to the destruction of the missile will be very challenging once the missile has been detected the abl pointing and tracking lasers must acquire and measure the distance

high power out the turret window and onto the target the energy deposited on the target causes the missile casing to heat and when the local temperature reaches the yield destructive temperature for the metal the internal stresses on the casing will cause it to fail and the missile will break up the success f the coil is critical to the future of the abl as currently designed an irborne laser of this magnitude has never been built the four major design drivers are weight size power and beam quality in september of 1998 single laser module with the appropriate size required for the aircraft and flightweighted to 3104 pounds 14 10 kg was tested to better than 110 of design power from this test the engineers have initiated some design improvements to be implemented for the next version of the flightweighted coil however recent general accounting office gao report questioned th validity of the co il power and quality measurements for two reasons first the af tested flight weighted coil that contained some key components which were not represent ative of the coil that will be deployed in the operational abl second while the af indicated that beam quality was satisfactory the af did not fire th laser and simultaneously measure beam power and quality although the f measured output power directly beam quality was estim ated using software models17 while it is not always possible or practical to hot measure th beam quality of high energy laser using software models to estimate beam quality for flight weighte d laser that has never been fired raises obvious conc erns af representatives have noted that their approach for measuring power and quality complies with scientificall accepted methods for estimating power and beam quality during the testing an d development of high energy lasers the chairman of the iat thomas mars h indicated that he had confidence in the air forces test results of the coilhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30185crs18 the details of the estimates and potential time frames for destruction based on missil e18 distances are classified and can not be discussed in the reportthe air force not scheduled to hot test the tire pdrr laser subsystem ie all six modu for power and beam quality until july of fy2002 only 14 month s prior to the first scheduled lethal intercept in late fy2003 for the coil to destroy missiles at hundreds of kilometers it must produce beam of exceptional quality if the beam quality is not sufficient the coil may not be able to deliver enough energy on the target required to cause the missile to fail during the boost phase based on general scientific principles and estimated laser power levels bea m compensation factors and the rate of metal heat absorption crs has estimated the time it takes to locally heat the missile casing to the elastic destructive yiel d temperature these estimates are als based upon the range values extrapolated from the abl experiments at the mit lincoln laboratory in 1997 these estimates suggest that at the shorter operational ranges the abl if i t operates as advertised is likely be effective against tbm this estimate is based on remaining boost phase times for 2 mm thick exterior steel casing of the missile 18 however at greater operational ranges for similar casings the time required t destroy the missile may excee d the time left in the boost phase given these potential operation limitations it appears that fully functional abl system at longe r engagements ranges could be vulnerable to counter measures for example counter measure which lowered the return signals for the tracking and aos could cause the coil beam to wander and defocus and increase the dwell time to longer than th boost phase time moreover if more than one missile is launched at the same time these estimates suggest that single abl may not have the time to engage bot h missiles at longer operational distances however it is important to note that according to the af air combat command abl exceeds operational rang requirement for all classes of scud missilies atmospheric turbulence as mentio ned above turbulence in the lower atmosphere below 125 km will weaken attenuate and defocus the laser beams the air force has devote d consider able effort estimating and correcting for this attenuation the primar approach will be to try to engage the missile above t he troposphere utilizing the aos to compen sate for beam distortion approximately 125 km above 40000 feet below 125 km the air force will apply the aos to the coil laser beam t compensa for atmospheric defocusing based on the earlier work at phillip s laboratories the gathering of atmospheric turbulenc data ablex and ableace tests and the 1997 lincoln laboratorys firepond experiment the air force i s confident that the aos will meet its basic operational requirements for the abl the iat noted that the ultimate value of the abl depends on actual turbulence to be at or below curren t af estimated values however as noted by the iat much of the afs current turbulence estimates are derived primarily from nonoptica l measurements in regimes that may not be representative of the anticipated laser beam path of the proposed operational system the iat recommended that the fhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30185crs19 op cit secretary of defense response to iat report p 619 op cit secretarys response p 920undertake comprehensive atmospheri c measurement program under conditions that more accurately represent the operational environment of the abl 19 the secretarys response to the iat findings also noted that turbulence i n excess of the design s pecification along the slant path between abl and its intended target can reduce abls maximum lethal range and increase dwell times even t lesser ranges the complication is that there appears to be clear method fo r estimating turbulence levels along slant path to particular threat location at given point in time the af will collect more turbulence data in order to develop20 tactical options for addressing this issue further even when operating above the troposphere at greater operationa l distances the curvature of the earth causes portion of the laser beam to pas s through the troposphere introducing that turbulence into portion of the beam path conseq uently it is likely that at greater operational distances the laser beams wil l sometim encounter atmospheric defocusing and attenuation and may not hav enough time to destroy the missile in its boost phase to address osd and congressional concerns about the ability of the aos t track and compensate for atmospheric turbule nce the air force to accelerate series of tracking and illumination tests from north oscura peak nop in new mexico using both fixed and moving targets out to range in excess of 50 km series of comprehensive tests on tracking and the aos focusing on beam compensation and scoring will be conducted to validate the operation of these crucial bcf c subsystems these tests will scale to abl engagements of 300 to 400 kilometers in range however its important to note that the af will be utilizing surrogate laser and replica of the bcfc system not the actual hardware that will fly in the abl the air forc conducted additional aos testing at in july of 1999 i n which scaled laser was aimed at target 50km away the test facility included functional equivalent of the aos scheduled for the abl with scaled mirrors an d power to replicate an abl engagemen t of target over distance of 300400km at the conclusion of these tests the air force reported that the laser was able to place sufficient energy on the target with atmospheric conditions three times worse than the abl is expected to operate in the nose mounted turret this nose turret is made with lightweight composites carrying the 174 meter window and 15 meter mirror two heavy glass objects see figure 1 the turre t rotates up to 260 in order to direct the lasers toward the target weighin g0 approximately 12000

quarter of fy2001 systems integration one of the most demanding challenges facing the abl program is assembling the subsystems i nto fully integrated and operating system aboard an aircraft with the airborne laser laboratory all program in the 1970s and 1980s the air force has had experience assembling several hundred watt laser and optics system aboard an aircraft nevertheless the abl multimegawatt laser and precision tracking system breaks new ground in systems integration boeing the prime contractor wil l construct special system integ ration laboratory sil at edwards air force

communications computers and intelligence bmc4i system and surrogate laser in place of th coil see figure 2 the integrated system will be fully tested on the ground and in flight with improvements made as required to bring it to full operational capability large groundbased multimegawatt lasers ie miracle nova and f the latter two at the lawrence livermore national laboratory all requir extremely rigid and stable mounting systems because any small misalignment coul d cause catastrophic failure of one or more optical components further high power lasers must be contained in exceptionally clean stable environments to prevent th destruction of optical components such as mirrors the abl requires that the three laser beams tracking beacon and coil be coaligned t within few micro meters aircraft can provide that level of rigidity and stability needed to maintain th integrity of the abl so the plan for the abl is active alignment that is severa l auxiliary lasers will constantly monitor and reposition key optical components t maintain alignment the air force b elieves that this system can in real time adjust to the flexing of the aircraft as it flies in addition to protecting the optical components the active alignment system is to assure the precision needed to direct the laser beams at the target missile the concepts of the active alignment system have been studied and demonstrated in the lockheed martin lm laboratory brassboard mockup of the abl optical systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30185crs21 lm has demonstrated under simulated flight conditions that

advisory board airborne laser scenarios concep t21 of operations sab9804 february 1998 p 11congressional concerns and issues current technical issues the legacy of the airborne laser laboratory and technology maturation ove r the past decade have led the air force to believe that multiple parallel path program develop ing and testing key abl components simultaneously often referred to s concurrency is the shortest route to successful abl therefore the air force has embarked on pro gram of acquiring long lead items such as the components for the nose turret and the 747 while completing the technology development and fabrication of the coil and the beam controlfire control bcfc subsystems this approach could lead to rapid progress and perhaps lower systems costs but it has its obvious risks the coil as previously indicated the extent to which the coil laser can engage an d success fully destroy an enemy missile in the boost phase is critical to the ultimat success of abl according to the af past rd efforts and recent test result s suggest that the coil as currently designed is capable of destroying missiles t operationally required distances during the boost pha however others suggest that significant testing and redesign of the coil laser will likely be required before th program moves into emd primarily because of the immaturity of the technology21 and the unique environment in which the laser must operate in an airplane that i s constantly flexing and vibrating if these concerns materialize the abl progra m could experience significant delays that might become very costly if they result i n suspens ion or modification of the long lead procurement items such as the secon d unmodified 747 the turret window and the 15 meter pointing mirror air force representatives characterize the coil as mature technology while the af claims that flight weighted coil laser module has successfully completed initial testing reaching 110 f required power and acceptable beam quality others including gao have questioned the validity of this claim because the af has t simultaneously measured the coil test model beam for power and quality again it is important to note that the coil must simultaneously produce beam of sufficient power and quality in order to destroy missile at variety of distances in limite d periods of time if the coil laser does not work as planned the af will not have usable weapon system consequently congress could request that the af conduc t hot test in late 1999 or early 2000 when additional coil ground tests ar already

bhp was injected into the laser as fuel for testing the coil this procedure was repeated every time the coil laser was tested the air force contends that after repeated use of hp inadequate cleaning of the flow tubes may have allowed the hp to contaminate the bhp which is used to power the coil laser air force officials note that this would not occur in the actual abl system because bh would be run through the laser before the aircraft takes off and not reused h owever victor george scientist with over 30 years of experience in designing and building lasers noted that if the contamination

the source on the contamination beam control fire control as described earlier the bcfc includes the missile precision tracking bot h internal to the 747 and external subsystems and the aos beam

fourth quarter of fy 2002 this includes the purchase of the second unmodified 74 7 aircraft under this schedule the air force would be committed to buying second modified 747 one year before the flight test and evaluation phase for the pdrr is completed including the actua l shooting down of missile in late fy2003 moreover the aircraft will not be modified until one year after pdrr demonstrations are complete this could be an issue for congress and the independent review team to consider second window wa s purchased under the pdrr program as risk reduction backup for an item with 36 month lead time unless the pdrr program should need the second window it will be used for the emd phase of the project counter measures an issue that appears to be receiving greater attention in air force ab l documents is discussion on counter measures that an adversary may employ t reduce or defeat the intent of the abl while much of this discussion woul d necessarily occur in classified environment the air force sab has recommended that the air force improve its response to both current and long term counte r measure s others have suggested that since the abl is not scheduled to b operational until 2009 it seems reasonable to expect that the air force shoul d examine the potential evolution of both technical and tactical counter measureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30185crs30httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30185crs31 united states air force scientific advisory board airborne laser scenarios concep t33 of operations sab9804 february 1998

prospects of n adversary applying very high polish on the outer casing of the missile in an attempt to make tracking and targeting more difficult in the long term the sab and others have argued that potential adversaries could harden existing or new tbm agains t attack they could also build new missile that has shorter boosting time thu s reducing potential abl engagement times or employ early release of submunition payloads however it is important to note that the abl design may make it more effective weapon again st missiles carrying submunitions than other tamd systems another counter measure would be to spin the missile when it is launched which then could take longer to destroy because of laser heat dispersion in terms f33 tactical counter measures the enemy could l aunch missiles from ranges beyond abls striking ability or quickly move missile and attack before the abl is deployed in most instances potential adversa ry would be likely to employ mixture of technical and tactical counter measures which could seriously compromise the operationa l capability of the abl the iat recommended that the af undertake an aggressive test and analysis program to gain thorough understanding of the effectiveness of such counter measures this information will be needed to support an informe d milestone ii decision at the conclusion of pdrr 34 in september of 1998 the air force announced that it is forming an independent directed energy countermeasures ssessment team decat to examine potential technical and tactical counter measurers that might be employed by an adversary to defeat the abl the dire ctor of this team will report to air force headquarters not to the director of the abl program office nevertheless key congressiona l committees may want to participate in closed briefings with the air force and other independent experts to examine the potential short and long term operationa l consequences of various technical and tactical counter meas ures likely to be employed against the abl the air force andor gress could request the lcat to develop potential counter measure tactics that could be deployed and tested during the latter stages of pdrr testing the recent acknowl edgment that the russians are developing new surface to air missile sam with range of 250 miles raises serious operational counte r measure concerns for the abl the 250 mile range is 10 times the range of sam s used in kosovo that made it difficult for us military commanders to successfull prosecute the air campaign referred to as the s400 the 250 mile sam is t

technology development the fy1994 senat appropriations report denied the request stating that recently released study n boost phase intercept bpi determined that abl was one of the riskiest approaches to attacking ballistic missiles immediately after launch the report also noted th 773 million cost to develop an abl demonstrator through fy2001 was t affordab congress appropriated 1945 million for abl technology in fy1994 with the stipulation that the secretary of the air force provide rationale fo r pursuing this technology and documentation that the program is fully funded in the future years defense program36 essentially past congressional concerns have centered around two main issues that were raised in the senates fy 1997 defense authorization report the first is that the air force had not adequately demonstrated through testing that the ke technol ogies were ready to be assembled into an abl and second that the ab l concept of operations would not allow the system to be cost and operationall effectiv in regard to the second issue the committee wrote that in terms f operations the abl will be forced to stand off approximately 90 kilometers from the forward edge of the battle area but the abl will have range well below 500 kilometersi n most cases below 300 kilometers this means that the abl will have very little capability against shortrange 300 km missiles and longerrange missiles launched from significant distances behind the forward edge of the battle area37 in its fy1999 defense authorization report the committee again raised thes two issues noting that the air force had not adequately demonstrated the feasibility of the necessary technology to begin such significant investments the report stated that the testing necessary to make important decisions

completed before initial modification of the commercia l aircraft to the abl configuration 2 the adequacy of exit criteria for the program definition and ris k reduction phase of the abl and 3 the adequacy of current abl operational concepts39 the report also reduced the 2922 million request by 57 million recommending 2352 million and limiting fy19 99 spending to 185 million until 30 days after the secretary of defense submits the iat report to congress the ia t report was submitted to congress on march 9 1999 senate appropriators have also called for additional testing of the coil lase r prior to proceeding to system integration activities in fy2001 in its fy199 9 appropriations report the committee stated that the air force has failed t demons trate propagation and lethality of the coil the fy1999 appropriation s conference report directs the air force to conduct meaningful groun d demonstration of the capability to produce high energy beam compensate the beam for atmospheric distu rbances and measure the deposition of laser energy on target under realistic test conditions the conferees reduced the budget request by 2540 million to 2672 million to reduce concurrency in the program and to incorporat lessons learned from the tests back into the abl program the air force contends that its testing program has been carefully structured to ensure that the critical risk areas associated with the various abl subsytems hav been properly characterized through prudent testing and valuation process the air force states that the abl subsystem test plan will address all the issues raised b congress prior to the start of systems integration activities in 2002 for example in response to the appropriators call for additional testing of the lasers and aos the air force will accelerate its planned time table for the nop tests on mockup of the bcfc subsystem and surrogate high power laser from early in 2000 to th beginning of 1999 the coil laser will undergo long series of

recommending moving abl to emd in fy2004 according to the air force th 25 million reduction and the call for more testing has led to 12 month delay i n some elements of the program and an estimated

developing and testing key abl components simultaneously versus developing and testing key components oneatatime r sequentially in the abl program the senate armed services committee report s rpt 10650 noted that the secretary of defense must develo p an acquisition strategy for the ab l that strikes an appropriate balance in managing risk and concurrency the legislation instructs the secretary of the air force not to begin modification of the pdrr aircraft which boeing ivered in january of 2000 until the secretary of defense certifies to congress that test and analysis results based on the followin g activities 1 the north oscura peak dynamic test program 2 scintillometry data collection and analysis 3 the contermeasures test and analysis effort 4 the letalityvulnerability program and 5 reduction and analysis of other existing data41 congress wants to be sure that all the abl major subsystems meet minima l operational requirements before the pdrr plane is modified any modification could prevent the air force from returning the plane to boeing if major technical obstacle arose during pdrr testing congress also instructed the air force not to modify the second aircraft th emd plane with scheduled delivery date of 2003 until the pdrr plan successfully completes robust series of flight test that validates the technica l maturity of the abl program and provides sufficient information regarding th perform ance of the system across the full range of its validated operationa l requirements modification of the emd aircraft was sch eduled to begin prior to the42 completion of pdrr testing including the actual destruction of theater ballisti c missile in 2003 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30185crs35 conclusion the current pdrr testing schedule is lik ely to present congress with series of difficult decisions fi rst as previously discussed given the uncertainties surrounding the coil cong ress may wish to request that the af hot fire the pdrr laser i n order to simultaneously measure beam power and quality rather than waiting unti l fy2002 when the pd rr laser is scheduled to be hot tested in the sil and on the airplane in fy2003 second under the current schedule the air force is to purchase secon d modified 747 one year before pdrr flight tests of all the major subsystems ar completed given concerns expressed about the maturity of cru cial abl technologies congress may consider delaying the purchase of second aircraft until after pdrr testing is completed nevertheless pos tponing the purchase of long lead items would predictably lead to additional cost increases and delays in deploying the abl it i s important to note that modification of the 747 begin s year after the air force places its order for the plane this raises the possibility that if the air force were to order the plane as scheduled boeing could take the plane back for commercial sale if abl is delayed indefinitely prior to the actual modification of the plane at or minimal cost to the government third major issue congress may face centers around the future of the ab l program and laser weapons in general as indicated in this report there is som concern that the abl may not be capable of demonstrating that it can meet the air forces operational requirements as it moves to engineering manufacturing an d development emd given that the air force will have spent over 1 billion on the abl before entering emd congress could decide to extend the pdrr testin g schedule until the abl demonstrates that the system will be capable of meeting it s operational requirements or if the abl encountered considerable science an d technology challenges during pdrr testing co ngress could consider using the abl as research and development rd platform that may eventually lead to th establishment of different or reconstituted abl acquisition program fourth given the desire in and outside congress to develop laser weapons congress may want to pursue the rd option even if the armys and navys upper and lower tier tamd re likely to be operationally ready prior to the deployment of the abl unlike other tamd s ystems if abl works as advertised it may be better designed for destroying missiles carrying submunitions before the submunitions are deployed fifth if abl pdrr testing reveals number of significant scientific an d technical challenges congress could decide to cancel the abl program if thi s occured congress could then instruct the three services and the defense advanced research projects agency to initiate number of research and development activities that would eventually lead to variety of laser based weapons finally congress could decide that the current reconfigured abl progra m reduces risks to sufficient levels that would allow the program to proceed to it s expande d pdrr flight tests schedule in fy2003 with additional testing th ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30185crs36 collection of additional atmospheric data and the validation of the aos compensation capabilities congress and the air force could decide that the only practical way of determining if the abl will work as des igned is to flight test the pdrr plane against variety of targets
