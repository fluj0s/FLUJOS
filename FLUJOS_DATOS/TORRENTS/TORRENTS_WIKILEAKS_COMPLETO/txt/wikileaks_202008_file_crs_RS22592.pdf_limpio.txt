demand separate vote in the house on any first degree amendm ent reported from the committee of the wholethe votes of the delegates and the resi dent commissioner were decisive and thus subject to automatic revote by the house on three occasions in the 103rd congress7 the rule governing voting in the committee of the whole by delegates and the resident commissioner has not been interpreted to mean that any recorded vote with difference of six votes or less is subject to automatic reconsidera tion in determining whether the votes of the delegates and th resident commissioner were decisive the chair follows but for test namely w ould the result of vote have been different if the delegates and the commissioner had not voted8 if the votes of the delegates and resident commission on question are determined to be decisi ve by this standard the committee automatically rises and the speaker puts the question to vote the vote is first put by voice and any representative ma with sufficient second obtain record vote once the final result of the vot is announced the committee of the whole automatically resumes its sitting9
