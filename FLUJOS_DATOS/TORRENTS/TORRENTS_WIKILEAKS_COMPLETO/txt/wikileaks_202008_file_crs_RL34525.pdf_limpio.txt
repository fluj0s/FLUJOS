challenges to its economy iran has long been subject to us economic sanctions and more recently to unite d nations sanctions partly due to the sanctions some foreign countries and companies par ticularly in europe have curbed trade and business with iran iran also has faced challenges in obtaining foreign investment for devel opment of its energy sector iran has turned to new trading partners such as china and russia and has focused more heavily on regional trade opportunities significant internal challenge is reported domestic economic mismanagement with the election of president mahm oud ahmadinejad in 2005 irans economic policies have worked to reduce regional and class disparities through oil wealth redistribution ahmadineja d has tried to reduce unemp loyment and poverty through expansionary monetary and fiscal policie s including large energy subsidies and subsidized lending however some criticize these policies for contributing to unemployment and inflati on and not reducing poverty another domestic vulnerability is irans dependence on its oil sector the governments chief source of revenue is from oil exports iran has experienced strong economic growth in recent years due to the rise in international oil prices but remains susceptible to oil price volatility iran has taken steps to diversify its economy such as through building up its nonoil industry sectors because iran does not have sufficient refining capacity the country is highly dependent on gasoline imports to meet dom estic consumption needs to reduce this dependency the country is seeking foreig

involved in irans underground economy the irgc has significant contro l over irans borders and airports the irgc is allegedly involved in smuggling alcohol and other low level contraband into iran some report that the irgc smuggles gasoline which is heavily subsidized in iran to other countries for profit37 some analysts believe that the revol utionary guard benefits from irans economic isolation with fore ign businesses unwilling or unable to enter into deals the revolutionary guard faces less co mpetition for acquiring new contracts however because the irgc frequently does not have the technical expertise that many international companies do the irgc sometimes subcontract s to international companies making profit as an intermediary in the

irans oil output has remained essen tially flat the government has set goal of 5 mbd which is still below the 6 mbd prerevolution capacity oil production has been hindered by number of factors first the oil industry f aces the high rate of natural decline of mature oil fields the decline rate is 8 for onshore fields and even greater at 10 for offshore fi elds second oil recovery rates in iran average between 24 and 27 much less than the world average it is believed that millions of barrels of oil are lost annually because of damage to reservoi rs and these natural declines additionally structural upgrade s and access to new technologies such as natural gas injections and other enhanced oil recovery efforts have been limited by lack of investment due in part to us sanctions55 the

unanticipated drop in oil prices to belo w 40 per barrel for more than one quarter could pose fiscal pressure56 oil price drops also would affect the private sector as iran imports significant portion of its capital and machinery goods from abroad fall in oil prices and subsequent economic downturn may increase political dissent among iranians already facing high unemployment and inflation levels dramatic unexpected drop in oil pri ces may be cushioned by number of factors iran may be able to draw from its osf to cushion an oil price bust however observers warn that this means iran would have to restrict its current spending from the osf to fund imports widespread embargo on iranian oil ex ports would threaten irans economy however this prospect is unlikely given th fact that iran is the second largest oil producer in opec and other oilproducing countries do not have the excess capacity to make up for loss of oil supply from iran because of irans dependency on oil export revenues iran

class disparities ahmadinejad has focused on redistributing oil wealth and to reduce unemployment and poverty through expansi onary monetary and fiscal policies including large energy subsidies and subsidized lending however some criticize these policies for contributing to unemployment and inflation and not reducing poverty second internal challenge is irans dependence on its energy sector which is the governments chief source of revenue iran has experienced strong economic growth in recent years due to the rise in international oil prices but remains susceptible to oil price volatility iran s taken steps to diversify its economy such as through building up its nonoil industry sectors because iran does not have sufficient refining capacity the country is highly dependent on gasoline
