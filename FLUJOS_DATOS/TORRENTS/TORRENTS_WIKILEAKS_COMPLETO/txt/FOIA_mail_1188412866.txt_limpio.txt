from kevin trenberth trenbertucaredu to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re something not to pass on date wed 29 aug 2007 144106 0600 cc michael mann mannmeteopsuedu phil confidential dennis shea just had angiogram 75 blockage having open heart surgery tomorrow morning he does not want this known till the operation results are known this is awful stuff and i cant imagine that this could be published i know of this fellow peiser though and he is extremely biased against you likely so treading with caution is warranted the email seems to invite comment but not review you should probably only respond with something that you would not mind being published you can also point out errors of fact whether you point out errors of logic or opinion is another matter altogether if you write just to the editor you can try to evaluate the comment and point out that it lacks substance i think my approach would be to try to stick to scienceeg i dont know what was done for the 1990 paper but obviously sound practice is 1 we attempt to use homogeneous data 2 site moves are one indication of lack of homogeneity but there are standard means of adjusting for such moves especially when there is an overlap in the record 3 all data are scrutinized for possible problems and discontinuities especially if there is question about possible move and the date is known 4 site movements do not necessarily prejudice the record toward warming or cooling move from the inner city to an outlying airport can result in cooling for instance 5 revisions are made when new information becomes available 6 it is helpful if researchers can improve the records and provide updated analyses or something to this effect you could try patronizing approach of over explaining the difficulties at the very least you should be critical of the statement in 4 that he politely requested an explanation he quotes you as saying why should i make the data available to you when your aim is to try and find something wrong with it11 ______________________________ 21 mcintyre s 19 july 2006 submission to the subcommittee on oversight and investigations committee on energy and commerce us house of representatives this is sworn statement by mcintyre it is available at 3httpenergycommercehousegovreparchives108hearings07192006hearing1987mcintyrepd f but you have reason to be defensive if there was problem with the data and all due care was taken then if there is something wrong with it it was the responsibility of those who took the data not those who used it responsibly you should also point out that the data are just as available to anyone as to you in the ipcc report we are careful to say that there are urban effects and they are important and we have lot about them but they are small on the global scale his conclusions are wrong also the ipcc evaluates published works and does not do research or deal with raw data in the appendix presumably the quotes are based on the best information at the time that was then the conclusions of the author that fabrication occurred is not valid maybe things could have been done better but that universally applies let know if you want more concrete suggestions kevin phil jones wrote kevin mike sending just for your thoughts the appendix of this attachment has gone to suny albany and is being dealt with by them not sure when but weichyung has nothing to worry about ive sent to weichyung and also to tom karl q is should i respond if i dont they will misconstrue this to suit their ends i could come up with few sentences pointing out the need to look at the chinese data rather than just the locations of the sites looking further at keenans web site hes not looked at the temperature data nor realised that the sites hes identified are the urban stations from the 1990 paper he has idea if the sites for the rural chinese stations moved as he doesnt seem to have this detail whatever i say though will be used for whatever so it seems as though im damned if i do and damned if i dont does the email suggest to you this is request for formal review ee have an awful track record as peerreview journal footnote 8 is
