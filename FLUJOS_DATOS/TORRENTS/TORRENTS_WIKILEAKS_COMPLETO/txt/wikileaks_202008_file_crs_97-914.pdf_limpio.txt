senate bill s 8 as it appear s in the draft chairmans mark of august 261997 to address the criticism that the superfund program favors excessively costly remedies some critics argue that the environmental protection agency epa shouldchange its risk assessment procedures and increase the role of risk assessment inselecting remedies other recommended reforms include establishing singlenational risk criterion for cleanup decisions ra ther than the current use of risk ranges some stakeholders suggest elevating the importance of cost in epas evaluation ofalternative cleanup strategies cost is curre ntly considered in ev aluating alternatives however critics claim that the statutes deference to arars and its preference forpermanence and treatment as opposed to containing waste and controlling land use have resulted in high cleanup costs some stakeholders cite superfunds reliance on arars for determining site specific cleanup standards as the cause for lengthydebates over which federal or state regulati ons or combinations thereof apply to site and for the selection of more costly remedies than are necessary to protect human health and the environment stakeholders who advocate elevating the role of risk assessment in selecting remedies also urge increased consideration of superfund sites future land andwater use many of these stakeholders advocate that state and local governmentsrather than epa decide future land and ground water use some critics of superfund claim that the current system of shared federal and state responsibility leads to delayduplication of effort confusion among stak eholders and higher transaction costs some states want full superfund authority and others only want delegation of thefederal program some stakeholders are in favor of full authority for the states while others are concerned about the burden on businesses that responding to as many as 50 state programs could create the gree of community involvement

introduction key issue in the 105th congress is reforming the superfund program which cleans up the nations most hazardous waste sites while the program has improvedthe practices in managing hazardous wastes to protect human health and theenvironment there appears to be consen between the public and private sectors that reform is necessary to increase the pace of cleanups and lower remedial costs although there is disagreement over how to accomplish this objective thecomprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 cercla pl 96510 established the superfund program and the environmentalprotection agency epa administers it and is responsible for adding hazardouswaste sites to the national priorities list npl the law provides for cleanup and emergency response for hazardous substances released into the environment cleanupof inactive hazardous waste disposal sites nd retroactive strict joint and several liability for potentially responsible partie s prps the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 sara p l 99499 revised and expanded cercla and introduced new cleanup standards into the program in an attempt by congressto add statutory language which would clarify for federal officials and prps appropriate cleanup remedies to be selected for contaminated sites while saras intent was to improve the quality and pace of site remediation critics maintain that superfunds problems have not been solved the current debate in congress on the r eauthorization of superfund has focused particularly on two major areas liability reform and remedy selectioncleanupstandards this is not to say that there is total agreement in other areas allowing the states to assume as much of the s uperfund program as they are able and willing to do appears to have fairly wide acceptance but subject of serious debate is underwhat conditions if any epa can reassert its jurisdiction over facility cerclasnatural resource damage provisions are also contentious as business interests seekto place limits on the amounts they could be assessed to restore or replace lost ordevalued resources there appears to be fairly broad agreement on other topics suchas allowing communities greater voice in the decisionmaking process recognizingand expanding the brownfields program fo r cleaning up less serious sites and assisting states with their voluntary cleanup

in superfund include prps attorneys the insurance industry medical health professionals citizen and environmentalorganizations federal agencies involved in superfund cleanups state and localgovernments the remediation technology industry and land development firmsmany of these stakeholders have broadly criticized superfund and argue that thestatutes cleanup standards are partly res ponsible for the slow place of cleanups due to the extensive process required to select remedies and have led to cleanup costs that are higher than necessary to protect human health and the environment superfunds critics believe that the statutes cleanup standards must be changed to improve thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97914crs3 programs pace and lower cleanup costs to address these concerns while protecting public health congress is attempting furthe r to define superfunds cleanup goals and the methods used to attain these goals to assist congress in its considera tion of proposals to revise superfunds cleanup standards this report discusses th existing standards under current law and recommendations for revising them offered by stakeholders in the debate the reportrelies primarily on information provided in congressional heari ngs including the one held on september 4 1997 by senate environment and public works among thequestions being asked about reforming superfunds cleanup standards are should cleanup decisions be based more on risk assessment considerationsand less on fixed numerical criteria is the statutes preference for treatme nt and permanent solutions reasonable how much weight should the cost of remediation be given in the cleanup decision should cleanup decisions be based on si ngle health risk value or on range of them do scientists have the capability to accurately predict health effects from various levels of exposure for all who ma come in direct or indirect contact with the hazardous substances involved the laws lack of national uniform vel of cleanup has been major source of controversy for the superfund program the reauthorization debate in the 104th and 105th congress has provided forum for stakeholders to outline their recommendations and proposals for reformi ng superfunds cleanup standards this report discusses the following issues that have arisen in the debate the role of risk assessment costeffectiveness of treatment elimination of applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements arars and preference for treatment and permanence future land ground water and other resource use the role of the states and community involvement in the remedy selection process administrative reforms to the superfund program in response to the debate over superf unds problems epa began to implement series of administrative reforms in 1993 to increase the pace of cleanups and lower cleanup costs while maintaining the same standards of protection for human healthand the environment while the revisi ons have not altered superfunds cleanup standards they have simplified the process of selecting remedial actions at certainsites through the use of presumptive remedi which are cleanup solutions that epa has successfully used at particular categorie s of sites the advantage of using them is that they are preapproved and not subject to the time and costs of

corporatemembers testified that epas administrative changes have helped to improvesuperfund but alone are not sufficient to solve the programs problems 6 t h projects members argued that comprehensive legislation is necessary to revise the current cleanup standards and process of lecting remedies if the pace of cleanups is to increase and remedial costs are to decrease stakeholder views epa and the states determine cleanup sta ndards for each site based on statutory requirements and preferences and based on arars which are state and federal lawsand regulations determined to be applicab or relevant and appropriate epa uses risk assessments to set cleanup levels if such standards have been established for the contaminants at the site the selection of applicable relevant and appropriate laws and regulations is highly discretionary because each site has its own set of unique conditions whichmust be evaluated many stakeholders have argued that arars and other factors have led to confusion about which cleanup levels are required cleanup costs that are unnecessarily high and sites that have been cleaned to different risk goals oneproposal for reform is to place more emphasis on risk assessment eliminating thearars requirement when determining how clean site should be renderedsupporters of this proposal claim that the elimination of the statutes arars requirement would result in less costly site remediations and savings to thesuperfund program some stakeholders also would like to see modification ofepas risk assessment methods to reduce reliance on what they see as overlyprotective assumptions and models the superfund program has also been critic ized as being too slow in achieving its goal delays in cleanup have been attributed to the statutes ambiguity regardingcleanup levels as well as other factors to address this issue some participants in the superfund reform debate advocate establishing single national riskmanagement goal which would also provide equal protection from hazardous waste for all communities prps have complained that epa has little regard for the costeffectiveness of its selected remedies cercla requires the implementation

congress 1st session p 491remedial actions for contaminated sites however it also requires that the degree of cleanup at minimum assures protection of human health and the environment7 one of the challenges of the current superf und reauthorization effort is to calibrate these goals in combination and produce work able solutions some reform proposals seek to elevate the importance of cost considerations in the superfund remedy selection process others want to reduce costs by facilitating selection of remediesthat have historically been effective often referred to as presumptive remedies some stakeholders have called for complete or partial elimination of the arars requirement in order to streamline th process used to establish site cleanup standards and to enable epa to place heavier emphasis on risk assessment and costof remedial action in addition to elim inating the arars requirement some critics call for the elimination of the statutory pr eference for permanent treatment solutions at hearing held in april 1997 the chemical manufacturers association testifiedthat the selection of remedies should be based on realistic assessments of risk andconsiderations of technical practicability reliability cost and community acceptancenot by artificial preferences and standards 8 some critics also claim that containment measures institutional controls such as deed restrictions nd treatment should be considered equally among remedies and argue that preference for treatment shouldbe reserved for hot spots of contamination there is broad consensus that future land use must be considered in determining the appropriate cleanup standard on which to base remedial design appropriate consideration of land use is expected to lead to more costeffective cleanups at reasonable pace land use is currently c onsidered in the remedy selection process however critics claim that states and cal governments should have more input into future land use determinations others ar gue that if cleanup decisions are not based on conservative land use assumptions ie re sidential or recreational as opposed to industrial communities that are located near nonresidential areas for exampleindustrial sites will be at greater health risk than those communities which are notlocated near such sites some stakeholders claim that the current system of shared federal and state responsibility has caused delay duplication of effort and confusion amongstakeholders the issue is whether states should be given full program authority or whether states should be given program delegation full program authority would enable states with such authority to im plement their own versions of superfund program while program delegation would give states the authority to implement the federal program notably however some others oppose any increase in stateresponsibility the success of superfund is measured not only by the number of sites cleaned and reasonable costs associated with running the program but also by publichttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97914crs6 9hayes david j and conrad b mackerron superfund ii new mandate bna special report environment reporter v 17 42 part ii

13determinations for purposes of this repor t risk assessment refers to various epa methods for evaluating and comparing risks at superfund sites14 epa currently uses risk assessment at several points in the superfund program it first conducts rough risk assessments at each site to determine whethercontaminants pose current or potential thr eat to human health or the environment if epa determines that site poses sign ificant threat the agency adds it to the npl these risk assessments adhere to methods detailed in the nationalcontingency plan ncp codified at 40 cf r 300 appendix to the ncp describes the hazard ranking system hrs as the principle mechanism the environmental protection agency epa uses to place sites on the national priorities list npl the hrs serves as screeningdevice to evaluate the potential for re leases of uncontrolled hazardous substances to cause human health or environmental damage the hrs provides measureof relative rather than absolute risk it is designed so that it can be consistently applied to wide variety of sites 15 for npl sites epa then uses risk asse ssment to determine the necessary level of cleanup and to evaluate appropriate clea nup remedies the remedial investigation and feasibility study rifs phase of the superfund program uses risk assessment to characterize the nature and extent of risks posed by uncontrolled hazardous wastesites and for evaluating remedial options 16 the remedial investigation ri gathers information sufficient to support risk management decision including likelycurrent and future risk associated with human exposures to releases from the sitethe feasibility study fs develops screens and evaluates alternative remedialactions during the fs phase epa determines the cleanup goals necessary forprotecting human health and the environmen t first epa develops preliminary objectives for performing remedial actions based on readily available informationsuch as arars and numerical criteria then epa bases the final objectives on results of the baseline risk assessment and an evaluation of expected exposures and associated risks for each alternative as described by epa the intent of the rifs process is to provide dynamic flexible process that can and should be tailored to specific circumstances atindividual sites it is not rigid stepbystep approach that must be conductedidentically at every site 17 some critics have claimed that in practice epa does not apply this flexibility and that the agency selects excessively costly remedies more often than costeffective ones many stak eholders have argued that the current risk assessment process is responsible for the selection of exceedingly costly remedieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97914crs9 18ibid 19barry l johnson phd assistant surg eon general public

hearing held in april 1997 bailus walker phd represented the american public health association and provided public health perspective ondealing with toxic substances that can affect human health the underlying purpose of superfund is to prevent disease and disability due to toxic exposures human exposures to toxic substances have many potential adverse health outcomes including neurological damage birth defects andcancer preventing the exposure of entir communities to potentially devastating health consequences is less important than protecting people from infectious diseases such as

suggestion to reduce program costs is to permit the use of presumptive remedies or remedies that epa has historica lly used at particular categories of sites which could be preapproved in order to void costs of extensive analysis currently required however some critics oppose us ing presumptive remedies because they essentially offer generic solutions that may not be able to address specific

savings in practice the implementation of waivers is often stymied by political issues such as some states reluctance to accept the waiver option the most important application of the waiver is for the case of certain ground water restorations for example the presence of dense nonaqueousphase liquidscommonly known as dnapls at hazardous waste sites has complicated manyground water cleanups 46

the current regulatory structure can impede the development of innovative treatment so lutions and examined the use of market incentives to spur new cleanup technologies the principal change necessary

without notable benefit after cercla had been in existence for 5 years many stakeholders recognized the importance of involving co mmunities in the process of selecting remedies as result sara added section 117 to the statute with the intent ofincreasing the level of community involvement however section 117 only requiresthat sites remedial action plan be made available to the public that the public have an opportunity to make comments on the plan and any changes to it and that epaanswer those comments and explain any si gnificant differences in the final

communities in the decision making process at hearing held in june 1995 the depa rtment of energys assistant secretary for environmental management thomas p grumbly made the following argument in support of involving affected communities superfund should be reformed to incorporate community involvement earlier in the remedy selection process we have often been criticized for not adequatelyaddressing local circumstances when we eval uate the risks associated with site or determining the method or level of cleanup for too long community groupshave felt shut out of the process of site remediation decision making discussionsof future land use options and the risk evaluation process communityinvolvement should be an integral part of the remedy selection process that willin the long run make the risk assessment and management process more openand more democratic 59httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97914crs27 59continued 1st session p 911912 60chemical manufacturers association

the chemical manufacturers association supports increased levels of community involvement in cleaning up npl sites proposes the expansion of thetag program and recommends coordination with formal community groups toensure that citizens have an organized m echanism through which th ey can participate in the cleanup process communities need to have adequate input into the remedy selection and implementation process at superfund sites by providing local citizens withopportunities for early and active particip ation in the evaluation of remedial options the entire procedure becomes mo re transparent resulting in greater credibility in and commitment to the sel ected remedy informed communities are more likely to support reasoned agency decisions cma supportsestablishing formal community groups to improve communication between epaprps and the communities that live around superfund sites furthermore theexisting technical assistance grants tags program could be increased tohelp community groups obtain full access to information and an early and ongoing voice throughout the remedy selection process formal community groupsshould be supported where they exist by making them the only eligible group for tag 60 s 8 would require epa to inform and c onsult with the affected community and to consider their views in developing and implementing the remedial action plan italso directs epa to assist in establishing community advisory groups cags thatwould serve as information conduits to nd from epa the states and prps in addition the bill continues the tag progr am grants of 50000 but allows waiver of that limit the bill eliminates the current law fundmatching requirement and authorizes early disbursement to the tag recipient in advance of the recipients making expenditures to be covered by the grant up to 5000 may be advanced ata time conclusion this report has outlined issues in th debate on reforming superfunds cleanup standards these issues reflect criticisms and proposals which have been presented at congressional hearings during the 104th and 105th congress and which are central to the superfund reauthorization debate the views summarized in this report arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97914crs28 those most frequently delivered on the subject of cleanup standards and remedy selection proponents and opponents of proposed reforms such as repealing the statutes requirement to meet relevant and appropriate requirements or ensuring that riskassessment plays larger role in the reme dy selection process confront formidable questions what should be the goal of the superfund program should sites be cleaned to eliminate all remnants of wast and pollutants or should sites be cleaned to level that is simply sufficient to pr otect human health the distinction between the two is significant the former takes more expansive approach toenvironmental protection while the latter takes an approach that may betteraccommodate economic considerations if the goal should be the protection ofhuman health how protective and comp lete should the cleanup be and who decides if the goal is to achieve certa in level of environmental cleanliness should national standards be established to define the level of cleanliness required though there is little consensus on the answers superfunds stakeholders seek to alleviatethe confusion over the program to lessen this confusion congress is attempting tofurther define superfunds cleanup goals and the methods used to attain these goals
