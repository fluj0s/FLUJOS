1698 classified by political ministercounselor kathleen allegrone 14 b d 1 c summary president sarkozys march 2627 visits to the democratic republic of congo drc republic of congo roc and niger were intended to promote democratic principles shared business interests and more generally sarkozys policy of moving away from the franceafrique model of managing relations to more modern one based on partnership according to presidential deputy diplomatic advisor bruno joubert on april 3 joubert said that sarkozy had accomplished what he had set out to do and that the africans with whom he met better understood french policy toward the region and where sarkozy wants to take relations even if they were not completely comfortable with the new paradigm on the drc and rwanda joubert explained that france wanted to promote cooperation between the two and suggested starting with number of small economic and development projects that would show quick results and encourage further cooperation joubert said that he planned to travel to the us during the april 1415 period and hoped to meet with officials at the department af asdesignate carson nsc af senior director gavin and usun permrep rice end summary xxxxxxxxxxxx franceafrique 4 c rather than provide narrative of sarkozys visit joubert placed it within the context of frances evolving africa policy and its movement under sarkozy away from the classic colonial and postcolonial franceafrique model and towards more modern relationship based on shared interests and partnership among equals ref eg he said that the visit most notably as expressed in sarkozys speech before the drc parliament was an extension of remarks that sarkozy had made in cape town in february 2008 on the need for rational relationships free of the baggage of the past joubert said that the new policy faced several challenges one of which he described as predilection on the part of the french public and press to view relations with africa as inherently corrupt sordid and scandalridden the public and press often looked at africa only from this angle one of sarkozys aims was to carry out visit crisply efficiently and transparently he wanted to show that france could deal with its african partners as straightforwardly as it dealt with its other partners and joubert deemed this aspect of the visit success even if its briskness and openness left the press critics and some africans bit perplexed 5 c always seeking to put negative light on relations some observers while claiming to condemn franceafrique at the same time accused sarkozy of trying to rupture french relations with africa joubert said that neither sarkozy nor anyone else speaking officially for france had ever used the term rupture the move away from franceafrique was instead turning of page and shift in direction towards more modern and balanced relationship 6 c thus partnership was an underlying theme of the paris 00000504 002 of 002 visit in niger for example where french extractiveindustry giant areva and its activities were central element of the visit sarkozy stressed not only the mutual benefits derived from arevas uranium operations but also the other positive aspects of arevas presence in terms of improved roads and infrastructure for the common good the same was true for arevas activities in the drc 7 c another theme was democracy and good governance with joubert noting that france was unfairly accused of only supporting old regimes sarkozys speeches in the drc and roc stressed the need for both countries to adhere to democratic principles and that these principles were not something applicable only in the west joubert said that sarkozys stop in brazzaville had to be managed delicately as also noted ref c sarkozy did not want to appear to be campaigning for president sassou nguesso regarding elections later in 2009 and joubert pointed out that sarkozy met with opposition figures to underscore that point 8 c asked how the press and africans viewed the visit joubert said that the press response was muted in part because the visit did not take place according to press preconceptions joubert indicated that this was positive development insofar as the press was forced to think about the visit joubert said that african leaders seemed to understand what sarkozys approach represented in terms of transparent straightforward dealings although they may not have been completely comfortable with it speaking quite candidly joubert said that you have to understand many of these leaders such as sassou nguesso have grown up with franceafrique when they used to meet with chirac it was all backslapping jokes long leisurely meals and plenty of anecdotes about the old days when they and chirac were younger and coming up together sarkozy isnt like that at all it takes some getting used to for some of them there were few comments about why sarkozy didnt at least spend the night at each of his stops they are beginning to see that sarkozy is not here to carry on the old backslapping ways drcrwanda 9 xxxxxxxxxxxx pekala
