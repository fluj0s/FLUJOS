in april 2006 samhsa published matrix3 that listed the mental health and substance abuse issues addressed by the agency along with the cr osscutting principles samhsa applies to each issue area see appendix c samhsa has identified number of priority areas typically these are policy issues that cut across the work of its three centers the priority issue areas include individual health concerns like cooccuring mental health and substance abuse disorders suicide behavioral health issues for individuals with hepatitis and hivaids societal issues like homelessness and criminal justice and systemslevel issues like treatment capacity and workforce development in addition samhsa has identified principles to guide pr ogram policy and resource allocation within the agency these principles include use of evidencebased practices evaluation collaboration cultural competence stigma reduction and costeffectiveness the matrix illustrates for example that samhsa aims to address the issue of coocc urring disorders using each of the crosscutting principles including evidencebased practices surveillance and collaboration samhsa does not formally require its grantees to apply each of these crosscutting principles to their work instead samhsa requires grantees to submit data using the indicators identified through the national outcome measures as described later in this report there is crosswalk between the national outcome measures and the crosscutting principles in this matrix

block grant formula which has not changed since 1992 is presented later in this report the 2000 reauthorization focused on improving mental health and substance abuse services for children and adolescents implementing proposals to give states more flexibility in the use of block grant funds and replacing some existing categorical grant programs with general authority to give the secretary of hhs more flexibility to respond to those who require mental health and substance abuse services provisions in the 2000 reauthorization that related to children and adolescents authorized programs to address emergency response treatment services and other comprehensive communitybased services for youth at risk due to violence substance abuse or mental illness other provisions addressed the issue of homeless individuals with substance abuse andor mental illness additionally samhsa was required to issue regulations on use of restraint and seclusion within residential nonmedical facilities

reauthorization samhsa was required to produce two reports to congress the first report was on the efforts of the agency and the states to provide coordinated services to individuals who have cooccuring substance abuse and mental health problems in this report which was produced in 2002 samhsa summarized the prevention and treatment practices for people with cooccurring disorders and provided plan for improving services for these people 7 the second report discusses the flexibility and performance of its block grants and accountability measures this report which samhsa delivered in 2005 detailed the flexibility given to states defined the common performance measures to be used for state accountability outlined an implementation strategy and discussed possible obstacles to

and surveillance in the fields of violen ce suicide and mental health the indian health service ihs serves population that has significant substance abuse problems along with issues of access to

block grant consolidated several existing categorical gr ants for substance abuse and community mental health services in order to provide state and local governments with more flexibility and control over funding to enhance their ability to meet localized needs to end duplication of effort in delivering services and to enable better coor dination obra authorized adms block grant funds for fy1982 through fy1984 in proportion to the historical funding patterns of the original categorical grants due to the resulting inequities among states in per capita funding for substance abuse and mental health services obra direct ed hhs to conduct study that would produce formula considering population and state fiscal capacity to more equitably distribute funds among states the 1984 adamha amendments renewed the block grants for three years with minor equity adjustment that would hold harmless states that would have otherwise received decreased funding under the new calculation17 funds above the fy1984 holdharmless level18 were to be allocated using formula based equally on state population and relative per capita income the amendments also required non governmental entity to provide recommendations on the formula proposed by hhs the resulting recommendations from the institute for health and aging iha 19 included phasing out the holdharmless provisions allocating funds based on populations at risk and incorporating state fiscal capacity measure the 1988 antidrug abuse act20 revised the formula based on the iha recommendations to phase out the holdharmless provision use total taxable resources as the measure of state fiscal 16 pl 9735 17 pl 98509 18 this holdharmless provision assured that each states block grant f unding would not be less than the amount it

act takes into account three measures 1 the population in need of services 2 costs of services in the state and 3 fiscal capacity of the state the first factor is intended to be proxy for the extent of need for services in state adjustments were made to the weights assigned to each age cohort in this factor to address the inequities caused by the original weights used the second factor which is the cost of services is derived from the 1990 report of health and economics research inc and ranges from 09 to 11 23 the third factor which is the fiscal capacity of the state is intended to adjust for differences in state capacity to pay for these services this factor uses the threeyear mean of the total taxable revenue of the state the three factors mentioned above are multiplied to produce score for the state to calculate the grant amount for given state that states score is mutiplied by the total available grant amount and divided by the sum of all the states and district of columbias
