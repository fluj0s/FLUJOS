wikileaks document release httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21035 february 2 2009 congressional research service report rs21035 emergency spending statutory and congressional rules james v saturno government and finance division july 24 2007 abstract the designation of spending as emergency has had signiÔ¨Åcance in both procedural and budgetary terms the budget enforcement act bea 19902002 placed statutory limits caps on the level of federal discretionary spending enforced by acrosstheboard spending cuts known as sequester if however spending were designated as emergency by both the president and congress it would not trigger sequester because the caps would be adjusted automatically by an amount equal to the emergency spending although the spending caps established under the bea have expired additional limitations adopted by the house and senate in their respective rules concerning the use of emergency designations continue to be in force in particular the budget resolution for fy2008 sconres 21 110th congress provides point of order in the senate against the use of emergency designationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21035g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

currently exempts that spending from certain procedural budget constraints in particular emergencydesignated spending is not counted against the spending allocations associated with the budget resolution in the house and senate and the payasyougo paygo requirement in the senate the treatment of emergency designated spending has its roots in the statutory budget constraints especially the statutory limits on discretionary spending established by the b udget enforcement act bea of 1990 while the statutory budget constraints established by the be expired at the end of fy2002 the house and senate continue to provide for special treatment and limitations on spending designated as emergency this report will be updated to reflect any changes in the rules concerning the use of emergency

appropriations for unanticipated or emergency purposes has been longstanding concern within the federal budget process for example the congress ional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 included requirement that the budget resolution include an allowance for contingencies1 similarly the presidents budget was required to include an allowance for additional estimated expenditures and proposed appropriations for the ensuing fiscal year and an allowance for unanticipated uncontrollable expenditures for the ensuing fiscal year 2 explicit limitations however were placed on either branch with regard to their prerogative to request or enact spending for any purpose including supplemental appropriations as part of presidentialcongressional budget summit agreements in 1987 and 1989 appropriations caps were enacted and the two branches agreed not to initiate supplemental spending above these amounts except in the case of dire emergency in neither agreement was there definition for dire emergency or requirement that any supplemental spending be offset 3 g22g145g142g561g4g158g141g144g142g157g561g7g151g143g152g155g140g142g150g142g151g157g561g3g140g157g561 with the budget enforcement act of 19904 the process for enacting emergency spending became more formalized the act generally shifted the focus of budgetary control mechanisms from the projected deficit to the spending or revenue effect of current legislation by providing for the direct enforcement of statutory discretionary spending limits and limitation on changes to entitlement spending and revenues known as payasyougo or paygo5 in addition to specifying the spending limit the act also provid ed for several required adjustments including emergency appropriations the act provided that if for any fiscal year appropriations for discretionary accounts are enacted that the president designates as emergency requirements and that the congress so designates in statute the adjustment shall be the total of such appropriations in discretionary accounts designated as emergency requirements and outlays flowing in all fiscal years from such appropriations 6 there is currently statutory spending caps for discretionary spending similar provision of the act specified that enforcement of paygo excluded emergency provisions as well7 however 1 pl 93344 sec 301a2 88 stat 306 2 pl 93344 sec 604 88

for discretionary spending accounts8 the bea provided that either the president or congress could initiate the emergency spending designation the president could initiate emergency spending by designating the spending as emergency in his request which would then have to be similarly designated by congress in statutory language congress could also initiate emergency spending by making the designation in statutory language when doing so it usually made the availability of such funds for obligation contingent on the president designating them as well in addition section 314a of the congressional bu dget act of 1974 provides for an adjustment of aggregates set forth in the budget resolution as well as allocations made pursuant to those aggregates to reflect the amount of spending carrying emergency designations under the bea by making this adjustment apply while bill or amendment was under consideration it effectively exempted the provision from certain points of order under the congressional budget act 9 the act did not define or place limits on the use of the emergency designation other than the requirement that it be so designated by both the president and congress this provided maximum degree of flexibility but also led to criticism from some members of congress that the emergency designation could be applied to nonemergency spending and thus be used as means for circumventing budgetary discipline this resulted in additional rules concerning the consideration of emergency spending legislation in both the house and the senate although the statutory provisions concerning the use of emergency designations has expired these additional rules continue to have an impact on house and senate procedure g10g152g158g156g142g561g20g158g149g142g156g561 in january 1995 the house added new provision to its rules house rule xxi clause 2e to prevent nonemergency spending from being added to an appropriations bill designated as providing emergency spending 10 the rule provides that provision other than an appropriation designated as an emergency under section 251b2 or section 252e of the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act rescission of budget authority or reduction in direct spending an amount for designated emergency may not be reported in an appropriation bill or joint resolution containing an emergency designation under section 252b2 or section 252e of such act and may not be in order as an amendment thereto although this provision has continued to be include d in house rules the expiration of statutory spending limits on spending in 2002 has meant that the designation of spending as emergency longer provides for an automatic adjustment of aggregates set forth in the budget resolution nor 8 the emergency designation was used four times for legislation subject to paygo sec 6 of pl 1036 sec 3309c of pl 105206 sec 101b of pl 10742 and sec 502 of pl 107147 9 in particular points of order under secs 311 and 302

was adopted in section 502b of the fy2004 budg et resolution hconres 95 108th congress specifying that any bill joint resolu tion amendment or conference report designated as an emergency requirement shall not count for purposes of sections 302 303 311 and 401 of the congressional budget act of 1974 similar provision was adopted in section 4 02a of the fy2006 budget resolution hconres 95 109th congress in addition this subsection prov ided that supplemental appropriations for fy2005 or fy2006 for contingency operations related to the global war on terrorism designated as emergency would not count for purposes of sections 302 303 311 and 401 of the congressional budget act although the house and senate did not come to agreement on the budget resolution for fy2007 the house did adopt resolution hres 818 109th congress deeming the provisions of the housepassed version of the budget resolution hconres 376 109th congress to apply in the house including section 402 exempting from procedural limits imposed under titles iii and iv of the congressional budget act appropriations for contingency operations directly related to the global war on terrorism and other unanticipated defenserelated operations in addition section 501 provided for reserve fund of 645 billion to allow for adjustment of the allocations and aggregates in the budget resolution for amounts designated as emergency spending the resolution further required in section 504 that committees include an explanation of how provision designated as an emergency requirement met the criteria for that designation enumerated in section 502 currently section 301b of sconres 70 110 th congress the budget resolution for fy2009 provides for an adjustment of certain sp ending amounts for fy2008 and fy2009 for overseas deployments and related activities11 in addition it provides that any additional amounts provided for such purposes as well as any spending designated as necessary to meet emergency needs shall not be counted against the spending constraints associated with the budget resolution under the budget act g21g142g151g138g157g142g561g20g158g149g142g156g561 the senate has taken different approach to limiting the use of emergency designations in 1999 the senate first adopted point of order to prohibit consideration of legislation containing an emergency designation 12 this mechanism was designed so that point of order could be raised against any emergency designation in measure which could then be stricken from the measure without further action the point of order could be waived however by vote of threefifths of the senate the result of this was effectively to require that any emergency designation be supported by threefifths of the senate in order to insure that it would remain as part of the measure if waiver was not granted the emergency designation would be stricken although the spending could remain in the measure subject to any other applicable budgetary limits this provision also included language providing guidelines for justifying an emergency designation 11 sec 10421 of sconres 70 110th cong provides 1081 billion in budget authority for fy2008 and 700

in modified form in 200013 including provision establishing that it does not apply against an emergency designation for provision making discretionary appropriations for defense spending14 in the 108th congress the senate included an updated version of this point of order15 under this section when the senate is considering bill resolution amendment motion or conference report if point of order is made by senator against an emergency designation in that measure that provision making such designation shall be stricken from the measure and may not be offered as an amendment from the floor as in the house section 502c of th fy2004 budget resolution hconres 95 108th congress provided that in the senate any spending with an emergency designation shall not count for purposes of enforcing sections 302 303 311 and 401 of the congressional budget act nor for other applicable enforcement provisions in the budget resolution as with previous versions of this point of order it did not apply to discretionary spending for defense accounts and it could be waived by vote of threefifths of the senate this point of order was reiterated in the fy2005 department of defense appropriations act 16 and section 402b of the fy2006 budget resolution hconres 95 109th congress because the house and senate did not come to an agreement on budget resolution for fy2007 the senate included provision in section 7035 of the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense the global war on terror and hurricane recovery 2006 pl 109234 providing for limit on discretionary spending but allowing adjustments to those limits pursuant to section 402 of sconres 83 109 th congress as passed by the senate in addition to reiterating the senates point of order against designating spending as emergency spending subject to the waiver provision in the resolution this section provided for limit on total exemptions for emergency spending currently section 204a of sconres 21 110 th congress the budget resolution for fy2008 provides that spending designated as an emergency requirement shall not count for purposes of sections 302 and 311 of the congressional budget act and section 201of the budget resolution relating to paygo this most recent emergency exemption provision retains the point of order against any emergency designation subject to the waiver provision in addition as in the house the budget resolution for fy2009 sconres 70 110 th congress provides for an adjustment of certain spending amounts for fy2008 and fy2009 for overseas deployments and related activities 13 sec
