and martin weiss specialists in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34644lowincome country debt cancellation hr 2534 and s 2166 summary in recent decades the rapid growth in poor country debt has emerged as foreign policy concern there have been many efforts to help reduce poor country debt in 1988 group of major creditor na tions known as the paris club agreed for the first time to cancel debts owed to them instead of refinancing them on easier terms as they had done previously in 1996 the international monetary fund imf the world bank and the regional developm ent banks agreed to allow portion of debts owed to them by select group of countries to be cancelled this effort is known as the debt relief initiative for heav ily indebted poor countries hipc at the gleneagles summit of the group of eight g8 nations in july 2005 the hipc effort was expanded to provide 100 can cellation of all mu ltilateral debt for countries that have completed the hipc pr ogram this expanded effort is known as the multilateral debt relief initiative mdri some analysts believe that existing multilateral debt relief initiatives are insufficient they want debt relief for more countries than are currently eligible to this end members of the 110th congress introduced the jubilee act for responsible lending and expanded debt cancellation of 2008 hr 2634s 2166 the bill has been approved by the house of representa tives and reported favor ably by the senate foreign relations committee the act seeks to expand hipcmdri debt relief to an additional 24 countries which are eligible to receive 100 of their world bank assistance from the international development association i da the world banks lowincome lending facility socalled b lend countries those eligible to receive world bank assistance from the concessional and marketrate windows of the worl d bank woul d not be eligible for jubilee debt relief the act directs the secretary of the treasury to undertake negotiations with other bilateral creditors and with the multilateral agencies in order to provide comple debt relief for the 24 countries proponents of the legislation argue that on equity and policy grounds strong case can be made that the socalled jub ilee countries should have access to the same level of debt relief as pr ovided to the equallypoor hi pc countries critics counter that the proposed legislation ra ises several policy concerns first even if the united states approves the proposal multilateral debt relief woul d require the assent and collaboration of other donor na tions many of whom have expressed little interest in new round of multilateral debt relief th proponents of the legislation want the international financial institutions ifis to absorb the cost of additional debt relief from existing resources it is not clear if other major countries would agree to such plan also the ifis capacity to maintain the present size of their programs might be constrained if debt re lief were funded out of exis ting resources lastly many analysts question the ability of debt relie f absent broader social economic and governance changes in the poor countri to achieve poverty reduction and growth the proponents argue nonetheless that it is unfair and wrong that one group of very poor countries should have their debts forgiven totally while another very similar group must repay in full this report will be updated as events warranthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34644contents background the hipc and mdri programs 1 c

senate action it assesses the likely cost of possible jubilee debt reduction program fina lly the report examines some possible implementation and policy issues background the hipc and mdri programs since 1996 the world bank and imf have c oordinated an effo rt by multilateral and bilateral official creditors to reduce the foreign debt of the nations categorized as heavily indebted poor countries hipcs in 2005 the g8 countries agreed during their summit meeting in scotland on multilateral debt reduction initiative mdri which aims to augment the hipc program1 for much of their history the ifis have served as lenders of last resort to countries suffering from financial crisis thus the ifis argued that since they provided assistance to countries unable to borrow from anyone else they should receive preferred creditor status this means that the world bank and the imf would be paid first in the event that borrowers ran into financial difficulties and that debts owed to them would not be reduced under any circumstances if they forgive debt owed to them by their borrower countries the ifis argued they would have less money available in the future to help othe r countries needing ifi aid it would also set bad example they said as it would give debtors the impression that they could borrow money from the ifis without co mmitment to pay it back the latter is called the moral hazard argument against bt relief from this perspective debt relief should be last recour and should include require ment that debtor countrieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34644crs2 2 rutsel silvestre j martha

times june 10 2005adopt reforms and new policie s to reduce the likelihood that they will need more debt relief in the future2 despite initial reservations and at the g8s request the world bank and the imf created the heavily indebted poor c ountries hipc debt relief program in 1996 to reduce some multilateral debt in conjunction with bilateral debt forgiveness according to the imf and the world bank the goal of the hipc program was to help the poorest and most indebted countries meet thei r current and future external debt service obligations in full without recour to debt reschedu ling or the accumulation of arrears and without compromising growth3 in 1999 the program was expanded to provi deeper faster and broader debt relief initially the hipc program determined that debt servicetoexports ratio of 250 was sustainable moreover it took minimum of six years for borrowers to qualify for debt relief critic s charged that this ratio was too high and the timeframe to qualify for debt relief was too long when the program was redesigned in 1999 the debt servicetoexports ratio was reduced to 150 and the time period was shortened it was also anticipated that the debt service ratio the share of export revenue needed to service foreign debt for hipc beneficiaries would be in the range of 15 to 20 the hipc program was also modified to include greater focus on poverty reduction efforts countries receiving debt relief were now explicitly required to use money freed up by debt relief for poverty reduction hipc debt relief is provided in stages based on each countrys performance against defined set of economic targets and requirements hi pceligible countries must successfully implement imfprescribed reforms for three years before reaching the decision point which makes them eligible to receive intermediate debt relief following further track record of good economic policy country reaches completion point where the remaining debt relief is granted in june 2005 g8 finance ministers proposed the multilate ral debt relief initiative mdri to provide financing for the world bank to be able to completely forgive all of the hipc countries bilatera l and multilateral debts once they completed the hipc program the eventual mdri agreement was compromise agreement between the united states and european countries4 us officials had reportedly argued that the cost of multilateral debt relief could be borne by the institutions and did not require donors to contribute any new assistance other creditors believed the institutions should be compensated for

congressional action the jubilee act proposal the jubilee debt cancellation act would require the secretary of the treasury to seek new arrangements with the paris club of official creditors an informal group of the wealthiest countries that would can cel 100 of the bila teral and multilateral debt owed by two dozen poor countries that were not eligible to receive debt relief from the hipc program and are not covered by the mdri6 the act would also require the united states to seek changes in the framework for international lending to poor countries and limitations on the cond itions countries would have to meet in order to receive debt cancellation the original jubilee act was introduced in june 2007 by representative maxine waters and several others the house financial services

prev iously had not received debt relief from the hipc or mdri programs multilateral debt cancellation was to be financed to the extent possible the bill said from the ongoing operations procedures

these expenditures 3 develop and implement effective policy reforms to ensure that savings from debt cancellation are redirected to poverty reduction efforts and that any future borrowing be conducted in res ponsible fashion and 4 produce publicly available annual report disclosing how the savings fro m debt cancellation were used the jubilee debt cancellation plan woul d encourage debt relief recipients to allocate at least 20 of their national budget to such social services as basic health care education and clean water for all people in the country it also seeks agreement among the ifis and donors to assure that th external financing needs of lowincome countries will be met primar ily through grants rather than new lending and that countries receiving debt cancellation will not have their future levels of aid cut proportionally as is the curre nt arrangement under mdri as originally proposed in the house nd senate versions of the jubilee act countries would be eligible fo r debt

publicly available and easily accessible to all the house of representatives added two additional eligibility requirements during its consideration of hr 2634 on april 16 the first floor amendment proposed by representative dana rohrabacher said that countries could receive debt relief only if their governments were chosen by and they permit free and fair elections the second floor amendmen t introduced by representative mario diazbalart said that countries would not be eligible for debt cancellation if they have business inte rests with iran the senate foreign relations committee did not add the house amendments regarding eligibility to the senate version s 2166 of the jubilee debt cancellation bill however the committee did add to th criteria that countries had to meet in order to be eligible for bt cancellation stipulation that their governments must have demonstrated democra tic governance and transparency in decision making the senate committee also struck from the bill the language which sought to ensure that aid levels from the ifis nd bilateral donors would not be reduced when countries received debt cancellation the house left this provision of the bill unchanged at the urging of the unite d states the g8 countries had agreed previously that foreign aid levels to p oor countries w ould be reduced correspondingly when their debt service payments we re reduced through debt cancellation7 framework for responsible lending hr 2634 and s 2166 require the secretary of the treasury to seek agreement among the ifis and the paris club countries on new framework for transpar ent and responsible international lending to lowincome countries the new framework should assure that official lenders are more transparent in their credit operations and that affected communities and civil society have opportunities to pa rticipate in loan decisions it should also seek to insure that all creditors public and private contribute to preserving the gains of debt relief for poor debtor countries the house and senate bills originally directed the secretary to seek agreements that would prevent certain kinds of priv ate investors vulture funds from buyinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34644crs6 poor countries international debt obligations deeply discounted market value and then seeking to recover the original valu through legal or other processes the house financial services committee dropped the language about vulture funds from hr 2634 on grounds that these would be the subject of future legislation the senate foreign rela tions substituted for the original language in s 2166 stipulation that the united states should wo rk with other governments to discourage rather than to prevent vulture fund activ ity in poor debtor countries the senate committee added additional language to the bill directing the secretary to work with other countries to secure commitments from nonparis club creditors that they would not sell debt owed to them by poor countri to other creditors who did not intend to provide debt relief the house and senate bills origina lly directed the general accountability office gao to perform audits of the debt portfolios of countri with questionable loans in which there were allegations that odious onerous or illegal debt was subscribed in order to facilitate corruption or activities that were not in the interest of the people of those countries the nate foreign relations committee changed from shall to should the directive that gao audit loans made by the ifis and the us government it also replaced most re ferences to odious debt with references to sustainable debt shifting the focus to c oncern whether the debts were sustainable at the time they were incurred the senate committee left unchanged the directive that these audits should investigate the pr ocess by which the loans were contracted how the funds were used whether any intern ational or us laws were violated and whether the debts were odious or onerous harmful conditionality original language in hr 2634 and s 2166 directed the secretary of the treasury to seek agreement among the ifis and the paris club creditor countries that debt cancellation in the future would not be premised on countries adopting what the legislati on called harmful economic or policy conditionality the legislati on mentioned in particular requirements that countries impose user fees for primary health or edu cation programs that they raise the price that lowincome households must pay for basic public services such as education health care drinking water or sanitation that they limit workers ability to exercise effectively internationally recognized work er rights as recognized under us law that they adopt polices which degrade the environment or that they limit their budgetary expenditures particularly in the c ontext of an agreement with the imf for essential healthcare or educa tion expenses or adopt hiring or wage bill ceilings the bills required the secretary to file re port annually during th next four years detailing the steps taken to accomplish the purpos of that section of the legislation the house financial services committee replaced the concept of harmful conditionality with directive that the secretary seek agreement among the ifis and paris club creditors that there should be conditions on countries access to debt cancellation other than the procedural and governance factors noted above the senate foreign relations committee deleted any references in s 2166 to specific practices or policies instead it directed the secretary to seek agreement that there should be conditionality for debt cancella tion that would significantly increase the cost of public services for lowinco households or that deepen poverty or degrade the environmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34644crs7 the senate committee also struck out the requirement that treasury report annually on the implementation of the legislation instea d it required that treasury file report by the end of december 2009 showing the extent to which previous rounds of debt cancellation were accompan ied by conditionality requiring countries to adopt user fees on primary education or health care incr eases in the cost of basic public services to lowincome people or the adoption of caps or limitations on government spending for education and health care or hiring or wage bill ceilings experts disagree about the extent to whic h multilateral and bilate ral debt cancellation in the past has been predicated on count ries adopting economic or policy conditions of that sort other matters the house financial services committee added new section 5 to hr 2634 expressing sense of congress that the united states should pay off its 596 million in arrears overdue payments to ida and the regional development banks it also said the ited states should become current on all its commitments to fund debt reduc tion through the hipc and mdri programs the senate foreign relations committee added new section 3 to s 2166 stating similar sense of congress recommitting the unite d states to fund its existing arrears to the multilateral banks it also expressed sense of congress that the provision of debt cancellation to lowincome country should not be followed by reduction in the level of us development aid it sa id the united states should encourage other creditors not to make such reductions in their levels of aid to those countries during its consideration of hr 2634 on april 16 2008 the house approved an amendment by representative alcee hastings of florida new section 6 expressing the sense of congress that the secretary of the treas ury should seek the immediate and complete cancellation of all haitis debts to the ifis or an immediate suspension of debt repayment obligations the senate foreign relations committee added corresponding section 6 to s 2166 urging similar can cellation of haitis debts or debt service payments to the ifis the senate committee also added new sec tion 7 to s 2166 this directed the secretary of the treasury to submit re port to congress by the end of june 2009 discussing the feasibility of adding new loan facility to the imf the new facility would be intended to provide temporary financing to help lowincome countries cover their debt service obligations in situations where their economies have been struck by economic shocks beyond their control the bill mentioned for example natural disasters and sharp spikes in commodity process it said that facility of this sort would minimize the need for additional debt relief in the future potential beneficiaries there are 24 countries that only receive ida assistan ce but for various reasons are not included in the hipc or mdri debt reduction plans most often they were not included because their debt burden was considered to be sustainable at the time the list of hipcs was compiled and they therefore were not deemed to need

the 15 to 20 levels that were an objective of the 1999 enhanced hipc debt cancellation program10 as noted before it was on account of their comparatively lower debt rvice ratios that thes countries were not originally included in the hipc program the per capita income and poverty vels of the countries shown in table 1 are comparable however to most of the countri that were beneficiaries of the hipc program in fact several of these countr ies have per capita income levels that are lower than countries in the hipc group in 2005 the focus of attention shifted w ith the advent of the mdri from debt sustainability to 100 debt cancellation for the countries of the hipc group on that basis many questioned wh one group of very poor countries should have their foreign debts eliminated while the c ountries of similar group received debt cancellation at all the jubilee debt cancellation bill is reflection of that concern estimated cost of the jubilee act the additional countries that would be ligible for jubilee debt relief owe the united states little over 22 billion the jubilee usa network see note 7 above estimates that to cancel the bilateral us debt covered in the proposal would cost approximately 957 million depending on which countries opt in to the agreement and the discount rate applied in determining the net presen t value of the debt that is forgiven this is in line with official us estimates according to the us department of the treasury the cost of forgiving additional us bilateral debts covered under the jubilee bill would be approximately 700 million to 1 billion11 the federal credit reform ac t of 1990 says that congre ss must appropriate sum equal to the net present value of the debt before the us government can write off any obligations owed to it by countries institutions or individuals table 2 shows the amounts that the potential beneficiaries of the jubilee act owe to the imf and world bank table 3 shows the amounts that they owe to the us government and the likely budgetary cost of cancelling those debts to cover the multilateral costs of jubil ee debt relief the proposed jubilee act states that to the extent possible financing the debt cancellation should come from the ongoing operations procedures and accounts of the institution without undermining the financial integr ity of the institutions hr 2634 section 3 it is unclear

ibrd net income by 300 million annually furthermore they argue that the international finance corporation ifc could similarly transfer 59 billion from reserves and net income through 2020 fo r this purpose also they say the international monetary fund could sell some of its st ockpile of gold to fund additional cancellation of debt owed to ida by potentially eligible poor countries as discussed

jubilee debt relief bill has cutoff or effective date beyond which loans will not be included in the loan cancellation plan thus loans that have not yet been approve d may be eligible for debt cancellation by the time the debt cancellati on program proposed by jub ilee act becomes effective theory of debt cancellation debt overhang theory from an economic perspective debt relief is grounded in the debt overhang theory which holds that the accumulation of large stock of unpayable debt will inhibit development by disuading potential nders and investors the theory had its origins in the debt experience of latin am erica in the 1980s it was formulated in light of the positive economic growth th at several heavily indebted countries experienced following 1989 debt relief in itiative known as the brady plan named after thenus treasury secretary nicholas brady15 under the brady plan substantial amounts of debt owed to privat creditors was cancelled with the backing and assistance of the multilateral agencies and growth in the region revived the theory suggests that if investors ex pect countrys debt level to impair its ability to repay its loans they will not invest out of concern that the government may resort to distortionary measures such as expanding the money supply which promotes inflation or raising taxes on their profits to finance debt payments16 even if the debt is not being serviced the theory suggests that it is still an impediment to economic growth because of the overhang of debt discourages new private investmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34644crs14

paper 10230 january 2004 when large stock of external debt is present creditors could continue lending rates in hopes that this will spur economic growth and that the recipient country will one day be able to repay its debts creditors are generally unwilling to make new loans however when they are not being repaid for their prior loans according to debt overhang theory it is better to forgive the debts either entirely or to some reduced sustainable level so that investor confidence will be restored with this renewal of confidence the in flow of private investment will resume economic growth will resume and the country will be able to borrow add itional money and service debt at higher level of national income debt overhang evidence 2002 study of 93 developing countri between 1969 and 1998 and follow up study of 61 countries over the same time period were cited as strong support for the debtoverhang theory the first study found that external debt began to have negative impact on growth when its net present value17 exceeded 160 to 170 of exports and 35 to 40 of gdp study s imulations suggest that doubling the average stock of external debt in these countri would slow down annual per capita growth by ½ to 1 the second study found that doubling countrys average external debt level would reduce growth of bot h per capita physical capital and productivity by almost 1 the studies concluded that large debt stocks negatively affect growth by slowing both the accumulation of physi cal capital and productiv ity often at the expense of investment18 the question however is whether this theory which grew out of the experience of middleincome developing countries is relevant also for poor countries several studies suggest that it is not they point to two key differences between the brady and hipc countries19 in contrast to the brady countries there never was significant amount of private i nvestment in the hipc countries and the hipc countries have never suffered negativ net flow of resources because inflows of foreign aid are typically more than sufficient to cover debt payments20 moreover debt relief that the hipc countries have r eceived has not been sufficient to allow them access to private sector credit marketshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34644crs15 21 for ida loans for example the payments are zero percent of the outstanding balance during the first 10 years 2 nnually during the next ten years and 4 annually during the final twenty years of the repayment period this means that 80 of the benefit from debt can cellation will not accrue to the recipient until at least 20 years from the date the or iginal loan was approved experience suggests that official creditors behave differently than private creditors when they are faced with debtors that do not pay rather than retrenching or withdrawing as private lenders might have done the hipc c ountries bilateral aid donors continued to provide those countries with substantial amounts of aid during the 1990s even though the unpaid debt to them from the hipcs continued to grow bilateral creditors do not seem to be di ssuaded from providing needy countries with new assistance as theory would predict by the overhang of unpaid debt that those countries already owed in the case of the hipc and mdri programs the goal of debt cancellation is not one of encouraging fo reign donors to provide more because the debt overhang is reduced but rather one of reducing the amount that the poor countries need to pay to rvice their debts the res ources to fund new development activities comes from diversion of the debt service funds to other uses rather than from new flows of official or private funds from abroad implementation concerns debt cancellation can be effected relativel quickly but the benefits of the debt cancellation accrue to the reci pient countries much more slowly debt cancellation does not transfer new resour ces rather it eliminates th requirement that countries make debt service payments to retire thei r debt the benefit of debt cancellation accrues to the former debtor not at th time the debt cancellation is announced but rather at the time the country would otherwis have had to make payments to service its debt the amount the recipient saves w ill depend less on the size of its debt than on the terms and conditions of the loans themselves concessionalrate loans accounted for much of the debt scheduled for cancellation through the hipc and mdri programs as is most of the debt that would be cancelled through the jubilee act the annual payments for concessiona l rate loans are relatively small compared to the face value of the debt21 consequently the amount th beneficiaries will be able to spend for the poverty alle viation and social developm ent activities mandated by the jubilee act will be modest and distant in time from their present needs it is possible that many of the potential beneficiaries might not be able to qualify for debt relief under the jubilee debt cance llation plan the senate bill s 2166 says for example that in order to be eligib countries must ve transparent and effective fiscal and budgetar mechanisms in place to sure that the savings from debt relief will go towards poverty reduction they must also demonstrate democratic governance and transparent decisionmaki ng the house bill hr 2634 requires that countries make their policy decisions through transparen t and participatory procedures they meet good governan ce standards they have effective anticorruption measures in place and they have democratically elected governmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34644crs16 22 frequently asked questions on the jubilee act how much will it cost jubilee usa network april 16 2008 available at h ttp wwwjubileeusaorgj ubileeacthtmlthey must also promote the particip ation of citizens and nongovernmental organizations in the economic policy choices of government the proponents of the jubilee act say that nine countries georgia cape verde samoa vietnam kenya mongolia sotho moldova and vanuatu are likely to meet right away the requirement that they have transparent and effective fiscal and budget mechanisms22 it seems likely though that some of these countries and many others on the 24country list may not meet the other standards included in the legislation many would likely need time nd foreign aid before they can meet the governance and procedural standards em bodied in the house and senate bills the original point of the hipc program was concern that too much of countrys scarce foreign exchan ge resources were being used to fund debt service and not enough was available for developmen t purposes the mdri and the proposed jubilee act would require th at countries spend their sa vings from debt cancellation on programs aimed at the alle viation of poverty for the most part however those expenditures are made in the countries ow n currency and not in foreign exchange in effect the money in governments budget that previously would have been used to purchase the foreign exchange needed for debt service can be used instead for domestic social or development programs the hipc and mdri programs anticipate that foreign aid levels will decline in pace with the reduction in the former debtors debt service obligations the freedup foreign exchange the money that would have been used previously for debt paym ents is now expected to be the source of funding in lieu of development aid the jubilee debt cancellation bill says nothing however about the way countries should use their freedup foreign exchange countries can chose to use that money to fund the import cost relate d to new development activitie s if they wish but there is obligation that they do so the money could be used instead to fund the purchase of consumer goods luxury goods ar ms or other things that are not basic to the development process there is assu rance under the current legislation that countrys expenditures for developmentrela ted imports will increase beyond the level needed to supply the incidental require ments of the countrys enhanced domestic expenditures policy issues additionality debt cancellation is seen by many as relatively inexpensive way to provide additional aid to needy countries the m oney has already been contributed to the recipient country only small amount of new money is needed to cancel the outstanding balance the key word is additional the world banks independent evaluation group ieg reported in 2003 that aid flows to hipc debt cancellation recipients increased after the onset of the hipc program but that aid levels overall hadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34644crs17 23 world bank an oed of the hipc initiative operations evaluati on department later renamed the independent evaluation group 2003 decreased23 consequently ieg sai d there appears to have been redistribution from nonhipcs to hipcs since 1 998 aid to nonhipc poor countries declined as the existing resources were concentrated more on the hipc beneficiaries the fact that the costs of funding debt relief are gene rally charged against the donor countries foreign aid budget compounds the problem if the new round of debt relief contemplat ed by the jubilee debt cancellation bill is accompanied by an increase in the overall levels of foreign aid then other countries will not see their aid levels fall when the c ountries in the group targeted by the jubilee legislation receive new debt relief on the other hand if aid levels do not increase in proportion to the benefits th new beneficiaries from the jubilee program the gains for the jubilee beneficiaries will be matc hed by losses by the nonjubilee countries and the overall development ffect of the jubilee debt cancellation program could be neutral at best conditionality the house and senate jubilee debt reduction bills both contain high standards that countries must meet in order to qualify for assistance under the proposed program the question is whether this is way of seeing that only worthy countries receive debt relief or whether the standards are an integral tool in the development process that is the goal of the legislation some of the standards seem to be aime d at rewarding count ries for example those with democratically elected governments business contacts with iran cooperative policies regarding interna tional terrorism dr ugs and mass weapons proliferation that have pur sued what might be consider ed desirable goals those goals may not have much connection to the development process itself other standards in the legislation however do ve such connections these include the requirements that countries make policy through tran sparent and participatory procedures and that they have transp arent policy and budgetary procedures good governance and effective anticorruption procedures many analysts believe that weak governance and lack of institutional capacity are greater barriers to growth in poor count ries than is the overhang of unpaid debt difficulty in managing debt is often symptom they believe of deeper and more fundamental economic and so cietal problems political leaders in developing countries are often aware of these diffi culties but find it difficult to mobilize the support necessary to overcome entrenched re sistance to change the prospect that their countries foreign debts may be cance lled if they undertake the needed reforms may be an incentive that will capture th popular imagination nd facilitate reform debt cancellation by itself might have only limited positive effects if underlying conditions in the governance and policy pro cess are unchanged ho wever if countries are able to find the political will to institute the reforms that are necessary to qualify for debt cancellation under the jubilee act they w ill likely be able to make more effective use of the resources freed by bt cancellation than they might otherwisehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34644crs18 24 jonathan sanford ida gr ants and hipc debt cancellation their effectiveness and impact on ida resources world development september 2004 25 ibidhave been indeed some an alysts believe that it is the process of making and achieving those changes rather than th proceeds from debt cancellation that would have the most positive developmental effects funding jubilee debt relief the jubilee act does not authorize the united states to spend money to help provide additional debt relief appropriations will be required however if the program goes into effect and the united states agrees with others to cancel debts owed to it by the proposed beneficiary countries the jubilee act presumes that the international financial institutions will use internal resources money currently in their financial reserves and anticipated future ifi income to offset the cost of cancelling the debt which is owed to them there may be nough money available from these sources to offset much of the cost of multilate ral debt cancellation it is uncertain however that other ifi member countries will want to make debt cancellation for this particular group of countries their highest priority and to dedicate the ifis internal resources to that goal in that case debt cancellation for those countries will require either that the international agencies absorb the cost by shrinking the size of their programs or th at the united states and other donor countries contribute money to offset that cost i da for example has typically funded about 40 of its new loans with money received from the repayment of earlier loans24 if those reflows are reduced ida will either need new source of funding to make up the difference or it will have to reduce its future level of assistance to recipient countries funding mdb debt cancellation for these 24 countries from mdb and imf internal resources may be difficult to achie ve there are competing claims for those resources following recommendati on by the world banks development committee in 1999 for example the ibrds member country governments have been allocating major share of the banks net income each year towards expanding ibrd reserves since then the ratio of ibrd equity paid in capital plus retained earnings to outstanding loans has increased from 239 to 408 this means that the ibrd has almost 41 dollars in reserves for every 100 of outstanding loans25 it is conceivable that the banks member countries may decide that ibrd net income is sufficient and that larger share of the ibrds net income could now be allocated for other purposes such as bt cancellation jubilee usa proposes that the ibrd transfer an additional 300 million annually from its net income for the next dozen years in order to fund debt relief fo r the 24 countries addressed in the jubilee bill the world bank has been doing this already in the past three years it allocated 17 billion from its net income to help f und ida and various bt relief initiatives it also made similar transfers previously it is not clear though that the banks member countries would agree that debt cancellation for these 24 countries

pressing international health or povertyalleviation or environmental concerns countries may have different views as to how these present and future claims should be weighed there may be less reason to believe that the world ba nks member countries will be willing to withdraw substantial sums from the banks reserves to pay the cost of debt cancellation for these 24 countries as noted earlier the banks member countries have made concer ted effort since 1999 to expand the size of the reserves the development committee26 believed the bank needed rger reserves so it could take on more risks in its loan program in order to enhance their development impact the committee thought the ibrd should expand the size of its operations in some countries even if this meant that the sh are of its exposure in individual countries would increase the committee thought the bank should be more innovative and more willing to lend money in the face of di fficult and risky problems it also thought the bank should expand its volume of lending to lower middleincome countries even though these countries were often consid ered less creditworthy than are emerging market borrowers these initiatives all increase the risk factor in ibrd lending and they still seem to be present concerns if the size of its reserves were to shrink because money was allocated for other pur poses the banks member countries would likely need to decide whether its loan program should become more cautious or whether it should go ahead with these activ ities even though its financial backstop had shrunk another effect of reduction in the size of the ibrds reserves might be reduction in the size of the banks annual income the bank invests its equity and retained earnings in order to generate income to fund its operating costs in 2007 the ibrd earned about 12 billion from investments while its total net income for the year exclusive of marktomarket adjus tments on the value of its portfolio was about 17 billion27 if the banks investment income diminishes as result of the decline in the size of its reserves the ibrd would face difficult choices it might need to consider whether to reduce the amount it llocates annually from surplus revenue for humanitarian and development aid whether to reduce its administrative budget further or whether to increase its amount it charges its ibrd borrowers so as to increase its revenue from loan operations each of these choices has pitfalls that the member countries would need to discuss jubilee usa has also proposed that bt cancellation might be funded through the sale of gold by the imf imf gold sales have always been sensitive and controversial topic at present the imf member countries are proposing that ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34644crs20 28 see crs report rs22729 international monetary fund imf financial reform and the possible sale of imf gold by martin weiss and jonathan sanford substantial amount of gold should be sold in order to create an endowment fund that will pay the costs of the imfs research and surveillance activities because its lending volume has substantially decline d the imf does not currently have enough income to cover its operating expenses th member countries are proposing that the imfs public goods activities should be funded independe ntly through an endowment proposal to pprove imf gold sales for this purpose is expected to come to congress in 2009 it is unlikely that the imf member c ountries will abandon the proposal that gold be sold in order to underwrite the funds administrative costs so that gold sales for debt reduction can be the new priority more likely if the imf were to propose that gold be sold to pay for debt relief it would be in addition to the existing plan careful negotiations were necessary to secure agreem ent for the current gold sale plan it is not clear that gold producer countries centr banks and other holders of gold would easily endorse plan to roughly double the amount of gold the imf could sell likewise it is not clear that congress woul d easily endorse larger gold sale plan there have been many proposals in the past that gold be sold by the imf to help finance ida debt forgiveness28 institutionally and substantively there has been strong resistance among the members to that idea careful discussion would be needed within the us government and among the imf member countries to see if there is sufficient support now for an expanded gold sale plan in the past and as proposed in the jub ilee debt cancellation bill poor countries have had to meet specified conditions in or der to qualify for debt cancellation at the decision point however once they have qualif ied their debt payments are irrevocably cancelled and they do not need to take additional steps or maintain the reforms they adopted to qualify in order to retain the benefits of bt cancellation supporters say this procedure is necessary in ensure stab ility and to assure countries that they can program the money gained from debt can cellation without worry that their debt cancellation will be taken away critics argue however th at there is assurance under this procedure that the reforms dopted to qualify for debt relief will be sustained many instances have been ci ted where adherence to the reforms has deteriorated once debt can cellation has been achieved those who share this latter concern mig ht consider whether some form of tranching might be employed to ensure that countries continue to meet the standards that were required for debt cancellation on ce their debt cancellation program has been approved for example countries debt pa yments for five year period might be forgiven on the understanding that to have th eir debt payments for the next five years similarly waived they must continue to meet the terms they had to meet in order to qualify for debt relief in the first place currently the debt cancellation under the hipc program is an irrevokable action once country qualifies for cancellation it longer needs to make future payments on the forgiven loans even if it regresses on its policy reforms or it equivocates on its promises
