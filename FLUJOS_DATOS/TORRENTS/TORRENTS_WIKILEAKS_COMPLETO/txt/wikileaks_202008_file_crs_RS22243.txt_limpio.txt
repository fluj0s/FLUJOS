38 billion in fy2006 this report reviews the funding history of the programs since the 2002 farm bill was enacted it will be updated periodically introduction major issue in the upcoming farm bill debate is likely to be funding for conservation programs current authorization for mandatory funding for most of these programs under the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 pl 107171 expires at the end of fy2007 mandatory funding means that the amount authorized by congress is available unless limited to smaller amounts in the appropriations process if appropriators do not act the amount that was authorized is provided to the program these mandatory funds are provided by the us department of agricultures commodity credit corporation financing institution for many agriculture programs including commodity programs and export subsidies while most conservation programs currently are authorized using mandatory funding discretionary funding is used for six conservation programs for discretionary programs appropriators decide how much funding to provide each year in the annual agriculture appropriations bill subject to any maximum limit set in law conservation program advocates prefer mandatory funding over discretionary funding they believe that it is generally easier to protect authorized mandatory funding levels from reductions crs2 during the appropriations process than to secure appropriations each year however since fy2002 congress has limited funding for some of the mandatory programs each year below authorized levels in annual appropriations acts advocates for these programs decry these limitations as significant changes from the intent of the farm bill which compromise the programs ability to provide the anticipated magnitude of benefits to producers and the environment others including those interested in reducing agricultural expenditures or in spending the funds for other agricultural purposes counter that even with these reductions overall funding has grown substantially mandatory conservation funding before 2002 congress provided mandatory funding for selected conservation programs for the first time in the 1996 farm bill pl 1041271 prior to 1996 all conservation programs had been funded as discretionary programs conservation program advocates viewed mandatory funding as much more desirable approach and congress agreed enacting provisions that moved some conservation programs from discretionary to mandatory funding some advocates viewed this change in funding as major achievement in the 1996 farm bill amounts authorized for these programs at the time may seem modest httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22243 when compared with todays levels programs funded with mandatory funding and their authorized levels under the 1996 law included the following conservation reserve program maximum of 364 million acres at any time through fy2002 with dollar amount specified wetland reserve program maximum of 975000 acres at any time through fy2002 with dollar amount specified environmental quality incentives program 130 million in fy1996 and 200 million annually thereafter through fy2002 wildlife habitat incentives program total of 50 million between fy1996 and fy2002 farmland protection program total of 35 million with time span specified and conservation farm option 75 million in fy1997 increasing each year to high of 625 million in fy2002 the 2002 farm bill the 2002 farm bill greatly expanded mandatory funding for conservation authorizing the annual funding levels shown in table 1 mandatory funding was provided both for expiring programs that were reauthorized and for new programs created in the legislation the increase in authorized funding levels was widely endorsed for many reasons conservation supporters had long been seeking higher funding levels and this was another significant step in that effort an argument that proved particularly persuasive in this farm bill debate was documentation of large backlogs of interested and eligible producers who were unable to enroll because of lack of funds demand to participate in some of the programs exceeded the available program dollars several times over and some members reasoned that higher funding was warranted to satisfy this demand 1 the one exception to this statement is that the 1985 farm bill pl 99198 authorized mandatory funding for the conservation reserve program in fy1986 and fy1987 crs3 funding for fy2002 is not included in table 1 as the fy2002 appropriations legislation was enacted on november 28 2001 six months before the 2002 farm bill program funding decisions had to be based on prior legislation indeed by the time this farm bill was enacted the fy2003 appropriations process was well along2 however the 2002 farm bill did authorize money in fy2002 for several mandatory programs spending limits on mandatory appropriations since fy2002 in each year since fy2002 annual agriculture appropriations acts have capped funding for some of the mandatory conservation programs below authorized levels the programs that are limited and the amounts of the limitations change from year to year one program the wetland reserve program has been capped in enrolled acres which appropriators translate into savings based on average enrollment costs table 1 compares the authorized spending level for each of the programs with the amount that congress actually provided through the appropriations process it does not include any mandatory conservation programs enacted since the 2002 farm bill including the conservation reserve program technical assistance account enacted in pl 108498 the healthy forest reserve enacted in pl 108148 and the emergency forestry conservation httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22243 reserve program enacted in pl 109148 many of the spending reductions originate in the administrations budget request since the farm bill states that the secretary shall spend the authorized amounts for each program each year congress must act to limit spending to lesser amount the mix of programs and amounts of reduction in the administration request have varied from year to year congress has concurred with the administration request some years for some programs starting in fy2003 the requested reductions in mandatory funding below the authorized levels shown in the table are as follows in fy2003 the request was submitted before the farm bill was enacted and did not include any requests to reduce funding levels in fy2004 the request was to limit the wetlands reserve program wrp to 200000 acres 250 million limit the environmental quality incentives program eqip to 850 million limit the ground and surface water program gswp to 51 million limit the wildlife habitat incentive program whip to 42 million limit the farmland protection program fpp to 112 million limit the conservation security program csp to 19 million and eliminate funding for the watershed rehabilitation and agricultural management assistance ama programs in fy2005 the request was to limit the wrp to 200000 acres 295 million eqip to 985 million whip to 59 million fpp to 120 million and csp to 209 million and eliminate funding for the watershed rehabilitation and ama programs 2 in addition during the fy2001 appropriations process congress had provided onetime funding to several conservation programs beyond what had been authorized in the 1996 farm bill these onetime appropriations were congressional and administration responses to combination of forecasts of federal budget surpluses and high demand to participate in

whip to 55 million fpp to 50 million biomass research and development to 12 million and csp to 342 million and eliminate funding for the watershed rehabilitation and ama programs discussion while congress has reduced funding for some mandatory conservation programs either in support of an administration request or on its own the reductions did not exceed 10 of the total until fy2005 however the gap between authorized levels and actual amounts continues to grow as percentage this gap has grown from 24 of the total authorized amount in fy2003 to 127 in fy2006 even with these changes however actual total funding has risen almost 720 million over the same fouryear time period httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22243 which is an increase of almost 25 from the fy2003 authorization3 reductions have not been uniform among programs the largest mandatory program the crp has not been limited in any way by appropriators since the 2002 farm bill was enacted the secondlargest program eqip has absorbed the largest reductions from authorized levels totaling 396 million between fy2003 and fy2006 funding for third program the csp has been amended four times since 2002 as initially enacted it was the first true conservation entitlement program that is any individual who met the eligibility requirements would be accepted into the program congress has capped csp and then repeatedly reduced the cap to fund other activities usually disaster assistance more generally the table shows that reductions have varied from year to year and program to program since 2002 at one extreme the watershed rehabilitation program has received mandatory funding in any year it is one of the five conservation programs authorized to receive discretionary appropriations as well and those have been provided and at the other extreme the crp has not been limited in any way some of the programs have unusual characteristics that affect how they are treated for budget purposes as noted in the table footnotes for example the grasslands reserve and klamath river basin programs each have total authorized level that is not subdivided by fiscal year in the authorizing legislation for those programs the amount that was spent each year not the remaining lifetime authorization is included for purposes of calculating the percentage by which funding is reduced as result of the many variations in how these programs are authorized some in acres and others in dollars and some as total amount and others by year there are several alternative ways to calculate the annual and total reduction from the authorized level however all of these calculations lead to the same general set of observations first overall funding for the suite of mandatory agriculture conservation programs has 3 if the full authorized amount had been provided in fy2006 the increase would have been more than 35 from the fy2003 authorized amount crs6 been reduced each year second the magnitude by which this suite of programs is being reduced has been growing each year third these reductions may still be significant to current or potential beneficiaries of those program fourth even with the reductions overall funding for the group of mandatory programs has continued to rise finally funding for the discretionary agricultural conservation programs varies more from year to year with much larger percentage reductions than the mandatory programs in some years greater variation in funding for discretionary programs supports the view of conservation proponents that using the mandatory approach has been more successful and predictable approach to conservation program funding in recent years for more information on each of these programs see crs report rl32940 agriculture conservation programs scorecard by jeffrey zinn and tadlock cowan concluding observations when considering whether reductions in mandatory funding for conservation programs compromise the conservation effort three points are relevant first measure of how conservation funding is viewed in relation to other agriculture funding was provided in the fy2006 reconciliation process which required the agriculture committees httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22243 to reduce total usda mandatory program funding by 30 billion over five years including reduction of 176 million in fy2006 conservation provided 934 million of those savings with reductions for fy2006 this amount is about 25 of the total reduction that was enacted 37 billion over five years the savings came from lowering caps on spending for csp and eqip in future years which also required authorizing them beyond fy2007 and eliminating unspent funds for the watershed rehabilitation program carried over from earlier years part of the debate was whether conservation is being asked to bear disproportionate share of these reductions for more information see crs report rs22086 agriculture and fy2006 budget reconciliation second it appears highly likely that reductions to mandatory program spending at the current scale will continue reductions have been in every administration request and annual appropriations bill since fy2003 it is less certain however whether these reductions will continue to grow as percentage of the total future change will depend on both congressional support for conservation specifically and broader pressures that influence overall federal spending it is likely that the affected programs and the magnitude of the reductions will continue to vary from year to year making it difficult to forecast the future based on the past third supporters of conservation programs may look for ways to address the challenge of spending reductions in the next farm bill however several broader forces may make it difficult to authorize higher funding levels or to protect current funding levels for these conservation programs one force may be broad efforts to control federal spending second force may be competition among various agriculture constituencies for limited funds the fy2006 reconciliation process provided an indication of how congress will treat conservation when it must make decisions based on this competition third force may be limits on the capacity of federal conservation agencies at current staffing levels and with the current approaches to plan and install all the conservation practices that additional funding would support and it seems likely that increasing staff levels in federal agencies to provide more conservation will not be an option
