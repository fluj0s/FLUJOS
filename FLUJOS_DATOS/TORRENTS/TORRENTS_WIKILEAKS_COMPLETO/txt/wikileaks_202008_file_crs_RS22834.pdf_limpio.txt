this overall framework s 3036 in cludes three design mechanisms that may provide financial incentives to encourage landbased agricultural and forestry activities these include provisions on carbon offsets setas ide allowances and auction proceeds in the 110th congress several propos als have been introduced that would either mandate or authorize capandtrade program to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions capandtrade pr ogram provides marketbased policy tool for reducing emissions by setting cap or maximum emissions limit for certain industries sources covered by the cap can choose to reduce their own emissions or can choose to buy emission credits that are generated from reduc tions made by other sources this type of marketbased approach to ghg reductions nd trading would be similar to the acid rain reduction program established by the 1990 clean air act amendments1 among the capandtrade proposals introduced to date none includes the agriculture sector as covered industry subject to emission reductions under the cap2 in part this may reflect the general consensus as stated by the house energy and commercehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22834crs2 3 committee on energy and commerce climate change legislation design white paper scope of capandtrade program prepared by committee staff october 2007 available at httpenergycommercehousegovc limate_changewhite_paper100307pdf 4 among the ghg bills that prov ide for agriculture andor forestry offsets are s 3036 liebermanwarner s 280 mccainlieberma n s 317 feinstein s 1168 alexander lieberman s 1177 carper s 1766 bin gamanspecter and hr 620 olver 5 primarily s 3036 and also s 1766 bingamanspecter 6 on june 2 2008 the senate invoked cloture on s 3036 and will proceed to debate the bill under unanimousconsent agreement 7 this analysis is based on legislative text in s 3036 as of may 20 2008 and does not include changes from possible amendments that may be considered by the senatecommittee that ghg emissions from the agriculture sector generally do not lend themselves to regulation under capandtr ade program given the large number of sources with small individual emissions th at would be impractical to measure3 however several of the capandtrade pr oposals do incorporate the agriculture and forestry sectors either as source of carbon offsets4 or as recipient of setaside allowances5 some bills also specify that the pr oceeds from auctioned allowances be used to promote certain objectives which could further encourage farmland conservation and bioenergy technologies and prac tices among other activities inclusion of such provisions in the broa der capandtrade proposal s could benefit the us agriculture and forestry sectors for example the offset and allowance provisions would allow farmers and landowne rs to participate in the emerging market by granting them use of allowances and credits for sequestration andor emission reduction activities these allowances and credits could be sold to regulated facilities eg power plants covered by capandtrade program to meet their emission reduction obligations the proceeds from the sale of these allowances and credits as well as proceeds from auctions that fund technology deployment are intende d to further promote and support activities in the agriculture or forestry sectors that aim to reduce avoid or sequester emissions in the senate for example bill ordered reported by the senate committee on environment and public works epw in december 2007 the liebermanwarner climate security act of 2008 s 3036 formerly s 21916 contains several agriculture based provisions summary of these provisi ons is provided below overall s 3036 directs the administrator of the us envi ronmental protection agency to establish program to decrease ghg emissions under capandtrade framework7 agriculture and forestry provisions the capandtrade framework outlined in s 3036 establishes tradeable allowance system that includes combination of auctions and free allocation of tradeable allowances as part of th is overall framework s 3036 incl udes three design mechanisms that may provide financial incentives to courage landbased agri cultural and forestry activities carbon offsets setaside allowances and auction proceeds in this context carbon offset refers to measurable voidance reduction or sequestration of co2 or other ghg emissions expressed in carbonequivalent terms setaside allowancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22834crs3 8 in carbon market trading an offset is certif icate representing the reduction of the equivalence of one metric ton of carbon dioxi emissions the principal greenhouse gas offsets generally fall within the categories of biological sequest ration renewable energy energy efficiency and nonco2 greenhouse gas emissions reductions for more information on allowances and auction proceeds in current ghg bills see allocations for carbon allowances and auctions under s 2191 by brent d yacobucci crs general distribution memorandumrefers to set percentage of available llowances under the overall emissions cap that is allocated to nonregulated entities in this case domestic agriculture and forestry entities for auction proceeds this refers to the set pe rcentage that is allocated for use to carry out the cellulosic biomass ethanol technology deployment program8 offsets title ii subtitle d

these listed practices or combinati ons of agricultural conservation practices in general these types of conservati on and farmland manage ment practices are among existing agricultural and forestry programs that are administered at both the federal and state levels many of these practices are provided for as part of existingeligible agricultural and forestr offset projects s 3036 sec 2403

of the farm bill such as the conservation reserve prog ram the grasslands reserve program the environmental quality incentives program and the conservation stewardship program among others these programs provide tec hnical assistance and either costsharing or easement payments that in addition to accomplishing other environmental objectives generally encourage land retirement or the types of agricultural practices that can reduce ghg emissions andor sequester carbon table 1 other farm bill programs in the energy title ix and rural development title vi titles authorize loans loan guarantees and grants for energy efficiency and renewable energy systems including anaerobic digesters for more information see crs report rl33898 climate change the role of the us agriculture sector by renée johnson setaside allowances title iii sub title g domestic agriculture and forestry of s 3036 directly allocates 5 of the overall emi ssions allowances to domestic agriculture and forestry entities sec 3701 this could provide sizeable benefit to us producers overall the proposal starts off with 58 billion emissions allowances for cy2012 which phases down to 17 billion emissions allowances for cy2050 sec 1201 5 setaside for domestic agriculture and forestry entities could give these sectors significant part of this emerging market between 290 million and 90 million emissions allowances for qualifying entities depending on the year the agriculture and forestry provisions in this subtitle cover allocation sec 3701 research sec 3702 and distri bution sec 3703 the subtitle does not specify the types practices that would be applicable howeve r it does state that emissions reduction and increases in carbon sequestration in the agricu lture and forestry sectors should be real verifiable additional permanent and enfo rceable sec 3701 it so specifies the need for reductions of both nitrous oxide emissi ons through soil mana gement and methane emissions through feed and ma nure management sec 3702a this provision indirectly relates to new usda conservation provision that was included in the 2008 farm bill this provisi on would facilitate the market development of environmental services from the agriculture and forestry sectors including carbon storage and tradeable credits by addressing measurement quantif ication verification and enforcement issues among other relate d issues for information see crs report rl34042 environmental services markets farm bill proposal by renée johnson auction proceeds title iv subtitle d ener gy technology deployment of s 3036 specifies that 6 of auction proceeds be used to carry out variety of projects to promote cellulosic biomass ethanol t echnology deployment sec 4401 sec 4404 this provision calls for the use of producer incentives such as loan guarantees and production payments to promote the constr uction of production f acilities and supporting infrastructure for cellulosic biomass this could benefit us ag

reported that global transactions of lulucf offsets have only account ed for 6 of this allowable limitconsiderations for congress many see the involvement of the agriculture and forestry sectors in climate change mitigation strategy as an opportunity to fu rther encourage farmers and landowners to make environmental improvements on their nd and to transition to more sustainable production practices neve rtheless inclusion of the agricu lture and forestry sectors in capandtrade program has remained controvers ial since the kyoto protocol negotiations9 during those negotiations there was marked disagreement among countries and interest groups arguing either for or against the in clusion of offsets fro m the agriculture and forestry sectors10 the text box below lists some of the primary areas of concern regarding agriculture and forestry offset s and allowances the eus ghg emission program the emission trading system ets which was established in 2005 does not provide for agricultural or forestry projects and activities among the reasons are 1 pragmatic concerns regarding measurement and verification given the sheer number of farmers and landowners and 2 ideological concerns about granting too much flexibility in how emission reductions are met wh ich could undermine ove rall program goals11 for more detailed discussion of th issues see crs report rl34241 voluntary carbon offsets overview and assessment by jonathan l ramseur and crs report rl33898 climate change the role of the us agriculture sector by renée johnson agriculturalforestry offsets and allowances areas of concern permanenceduration land uses can change over time eg forest lands to urban development natural events such as fires or pests measurementaccounting measuring biological sequestration is difficult and estimates can vary and actual emission reduc tionsequestration depends on sitespecific factors eg location climate soil type cropvegetation tillage practices management additionality some activities generating offsets would have occurred anyway under preexisting program or practice and ma not go beyond business as usual bau reductions may be doublecounted or attributab to other environmental goal programs effectiveness the success of the mitigation practice depends on the type of practice how well it is implemented and managed by th farmer or landowner and the length of time the practice is undertaken and leakage reductions in one place could resu lt in additional emissions elsewherehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22834crs6 table 1 current conservation and
