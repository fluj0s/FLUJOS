undp unhq and unon undp country offices provide range of administrative services including cash di sbursements related to programme implementation for united nations agencies the undp country offices record the layout of funds on inter office vouchers iov and bill the v arious agencies for these services on monthly basis by preparing report at 036 for each agency which has appended to it copies of all iovs for that agency for the month the origin at 036 report and its attachments are sent to undp hq new york by diplomatic pouch and copy is sent to the agency report at 036 is thereafter filed in the undp country finance files in undp bratislava copies are not kept of the attachments and the report at 036 does not enum erate them this office processes about 25 cash disbursements month 12 in october 2003 unon finance was reconciling its acc ounts with undp bratislava and noted there was an outstanding iov from august 2002 unon finance could not locate the august 2002 report at 036 or its attachments it r equested these materials from undp bratislava and determined that there were two cash disbursement vouchers which could not be reconciled two lump sum payments to the consultan t in the amounts of us5814 and us4265 for travel to johannesburg and monrovia t attend ozone secretariat conferences in august 2002 and september 2002 respectively 13 unon finance determined that these two vouchers were based on genuine travel request authorization which had been sent from unon to the undp bratislava office on 25 june 2002 the two travel requests of the consulta nt changed certain details of the genuine fax including the name of the payee the date comments and the unon fax number which is unique to each unon fax and is assigned in the unon cable room but retained amongst other items the names and signatures of the authorizing officer s and the travel request number which is specific to each request 14 unon finance concluded that the faxes which instructe d undp bratislava to make these payments were forged furthermore unep confirmed th at there were meetings in johannesburg and monrovia in 2002 that the consult ant was not uneps consultant and that payment of lump sums to consultants for travel was irregular in any event v investigative details 15 idoios learned that the genuine and the forged fax were received by the registry clerk of the undp bratislava registry office and in the normal course of business forwarded by email to the finance department supervisor and to financ assistant 1 the finance department supervisor then forwarded the genuine fax to the tr avel department for processing but neither the finance department supervisor nor finance assis tant 1 forwarded the forged faxes elsewhere 16 finance assistant 1 then emailed the consultant n both occasions to notify him of the authorization of payment and he and the consultant exchanged emails to arrange the time and means of his collection of the payment on both oc casions the consultant presented himself at the undp office on one occasion he logged in with his signature and identification number but there was signin record the other time t he consultant met with someone from the finance department probably finance assistant 1 lthough finance assistant 1 has recollection of meeting him in keeping with accept ed practice within undp bratislava and slovakia as whole whoever met with the consulta nt had him write his name and identity details on the back of the respective checks howev er undp bratislava does not keep an independent copy of such information the consult ant also signed cash disbursement form and subsequently cashed both checks 17 idoios obtained copies of the checks from the bank and acquired the identity details from the back of the check idoios consulted with the slovakian police and found that neither the consultant nor his company were in their data bases and the police concluded that the identity materials provided by him when he picked u p the checks were likely to be false idoios also found that the email account used by the consultant to arrange collection of the cheques at undp bratislava had been discontinued 18 idoios examined copies of the forged faxes which h ad been retained in the undp bratislava registry database these copies had h eader with unons sender details but unlike the undp bratislava hard copies in the finance files and those which had been forwarded to unon in october 2003 the registry copies also had footer which reflected that they had actually been sent from store which provides fax services in shopping centre near the undp bratislava office 19 finance assistant 1 claimed he had not noticed the footer on them when idoios asked why the photocopies of the forged faxes in the undp finance file did not have the footer he disclaimed responsibility for the photocopying 20 at the time of these incidents two photocopying as sistants had been working on an ad hoc basis at the finance office and had access to d epartmental files photocopying assistant 1 was relative of the finance department supervisor and photocopying assistant 2 was the daughter of finance assistant 2 photocopying assi stant 2 assisted her father periodically without pay oios was informed that the two assist ants helped in the preparation of the end of month financial returns which included retrieving documents from various files copying them and returning them to the files photocopying assi stant 1 was working at the finance office at the relevant time period but it has not been fully est ablished when photocopying assistant 2 worked at the office timesheets were kept for either assistant 21 review of procedures at unon unep narobi and undp brati slava in connection with payments of this sort showed that undp bratislava relies on the authorizing signature s on the faxes and does not verify their authenticity with the agency undp bratislava maintains signin sheet which req uires signature and identity information but it was kept haphazardly at the tim of these incidents undp bratislava disperses cheques upon proof of ide ntity which is recorded on the back of the cheque and the payee signs the original cash d isbursement voucher upon receipt of the cheque but the finance office does not retain co py of the payees proof of identification undp bratislava does not maintain mail log while procedures for reconciling accounts between u non and undp were in place unon did not attempt to reconcile the august 2002 undp br atislava account for more than year after it was purportedly submitted and unep narobi stated that it has had several problems with fraudulent payments by undp offices vi findings issue one can the fraudulently induced payments b recovered from the consultant 22 idoios with the assistance of the slovakia police has not been able to ascertain the identity of the consultant however the consul tant if identified and found would be subject to prosecution under the slovakian penal co issue two was this fraud facilitated by united nations staff member and if so can that individual be identified 23 idoios has established that the genuine unon fax num ber was photocopied and altered to produce the consultants fax requests it has also established that the forged faxes were transmitted locally which suggests that this fraud was carried out in slovakia 24 whoever forged the faxes had to have access to the genuine fax and knowledge of the format and function of the travel requests and the procedures used in processing these requests 25 the fact that unon finance did not receive the repor t at 036 and the appended iov although the cover letter to unon was filed at undp br atislava suggests that someone with knowledge and access manipulated the system to dela discovery of the fraud furthermore the photocopies of the forged faxes which were filed wi th the report at 036 were copied without the identifying footer which also suggests an inte nt to delay discovery of the fraud 26 consequently it is highly probable that this fraud was facilitated by undp bratislava staff member probably in the finance department b ut idoios investigators were not able to determine who was responsible 27 if staff member is found to have facilitated this fraud he could be charged with violation of staff rule 1012g staff regulation 12b g and i and would be subject to prosecution under the slovakian penal code vii recommendations 28 in the light of the preceding findings and clusions oios makes the following recommendations recommendation 1 it is recommended that undp revis the system in place for verification and payment of travel authorization requests to enh ance and safeguard procedures and prevent fraud rec iv0358001 recommendation 2 it is recommended that undp brati slava retain copies of identification provided by payees to assist in later identity chec k requirements rec iv0358002 recommendation 3 it is recommended that undp brati
