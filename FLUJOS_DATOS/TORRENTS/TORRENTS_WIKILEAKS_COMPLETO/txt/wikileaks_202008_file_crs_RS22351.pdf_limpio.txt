tax incentives that encourage the purchase of these vehicles nd the development of infrastructure needed to support them among the new provisions are tax credits for the purchase of hybrid vehicles replacing an existing tax deduction tax credits for the purchase of advanced diesel vehicles although it is unclear whether any current vehicles will qualify and tax credits to expand refueling infrastructure this report discusse s current federal tax incentives for alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles it also outlines how the energy policy act of 2005 changes those incentives this report will be updated as events warrant introduction1 alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles face significant barriers to wider acceptance as passenger and work vehicles alternative fuel vehicles include vehicles powered by nonpetroleum fuels such as natural gas electricity or alcohol fuels advanced technology vehicles include hybrid vehi cles which combine gasoline engine with an electric moto r system to boost efficiency2 often these vehicles are more expensive than their c onventional counterparts3 further fueling the vehicles is often inconvenient because the number of refueling sta tions for alternative vehicles is negligible compared with the number of gasoline sta tions nationwide in some regions the infrastructure is nonexistent however many of these vehicles pe rform more efficientlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22351crs2 4 for more information on the current tax incen tives see the internal revenue service website at httpwwwirsgov 5 further taxpayers who purchased hybrids in prev ious years may file an amended return to claim the deductionand are better for the environment than conven tional vehicles there has been significant interest in promoting these vehicles as response to environmental and energy security concerns current tax incentives through 20054 the energy policy act of 1992 pl 102486 1913 estab lished individual and business tax incentives for the purchase of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles and for th installation of alternative fuel infrastructure the energy policy ac t of 2005 pl 10958 expands these existing tax incentives and creates new ones incen tives existing prior to pl 10958 include the electric vehicle tax credit the clean fuel vehicle tax deduction and tax deduction for the installation of alternative fuel infrastructure electric vehicle tax credit for 2005 federal tax credit is available worth 10 of the purchase price of an electric vehicle up to maximum of 4000 26 usc 30 the credit which was not extended by the energy policy act of 2005 will be reduced to maximum of 1000 in 2006 and will be phased out co mpletely after 2006 clean fuel vehicle tax deduction for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles as well as hybrid electric vehicl clean fuel vehicle tax deduction 26 usc 179a is available the amount of the deduction is based on the weight of the vehicle vehicles under 10000 pounds gross vehi cle weight ie cars and light trucks qualify for 2000 deduction in 2005 t hose between 10000 and 26000 pounds qualify for 5000 deduction vehicles above 26000 pounds qualify for 50000 deduction the energy policy act of 2005 terminates this deduction after december 31 2005 and replaces it with tax credit see below prior to 2002 hybrid electric vehicles we re not considered cleanfuel vehicles because the primary fuel for the vehicles is gasoline however in may 2002 the internal revenue service irs announced that taxp ayers can claim the deduction for qualified hybrids5 as of december 2005 eight hybrid m odels are eligible for the deduction fueling infrastructure tax deduction businesses that install alternative fuel refueling infrastructure can claim tax deduction of up to 100000 26 usc 179a the energy policy act of 2005 eliminates th is deduction at the end of 2005 and replaces it with tax credit see below new tax credits under p l 10958 2006 and beyond the energy policy act of 2005 expanded and extended the ex isting tax incentives for nonconventional vehicles these new incentives are similar to those proposed in the clean efficient automobiles resulting from advanced car t echnologies act clear act s 971 and the volume enhancing hardware incen tives for consumer lowered expenseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22351crs3 6 currently these are exclusively diesel vehi cles although leanburn gasoline engines are technically feasible vehicles with leanbur n gasoline engines as defined by 1341 of the act are currently availabletechnology act vehicle technology act h r 626 as well as gislation discussed in the 108th congress among other provisions sections 1341 nd 1342 of the energy policy act of 2005 contain several tax incentives for alternative fuel and adva nced technology vehicles for example the act replaces the existing cleanfuel vehicle tax deduction with new tax credit for hybrid vehicles creates tax credit for the purchase of leanburn passenger vehicles6 creates new tax credit for the purchase of fuelcell vehicles replaces the existing cleanfuel vehicle tax deduction with an alternativefuel vehicle tax credit and replaces the existing deduction for the installation of refuelinginfrastructure with tax credit each of these credits is discussed below table 4 summarizes each one hybrid electric vehicle tax credit under the energy policy act of 2005 the existing cleanfuel vehicle deduction for hybrid electric vehicles is replaced with tax credit after 2005 the amount of the credit is based on several fact ors for passenger vehicles these factors are the fuel econom increase and the expected lifetime fuel savings when compared with conventional vehicle of comparable weight to qualify for the credit hybrid vehicle must meet certain emissions standards and technical specifications for heavydut vehicles more than 8500 pounds the credit is based on the fuel economy relative to comparable vehicl as well as the incremental cost of the hybrid vehicle above the cost of the conven tional vehicle the range of potential credits for each vehicle weight are shown in table 1 the hybrid vehicle credit is scheduled to expire at the end of 2009 table 1 hybrid vehicle tax credit by gross vehicle weight up to 8500 pounds8501 to 14000 pounds14001 to 26000 poundsmore than 26000 pounds 400 to 3400a0 to

of the credits for 2006 leanburn vehicle credit the energy policy act of 2005 established tax credit for the purchase of passenger vehicles with leanburn engines for the most part dieselpowered vehicles that meet certain emissions and fuel economy standards would qualify for the tax credit which is structured like the hybrid tax credit and ranges from 400 to 3400 based on fuel economy and fuel savings the credit is scheduled to expire at the end of 2010 however leanburn passenger vehicles are available that meet the emission standard consequently vehicles on the market qualify for the credit although many observers expect automakers to look for ways to reduce the emissions of such vehicles in future years so that the vehicles can qualify fuelcell vehicle purchase tax credit the energy policy act of 2005 provides tax credit for the purchase of fuelce ll vehicles the credit increases with gross vehicle weight as shown in table 1 passenger vehicles that achieve at least 50 better fuel economy than comparable conventional vehicle also qualify for an additional tax credit of between 1000 and 4000 depending on overall fuel economy the credit expires at the end of calendar year 2014 however b ecause of technical and cost concerns fuelcell vehicles are commercially available and the development of massmarket fuelcell vehicle in the near future seems unlikely table 2

fuel vehicle afv the new credit is equal to percentage of the incremental cost of the afv subject to certain maximum dollar amounts the incremental cost is the difference between the higher cost of the afv and its conventiona l counterpart under the act the applicable percentage is 50 of the incremental cost plus an additional 30 if the vehicle meets certain emissions requirements the maximum credit is based on the weight of the vehicle as shown in table 3 the credit expires at the end of 2010httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22351crs5 8 dualfuel vehicles can operate using either an alternative

maximum incremental cost is 5000 b maximum incremental cost is 10000 c maximum incremental cost is 25000 d maximum incremental cost is 40000 to qualify for the credit the vehicle is required to be dedicated afv meaning that it must not be capable of operating on c onventional fuel this provision is response to criticisms of previous afv policies that included dualfuel vehicles8 in many cases dualfuel vehicles operate solely on gasoline because some alternative fuels must be blended with small amount of gasoline eg ethanol methanol vehicles using these fuels qualify for prorated tax credit alternative fuel refueling infrastructure credit the energy policy act of 2005 replaces the existing deduction for the insta llation of alternative fuel infrastructure with tax credit the credit is equal to 30 of the purchase or installation cost of the refueling property subject to maximu m dollar amount for retail property the maximum credit is 30000 for residential pr operty the maximum is 1000 the credit expires after 2014 for hydrogen infrastructure the credit for all other fuels expires after 2009 table 4 summary of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicle tax incentives
