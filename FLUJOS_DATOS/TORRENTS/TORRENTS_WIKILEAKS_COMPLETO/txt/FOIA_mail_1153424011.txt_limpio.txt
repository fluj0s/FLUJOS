from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to caspar ammann ammannucaredu subject fwd re pseudoproxies for the climate reconstruction challenge date thu jul 20 153331 2006 cc philipbrohanmetofficegovuk i should also say caspar that ive not forwarded any documents to philip yet with more details about the challenge i thought that you should do that instead because you will have more likely kept track of where the latest version is cheers tim hi caspar i forgot to forward to you philip brohans positive response to my invitation for him to be involved in the production of pseudoproxy and pseudoinstrumental data for the climate reconstruction challenge it is copied below and you can find his contact details below too best wishes tim from philipbrohanmetofficegovuk subject re pseudoproxies for the climate reconstruction challenge to tim osborn tosbornueaacuk cc simontettmetofficegovuk keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk date thu 29 jun 2006 110854 0100 hi tim thanks for your notes from the workshop it sounds both interesting and very positive i was afraid that the relations between the participants would break down completely but youve clearly made good progress i think blind test of reconstruction methods is an excellent idea and im happy to support it in any capacity ive done this before with nuclear fuel performance models and the results were both alarming and instructive doing it properly wont be easy though i think several different stretches of model simulation will be required so yes volunteer to caspar or the organising committee to make pseudoproxy and pseudoinstrumental data philip on fri 20060623 at 1648 tim osborn wrote hi philip cc simon keith please read my reportback from wengen workshop first youll see that climate reconstruction challenge was suggested and that this would be blind test where participating groups would not know what the real answer is caspar ammann would provide and keep secret suitable model simulation but we discussed who should make the pseudoproxy data from the model output i wondered whether you philip would be interested in this given your experience with the instrumental error model and interest in statistical models for proxy error what do you think of this idea philip number of proxy people including us might liaise with you about how such an error model might be structured but ultimately we would not be allowed to know precise details about how you generated set of pseudoproxies otherwise we wouldnt be allowed to take part in the challenge ourselves would you be interested in participating in this challenge in this way and have time to do so it would preclude you from entering the challenge of course please let know and i will liaise with whoever else is involved in organising this challenge at least caspar but its not yet clear who else cheers tim philip brohan climate scientist met office hadley centre for climate prediction and research tel 44 01392 884574 fax 44 01392 885681 global climate data sets are available from 1httpwwwhadobsorg references 1 httpwwwhadobsorg
