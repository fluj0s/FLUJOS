updated january 8 2002 richard rowberg senior specialist in science and technology resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress commercial remote sensing by satellite status and issues summary since the late 1970s spurred by the launch of the nasa landsat satellites and later by the success of the french spot satellite congress has been taking steps to promote commercial remote sensing industry in the united states the land remote sensing act of 1992 coupled with presidential decision directive 23 in 1994 gave new impetus to the industry by permitting commercial companies to launch high resolution 1 meter or less remote sensing satellites while commercial satellite remote sensing industry has emerged however so far it has not been the success envisaged by its early proponents nevertheless the industry is growing and the images of the terrorist attack on the world trade center obtained by the ikonos 2 satellite operated by us company space imaging has recently given particular prominence to the industry the domestic industrys future however appears uncertain it has not turned profit and still depends largely on purchases of images by the federal government to remain in operation nevertheless congressional interest remains strong one relevant bill hr 2426 dealing with remote sensing applications has been introduced in the 107th congress to date competition from aerial remote sensing the slow development of market for remote sensing products outside local state and federal governments competition from governmentsubsidized foreign remote sensing satellites and regulations resulting from national security concerns are among other factors that have slowed the development of the u s commercial satellite remote sensing industry federal support for the industry is concentrated in the department of defenses dods national imagery and mapping agency nima and the national aeronautics and space administration nasa nima support however has been spotty because of funding limitations and dod actions that are limiting the need for imagery by nima from commercial satellites the industry is also creating national security benefits and challenges the us intelligence community is finding that commercial remote sensing images can supplement those of its own satellites at the same time the possibility that potential adversaries and terrorist groups may obtain access to sensitive images has resulted in federal regulations that restrict acquisition and publication of such images for national security and foreign policy reasons this shutter control provision is controversial and is likely to result in court challenge if and when it is invoked in the current situation in afghanistan the us government has avoided this possibility by contracting with space imaging private firm for exclusive rights to all images covering the operation enduring freedom area of operations future growth of the us industry will likely depend on steady and broadbased federal support development of new applications that result in an expanding market and resolution of regulatory uncertainties primarily the shutter control provisions contents introduction 1 background 1 satellite remote sensing technology applications and history 2 technology 2 applications 4 history 6 issues

remote sensing by satellite status and issues introduction background since the beginning of the space age observation of the earth remote sensing by satellite and humanoccupied space vehicles has played an important role in us and international space programs the earliest remote sensing satellites were used for national security purposes1 early on however space policy makers and others recognized the potential importance of remote sensing for civilian purposes such as environmental and climate monitoring such satellites began appearing in the early 1960s furthermore once these satellites were in operation many in the space community began advocating transferring responsibility for developing and operating civilian remote sensing satellites to the private sector this effort became the policy of the united states in 1979 and since then congressional and administrative action has attempted to implement that policy the land remotesensing commercialization act of 1984 pl98965 set out terms for transferring the governmentowned landsat satellite program to the private sector the land remote sensing policy act of 1992 pl102555 repealed the previous act declared commercialization of land remote sensing to be longterm policy goal of the united states and established procedures for licensing private remote sensing operators2 while commercial satellite remote sensing industry has emerged in the united states in recent years it has not been the success envisaged by its early proponents competition from aerial remote sensing aircraft and balloons the slow development of market for remote sensing products outside local state and federal governments competition from governmentsubsidized foreign remote sensing satellites and regulations resulting from national security concerns among other factors have slowed the development of heathy commercial satellite remote sensing industry commercial remote sensing industry has been established however and by all accounts is growing3 the images of the aftermath of the terrorist attack on the world trade center obtained by the ikonos 2 satellite operated by space imaging gave particular prominence to the existence of the commercial remote sensing industry in this country 1 remote sensing satellites for national security purposes are called reconnaissance satellites 2 pl 102555 sec 2 and sec 201 3 barnaby j feder birdseye views made to order new york times october 11 2001 sec f1 1 crs2 while the industry is growing however its future appears uncertain the industry has not turned profit and still depends largely on purchases of images by the federal government to remain in operation4 while action has been modest in the 107th congress to date congressional interest remains strong in the development of healthy commercial remote sensing industry5 this report presents review of the current status of the industry and an analysis of key issues that are likely to affect its future it begins with brief description of the technology of satellite remote sensing followed by brief review of the history of its development next the report examines three areas that encompass most of the important issues relating to the industrys development they are the commercial market potential and the role of the federal government as purchaser and provider of remote sensing images national security concerns about commercial remote sensing satellites and federal regulation of the industry finally the report presents discussion of policy considerations satellite remote sensing technology applications and history technology remote sensing is defined as any observation made at point removed from the object under investigation more commonly it refers to observations of areas of land and water covering the earth by airplane or satellite aerial remote sensing currently operates from altitudes of about 500 meters to 20 kilometers km with the latter being the domain of aircraft such as the u2 for national security purposes the range of operation for most spacecraft and satellite remote sensing is about 250 km to 1000 km with satellites close to the 1000 km level6 some remote sensing satellites also operate in geostationary orbit at 36000 km by the nature of that orbit these satellites remain over the same place on earth at all times remote sensing involves collecting an image of region on the earth by one of two means passive or active7 passive sensing which is the mode of operation of most remote sensing satellites today monitors the objects under investigation by using electrooptic sensors to collect solar radiation reflected off the object active sensing uses source of electromagnetic radiation usually radar carried on board the satellite these types of systems are discussed below 4 john c baker kevin m oconnell and ray williamson conclusions in commercial observation satellites ed by john c baker et arlington va and bethesda md rand and asprs 2000 559 5 to date one bill affecting the commercial remote sensing industry has been introduced that is hr 2426 the remote sensing applications act of 2001 6 paul j gibson introductory remote sensing principles and concepts london routledge 2000 2 7 most of the information in this section is based on material found in gibson introductory remote sensing 12126 crs3 the span of electromagnetic radiation spectrum from the sun used by passive remote sensing ranges from the familiar visible radiation to the near and thermal infrared not all of this spectrum will pass through the earths atmosphere however so sensors on remote sensing system have to be designed to receive those portions that can penetrate the atmosphere also not all of the radiation monitored by remote sensing satellite comes from reflections off the earths surface radiation is reflected off clouds and other particles in the atmosphere thereby giving these satellites the ability to monitor phenomena such as temperature and water vapor content at different atmospheric layers as for reflection off the surface the nature of the object from which the radiation reflects determines where in the spectrum it lies as result different surface features such as vegetation water rocks and populated areas have different spectral signatures in addition other factors such as the relative position of the sun and surface coverings such as snow affect that signature because of this behavior remote sensing systems can be designed for detailed study of many aspects and characteristics of the planet and its atmosphere remote sensing sensors are generally classified as panchromatic pan or multispectral ms the former produce data in black and white while the latter produce data in color ms sensors record images that provide the means to identify and study characteristics of different surface features these sensors usually include portions of the spectrum in both the visible and infrared regimes recently hyperspectral sensors have been developed that divide up the spectrum into many more smaller bands than ms sensors for even more detailed characterization of surface features the first remote sensing satellites recorded images on film all current satellites use digital systems to record the images and have many advantages over film systems in particular digital image data can be transmitted to groundbased stations and digital data are able to be processed on computers an important feature of remote sensing systems is resolution there are four measures of resolution spectral resolution which is measure of the narrowness of the spectral band that can be determined temporal resolution which measures the frequency at which data of the same region can be obtained radiometric resolution which measures how many levels of gray can be determined on black and white image and spatial resolution the latter gives the smallest dimension an object can have and still be distinguished from other objects it is the measure usually cited when characterizing remote sensing satellite the ikonos 2 satellite has spatial resolution of 082 meters for pan images and four meters for ms images8 spatial resolution is primarily dependent on the optical system used to collect the reflected radiation temporal resolution or revisit time is an important feature of remote sensing satellites along with the area of ground that can be observed at any given instant the lower the orbit the shorter the revisit period lower orbits however also reduce the area of ground that can be covered by using sensors that can look both forward and 8 frank sietzen jr advanced imagery raises the aerospace america sept 2001 39 crs4 back from the satellite particular point on the surface can be observed much more frequently than by the revisit rate the other type of remote sensing active systems primarily use radar as the source of electromagnetic radiation radar has two major advantages over reflected solar radiation it can penetrate cloud cover and it can be used at night because it does not depend on the sun active systems therefore can make observations that cannot be made by passive systems radar observations however are more complex and costly than passive systems and have been slower to develop advances in radar imaging technology however have increased interest in these systems in recent years in particular synthetic aperture radar sar greatly increases resolution along the path of the satellite azimuthal resolution by increasing the effective size of the radar antenna the effective increase is well beyond the practical limit of conventional antenna the improvement is so great that all recent and proposed radar remote sensing satellites are using or will use sar one application of sar is the use of radar to determine variations in surface elevation in addition to technologies for obtaining images very important aspect of remote sensing is the processing of the raw images to facilitate the analysis and application of the data this socalled valueadded step consists primarily of the development and application of software to analyze the content of the images because the latter are in digital format much of this processing is done with the use of computers one example is the combination of raw images with geographic information systems gis to enable the updating of gis databases with remote sensing data9 in addition to computer software human expertise in interpreting remote sensing images is an important component of this valueadded step applications applications of satellite remote sensing are varied and growing10 the type of application varies primarily with the portion of the spectrum that can be observed by sensor by the spatial resolution of that sensor and by whether the sensors are passive or use radar most current satellites carry range of sensors so that they can perform variety of applications small but growing number of remote sensing satellites however are single purpose systems satellites with low spatial resolution over one kilometer km are generally used for collecting meteorological and environmental data an example is the noaa meteorological satellite series operating in an orbit of 855 km using multispectral sensor with resolution of 11 km meteorological data include monitoring cloud cover climate change and the atmosphere rainfall storm events and the oceans the hole in the ozone layer over antarctica was first observed by the nimbus 7 satellite in the early 1970s environmental observations include vegetation assessment monitoring of natural hazards primarily major weather events and geology the last 9 kevin oconnell and beth lachman from space imagery to information commercial remote sensing market factors and trends commercial observation satellites 64 10 much of this section is largely based on material found in gibson introductory remote sensing 127150 crs5 item includes large area mapping including entire continents and the use of thermal infrared data for monitoring volcanos medium resolution satellites less than 100 m are used primarily for environmental monitoring and range of other applications including military observations and mapping of urban areas an example of these satellites is the landsat series the first five in the series were launched and operated by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the sixth was destroyed in launch failure landsat 7 was built and launched by nasa and is now operated by the united states geological survey usgs of the department of interior which maintains web site with information about the satellite and products available from it httplandsat7usgsgovabouthtml landsat 7 operates in 705 km orbit and is equipped with an 8band etm enhanced thematic mapper plus sensor one band of the etm provides 15 m pan data six bands provide 30 m data in the visible near and short waveinfrared bands and one band provides 60 m data in the thermal infrared band landsat 5 which was launched in 1984 and is still operating has two sensors one is 7band multispectral thematic mapper providing 30 m data in the visible near infrared middle infrared and far infrared bands the other is 4band multispectral scanner mss providing 80 m data in the visible and near infrared bands11 it also is now operated by usgs environmental applications of landsat data include monitoring ocean and other marine conditions such as thermal pollution mapping of vegetation properties such as crop health and the mapping of geological features such as faults it was landsat satellite that detected thermal plume in chernobyl lake giving the world the first notice of the 1986 accident at the soviet nuclear reactor because the revisit time of these satellites is relatively long several days their ability to study the effects of pollution is limited in another category landsat and the french satellite spot were used during the gulf war to monitor oil field fires in kuwait and other events of military interest high resolution remote sensing satellites 10 m and less are relatively recent the ikonos 2 satellite owned and operated by the us company space imaging was launched in 1999 and has 082 m pan sensor and 4 m ms sensor recently india launched 1 m pan satellite and several other countries are operating or planning launches of high resolution remote sensing satellites12 range of mapping applications are possible with these satellites including city planning transportation and development planning property marketing and pollution monitoring these satellites also offer increased potential for national security applications ikonos 2 is being used by the us military in the current war in afghanistan in addition images from that satellite were used extensively by the media following the september 11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon range of other national security applications including force monitoring and treaty verification are envisaged for these high resolution satellites the final category is radar imaging this category is currently represented by few satellites using synthetic aperture radar sar sensors including canadas 11 nasa landsatd prime prelaunch mission operation report report e6688402 february 21 1984 p 1115 prior to launch landsat 5 was named landsatd prime 12 see frank sietzen jr aerospace america 39 for list crs6 radarsat1 with an 8 m sar system the special characteristics of radar sensing make it useful for meteorological environmental and mapping applications in the case of weather wind speed and ocean wave height can be measured images of surface texture that can be obtained using radar make possible observations of oil slicks land and sea ice and ocean currents among other things topological measurements are also possible because of the ability of radar sensing to determine changes in surface height information on deforestation crop growth and hydrological processes particularly in regions with extensive cloud cover can be obtained with radar systems applications of remote sensing are many and varied with the growth of high resolution sensors they should expand into areas currently within the purview of aerial remote sensing how competitive satellite remote sensing will be and whether it can capture significant portion of the commercial market such as mineral and petroleum exploration and real estate development remains to be seen this issue will be discussed more fully below history remote sensing by satellite began in 1960 with the corona project series of highresolution satellites used for surveillance of the soviet union these satellites operated at low orbits 150450 km and used cameras to obtain photographic images13 also in 1960 the united states launched the first weather satellite tiros1 its purpose was to provide early warning of major storms in 1972 the first earth monitoring satellite earth resources technology satellite erts1 was launched the purpose of erts1 was to gather information about agricultural and environmental conditions this satellite was renamed landsat 1 and was the first of three satellites that made up the first landsat generation landsat 13 landsat 1 2 and 3 carried two scientific instruments return beam vidicon rbv camera and multispectral scanner mss on landsat 1 and 2 the rbv camera had resolution of 7080 m on landsat 3 it was 2640 m the mss on landsat 1 and 2 scanned in four visible wavelengths fifth band for measuring thermal infrared radiation was added to landsat 3 mss resolution was 80 meters for the first four bands and 240 m for the fifth band14 in 1982 the first of second generation landsat series was launched landsat 4 an identical spacecraft landsat 5 was launched in 1984 these satellites each had 30 m thematic mappers and 80 m msss described earlier landsat 6 was launched in 1993 but was lost when its launch vehicle failed the most recent member of the series landsat 7 was launched in 1999 landsat 5 and landsat 7 are both currently operating 13 the corona project ended in 1972 the images were declassified in 1995 and made available to the public gibson introductory remote sensing 67 for detailed history of corona see dwayne day etal eye in the sky the story of the corona spy satellites smithsonian press washington 1998

prepared by the congressional research services 98th congress 1st session washington us govt print off may 1983 p222223 crs7 the first three landsat satellites were built and launched by nasa and they were operated by nasa until 1979 at that point management was transferred to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa of the department of commerce with the hope that commercial remote sensing industry would develop15 noaa also assumed responsibility for developing landsat 4 and 5 the early landsat program did much to show the value of remote sensing and fostered the development of private sector firms dedicated to extracting useful information from the landsat images for commercial purposes16 in 1984 congress passed the land remotesensing commercialization act of 1984 pl98965 the act enabled the establishment of the earth observing satellite corporation eosat which assumed operational responsibility for the existing landsat satellites and with federal assistance through noaa was to develop and operate landsat 6 and 7 dispute ensued about the funding of the new landsat systems and only landsat 6 was built under the noaaeosat arrangement much of the dispute revolved around whether public or private use of the landsat data should have primacy17 there were also concerns about whether federal contributions to the landsat program would be adequate to ensure its continuity and whether there was adequate demand to support the satellites in the private market pressure built up in the early 1990s to return landsat operation to the federal government in 1992 the land remote sensing policy act of 1992 was passed which repealed the 1984 act and transferred responsibility for the landsat system to nasa and the department of defense dod from noaa and eosat18 one of the important goals of this legislation was to ensure continuity of landsat data soon after this legislation was passed dod withdrew from the arrangement19 landsat 7 which was developed and launched by nasa as part of its earth observing system eos program is now operated by usgs usgs also operates landsat 5 the only other operating landsat satellite in addition to the landsat series other civilian remote sensing satellites have been launched since the early 1980s the most well known of these are the three spot satellites spot 1 spot 2 and spot 4 launched in 1986 1990 and 1998 respectively20 these satellites were developed and are operated by spot image french company each of these satellites have 10m pan and 20 m ms sensors 15 for further discussion of the early history of

and the development of commercial remote sensing commercial observation satellites 40 17 ibid 43 18 as noted above this action did not change federal policy in support of commercial remote sensing industry rather it recognized the possibility that such an industry would take longer to develop than was believed in the early 1980s 19 for further discussion of this period in remote sensing policy

spot 3 was launched in 1993 but ceased operation in 1996 crs8 fifth satellite spot 5 with 25 m pan and 10 m ms sensors is planned for launch in 2002 spot was the first commercial remote sensing satellite and helped fuel optimism about the development of strong commercial remote sensing market in the early 1990s21 most recently ikonos 2 developed by space imaging was launched as noted it supplied images of the september 11 attack on the world trade center and currently supplies images of the war in afghanistan22 after two failures digitalglobe formerly earth watch successfully launched quickbird in october 2001 which has both pan and ms sensors23 another company orbimage suffered launch failure with its orbview 4 satellite in 2001 in addition to these satellites other countries have or are planning to launch high resolution remote sensing satellites in addition to india joint usisraeli venture successfully launched 18 meter pan satellite eros 1a in december 2000 and several other countries have recently launched or are planning to launch over the next few years high resolution remote sensing satellites24 issues commercial market potential and government role as noted above development of healthy commercial satellite remote sensing industry has been longterm goal of the federal government while attempts to create such market by the commercialization of landsat in the 1980s were not successful several factors led to new attempt in the 1990s these factors included the emergence of lowercost access to space the use of commercial remote sensing data during the gulf war expansion of satellite remote sensing by foreign governments growth in sales from spot and concern about the health of the us aerospace industry following the end of the cold war25 this interest culminated in presidential decision directive 23 pdd23 issued on march 24 1994 which set forth guidelines for anyone applying for remote sensing satellite operating license under the 1992 remote sensing act these guidelines cover any activity that involves foreign access to images technology and systems26 the intent of the directive was to clear up uncertainties about license conditions that had existed since the 1992 act one feature of the directive was that the federal government would have the right to limit for national security reasons licensees satellite observations this shutter control provision has been controversial and will be discussed more fully below 21 kevin oconnell and beth lachman commercial observation satellites 69 22 ikonos images can be seen on

56 26 see httpwwwfasorgirpoffdocspdd232htm crs9 with the issuance of pdd23 the number of license applications grew significantly at least 11 licenses have been granted by the us department of commerce since 1994 including those for three satellites that are now operating ikonos 2 microlab 1 orbview1 and seastar orbview227 the latter two satellites were developed by orbimage division of orbital sciences corporation osc three other satellites granted licenses were launched but failed to achieve operational status they were earlybird launched in 1997 and quickbird 1 launched in 2000 both were developed by earth watch now digitalglobe in the first case the satellite achieved orbit but lost power five days after launch in the second case the satellite failed to reach orbit as noted new satellite quickbird was successfully launched in 2001 in september 2001 orbview4 developed by orbimage was launched but failed to reach orbit this satellite had 1 meter pan 4 meter ms and an 8 meter hyperspectral hs sensor suite28 in addition to regulating domestic commercial remote sensing satellites the us government is the largest customer of images from those satellites acting at the direction of congress the major users of these images nasa and the national imagery and mapping agency nima of the department of defense dod established programs to support the development of commercial remote sensing industry29 nasa purchases commercial imagery to supplement data obtained from its own satellites for many years the commercial remote sensing project now the earth science applications directorate at stennis space center had responsibility for these purchases as part of nasas applications program while stennis remains the primary purchaser of remote sensing data for applications other nasa offices and centers now are involved in such purchases to support their scientific activities nima has created commercial imagery program to help industry develop capabilities to provide it with products to assist its mapping mission in addition nima has established contracts with several remote sensing firms for the purchase of image products and services in both cases actions are being taken by the agencies to support the development of commercial industry that can be relied upon as steady supplier of imagery despite the optimism and federal activities described above the outlook for commercial remote sensing is uncertain currently annual worldwide revenues are estimated to be from 300 million to 2 billion depending on what is included the higher figure includes all analytical and consultant services provided in addition to the raw images at present commercial remote sensing satellite owner is profitable30 27 microlab 1 is operated by orbital sciences corporation osc but carries instruments for experiments funded by nasa and nsf seastar is also operated by osc and carries nasa instrument seawifs designed to monitor ocean conditions osc retains the rights to the data however and is marketing information on ocean fishing locations 28 as result of the failure orbimage filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy orbimage announces financial restructuring following launch failure aerospace daily sept 26 2001 3 29 pl 105303 sec 107 for provisions about nasa 30 barnaby j feder new york times f1 crs10 there appear to be several reasons for the current uncertain state of the industry image prices are relatively high which has restrained demand particularly from smaller users such as academic researchers local governments and small businesses that might have need for high resolution images evidence to date suggests strong price sensitivity in the market31 second aerial remote sensing continues to present stiff competition particularly as it adopts new technologies that enable lower cost higher resolution digital images currently aerial remote sensing makes up about 90 of the commercial remote sensing market32 third factor is the level of value added services that facilitate the application of remote sensing images given the limited expertise in interpreting and assessing remote sensing images by many potential uses such valueadded services will be crucial to the future of the remote sensing industry similar situation existed with the development of geographic information systems gis as gis technologies matured processes were developed that made them easier to use and consequently resulted in an expanded market33 the natural connection between remote sensing imagery and gis may be an important stimulus in developing remote sensing markets fourth factor is the role of the federal government as purchaser of images in particular for various reasons the nima strategy described above does not appear to be providing the stimulus hoped for in recent review of that strategy nima officials reaffirmed the agencys desire for robust spacebased remote sensing capability but also stated that it does not have the funds to buy as much commercial imagery as it desires34 this lack of funds has hurt the industry which was counting on strong support from the federal government in the form of purchases of products and services without such support industry officials claim it will be hard to raise the capital needed to build and launch the next generation of commercial remote sensing satellites which includes 05 m resolution pan system planned for 200435 others argue that nima does not have adequate resources to process and disseminate the images it already receives and will receive from the national reconnaissance office nro and other sources in the next several years36 as consequence these analysts suggest that it is not reasonable to expect that more funds should be added to the nima budget to buy more images37 at the same time these observers note that the commercial remote sensing industry has not expanded its 31 ibid f7 32 nick jonson make or break year for

space news july 23 2001 13 crs11 commercial market enough to be able to survive without substantial purchases from nima others while acknowledging nimas situation suggest that nima should look to the commercial remote sensing industry for the technologies products and services that can assist with processing and dissemination rather than more images38 they note that rapid advances are being made in spatial imagerelated technologies primarily in commercial market and that nima should take advantage of these changes furthermore they argue that it is not certain that the commercial remote sensing industry needs substantial federal investment to survive but rather the us government should offer clear commitment and stick with it 39 while nasa acting at the direction of congress pl105303 also has adopted strategy of supporting commercial remote sensing its support of the industry is likely to be significantly smaller than nimas the requirements of nasas earth science enterprise which is responsible for the agencys remote sensing activities are typically very specialized and require sensors that are not usually found on commercial satellites for example nasa is interested in measuring climate parameters such as atmospheric water vapor temperatures and wind speeds for its study of global climate change in the cases where nasa is using commercial remote sensing data the satellites are carrying specially designed nasa instruments other federal agencies also use remote sensing data in report recently released by the senate governmental affairs committee subcommittee on international security proliferation and federal services it was reported that of 19 civilian agencies polled 15 used remote sensing data in some form40 the agencies also expressed concern about their ability to use such data as effectively as they would like in particular they cited high costs of commercial data processing and analysis and lack of technology and trained personnel to fully exploit imagery in addition to purchasing commercial remote sensing images the federal government also markets images and may act as competitor to the commercial industry landsat 7 operated by usgs makes available its images to the public at cost some claim that the availability of landsat 7 images at cost has helped expand the potential market for remote sensing data41 the availability of raw images from landsat also appears to help the commercial remote sensing industry by forcing users of landsat images to go to commercial valueadded firms for processing and analysis recently however usgs has proposed offering levels of enhancement as well as the raw data42 many valueadded firms argue that such actions would be harmful to their 38 kevin m oconnell the problem without commercial imagery

continued crs12 segment of the industry43 and that the 1992 land remote sensing act restricts the sale of landsat images to unenhanced data debate is developing over who should build and operate the next landsat mission in order to ensure continuity of landsat data nasa has stated that new satellite the landsat data continuity mission will likely be needed by the end of the decade when the design life of landsat 7 is complete currently nasa has stated that it wants that followon mission to be financed built and operated by private company44 in addition the 1992 land remote sensing act the 1998 commercial space act and the 2000 nasa authorization act express preference for commercial landsat data continuity mission several remote sensing advocates in the private sector also support private landsat 7 followon45 these preferences are based on the belief that privately owned landsat will best promote the policy of developing commercial remote sensing industry and that imagery from such system will cost less to the federal government others however argue that this landsat followon mission should be built by nasa they point out that at workshop held by nasa on the continuity mission it was the consensus of commercial remote sensing image providers at the meeting that there was insufficient promise of an adequate financial return from landsat 7 followon to justify private investment46 in addition members of the valueadded segment of the industry in attendance argued that privately owned landsat that could set prices for images as it chose could prove detrimental47 they noted that the availability of landsat 7 data at cost has been very helpful in stimulating growth of the valueadded segment the us government is also influencing the development of the commercial remote sensing industry through its regulation in particular the possibility that the federal government may impose restrictions on what licensee can observe and transmit has added measure of uncertainty to the market while shutter control has not been invoked to date the possibility may create concern on the part of potential commercial purchasers of remote sensing imagery that they may lose access to those images during times of national emergency fifth factor is the effect of foreign competition in addition to the french indian and israeli launches mentioned above several other foreign remote sensing satellites are either operating or are planned to be launched within the next several 42 continued september 10 2001 4 43 ibid 44 warren ferster following landsat 7 nasa wants

commercial remote sensing satellites competition from these entities is likely to be substantial and could seriously hinder the growth of domestic commercial industry it is clear that while the market for commercial remote sensing is growing there is little expectation that the industry will be profitable anytime soon non governmental applications have been slower to develop than anticipated and competition from aerial remote sensing and foreign competitors is substantial it is possible that the new generation of 1 meter pan or better satellites may provide the stimulus needed to develop new profitable applications until that happens however the economic future of the industry is uncertain national security and commercial satellites commercial remote sensing satellites offer both benefits and concerns for national security the us government has made and is making extensive use of these satellites in variety of national securityrelated activities in addition to those noted above us intelligence officials are purchasing commercial images to supplement those obtained from their own satellites although the latter have much higher resolution they are spread thin and the highest resolution is not always necessary49 furthermore costs of processing commercial images are generally less than obtaining images from intelligence satellites and the commercial satellites are often in better position because of greater coverage in another action immediately after the start of bombing in afghanistan nima contracted with space imaging for exclusive rights to all images taken by ikonos 2 of the operation enduring freedom area of operations50 nima signed 30day contract in october 2001 which was extended for another 30 days in november51 under the contract nima approved what if any images could be released for public use in related move dod requested 1 billion to purchase commercial satellite imagery from the 40 billion emergency funding package approved by congress following the september 11 terrorist attacks52 nevertheless risks remain about the growing presence of high resolution commercial remote sensing satellites indeed the existence of these risks appears to be major reason for nimas action in contracting for exclusive rights to the ikonos 2 images from afghanistan potential adversaries could use remote sensing imagery to determine us military preparations and operations53 they could also use such 48 see frank sietzen jr aerospace america 39 for list 49 barnaby j feder new york times f7 50 shutter control aviation week space technology

security implications of commercial satellite continued crs14 imagery to facilitate military actions against another state or against insurgent groups within their borders while terrorist organizations could in principle use remote sensing imagery it may not provide much added value to information it can obtain in other ways more critical concern is the possibility that commercial remote sensing could be used by terrorists to compromise us counter terrorism moves54 there is also the risk that access to commercial remote sensing imagery may permit adversaries or related groups to devise ways to limit the effectiveness of us efforts to use remote sensing to monitor their activities in the near term these risks do not appear to be as serious as they are likely to be in the longer term55 at present most countries in currently sensitive areas do not have the capabilities for processing and analyzing remote sensing images required to make full use of their potential other nearterm factors that may limit national security risks are that short turn around access less than 24 hours is not likely to be available to nonsatellite nations for several years extensive cloud cover limits the value of conventional remote sensing in many areas and processing technology for making full use of remote sensing imagery may be many years off recent announcement by the gulf cooperation council group of arab states in the persian gulf region that they are exploring the possibility of purchasing their own remote sensing satellite suggests however that some of these mitigating factors may be eliminated or greatly reduced relatively soon56 in addition technological advances such as the penetration of high resolution radar satellites and more automated image processing will help overcome some of the other factors the expansion of foreign remote sensing systems could present the united states with significant national security risks should that happen it may be necessary to consider options to neutralize as much of the risk as possible such actions however would have to be weighed against harm that could come about by reducing the potential national security benefits of increased accessibility to high resolution remote sensing satellites in particular as many analysts have suggested such systems could make the planet more transparent leading to world where malevolent intentions are more easily observed and thwarted and thus they could possibly act as significant deterrent to conflict57 an indirect national security concern could arise as result of misuse of remote sensing imagery by individuals and organizations that are not adequately trained to interpret those images interpreting remote sensing images is difficult and involves detection identification measurement and analysis without proper equipment or 53 continued imagery commercial observation satellites 116 54 ibid 117 55 ibid 120125 56 warren ferster and gopal ratnam

interpretation of images can result particularly if they are somewhat ambiguous in the first place58 differences of opinion even contentious debate could develop over competing interpretations of their meaning such debates can have implications for national security because many times they are about images of objects of military significance that are the basis of proposed foreign policy or other actions examples include satellite images of longrange missile development in north korea and nuclear weapons testing in pakistan and india59 if the debates are the result of misinterpretation by untrained analysts they could create credibility problems with the imaging process and undermine us foreign policy these concerns could be mitigated by cooperative arrangements between experienced and newer untrained users of remote sensing images this cooperation could be particularly beneficial for the news media and nongovernmental organizations regulation and commercial remote sensing shutter control the land remote sensing act of 1992 is the basis for regulation by the federal government of the commercial remote sensing industry60 according to the 1992 act license must be granted before an entity can begin operating remote sensing satellite the licensee must protect us national security observe international obligations of the united states make raw images available at reasonable cost to the governments of the lands observed and notify the secretary of commerce of any significant international agreements entered into by the licensee the act also prohibits use of remote sensing to gather transmit or deliver defense related information for the benefit of any foreign government or to publish photographs of defense facilities as noted above presidential decision directive 23 pdd23 was issued in 1994 to specify the policy of the clinton administration towards commercial remote sensing the directive allows the secretary of commerce to limit image collection and distribution by licensed remote sensing satellites for national security reasons the socalled shutter control provision the policy outlined in pdd23 also promotes the remote sensing industry and provides for low cost access to the images for the united states there remains ambiguity and uncertainty in the remote sensing industry about the current regulatory framework governing commercial remote sensing in this country rules implementing the act have taken over eight years from its enactment to develop with an interim final rule published in july 2000 an attempt was made to clarify the regulations during the 105th congress but amendments to the 1992 act were included in the commercial space act of 1998 pl105303 the 1998 act did however reiterate congresss intent that the federal government pursue opportunities to purchase commercial remote sensing imagery when possible 58 john c baker new users and established experts bridging the knowledge gap in interpreting commercial satellite imagery commercial observation satellites 542 59 ibid 534 543 60 the discussion in this section is based primarily on bob preston space remote sensing regulatory landscape commercial observation satellites 501 crs16 at issue in the regulations is whether the doctrine of prior restraint shutter control can be used to limit actions by remote sensing entities and whether restrictions can be imposed based on foreign policy considerations in the first case the debate centers on whether there is adequate justification for regulations that prevent the publication of images prior to any event that may justify that action some argue that concerns that national security could be endangered by publication of such images may not be sufficient to justify the use of prior restraint they argue that it is necessary to prove that application of shutter control would prevent the loss of life before prior restraint regulation could be established others argue that national security considerations are sufficient and that the use of prior restraint is justified even if the level of danger cannot be specified in advance there is also debate about whether the act authorizes the use of foreign policy concerns as justification for shutter control prohibiting the acquisition and publishing of remote sensing images of sensitive areas pdd23 does include foreign policy along with national security as justification for shutter control some have argued that the term foreign policy in this context is too vague and more precise expression is needed these observers suggest the basis for shutter control should be protection of international obligations when harm is possible if images are obtained and published the crux of this issue is how to balance the seemingly conflicting goals of promoting commercial remote sensing industry while also protecting national security the difficult regulatory challenge is to prevent inappropriate use of remote sensing in gathering information on national security sites for possible adversary without excessively hindering legitimate commercial operation while prior restraint through the application of shutter control would likely achieve the first goal its application could cause severe financial harm for the entity targeted as noted above however the us government has taken another path in the current situation in afghanistan by contracting with space imaging for exclusive rights to the ikonos 2 images this has the advantage of preserving the commercial livelihood of the firm while denying access to potentially critical images by adversaries of the united states it also has the advantage of avoiding likely court challenge over the legality of using prior restraint in establishing shutter control the action has not been spared criticism however as some have claimed the move is more to control information flow to the public than to assure access to strategic images61 whether such commercial actions can be taken in all cases where shutter control might be invoked seems problematic if not there does not appear to be any other option than prior restraint even then court challenge is likely furthermore as the number of highresolution remote sensing satellites outside the control of the unites states grows the application of shutter control or exclusive purchase contracts will become less and less effective in preventing unwanted access to sensitive images 61 pamela hess united press international october 12 2001 crs17 policy and conclusions to date federal policy directed at facilitating the development of strong commercial remote sensing industry appears to have had mixed success while an industry exists its future appears uncertain there are at least three options that might improve the outlook should that remain national policy goal they are federal investment applications development and regulatory stability it seems clear that federal investment in the industry at some level is likely to be required for an indefinite period while the primary source of this support is now nasa nima and the intelligence community congress may wish to encourage expansion of that base to other agencies such as the departments of agriculture interior and transportation as noted in the discussion about nimas role such support may be most beneficial if it includes processing and interpretive services as well as the collection of imagery in that way the important valueadded sector of the industry would also receive assistance some observers have argued that an important condition for such investment is that it focus on the missions of the funding agencies and not be set up primarily to develop the industry62 in related matter congress may wish to reexamine the landsat data continuity mission while there appear to be strong arguments supporting private sector development depending on the state of the industry when the satellite is needed private development may not be practical it may be necessary for nasa to provide some or all of the funding for the project if it is to be built in timely manner arguments by segments of the remote sensing industry suggest such situation would still be beneficial whatever decision is made it appears important that the system maximize support for the industry while maintaining broad public access to images congress may also wish to expand its consideration of applications development perhaps even more important than federal investment is the development of remote sensing applications that would drive an expanded market the valueadded and applications research component of the us commercial remote sensing industry is an important reason for the us lead in this industry to maintain that lead it will be important that industry is encouraged to continue to seek innovative applications applications that would permit small users that do not possess the technology or resources of large users such as nima to make full use of the potential offered by these images may be of particular importance congress may wish to provide funds to relevant agencies to support research and development for new remote sensing applications that could be of value to state and local governments and to non governmental organizations63 the remote sensing applications act of 2001 hr2426 sponsored by rep udall and introduced on june 28 2001 would direct nasa to establish program of grants for pilot projects to explore the integrated use of sources of remote sensing and other geospatial information to address state local regional and tribal agency needs 62 kevin m oconnell space news 63 space enterprise council promote competitive us commercial remote sensing industry us chamber of commerce washington dc july 2001 crs18 in recent report the national research council nrc of the national academies found that there were several gaps that must be bridged if effective civilian applications of remote sensing were to be developed64 included were the gaps between raw remote sensing data and useful information between the expertise of experienced suppliers and users of remote sensing data and potential new users and between the acquisition cost of raw remote sensing data and the cost of products that permit full utilization of that data to address these gaps and enhance applications development the nrc made several recommendations among them are that nasas earth science enterprise develop costbenefit analyses of range of remote sensing applications and the costs of implementing those applications that nasa noaa the department of agriculture and usgs provide funds to develop training materials and courses for new users of remote sensing data that nasa noaa usgs and other relevant civilian agencies support remote sensing applications research that data producers establish mechanisms to obtain feedback and advice from the user community and that data standards and protocols be established much of the responsibility for developing such applications for the commercial sector however will likely fall on the industry itself one observer has suggested that partnerships between companies that operate satellites and those that provide the valueadded services may be helpful in this connection65 development of applications and processing that reduce the cost of using imagery and take advantage of the unique contribution of satellite remote sensing will be particularly important congress may also wish to consider ways to improve the regulatory environment stable regulatory environment appears to be important for future growth of the commercial remote sensing industry while concern has been expressed about the current ambiguity in regulatory procedures that uncertainty has not prevented the issuing of several licenses since 1994 nevertheless uncertainty is not conducive to long term growth of the industry the key factor is the application of shutter control if shutter control is invoked it seems important that it be done in way that minimizes disruption by offering alternatives if possible and that clearly spells out the reasons for the constraints some have also suggested that foreign policy not be used as reason for invoking shutter control but rather specific reference should be made to protection of us diplomatic forces installations and operations66 while this change would provide more specific basis for applying shutter control it may leave out important national considerations that involve broader definition of foreign policy such as meeting international obligations regulatory stability is also likely to be important when considering emerging technologies in particular as hyperspectral and synthetic aperture radar sar sensors gain in resolution they may pose new regulatory challenges because of their capabilities with respect to national security considerations currently the united states limits commercial sar resolution to 5 meters foreign sar systems such as canadas proposed radarsat 2 however are planned with higher resolution and 64 the national research council the national academies transforming remote sensing data into information and applications washington dc december 2001 65 nick jonson aerospace daily 66 bob preston commercial observation satellites 521 crs19 maintaining the 5 meter limit may hinder us competitiveness in this area regulatory scheme that recognizes the realities of the international market may be necessary the commercial remote sensing industry has not developed as rapidly as proponents hoped furthermore the us lead in commercial remote sensing may be threatened by growing foreign competition nevertheless an international commercial remote sensing industry is reality and is changing the way many government and nongovernment entities approach geospatial and intelligence matters as pointed out by the authors of commercial observation satellites this presence appears to be ushering in an age of global transparency as sensor resolution and the technology for processing and interpreting data improves this transparency will grow any congressional actions to address the future of us commercial remote sensing likely will have to address the ramifications of these international transparency and competition realities for other
