insurance corporation fdic insured commercial and savings institutions declined by 402 billion 276 between 2006 and year end 2007 some fourth quarter data were worse than they were during the 2001

2008 is expected to fall short of 2007 the industry in addition continues to be more concentrated with fewer small banking institutions which could lead to higher prices for bank services smaller banks are less able to garner cheaper funds for lending from wholesale markets and are less able to mitigate their credit and interest rate risks through participation in securitization and syndication markets even though the subprime crisis has more limiting effect on large institutions access to funding smaller banks remain more vulnerable to the increased indebtedness of borrowers and stricter lending requirements the three largest banking institutions have assets in the range of 1 trillion each their combined assets represent 30 of fdicinsured bank assets the next four banks hold another 13 of these assets and the top 25 banks hold more than 50 of the assets of fdicinsured banks looking at the situation from the other side the bottom 7000 commercial banks held only about 15 of the assets of th top 86 commercial banks at the end of 2007 mainly because of mergers and acquisitions at the end of 2007 there were 148 fewer commercial and savings institutions than there were at the end of 2006 even though many smaller institutions were not active in the subprime and the derivative markets they traditionally have higher levels of noncurrent assets to total assets ratios than larger institutions now that the subprime problem has br ought an enormous rise in noncurrent assets ratios to the larger institutions the overall noncurrent assets ratios are rapidly approaching the level of the 2001 recession furthermore despite the overall growth in deposits in the banking system deposits at smaller institutions continue to decline as deposits at the larger banks continue to grow between december 31 2006 and december 31 2007 deposits at large commercial banks grew 110 and those at small commercial banks declined 50 similarly while deposits grew at large savings institutions they declined for the smaller savings institutions in the fourth quarter of 2007 the data suggest that deposits at larger institutions are growing at slower rate than in the fourth quarter of 2006 while deposits continue to decline at smaller institutions this report will be updated as developments warrant

third quarter of 2008 the banking industry continues to be profitable despite the increasing number of bank failures ending september 30 2008 federal deposit insurance corporation fdicinsured depository institutions reported net income of 326 billion which is dramatic drop from the 1007 billion the industry earned in the first three quarters of 2007 for the 2008 third quarter net income was only17 billion decline of 274 billion 94 from the third quarter of 2007 in 2007 there were three bank failures as oppose to 25 so far in 2008 including the largest bank to fail in us history washington mutual bank with assets totaling 307 billion besides the subprime mortgage foreclosure turmoil that began in the second half of 2005 slower economic growth since then has increased bank exposure to credit risk causing their reluctance to expand lending at the same time the price of bank equity main determinant of bank capital has been rapidly declining as investors lost confidence in financial institutions the combination of disappearing capital and declining value of bank assets has led to increased bank insolvencies another critical determinant of the condition of the banking industry in the direction and pace of economy growth the economic expansion since 2001 has been key to the profitability of the industry the national bureau of economic research recent declaration that the us economy has been in recession since december 2007 would explain the decline in bank profits for six years in row starting in 2001 profits in the us banking industry have broken records profitability peaked in 2007 which coincided with the peak in the economic growth 1 economic expansions increase bank lending just as economic contraction reduces opportunities for lending growth in 2007 real gross domestic product gdp grew at 56 in the first quarter but only 34 for entire the year and the forecast for 2008 is for about 17 growth the declared recession is expected to increase the industrys exposure to credit risk as bank customers become less able to meet their financial obligations due to rising unemployment by the third quarter of 2008 the industrys profits had fallen to 326 billion this decline began in the second quarter of 2007 roughly year and half after the foreclosure turmoil started in august 2005 for the first three quarters of 2007 the industry reported net income of 1007 billion which was 117 billion 10 less than it earned in the first three quarters of 2006 that was the second quarter in row of lower net income with fewer than half the banks reported an increase in net income the average return on assets roa for the first three quarters of 2007 was 092 down considerably from the 133 in the first three quarters of 2006 by the third quarter of 2008 the average roa declined to 033 as shown in table 1 the decline in earnings was due primarily to increased provisions for loan losses and increased noninterest expenses partly related to the subprime mortgage crisis 2 the fourth quarter of 2007 generated net income of only 58 billion it was the lowest since 1991 in the 2001 recession the return on assets roa for the industry was 116 table 1 shows that on september 30 2008 the average roa had fallen 83 basis points below what it was during the 2001 recession 1 on december 1 2008 the national bureau of economic research announced that the united states economy has been in recession since december of 2007 marking the end of the of the march 2001 to december 2007 economic expansion 2 for detailed analyses of the subprime crisis see crs report

lowinterestrate environment that has held since 2001 despite the federal reserve boards feds policy of raising and lowering interest rates since then specifically mortgage lending and noninterest income were the major contributors to the profitability of banking mainly because of application and servicing fees however by the third quarter of 2008 net income of fdicinsured commercial banks and savings institutions declined 681 billion 676 from the third quarter of 2007 since december 2006 18 months after the subprime crisis began in august of 2005 the banking industry has reported continuously quarterly growth in net chargeoff 3 in the third quarter of 2008 net chargeoff totaled 279 billion an increase of 170 billion this is 154 from september 30 2007 twothirds of these chargeoffs are loans backed by real estate looking at the losses from another perspective the amount of loans and leases that were noncurrent 90 days or more past due increased to 1843 billion in the third quarter of 2008 this is 121 more that was reported year ago noncurrent loans were growing in other real estaterelated sectors such as real estate construction and development loans real estate loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties and commercial and industrial loans like in 2001 when profitability declined more severely in larger banking institutions than in smaller one in the current weakness in profitability is having greater impact on the larger banks table 2 column 5 shows that return on assets for banks with assets greater than 10 billion was 092 in the fourth quarter of 2007 fo r commercial banks with assets less than 100 million it was 068 for the first three quarters of 2008 table 1 column 5 shows respective figures of 44 and 56 the negative change in the return on assets in 2007 is greater for larger institutions 048 than for the smaller ones 012 which could be explained by smaller banks participating less in the assetbacked securities and derivatives markets the current financial turmoil is centered because of the devastating effects of the failure of the washington mutual bank wamu on september 25 2008 the largest bank failure in history the

money that is the first line of defense against bank failure bank equity capital has been building for years equity capital however has declined slightly in the most recent quarters because of declining equity prices profits and the necessity to build reserves against future defaulting assets table 1 shows the equity capital ratio for all fdicinsured institutions had fallen to 963 for the first three quarter of 2008 which was 074 less than it was in the fourth quarter of 2007 these levels of equity capital are still near record levels for example on december 31 2001 the equity capital was 909 which was high then still there are reasons for concern total equity capital fell by 452 billion 33 during the first three quarters of 2008 almost all of the decline occurred in the third quarter 442 billion 146 of other income consisting mainly of unrealized losses on securities held for sale and the washington mutual bank wamu were significant factors in the decline in equity the wamu failure also had similar negative effects of total tier one capital and total riskbased capital in addition almost half of all institutions reported decline in their leverage ratios in the third quarter and more than half of all fdicinsured institutions reported decline in their riskbased capital ratio to counter this capital deterioration more than half of the other the reporting institutions lowered their dividend and more than 20 did not pay any dividend even though the industry increased loanloss reserve by 17 billion the smallest since the crisis began the industrys ratio of reserves to total loans and leases increased from 181 to 195 its highest level since the first quarter of 1995 the result is that reserve growth did not keep pace with the growth in noncurrent loans and leases the coverage ratio of reserves to noncurrent loans fell from 89cents in reserve to every 4 fdic quarterly banking profile tables iia iib iva ivb for the full year 2001 and december 31

interest rate risk in the banking institutions loan portfolios meeting and even exceeding capital requirements are easier when the industry is making record profits today even thought capital is reasonably high as table 1 column 6 shows the combination of the subprime liquidity crisis and the deterioration in macroeconomic conditions exposes the banking industry to increased portfolio risks at time when its increasingly difficult to raise capital like profits bank equity prices have been declining despite the federal governments capital purchase program cpp which buy preferred shares in trouble banking institutions before turning to the government programs to stabilized the financial system below is useful to consider the two major categories of risk g5g155g142g141g146g157g561g20g146g156g148g561 credit risk is the risk that borrowers may fail to fully make the obligated payments of their loans in short credit risk is the probability of default credit risk is highly correlated with interest rate risk because higher interest rates tend to reduce borrowers available income and increase the probability of default as borrowers take on new loans with higher required payouts 5 the level of consumer indebtedness is major credit risk factor total household indebtedness is at an historic high total outstanding household liabilities were more than 144 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2007 at the same time real estate holdings of households fell 20 trillion and homeowners equity as percentage of households real estate mortgage debt fell to 4796 for the first time since 1982 household mortgage debt exceeded homeowners equity in real estate mortgage debt accounted for 731 of total outstanding debt in 2006 7 in 2000 it accounted for 86 of total household debt in the mid1980s total househol d debt was roughly 70 of household annual aftertax income in 2007 that proportion had risen to more than 1268 rising household indebtedness has raised concerns about the sustainability of the growth in consumer spending which accounts for almost 70 of the gross domestic product gdp even before the current credit crunch and the subprime turmoil banks have been seeing rise in noncurrent loans because households now have greater exposure to rising variablerate consumer loans and adjustable mortgages in the two tables column 8 noncurrent assets to

profitability of banks rising market interest rates often causes bank losses or reduces consumers ability to make loan payments th following example illustrates the problem for banks suppose bank makes twoyear 1 million loan for which it charges 10 interest per annum and the bank faces the choice of market financing of the loan with twoyear time deposit at 9 per annum or with oneyear time deposit at 8 per annum9 the 9 choice would result in 10000 in certain interest earnings for each of the two years for total of 20000 however if the bank chooses the oneyear financing it will earn 20000 in year one but its earnings in year two will depend on the currently unknown oneyear interest rate that will prevail year from now should the oneyear interest rate remain unchanged at 8 the bank will earn second year of 20000 for total of 40000 if in the second year the oneyear interest rate falls to 5 the bank would do even better and record secondyear earning of 50000 for total of 70000 but if the market interest rate rises to 13 the bank would suffer loss of 30000 in year two wiping out all profits plus 10000 or 50 of the earnings it made in the first year and it would take an overall loss this risk could be avoided by choosing the twoyear financing of the loan in the current market environment with declining interest rates households as well as banks could benefit from lower cost of borrowing and lending however rising unemployment and capital shortage could more that offset the benefits of lower interest rates

higherearning longterm loans and mortgages while interest rate rose form mid2004 to mid2007 as shortterm interest rates move higher and adjustable mortgages reset to higher interest rates depository

securities with shortterm commercial paper when the availability of credit became more difficult drying up the commercial paper market banking institutions were forced to start writing off their losses in mortgagebacked securities due to significant drop in purchasers of these securities with rising shortterm rates the shortage of purchasers made the banks increasingly vulnerable to more loan

scheduled to reset in 2008 and another 375000 set for 2009 the immediate priority for banks and thrifts is to make it easier for homeowners to refinance and to prevent as many foreclosures as possible 10 in their efforts to enhance their ability to offer more generous term mortgages to prevent foreclosures many institutions have limited new lending in order to build up their loan loss reserves and capital as result some analysts argued that the subprime mortgage crisis has turned into credit crunch where banks and thrifts cannot afford to expand lending because of the rising expense of preventing foreclosures for example the banks have seen their interest income 9 market financing loan means that the bank borrows the funds it uses for the loan from lenders in the financial market

lowinterestrate environment larger banks clearly have an advantage over smaller banks in raising deposits that fund loans the subprime crisis suggests that the suppliers of these funds overpriced the assets they received for these funds consumers have been taking advantage of declining mortgage rates to extract funds from the once increasing value of their homes sizeable part of these funds from refinancing and home equity loans has been used to pay off higher credit card and installment debts 15 smaller banks have greater reliance on retail funding which mainly comes from their customers deposits the interest rate difference between the lower mortgage loan rates and the rates banks pay for deposits has narrowed considerably bankers call this an erosion in smaller banks net interest margins in lowinterestrate environment deposits continue to flow into banks particularly to larger banks because the rate of return on alternative money market instruments is lower consequently

different story for the other large and small commercial banks shown in these tables for the large commercial banks noncurrent assets are now higher than they were during the 2001 recession for example in the fourth quarter of 2007 all commercial banks except the largest noncurrent assets were higher than they were in the 2001 recession the same is true for savings institutions where the noncurrent asset ratios went from 066 in 2001 to 145 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2007 that is up from the low of 048 at the end of the third quarter of 2006 in short the large banks noncurrent

thrifts overall have maintained high levels of equity capital see tables column 6 the regulators are now placing great emphasis on improving creditrisk management developing and impr oving their methods of measuring risk on transactionbytransaction basis and holding the appropriate level of capital for that risk these new methods are to better quantify risk and establish more formal and disciplined processes to recognize price and manage risk to ensure compliance bank regulators have been moving from the traditional regime of periodic examinations to inhouse examiners the office of the comptroller of the currency for example has placed resident examiners in the 24 largest national banks these examiners and specialists in areas such as commercial and retail credit capital markets bank technology and asset management provide the regulators with realtime risk management information despite these measures the institutions and their regulators were unable to foresee the subprime crisis even though the subprime crisis has called into question the effectiveness of these new approaches to risk management large banks are still expected to take holistic portfolio view of management using advances in technology to ga rner information to help them underwrite and manage their credit risk regulators claimed that larger institutions have reduced their credit risk exposure to concentration by using the syndicated loan markets which broadly distribute credit exposure within the us banking system as well as to foreign bank and nonbanking organizations 19 similarly the greater use of securitization markets has provided another way to manage risk concentration and to diversify funding sources to provide greater access to under served markets moreover the growth of derivatives markets has provided larger banks tools to manage their interest risk exposures for example because residential real estate lending is typically associated with low credit risk because of diversification solid collateral and borrowers vested interest banks are able to reduce this exposure by using hedges like interest rate swaps and options which then enable banks to manage future shifts in interest rates while 19 ibid hawke pp 911 greenspan pp68 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32542g22 g145g142g561g5g152g151g141g146g157g146g152g151 g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g4g138

take advantage of these tools because of the higher cost of these instruments20 the use of these riskmitigating instruments to protect against risks poses two challenges for regulators first riskmitigating tools are complicated contingency instruments whose hedge value is extremely difficult to determine or to price beforehand regulators as well as bankers often rely on judgment to estimate their protective value against risks the subprime crisis suggests that these assets were less valuable than the banking institutions thought they were second if these derivative instruments are truly effective protection against rate risk smaller banks are disadvantaged by their availability almost exclusively to larger banks on the other hand if they are not effective smaller banks might be better off without using them some analysts have argued that most smaller banks do not have enough assets to enter these markets or their management is not sophisticated enough to understand how to use them successfully evidently the same may be said for some larger banks g5g152g150g153g149g146g138g151g140g142g561g160g146g157g145g561g4g138g156g142g149g561g11g11g561 with historically high

there are clear signs that profit growth has slowed dramatically and has turned negative for most institutions at the same time the industrys safety and soundness in terms of capital is still better than it has been since the late 1930s however this soundness comes from an industry that is becoming more concentrated larger banks cl early have advantages over smaller banks in funding assets and mitigating credit and interest rate risks developments in the subprime lending crisis have brought these advantages in to question these processes have left large banking institutions vulnerable to increased credit and interest rate risks now that regulatory requirements on lending are more restrictive and the rate of growth in the economy has slowed consumers are spending larger portion of their disposable income on financial obligations and their mortgage debt now exceeds their equity in their home which exposes the banks to increased credit risk banks are also vulnerable to interest rate risk because of the declining interest rate margin between the interest the banks pay for funds they lend out and the interest they receive from their borrowers rising interest rates could result in accelerating reduced profitability larger banks that used these advanced methods of funding mortgages are beginning to see their profitability approaching those of the smaller banks that rely heavily on retail funding g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 walter w eubanks specialist in financial economics weubankscrslocgov
