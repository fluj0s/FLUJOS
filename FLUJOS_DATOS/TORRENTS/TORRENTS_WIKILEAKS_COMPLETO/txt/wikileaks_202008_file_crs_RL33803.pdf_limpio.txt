and an appendix that summarize and cite bill language that was intended to end or restrict us military operations in vietnam and indochina somalia and kosovo the report covers enacted provisions as well as those where there were roll call votes but the provision was not ultimately enacted the first table outlines proposals that restrict funding and the second table describes other types of restrictions the other legislation discussed in this report either cut off funding or called on the president to take certain military actions such as troop withdrawals the cutoffs generally prohibited the obligation or expenditure of funds that congress had appropriated and they applied to military activities ranging from combat operations to initial deployments in specified countries some legislative language cut off funding for certain military operations but permitted exceptions such as the withdrawal of us troops or was contin gent upon meeting certain conditions such as the release of prisoners of war other language prohibited continued funding unless military operations were authorized congress also considered nonfunding approaches that urged the president to withdraw forces negotiate or terminate military operations seek congressional authorization for military operations or set date for us troop withdraw als another approach was congressional repeal of the august 1964 tonkin gulf resolution which authorized the president to use military force in vietnam language attempting to restrict later conflicts continued to use these two main categories of approaches funding and nonfunding adding new elements and criteria to the restrictions as the conflicts themselves evolved in the case of indochina major demarcation was the signing of the vietnam peace accords and ceasefire agreement between the united states and north vietnam in january 1973 that required the total withdrawal of us troops by march 1973 congress continued to provide funds for us troops as levels fell from peak of 539000 in june 1969 to 21500 in january 1973 in 1974 nonfunding bill was passed to cap personnel leve ls in indochina at 3000 by the end of the year in response to the invasion of cambodia from april to june 1970 congress enacted the cooper church amendment in january 1971 which prohibited using any appropriated funds to introduce ground troops into cambodia legislation enacted in 1973after the ceasefire agreementthat cut off funds for combat in or over or from of f the shores of north vietnam south vietnam laos or cambodia was designed to prevent president nixon from reintroducing troops or bombing if the north vietnamese violated the ceasefire the 1973 legislation also terminated funding for the us bombing of khmer rouge forces in cambodia by august 15 1973 the us bombing did end on that date

discusses the political context and congressional consideration of various funding and other restrictive legislative language applying to military operations in indochina between 1970 and 1973 the report also briefly mentions similar congressional actions applying to us military operations in somalia in 1993 and kosovo in 1999 this discussion is followed by two tables that summarize provisions that were enacted or considered by congress and an appendix that cites the specific language for each provision in the tables table 1 includes funding restrictions on military operations and table 2 includes other non funding approaches those provisions that were enacted are listed first followed by provisions that were not enacted but where there was roll call vote in either house from the legislative history it appears that funding cutoffs may have been more effective than nonfunding approaches in altering executive branch plans for military operations1

g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 during the 19701973 period congress considered variety of proposals to restrict us military operations in indochina and require withdrawal of troops from vietnam in response to the growing controversy in the united states over us military involvement in vietnam during the 19651969 period the specific proposals for legislation often were in response to key elements of the nixon administrations policies and were intended to influence or force changes in the administrations policies on us military involvement particularly in vietnam and cambodia main element of the nixon administrations poli cies was the staged withdrawal of us troops from vietnam from mid1969 until the end of 1972 as part of the administrations vietnamization strategy of turning over the responsibility for ground combat operations in vietnam to the south vietnamese government and army according to department of defense statistics us troop levels fell from 539000 in june 1969 to 415000 in june 1970 239000 in june 1971 47000 in june 1972 and 21500 in january 1973 in 1974 nonfunding bill was passed to cap personnel levels in indochina at 4000 by mid1975 2500 of whom could be members of the armed forces and at 3000 by the end of 1975 1500 of whom could be members of the armed forces the nixon administration however set goal of total withdrawal of us forces or total end of us combat operations in vietnam in particular the air force continued bombing operations at high level thus many of the proposed amendments and bills in congress in the 19701972 period were aimed at requiring the president to withdraw all us troops from vietnam and prohibit us combat operations in vietnam and indochina several of these came to votes in the full house of representatives and the senate but none was enacted into law second policy element was the incursion of us ground forces into eastern cambodia that president nixon ordered on april 30 1970 us ground troops withdrew by june 30 1970 but us bombing of north vietnamese and khmer rouge forces in cambodia continued proposed and enacted amendments in congress were designed to prohibit both the reintroduction of us ground forces into cambodia after june 30 1970 and continued us aerial bombing of 1 for comparison of funding cutoffs and use of the war powers act see crs report rs20775

cooperchurch amendment enacted into law in january 1971 prohibited the reintroduction of us ground forces into cambodia the restrictive bills passed in june and july 1973 terminated funding for the bombing in cambodia on august 15 1973 and bombing stopped on that date the incursion into cambodia had an important impact on congressional attempts to legislate restrictions on us military operations it triggered congressional amendments aimed at restrictions on us military operations not only in cambodia but in vietnam as well the third policy element was the negotiation and signing of an agreement on ending the war and restoring peace in vietnam between the united states and north vietnam on january 27 1973 the agreement in effect ceasefire agreement with additional political provisions provided for the withdrawal of all us troops fr om south vietnam within 60 days of the signing of the accord us troops were withdrawn fully by march 1973 major problem for president nixon and secretary of state henry kissinger in negotiating the agreement was securing the support of south vietnamese president nguyen van thieu in november 14 1972 letter president nixon assured president thieu that but far more important than what we say in the agreement on this issue is what we do in the event the enemy renews its aggression you have my absolute assurance that if hanoi fails to abide by the terms of this agreement it is my intention to take swift and severe retaliatory action 2 president nixon and other administration officials hinted publicly in march 1973 that the united states would intervene militarily if north vietnam violated the ceasefire agreement on may 3 1973 president nixon submitted report to congress entitled us foreign policy for the 1970s shaping durable peace in it he asserted that the united states would not tolerate communist violations of the agreement and that north viet nam would risk renewed confrontation with the united states if it broke the agreement3 president nixon undoubtedly had in mind the rene wal of us bombing of north vietnam and north vietnamese forces in south vietnam if hanoi renewed the war as the nixon administration withdrew us ground forces from vietnam in 1971 and 1972 it ordered heavy bombing of communist forces and installations including massive bombing by b52 bombers these indications of nixons policy intention doubt influenced the legislation proposed and passed by congress in mid1973 to cut off funding for combat operations in or over or from off the shore of north vietnam south vietnam for crs

the proposals to cut off funds generally prohibit obligating or expending funds in particular bill or bills after congress has appropriated the funds obligations occur when the government signs

applied to certain military operationssuch as combat operationsand were absolute entries 2 3 4 18 in other cases funding was to be cut off for some military activities eg combat but permitted for other activities eg the withdrawal of troops or the protection of us civilians entries 7 8 11 15 in other cases the funding cutoff was contingent upon certain conditions or events taking place such as the negotiation by the president of ceasefire the release of us prisoners of war pows or presidential determination that personnel can be withdrawn safely entries 12 13 14 16 in some cases the president could recommend extending the deadline if certain conditions such as the safe withdrawal of troops have not occurred entries 13 14 the prohibition on obligating or spending funds could also

appropriations bills but sometimes authorization or other bills eg amendments to the selective service act 4 obligations also occur when one of the military services orders goods or services from other dod organizations that supply parts repair weapons systems or provide other services such as providing fuel 5 prohibitions that apply to any bill including future b ills could be challenged on constitutional grounds since one congress cannot obligate another congress

describes eight proposalsincluding four that were enactedwhich adopt variety of nonfunding restrictions considered by congress during the indochina conflict several well known amendments were introduced by senator mansfield including two that required the termination of us military operations in indochina at the earliest practicable date as well as withdrawal of all troops within ither six or nine months these versions ultimately did not pass entries 25 and 27 two other mansfield amendments provided for p rompt and orderly withdrawal at the earliest practicable date but did not set time limit entries 24 and 26 one amendment was sense of the congress and the other stated that it was us policy to terminate military operations and withdraw forces although both of these amendments were enacted in the fall of 1971 their practical effect is not clear since deadline was set all us troops were withdrawn by march 1973 as required by the paris peace accords almost year and half after

of war or specific congressional authorization entry 30 congress also considered and passed repeal of the august 10 1964 gulf of tonkin resolution that gave congressional approval to take all
