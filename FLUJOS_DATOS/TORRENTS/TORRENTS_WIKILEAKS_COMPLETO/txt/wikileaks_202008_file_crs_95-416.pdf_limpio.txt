provisions of the federal estate gift and generationskipping transfer taxes as they apply to transfers in 2009 this year is the final year of the phase out of the federal estate tax and the generationskipping tax the discussion provides basic principles about all three taxes and how they are computed the federal estate tax is computed through series of adjustments and modifications of tax base known as the gross estate certain allowable deductions reduce the gross estate to the taxable estate to which is then added the total of all lifetime taxable gifts made by the decedent the tax rates are applied and after reduction for certain allowable credits the amount of tax owed by the estate is reached the top rate for 2009 is 45 and the exclusion amount is 3500000 this discussion divides the federal gift tax into two components the taxable gift and the gift tax computation the federal gift tax is imposed on lifetime gifts of property the tax depends in large part upon the fundamental elementthe value of the taxable gift the taxable gift is determined by reducing the gross value of the gift by the available deductions and exclusions the gift tax liability determined on the basis of the donors taxable gifts may be reduced by the unified lifetime gift tax credit 1000000 the annual per donee exclusion is 13000 26000 for joint gifts for 2009 the top rate for 2009 is 45 the purpose of the generationskipping transfer tax is to close perceived loophole in the estate and gift tax system where property could be transferred to successive generations without intervening estate or gift tax consequences there are two basic forms of generationskipping transfers the indirect skip where the generation one level below the decedent receives some beneficial interest in the property before the property passes to the generation two or more levels below and the direct skip where the property passes directly to the generation two or more levels below the decedent this discussion describes the tax on these types of transfers its computation and implementation and use of such concepts as generation assignment and inclusion ratios two primary categories of legislation pertaining to transfer taxes may be expected to be introduced in the 111 th congress as the repeal of the estate and generationskipping taxes is not permanent one category would make the repeal permanent the second would reinstate these taxes at lower rates and with higher exclusion amount andor in manner more considerate of familyowned business of course there is also the possibility of taking action and allowing the sunset provision to take effect

federal estate tax and the generationskipping tax1 the federal estate gift and generationskipping tax laws are necessarily rather lengthy and complex this report discusses those major provisions which play the dominant role in the determination of estate gift and generationskipping tax liability the discussion relates only to the taxation of united states citizens and resident aliens different rules apply to the taxation of nonresident alien individuals g22g145g142g561g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g7g156g157g138g157g142g561g22g138g161g561 the federal estate tax is computed through series of

individual includes both property owned by the decedent on the date of the decedents death and certain interests in property which the decedent had transferred to another person at some time prior to the date of death the conditions under which such property and interests in property may be included in the decedents gross estate often constitute an important problem area in the administration of the estate tax laws the gross estate of decedent includes the value of all property real or personal tangible or intangible wherever situated in which the deceased owned an interest on the date of the decedents death 2 the property and interests in property included in the decedents gross estate are valued at their fair market value on the date of death or if elected by the executor the alternate valuation date the alternate valuation date is the earlier of the date of distribution or disposition of the property by the estate or the date six months after the date of death 3 the fair market value of property is normally described as the price at which willing buyer would purchase the property and willing seller would sell it both being fully informed as to all 1 these two taxes are in the final year of an eightyear phase out period which was enacted as part of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 501 511 521 under th eses provisions these taxes will be repealed at the beginning of 2010 but see 901 which provides for the sunset of the 2001 act thus reinstituting them at 2001 levels 2 26 usc 2031a 3 26 usc 2032a the alternate valuation date is useful when the value of the property contained in the gross estate has decreased following the death of the decedent such as might be the case when the estate holds substantial quantity of stock in

highest and best use rather than its current use4 there is however special rule under which the real estate used in certain family farms and closely held businesses will under certain conditions be valued for estate tax purposes at less than its highest and best use5 certain types of property are included in decedents gross estate under special rules the proceeds from life insurance policy on the life of the deceased will be included in the decedents gross estate if either the proceeds are payable to or for the use of the executor or the estate or if the decedent held any incidents of ownership in the policy on the date of death or gave away such incidents of ownership within three years of the date of death 6 an incident of ownership is an economic right in the policy such as the

decedents gross estate if the deceased had the right to receive lifetime annuity under the same contract 7 the value of property owned by the decedent join tly with right of survivorship in another person other than the decedents spouse is fully included in the decedents gross estate except to the extent it can be shown that someone other than the decedent contributed money or moneys worth of consideration towards the cost of acquiring the property8 only onehalf of the value of property owned jointly with right of survivorship by decedent and the surviving spouse will be included in the decedents gross estate regardless of the relative contributions of the decedent and the surviving spouse 9 in number of instances the value of decedents gross estate includes the value of property not owned by the decedent on the date of death decedents gross estate includes the value of lifetime gifts over which the decedent retained life interest10 or power to alter amend terminate or destroy the

decedents taxable estate is determined by reducing the gross estate by allowable deductions including estate administration expenses certain debts and losses the amount of qualified transfers to surviving spouse charitable bequests and state death taxes 15 the first deduction to which an estate is entitl ed is for the funeral expenses administration expenses claims against the estate and unpaid mortgages paid by the estate to the extent not 13 26 usc 2035 14 26 usc 2041 certain other powers are statutorily classified as limited or nonspecial powers of appointment including the right to invade the corpus principal subject to the power only under an ascertainable standard relating to health education support or maintenance or the noncumulative right to withdraw up to the greater of 5000 or 5 of corpus annually 15 prior to 2004 the gross estate could be reduced by the value of certain qualified familyowned business interests under this deduction the executor of qualified estate was empowered to elect special estate tax treatment for these qualified interests the deduction was limited to total of 1300000 when combined with the applicable exclusion amount of the unified credit if an executor elected to use this deduction the estate tax liability was calculated as if the estate was allowed maximum qualified business deduction of 675000 and an applicable exclusion amount of 625000 regardless of the year in which the decedent died if the estate included less than the 675000 of qualified familyowned business interests the applicable exclusion amount was increased on dollar for dollar basis limited to the applicable exclusion amount generally available for the year of death qualified estate was defined to be the estate of us citizen or resident of which the aggregate value of the decedents qualified familyowned business interests that were passed to qualified heirs exceeded 50 of the decedents adjusted gross estate qualified heir was defined to include any individual who had been employed in the business for at least 10 years prior to the date of the decedents death and members of the decedents family qualified familyowned business interest was defined as any interest in business with principal place of business in the us if ownership of the business was held at least 50 by one family 70 by two families or 90 by three families as long as the decedents family owned at least 30 of the business to qualify for this deduction the decedent or member of his family was required to have owned and materially participated in the business for at least five of the eight years preceding the death of the decedent also each qualified heir was required to materially participate in the business for at least five years of any eight year period within ten years following the decedents death 26 usc 2057 prior to repeal by pl 10716 521d

be deducted to the extent that they are paid by the estate and to the extent they are allowable under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction in which the estate is administered16 additionally the estate may deduct the amount of any casualty or theft losses sustained by the estate during settlement to the extent such losses are not compensated by insurance17 the estate is also entitled to marital deducti on for the value of all property passing to the decedents surviving spouse18 interests which may terminate in favor of another person upon the lapse of time the occurrence of an event or contingency or the failure of an event or contingency to occur generally do not qualify for the estate tax marital deduction19 the estate tax marital deduction is allowed only for nonterminable interests passing to the surviving spouse these interests may pass to the spouse under the terms of the decedents will by law of intestacy by contract by operation of law or otherwise special exceptions to the terminable interest rule are made for certain transfers in trust of lifetime inco interest if the executor elects to include the value of the trust property in the surviving s pouses gross estate and for certain life estates coupled with general power of appointment as well as for certain life insurance settlement options and certain interests conditioned upon survivorship for reasonable period not exceeding six months 20 the gross estate is also reduced by the value of certain charitable bequests and devises to qualified charitable organizations21 an estate tax deduction is generally permitted for any transfer which if made during the decedents lifetime would have been deductible for income tax purposes though the rules are not identical22 the gross estate is also reduced by the amount of any estate inheritance legacy or succession taxes actually paid to any state or the district of columbia in respect to property included in the gross estate 23

1986 repealed the generationskipping transfer tax enacted in 1976 as being unduly complicated and replaced it with simplified flatrate tax43 the purpose of the resulting generationskipping transfer tax is the same as its 1976 predecessor to close loophole in the estate and gift tax system where property could be transferred to successive generations without intervening estate or gift tax consequences the traditional generationskipping transfers were trusts established by parent for the life time benefit of the children with the remainder passing to the grandchildren if properly drafted estate or gift tax would be imposed when the trust corpus passed from the settlors children to the settlors grandchildren because the estate tax is not imposed on interests which terminate at death there are two basic forms of generationskipping transfers the indirect skip where the generation one level below the decedent receives some beneficial interest in the property before the property passes to the generation two or more levels below and the direct skip where the property passes directly to the generation two or more levels below the decedent the 1976 law only taxed the indirect skip the current system taxes both types of transfers the generationskipping tax is flatrate tax the rate is set at the highest estate tax rate currently 45 44 this tax rate is applied to three different events taxable distribution taxable termination or direct skip taxable distribution is distribution from trust other than taxable termination or direct skip to skip person45 skip person is person assigned to generation two or more generations below the transferors46 taxable termination is termination by death lapse of time release of power or otherwise of an interest in
