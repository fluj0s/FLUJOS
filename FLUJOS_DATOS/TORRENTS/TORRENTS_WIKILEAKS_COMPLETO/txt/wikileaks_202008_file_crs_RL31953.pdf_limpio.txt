identiﬁed the expansion of these programs as one of the key steps that might be taken to implement the 911 commission reports recommendations legislation prepared for consideration early in the 110th congress indicates that among the steps that should be taken to implement the 911 commission recommendations the united states should ease the process of expanding these programs to other nations

commercial email uce or junk email aggravates many computer users not only can spam be nuisance but its cost may be passed on to consumers through higher charges from internet service providers who must upgrade their systems to handle the traffic also some spam involves fraud or includes adultoriented material that offends reci pients or that parents want to protect their children from seeing proponents of uce insist it is legitimate marketing technique that is protected by the first amendment and that some consumers want to receive such solicitations on december 16 2003 president bush signed into law the controlling the assault of nonsolic ited pornography and marketin g canspam act pl 108 187 it went into effect on january 1 2004 the canspam act does not ban uce rather it allows marketers to send commercial email as long as it conforms with the law such as including legitima opportunity for consumers to optout of receiving future commercial emails from that sender it preempts state laws that specifically address spam but not state laws that are not specific to email such as trespass contract or tort law or other state laws to the extent they relate to fraud or computer crime it does not require centralized do not email registry to be created by the federal trade commission ftc similar to the national do not call registry for telemarketing the law requi res only that the ftc develop plan and timetable for establishing such registry and to inform congress of any concerns it has with regard to establishing it the ftc submitted report to congress on june 15 2004 concluding that do not email registry could actually increase spam proponents of canspam have argued that consumers are most irritated by fraudulent email and that the law should re duce the volume of such email because of the civil and criminal penalties included therei n opponents counter that consumers object to unsolicited commercial email and since the law legitimizes commercial email as long as it conforms with the laws provisions consumers actually may receive more not fewer uce messages thus whether or not spam is reduced depends in part on whether it is defined as onl fraudulent commercial email or all unsolicited commercial email many observers caution that consumers should not expect any law to solve the spam problem that consumer education and technological advancemen ts

of issues concerning commercial electronic mail introduction one aspect of increased use of the inte rnet for electronic mail email has been the advent of unsolicited advertising also called unsolicited commercial email uce unsolicited bulk ema il junk email or spam1 complaints often focus on the fact that some spam contains or has links to pornography that much of it is fraudulent and the volume of spam is steadily increasing2 however recent research shows that internet users concerns about spam are actually decreasing even while the volume of spam continues to increase for example in survey conducted by the pew internet american life project during february and march 2007 respondents stated that they were less bothered by s pam now than they reported being in the previous survey conducted in june 2003 specifically in the 2003 survey 25 of respondents stated that spam was big pr oblem in the 2007 survey that figure had dropped to 18 even more striking is th at the percentage of participants who responded that spam was not problem at all rose from 16 to 28 between 2003 and 2007 the percentage of respondents sta ting that spam is an annoyance but not big problem has stayed roughly th same at 57 and 51 in 2003 and 2007 respectively3 one reason for this change in attitude towards spam is attributed to internet users growing savvy with identifying sp am on their own as well as their increased use of spam filters whether provided by their internet service provider isp or purchased on their own in 2007 71 of internet users use filters up from 65 in 20054httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31953crs2 5 spam generally refers to email rather than other forms of electronic communication the term spim for example is used for unsolicited advertising via instant messaging spit refers to unsolicited advertising vi voice over internet protocol voip unsolicited advertising on wireless devices ch as cell phones is called wireless spamdefining spam one challenge in debating the issue of spam is defining it5 to some it is any commercial email to which the recipien t did not optin by giving prior affirmative consent to receiving it to others it is commercial email to which affirmative or implied consent was not given where implied consen t can be defined in various ways such as whether there is preexisting business relationship still others view spam as unwanted commercial email whether or not particular email is unwanted of course varies per recipient since nders of uce do find buyers for some of their products it can be argued that at least so uce is reaching interested consumers and therefore is wanted and thus is not spam consequently some argue that marketers should be able to send commercial ema il messages as long as they allow each recipient an opportunity to indicate th at future such emails are not desired called optout anot her group considers spam to be only fraudulent commercial email and believe that commercial email messages from legitimate senders should be permitted the dma for exampl considers spam to be only fraudulent uce the differences in defining spam add to the complexity of devising legislative or regulatory remedies for it so of the bills introduced in the 108th congress took the approach of defining commercial email and permitting such email to be sent to recipients as long as it conformed with certain requirements other bills defined unsolicited commercial email and prohibited it from being sent unless it met certain requirements the final law the c anspam act see below took the former approach defining and allowi ng marketers to send such email as long as they abide by the terms of the law such as ensuri ng that the email does not have fraudulent header information or deceptive subject headings and includes an optout opportun ity and other features that proponents argue will allow recipients to take control of their inboxes proponents of the law argue that consumers will benefit because they s hould see reducti on in fraudulent emails opponents of the law counter that it leg itimizes sending commercial email and to the extent that consumers do not want to receive such emails the amount of unwanted email actually may increase if the legislati on reduces the amount of fraudulent email but not the amount of unwanted email the ex tent to which it reduces spam would depend on what definition of that word is used on december 16 20 04 the ftc issued its final rule defining the term commercial electronic mail message but explicitly declined to define spamhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31953crs3 6 see http wwwftcgovbcp httponguardonlinegovinde xhtml and httpwwwftcgovspam 7 see httpwwwconsumersuni onorgpubcore_product_safety000210html additional spam

some of it originates outside the united states and thus is not subject to us laws or regulations spam is global problem and 2001 study by the europ ean commission concluded that internet subscribers globally pay 10 billion euros year in connection costs to download spam9 some european officials complain that the united states is the source of most spam and the us decision to adopt an optout

s 877 which merged provisions from several house and senate bills12 signed into law by president bush on december 16 2003 pl 108187 it went into effect on january 1 200413 pl 108187 includes the following major provisions commercial email may be sent to recipients as long as the message conforms with the fo llowing requirements transmission information in the header is not false or misleading subject headings are not deceptive functioning return email address or comparable mechanism is included to enable recipients to indicate they do not wish to receive future commercial email messages from that sender at the email address where the message was received the email is not sent to recipient by the sender or anyone acting on behalf of the sender more than 10 days after the recipient has optedout unless the recipient later gives affirmative consent to receive the email ie opts back in and the email must be clearly nd conspicuously identified as an advertisement or solic itation although the legislation does not state how or where that identif ication must be made commercial email is defined as email the primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion of commercial product or service inc luding content on an internet website operated for commercia l purpose it does not include transactional or relationship messages see next bullet the act directs the ftc to issue regulations within 12 months of enactment to define the criteria to facilitate determination of an emails primary purpose the ftc did so on december 16 2004 some requirements including the prohibition on deceptive subject headings and the optout require ment do not apply if the message is transactional or relationshi p message which include varioushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31953crs5

recipient is currently i nvolved participatin g or enrolled or delivering goods or servi ces including product updates or upgrades that the recipient is entitled to receive under the terms of transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender the act allows but does not require the ftc to modify that definition sexuallyoriented commercial email must include in the subject heading warning label to be prescribed by the ftc in consultation with the attorney general indicating its nature the warning label does not have to be in the subject line however if the message that is initially viewable by the recipient does not contain the sexually oriented material but only link to it in that case the warning label and the identifie r optout and physical address required under section 5 a5 of th act must be contained in the initially viewable email message as well sexually oriented material is defined as any material that depicts sexually explicit conduct unless the depi ction constitutes sma ll and insignificant part of the whole the remainder of which is not primarily devoted to sexual matters these provisi ons do not apply however if the recipient has given prior affirmative consent to receiving such mails businesses may not knowingly promot themselves with email that has false or misleading transmission information state laws specifically related to spam are preempted but not other state laws that are not specific to electronic mail such as trespass contract or tort law or other state laws to the extent they relate to

the act does not create do not email registry where consumers can place their email addresses in centralized database to indicate they do not want commercial email the law required only that the ftc develop plan and timetable for establishing such registry and to inform congress of any concerns it has with regard to establishing it the ftc released that repor t in june 2004 see next section

september 2004httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31953crs7 14 some spam already contains instructions usually to send message to an email address for how recipient can optout however in many cases this is ruse by the sender to trick recipient into confirming that the email has reached valid email address the sender then sends more spam to that address andor includes the email address on lists of email addresses that are sold to bulk emailers it is virtually impossible for recipient to discern whether the proffered optout instru ctions are genuine or duplicitous 15 see httpwwwcauceorgnode57 16 see

steps to implement the eu law austria britain denmar k ireland italy and spain sweden reportedly adopted spam legislation in march 2004optin optout and do not email registry much of the debate on how to stop sp am focuses on whether consumers should be given the opportunity to optin where prior consent is required or optout where consent is assumed unless the consumer notifies the sender that such emails are not desired of receiving uce or all commercial email the canspam act is an opt out law requiring senders of all commercial email to provide legitimate14 optout opportunity to recipients during debate on the can spam act several antispam groups argued that the legislation should go further and prohi bit commercial email from being sent to recipients unless they optin similar to policy adopted by the european union see below eight us groups including junkbusters the coalition against unsolicited commercial email cauce and the cons umer federation of america wrote letter to several members of congress expre ssing their view that the optout approach as in pl 108187 would undercut those businesses who respect consumer preferences and give legal pr otection to those who do not15 some of the state laws see below adopted the optin approach including californias antispam law the european union adopted an optin requirement for email which became effective october 31 200316 under the eu policy prior affirmative consent of the recipient must be obtained before sendi ng commercial email unless there is an existing customer relationship in that case the sender must provide an optout opportunity the eu directive sets the broad policy but each member nation must pass its own law as to how to implement it17 as noted congress chose optout in stead of optin however one method of implementing optout is to create do not email registry where consumers could place their names on centralized list to optout of all commercial email instead of being required to respond to individual mails the concept is similar to the national do not call registry where consumers can indicate they do not want to receive telemarketing calls during consideration of the canspam act

explicitly do not want to receive spam in an august 19 2003 speech to the aspen institute mr muris commented that the concept of do not email registry was interesting but it is unclear how we can make it work because it would not be enforceable19 if it were established my advice to consumers would be dont waste the time and effort to sign up following initial senate pa ssage of s 877 an unnamed ftc official was quoted by the washington post as saying that the ftcs position on the registry is unchanged and congress would have to ch ange the law to require the ftc to create it20 after the house passed s 877 mr muris released statement complimenting congress on taking positive step in the fight against spam but cautioned again that legislation alone will not solve the problem21 canspam act provision the canspam act did not require the ftc to create do not email registry22 instead it required the ftc to submit plan and timetable for establishing registry authorized the ftc to create it and instructed the ftc to explain to congress any concerns about establishing it ftc implementation the ftc issued its report to congress on june 15 200423 the report concluded that without technical system to authenticate the origin of email messages do not ema il registry would not reduce the amount of spam and in fact might increase it the ftc report stated that spammers would most likely use registry as mechanism for verifying the validity of mail addresses and w ithout authentication the commission would be largely powerle ss to identify those responsible for misusing the registry

the regi stry identified accounts used by children in order to assist legitimate marketers from sending inappropriate messages to them p i the ftc described several regist ry models that had been suggested and computer security techniques that some claimed would eliminate or alleviate security and privacy risks the ftc stated that it carefully examined those techniques centralized scrubbing of marketers dist ribution lists convertin g addresses to one way hashes cryptographic approach and seeding the registry with canary mail addresses to determine if they c ould effectively control the risks and has concluded that none of them would be effective p 16 the ftc concluded that necessary prerequisite for do not email registry is an authentication system that prevents the origin of email messages from being falsified and proposed program to courage the adoption by industry of an authentication standard if single sta ndard does not emerge from the private sector after sufficient period of time the ftc report said the commission would initiate process to determine if federally mandated standard is required if the government mandates standa rd the ftc would then consider studying whether an authentication system coupled with forcement or other mechanisms had substantially reduced the amount of spam if not the commission would then reconsider whether or not do not email registry is needed on august 1 2005 the ftc issued press release summarizing the results of testing it had conducted to determine if online reta ilers were honoring optout requests the ftc found that 89 of th merchants it tested did in fact stop sending emails when requested to do so24 labels another approach to restraining spam is requiring that nders of commercial email use label such as adv in the s ubject line of the message so the recipient will know before opening an mail message that it is an dvertisement that would also make it easier for spam filtering software to identify commercial email and eliminate it some propose that adultorient ed spam have special label such as advadlt to highlight that the email may contain material or links that are inappropriate for childre n such as pornography canspam act provision the canspam act 1 requires clear and conspicuous identification that commercia l email is an advertisement but is not specific about how or where that identifi cation must be made 2 requires the ftc to prescribe warning labels for sexuallyoriented emails within 120 days of enactment and 3 requires the ftc to submit report within 18 months of enactment setting forth

labeling of sexually oriented commercia l email went into effect the rule was adopted by the ftc 50 on april 13 2004 press release and the text of the ruling are available on the ftcs website25 the rule requires that the mark sexuallyexplicit be included both in the subject line of any commercial email containing sexually oriented material and in the body of the message in what the ftc called the electronic equivalent of brown paper wrapper the ftc explained that the brown paper wrapper is what recipient initially sees when opening the email and it may not contain any other information or images except what the ftc prescribes the rule also clarifies that the ftc interprets the canspam act provisions to include both visual images and written descriptions of sexually explicit conduct on july 20 2005 the ftc announced that it had charged seven companies with violating federal laws requiring these labels four of the companies settled with the ftc which imposed total of 1159 million in civil penalties us district court suits were filed against the other three companies26 the act also required the ftc to submit report to congress on plan for making commercial email identifiable from its subject line or to explain what concerns would lead the ftc to recommend against such plan that report was submitted in june 2005 it concluded that re quiring uce senders to use prefix such as adv probably would not result in less spam experience with subject line labeling requi rements in the states and in other countries does not support the notion that such requirements are an effective means of reducing spam indeed spam filters widely available at little or cost more effectively empower consumers to set individualized email preferences to reduce unwanted uce from both spammers and legitimate marketers mandatory subject line labeling by comparison would be an imprecise tool that at best might make it easier to segregate labeled uce from unlabeled uce it is extremely unlik ely that outlaw spammers would comply with requirement to label the email messages they send by contrast legitimate marketers likely would comply as result labeled uce messages sent by lawabiding senders would be filtered out meanwhile unlabeled uce messages sent by outlaw spammers would still reach consumers inboxes27 italics in originalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31953crs11 28 see crs report rl31636

for controlling spam the bounty hunter pr ovision the study was released on september 15 200429 the ftc concluded that the benefits of such system are unclear because for example wit hout large rewards in the 100000 to 250000 range and certain level of assurance that they would receive the reward whistleblowers might not be willing to assume the risks of providing such information the ftc offered five reco mmendations if congre ss wants to pursue such an approach tie eligibility for reward to imposition of final court order instead of to collecting civil penalty fund the rewards through congressi onal appropriations instead of through collected civil penalties restrict reward eligibility to insiders with highvalue information exempt ftc decisions on eligibility for rewards from judicial or administrative review and establish reward amounts high enough to attract insiders with high value information definition of primary purpose the act required the ftc to issue
