description of how the cpi is calculated and provides information on what kinds of data are available historical data are presented as well as examples of how to make inﬂation adjustments to dollar amounts using the cpihttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30074 order code rl30074 the consumer price index brief overview updated february 28 2008 brian w cashell specialist in macroeconomic policy government and finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30074the consumer price index brief overview summary the consumer price index cpi is perh aps the most widely reported measure of inflation number of federal government programs are regularly adjusted to account for changes in the cpi such as so cial security benefits and the personal income tax rate schedule thus the behavior of the cp i has important consequences for large number of people many however may be unfamiliar with how the cpi is estimated for congress the cpi is of particular interest because of its significant effect on the federal budget changes in the cp i can have substantial effects on both revenues and outlays and th ose changes may either reflect underlying economic conditions or result from methodological ch anges in the way the cpi is calculated the cpi is based on number of sample surveys one of these surveys estimates the purchasing patterns of the t ypical household to determine how that household spends its money another rvey determines where those households shop and third survey collects prices on th goods and services purchased by those households the cpi measures the price level relative to particular period currently the cpi number for each month is measure of the price level relative to what it was between 1982 and 1984 the cpi is availabl for number of metropolitan areas but it does not allow comparisons of the cost of living in different citieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30074contents background 1 estimating the cpi 3 m d i c l c r 4 h m w n r s h i p 6 i m p r v i n g t h c p i

economic and practical considerations by brian w cashell 2 bls began periodic publication of nationa l cpi in 1921 at first the cpi was only released semiannually quarterly releases we re begun in 1935 and monthly releases began in 1940 3 29 usc 1 the consumer price index brief overview the consumer price index cpi is proba bly the most widely used measure of inflation number of fede ral government programs such as social security benefits and civil service retir ement are tied to increases in the cpi in addition the personal income tax rate schedule is indexed to the cpi1 economists use the cpi to calculate constantdollar estima tes of other economic indicat ors such as retail sales and hourly earnings which allow analysis of changes in these variables excluding the effect of changes in the price level each year the cpi is used to update the income levels that determine the poverty rate periodic increases in many union wage and other contracts are also tied to increases in the cpi thus the behavior of the cpi has major consequences for significant portion of the population but many may be unfamiliar with the details of how it is derived background the cpi is published by the department of labors bureau of labor statistics bls2 there is specific legislation authorizing or requiring bls to calculate and publish the cpi neither has legislation ev er been enacted to require bls to adopt any particular methodology in calculating th cpi when the bureau of labor was first created in 1888 its task was among other duties to acquire and diffuse among the people of the united states useful in formation on subjects connected with labor in the most general and comp rehensive sense of the word3 in 1913 the bureau of labor was transf erred to the newly created department of labor and renamed the bureau of labor statistics bls was given slightly more specific instructions the bureau of labor statistics under th direction of the secretary of labor shall collect collate and report at least once each year or oftener if necessary full and complete statistics of the conditions of labor and the products and distribution of the products of the same and said secretary of labor mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30074crs2 4 29 usc 2 5 specifically clerical workers craft worker s operatives service workers or laborers 6 the cpiu is the index used to adjust various provisions of the personal income tax code the cpiw is the index used to ad just social security benefits 7 historically bls has publishe d monthly changes in the cpi on both seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted basis the seasona lly adjusted changes are subject to revision because seasonal adjustment factors may change over time bls also makes available seasonally adjusted index number that is subject to revision seasonal adjustment does not affect yearly changes because the adjustment factors cancel each other out over any given 12month period 8 an exception to this occurred in 2000 mathematical error was found in the way the cpi was calculated as result numbers that had already been published were revised 9 see us department of labor bureau of labor statistics using the consumer price index for escalation available at httpwwwblsgovcpicpi1998dhtmcollate arrange and publish such statistical information so obtained in such manner as to him may seem wise4 two cpis are published by the bls th consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers cpiw and the consumer price index for all urban consumers cpiu the cpiw is base d on the purchasing patterns of only those in the population who earn more than half of their income from clerical or wage occupations and were employed at l east 37 weeks in the previous year5 the cpiw population makes up about 32 of the total noninstitu tional population prior to 1978 the cpiw was the only cpi published beginning in 1978 the cpiu was introduced so that broader share of th population would be included in estimates of changes in the price level the cpiu is based on the expend iture patterns of all urban consumers and covers about 87 of the population the cpiu is usually the more publicized of the two price indexes although the cpiu and cpiw are sligh tly different indexes the numerical difference between the two measures is typically small between 1987 and 2007 the cpiu increased overall by 825 compared with an increase of 802 for the cpi w over the same period that translates into an average annual rate of change of 31 for the cpiu and 30 for the cpiw both the cpiw and the cpiu are used for inflation indexing by the federal government6 one advantage to using the cpi in indexing is that the cpi is rarely revised7 definitions the index base year th goods and services accounted for and the methodology used to calculate the cp i may change from time to time but once published the actual index number is final8 using other measures of the price level such as one of the price indexes associ ated with gross domestic product for indexing purposes poses the problem of which number to use the preliminary estimate or one of many subsequent revisions9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30074crs3 10 see additional info at the bls website at httpwwwblsgovcpicpithreedechtm 11 see in the field with the price indexers new york time s june 20 1995 p d2 12 detailed information on the ces is availabl on the internet at httpwwwblsgovcexbeginning with release of january 2007 data the cpi and ll of its component indexes are published rounded to three dec imal places rather than one the change is not meant to imply any increase in the accuracy of the cpi instead it is being done to maintain precision in pub lished estimates of percentage changes prior to 2007 when bls published the cpi rounded to onl one decimal place it based published figures of percentage change in the cpi on those rounded numbers so that they could be replicated by users of published cpi data but doing that meant that some precision in the published percent change data was lost the effect of the change is likely to be small10 estimating the cpi both cpis are based on retail market pr ices these prices for more than 80000 separate items are collected in 87 urban areas across the country from thousands of outlets such as grocery and department stores gasoline service stations and hospitals among others11 bls selects these retail establishments based on survey showing where people do their shopping actu prices except those for food are not published because they are collected on confidential basis price indexes are available in considerable detail examples of items for which cpi data are available include white bread mens shirts automob ile tires haircuts funerals automobile repair and bedroom furniture the allitems cpi is the index most often referred to and it is composite index weighted average based on the indexes for all of the goods and services whose prices are collected the allitems cpi measures the price change of fixe d market basket of goods and services over time the mix of goods nd services making up the market basket is based on spending patterns establishe d by the consumer expenditure survey ces12 based on the ces weights are assign ed to each of the goods and services that make up the market basket these weights determine how much the price change for given good will affect the allite ms measure for any given interval the total price change as measured by the allitems cpi is the weighted average of the price changes of all of the components with the release of data for january 2008 the cpi marketbasket was based on purch asing patterns described by the ces in 2005 and 2006 bls updates the expenditu re weights every two years table 1 shows the major expenditure categor ies included in the cpi and their relative importance in the cpiu as of december 2007 relative importance reflects both the expenditure weights and changes in relative prices either larger expenditure weight or an increase in the pr ice of good relative to prices for other goods may cause the relative importance to increasehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30074crs4 13 see us department of labor bureau of labor statistics measuring price change for medical care in the cpi at httpwwwblsgovcpicpifact4htmtable 1 expenditure

labor bureau of labor statistics medical care based on the measures of relative im portance shown here some might be concerned that medical care costs have too small weight in the allitems index in particular the elderly typically spend relatively larger share of their outlays on medical care in calculating the cpi however the share of the marketbasket accounted for by medical care is based on out ofpocket costs this includes direct outof pocket costs for medical care as well as indirect outofpocket costs for health insurance13 an increasing share of medical costs are paid for by employers and government so that outofpocket expenses on medical care are not as great as total outlays on medical carehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30074crs5 14 see us department of labor bureau of labor statistics

cashell 16 see us department of labor bureau of labor statistics how bls measures price change for personal computers and periphera l equipment in the consumer price index httpwwwblsgovcpicpifaccomphtmit is also important to appreciate that there is considerable variation among consumers and among elderly consumers as well in the demand for medical care and the relative importance of medical care in the cpi is based on an average single price index can accurately describe the inflation experience of every single person different population groups eg the elderly tend to have different purchasing patterns and individuals purch ases vary significantly within those groups although many elderly may spend mo re on medical care than is taken into account in the cpi there are also likely so elderly who spend less for those who spend less if medical care costs rise more rapidly than do the prices of other goods and services the cpi will tend to overstate increases in the cost of living other things being equal bls is currently investigatin g the behavior of an experimental cpi for the elderly population14 this experimental cpi fo r americans aged 62 and older rose by an average of 32 per year between december 1987 and december 2007 during the same period the both the cpi u and cpiw rose at rate of 3015 considerable effort is made to ensure that the cpi is meaningful reliable measure of changes in the price level but it does not necessarily reflect the inflation experience of each individual consumer to the extent that individuals spend relatively more on those goods and services whose prices are rising faster than average they may experience higher inflation rate than that measured by the cpi similarly those who spend re latively less on goods and services whose prices are rising faster than average may experience lower inflation rate than that measured by the cpi if purchasing patterns change significantly then in the short run the cpi may tend to overstate the inflation rate th cpi is fixedweight index and does not immediately take into account changes in spe nding patterns due to changes in relative prices there may also be tendency for the cpi to overstate the inflation rate because some price increas reflect improvements in the quality of goods and services taking quality changes into account in price index is difficult but bls does attempt to make some adjustments to the cpi for quality improvements in number of areas including automobiles apparel and number of consumer electronic goods personal co mputers in particular16httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30074crs6 17 see us department of labor bureau of labor statistics consumer price indexes for rent and rental equivalence at httpwwwblsgovcpicpifact6htm 18 because of the timing of this change in th way the cpi is calculated permanent upward bias in the level of the cpi was introduced bls has published estimates of the cpiu using the rental equivalence approach for the years 1967 to 1982 this series is known as the cpi ux1 the census bureau now publishes histor ical estimates of real money income based on the cpiux1 measure see us bureau of the census money

commission to study the consumer price index committee print 104th cong 2nd sess december 1996 20 because of the cpis budget implications congress has from time to time taken some interest in how it is calculated to date howev er legislation has been enacted that would directly affect bls methodol ogy see david s johnson stephen b reed and kenneth j stewart price measurement in the unite d states decade after the boskin report monthly labor review may 2006 pp 1019home ownership home ownership costs in the cpi are treated in special way17 prior to 1983 the home ownership component of the cpi measured changes in the cost of purchasing new home since 1983 for th cpiu and 1985 for the cpiw changes in the cost of home ownership have been based on the concept of rental equivalence rather than measuring ch anges in the cost of buying house in each period which would include finance charges the cpi attempts to estimate the rental value of owneroccupied housing thus the cpi measures changes in the consumption aspect of housing costs and not changes in the investment value of owneroccupied housing18 improving the cpi in december 1996 special commission ch aired by economist michael boskin reported to the senate finance committee that the cpi tended to overstate the actual rate of inflation by about 11 per year19 although number of specific recommendations were made in the repor t congress took legislative steps to require any changes in the way bls calculates the cpi20 but the methodology of calculating the cp i has changed much since it was first published and is likely to continue to do s bls continues to look at methods that might lead to more accurate measure of the cost of living as part of that process with the release of data for july 2002 bls introduced an alternative cpi that makes use of chainweights this index is referred to as the ccpiu the expenditure weights for the ccpiu will be updated more frequently than either the cpiu or the cpiw and the index itself will be s ubject to revision the ccpiu has nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30074crs7 21 see crs report rl32293 the chained consumer price index how is it different by brian w cashell 22 the cpi expresses the price level relative to particular period of time currently the cpi reflects the level of prices relative to the 19821984 period thus the average index value during that period for each metropolitan area will be 100 matter how expensive any area may be in which to live that does not mean that each of these metropolitan areas is equally expensive see crs report rs20942 adjusting federal benefits for geographic differences in the cost of living by brian w cashell replaced either the cpiu or the cpiw and they w ill continue to be used for indexing21 availability of the cpi the cpi is currently published for 26 metropolitan areas for most of these cities however indexes are not published on monthly basis these metropolitan area indexes are only intended to compare inflation rates between cities the metropolitan area cpis may not be used to compare the actual cost of living between cities22 table 2 shows the metropolitan areas for wh ich the cpi is published as well as the publication frequency bls has published estimates of the cpi go ing back as far as 1800 which makes it the longest continuous price index series available these data are shown in table 3 data for 1800 through 1912 were derived by splicing price indexes collected in three separate nongovernmental studies prior to 1978 there was only one cpi available for 1978 and after the data in table 3

to those with access to the internet bls has set up number of ways on thei r website httpwwwblsgovcpidata to obtain cpi data by making selections from each of succession of menus users of blss website may specify the particular data they want there is also link to an inflation calculator allowing users to make their own inflation adjustments to dollar amounts bls has also set up separa home page

httpwwwblsgovcpihttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30074crs12 cpi calculations the cpi is an indicator of changes in the price level at present those changes are expressed relative to the average vel of prices in the years 1982 1983 and 1984 thus the average of all of the mont hly cpi numbers for those years is equal to 100 determining the change in consumer prices between any two years is simple percent change calculation using the formula percent change in the cpi cpi2 cpi1 1 x 100 for example in 2007 the cpiu was 207342 and in 1987 the cpiu was 1136 the total percentage change in the cpiu between 1987 and 2007 was 207342 1136 1 x 100 825 percent calculating the percentage change between any two years at an annual rate is slightly more complicated and requires the formula annual rate of change in the cpi cpi2 cpi1 1n 1 x 100 where n is the number of years covered in the interval to calculate the average annual rate of change in the cpiu be tween 1987 and 2007 we use an n of 20 and the same cpiu values as in the previ ous example the average annual rate of change in the cpiu between 1987 and 2007 was 207342 1136 120 1 x 100 31 percent another common use of the cpi is to ad just dollar amounts for inflation so that amounts from different years can be compar ed in terms of dollars of the same purchasing power suppose the question is how much money would have been required in 2007 to buy the same quantity of goods and services as 100 bought in 1987 to get such an estimate the 1987 dollar value needs to be adjusted to account for the increase in consumer prices between 1987 and 2007 that requires the formula equivalent purchasing power in period 2 cpi2 cpi1 x dollar amount in period 1 for example using the same cpi values as in the above examples the equivalent purchasing power in 2007 of 100 in 1987 is 207342 1136 x 100 18252 this same calculation can be reversed to find the purchasing power in an earlier period of dollar amount of more recent vintage to do this use
