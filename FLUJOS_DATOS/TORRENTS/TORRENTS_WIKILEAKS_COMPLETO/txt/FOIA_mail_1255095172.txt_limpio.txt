contenttransferencoding 7bit xflowed dear rick i am prepared to help in any way that i can as i see it there are two key issues here first the cei and pat michaels are arguing that phil jones and colleagues at the climatic research unit cru willfully and intentionally destroyed some of the raw surface temperature data used in the construction of the gridded surface temperature datasets second the cei and pat michaels contend that the cru surface temperature datasets provided the sole basis for ipcc discernible human influence conclusions both of these arguments are factually incorrect first there was intentional destruction of the primary source data i am sure that over 20 years ago phil could not have foreseen that the raw station data might be the subject of legal proceedings by the cei and pat michaels raw data were not secretly destroyed to avoid efforts by other scientists to replicate the cru and hadley centrebased estimates of globalscale changes in nearsurface temperature in fact key point here is that other groups primarily at ncdc and at giss but also in russia were able to replicate the major findings of the cru and hadley centre groups the ncdc and giss groups performed this replication completely independently they made different choices in the complex process of choosing input data adjusting raw station data for known inhomogeneities such as urbanization effects changes in instrumentation site location and observation time and gridding procedures ncdc and gissbased estimates of global surface temperature changes are in good accord with the hadcrut results im sure that pat michaels does not have the primary source data used in his phd thesis perhaps one of us should request the datasets used in michaels phd work and then ask the university of wisconsin to withdraw michaels phd if he fails to produce every dataset and computer program used in the course of his thesis research im equally sure that john christy and roy spencer have not preserved every single version of their msubased estimates of tropospheric temperature change nor is it likely that christy and spencer have preserved for posterity each and every computer program they used to generate uah tropospheric temperature datasets one irony here is that the christyspencer claim that the troposphere had cooled over the satellite era did not stand up to rigorous scientific scrutiny christy and spencer have made scientific career out of being wrong in contrast crus claim of pronounced increase in globalmean surface temperature over the 20th century has withstood the test of time the cei and michaels are applying impossible legal standards to science they are essentially claiming that if we do not retain and make available to selfappointed auditors every piece of information about every scientific paper we have ever published we are perpetrating some vast deception on the american public i think most ordinary citizens understand that few among us have preserved every bank statement and every utility bill weve received in the last 20 years the second argument that discernible human influence findings are like house of cards resting solely on one observational dataset is also invalid the ipcc third assessment report tar considers multiple observational estimates of globalscale nearsurface temperature changes it does not rely on hadcrut data alone as is immediately obvious from figure 21b of the tar which shows cru ncdc and giss globalmean temperature changes as pointed out in numerous scientific assessments eg the ipcc tar and fourth assessment reports the us climate change science program synthesis and assessment report 11 and the ccsp state of knowledge report rigorous statistical fingerprint studies have now been performed with whole range of climate variables and not with surface temperature only examples include variables like ocean heat content atmospheric water vapor surface specific humidity continental river runoff sealevel pressure patterns stratospheric and tropospheric temperature tropopause height zonalmean precipitation over land and arctic seaice extent the bottomline message from this body of work is that natural causes alone cannot plausibly explain the climate changes we have actually observed the climate system is telling us an internally and physicallyconsistent story the integrity and reliability of this story does not rest on single observational dataset as michaels and the cei incorrectly claim michaels should and does know better i can only conclude from his behavior and from his participation in this legal action that he is being intentionally dishonest his intervention seems to be timed to influence opinion in the runup to the copenhagen meeting and to garner publicity for himself in my personal opinion michaels should be kicked out of the ams the university of virginia and the scientific community as whole he cannot on the one hand engage in vicious public attacks on the reputations of individual scientists in the past he has attacked tom karl tom wigley jim hansen mike mann myself and numerous others and on the other hand expect to be treated as valued member of our professional societies the sad thing here is that phil jones is one of the true gentlemen of our field i have known phil for most of my scientific career he is the antithesis of the secretive data destroying character the cei and michaels are trying to portray to the outside world phil and tom wigley have devoted significant portions of their scientific careers to the construction of the land surface temperature component of the hadcrut dataset they have conducted this research in very open and transparent manner examining sensitivities to different gridding algorithms different ways of adjusting for urbanization effects use of various subsets of data different ways of dealing with changes in spatial coverage over time etc they have thoroughly and comprehensively documented all of their dataset construction choices they have done tremendous service to the scientific community and to the planet by making gridded surface temperature datasets available for scientific research they deserve medals as big as soup plates not the kind of crap they are receiving from pat michaels and the cei the bottom line rick is that i am incensed at the data destruction allegations that are being unfairly and incorrectly leveled against phil and tom by the cei and pat michaels please let know how you think i can be most effective in rebutting such allegations whatever you need from youve got it i hope you dont mind but im also copying my email to john mitchell at the hadley centre i know that john also feels very strongly about these issues with best regards ben rick piltz wrote gentlemen i expect that you have already been made aware of the petition to epa from the competitive enterprise institute and pat michaels calling for reopening of public comment on epas prospective endangerment finding on greenhouse gases cei is charging that the cru at east anglia has destroyed the raw data for portion of the global temperature record thus destroying the integrity of the ipcc assessments and any other work that treats the uk joneswigley global temperature data record as scientifically legitimate i have attached the petition in pdf with statements by cei and michaels the story was reported in environment energy daily yesterday below they called for it presumably because i am on their call list as someone who gets in the face of the global warming disinformation campaign among other things i hit cei but i dont have technical response to their allegations who is responding to this charge on behalf of the science community surely someone will have to if only because epa will need to know exactly what to say and really i believe all of you as the authoritative experts should be prepared to do that in way that has some collective coherence i am going to be writing about this on my climate science watch website as soon as i think i can do so appropriately i am most interested in what you have to say to set the record straight and put things in perspective either on or off the record whichever you wish will someone please explain this to best regrads rick 1 climate freemarket group attacks data behind epa endangerment proposal ee news pm 10072009 robin bravender ee reporter freemarket advocacy group has launched another attack on the science behind us epas proposed finding that greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare the competitive enterprise institute vocal foe of epas efforts to finalize its endangerment finding petitioned httpwwweenewsnetfeaturesdocuments20091007document_pm_02pdf the agency this week to reopen the public comment period on the proposal arguing that critical data used to formulate the plan have been destroyed and that the available data are therefore unreliable at issue is set of raw data from the climatic research unit at the university of east anglia in norwich england that includes surface temperature averages from weather stations around the world according to cei the data provided foundation for the 1996 second assessment report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change which epa used when drafting its endangerment proposal according to the web site for east anglias research unit data storage availability in the 1980s meant that we were not able to keep the multiple sources for some sites only the station series after adjustment for homogeneity issues we therefore do not hold the original raw data but only the valueadded ie quality controlled and homogenized data cei general counsel sam kazman said this lack of raw data calls the endangerment finding into question epa is resting its case on international studies that in turn relied on cru data but crus suspicious destruction of its original data disclosed at this late date makes that information totally unreliable he said if epa doesnt reexamine the implications of this its stumbling blindly into the most important regulatory issue we face in statement filed with ceis petition cato institute senior fellow patrick michaels called the development totally new element in the endangerment debate it violates basic scientific principles and throws even more doubt onto the contention that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions endanger human welfare he wrote michaels is university of virginia professor and author of the book the satanic gases clearing the air about global warming he stepped down from his post as virginias state climatologist in 2007 after he came under fire for publicly doubting global warming while taking money from the utility industry greenwire httpeenewsnetgreenwire20070927archive9 sept 27 2007 representatives of east anglia universitys climatic research unit were not available to comment on the cei petition epa spokeswoman adora andy said the agency will evaluate the petition but after initial review of the statement their position rests upon andy added it certainly does not appear to justify upheaval the petition is the latest in string of cei challenges to the proceedings surrounding the endangerment finding and other obama administration climate policies last week the group threatened to sue the administration over documents related to the costs of federal capandtrade program to curb greenhouse gas emissions and in june the group accused epa officials of suppressing dissenting views from an epa environmental economist during the runup to the release of the endangerment proposal rick piltz director of the watchdog group climate science watch and former official at the us climate change science program said that although the research units data are among key data sets used by the ipcc its not the only data set that they use he also said epa drew on multifaceted robust data in the technical support document underlying the finding epas endangerment finding relies most heavily on ipccs 2007 fourth assessment synthesis and assessment products of the us climate change science program national research council reports under the us national academy of sciences the epa annual report on us greenhouse gas emission inventories and the epa assessment of the effects of global change on regional us air quality according to the agencys technical support document you do not need to reopen the ipcc reports and the technical support document on the epa endangerment finding because of something having to do with the raw data from the temperature record from east anglia university in the 1980s piltz said adding that the ipcc carefully vets its data piltz said cei is on an ideological mission to head off epa attempts to finalize the endangerment finding and is grasping at straws by challenging the ipcc data their bottom line is an antiregulatory ideology piltz said when they use science they use it tactically and they will go to war with the mainstream science community republican senators also weighed in yesterday urging epa to reopen the public comment period on the endangerment finding to investigate the scientific merit of the research data its astonishing that epa so confident in the scientific integrity of its work refuses to be transparent with the public about the most consequential rulemaking of our time said sen james inhofe rokla ranking member of the environment and public works committee inhofe sent joint press release with sen john barrasso rwyo accusing epa of relying upon flawed data now the evidence shows that scientists interested in testing some of epas assertions cant engage in basic scientific work such as assuring reproducibility and objectivity because the data they seek have been destroyed inhofe said in order to conform to federal law and basic standards of scientific integrity epa must reopen the record so the public can judge whether epas claims are based on the best available scientific information rick piltz director climate science watch 3018072472 wwwclimatesciencewatchorg httpwwwclimatesciencewatchorgclimate science watch is
