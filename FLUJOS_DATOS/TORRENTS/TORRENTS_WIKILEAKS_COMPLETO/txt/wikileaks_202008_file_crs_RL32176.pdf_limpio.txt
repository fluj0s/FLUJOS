divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32176the liability risk retention act background issues and current legislation summary risk retention groups rrgs and risk purchasing groups rpgs are alternative insurance entities authorized by congress to expand insurance supply through simplification of insurance regulati on the mccarranferguson act of 1945 generally leaves the regulation of the busin ess of insurance to the individual states in 1981 and 1986 however congress crafted narrow exception to the usual state insurance regulations for these groups rgely exempting them from multiple state oversight membership in risk rete ntion and purchasing groups is limited to commercial enterprises and governmental bodies and the risks insured by these groups are limited to liability risks over the past two decades interest both in congress and in the market in these groups has varied largely with the va garies of the regular insurance market from 20012004 the insurance market was in one of its periodic hard markets and regular insurance became increasingly expe nsive and sometimes vailable since 2001 the numbers of risk retention groups rose dramatically and calls have been heard to expand the scope of insurance that they are allowed to offer at the same time some problems occurred in individua l risk retention groups and cautionary voices have also been raised alt hough the market since 2005 has softened somewhat risk retention gr oups have continued to form in significant numbers the fundamental questions surrounding liability risk retention act lrra expansion are essentially the same as those addressed by congress in prior consideration of the issue stripping aw ay jargon this question can be posed as an issue of availability vs reliability thos who would support expansion often focus on failure of the current insurance mark et and the current regulatory system to make sufficient supply of insurance available so that consumers who need insurance can find it at reasonable price the question they pose is essentially what happens to community when busin ess school or doctor can not afford or find insurance those who would oppos expansion often focus on the dangers in allowing insurance to be sold that is not subject to same regulatory standards as normal insurance the question this gr oup poses is essentially what happens to community if the insurer from which th is business school or doctor purchases insurance ends up bankrupt or if the po licy does not cover what needs to be covered legislation to extend the lrra to commercial property

issues and current legislation introduction the insurance industry particul arly propertycasualty insurance1 is known for alternating periods of hard and soft markets turns in this cycle are typically traced to unexpected changes in the i nvestment climate une xpected changes in insurance payouts or both during typi cal hard market the supply of insurance goes down insurance prices go up and underwriting standards become more stringent this often leads to consum ers encountering difficulty in finding and affording insurance during soft market prices are typically flat and insurers are more willing to underwrite greater risks so consumers typically do not face such problems in obtaining insurance legisla tive attention tends to focus on insurance matters during hard markets as constituents relate complaints about finding or affording insurance to their legislators because regulation of the insurance market was left to the states in the mccarranferguson act of 19452 however the legislature in question is most often stat legislature among the solutions offered at the state level has been the creation of or allowance for alternative market entities to increase the amount of insurance av ailable to consumers the alternative market is made up of entities or arrangements that spread and finance risk like an insurance company but that operate outside the normal regulations governing the world of regular insurance companies3 risk retention and purchasing groups rrgs and rpgs are alternative market entities that have grown out of attempts at the federal level to expand insurance supply by simplifying insurance regula tion in 1981 and 1986 congress crafted narrow exception to the usual state insura nce regulations for these groups largely exempting them from multiple state oversight interest in risk retention and purchasing groups has increased over the past few years as prices for insurance have climbed some have suggested that congress needs to

lrra to commercial property insurance and introduce other reforms in the law was introduced by representative dennis moore along with representatives deborah price john campbell and ron klein on april 15 2008 this bill hr 5792 was addressed in an april 16 hearing examining proposals on insurance regulatory reform held by the house financial services subcommittee on capital markets insurance and government sponsored enterprises risk retention and purchasing group structure and regulation risk retention groups are requi red by current federal law4 to be statechartered insurance companies they are allowed to insure commercial liability risks such as the risk that physician will be found liabl for medial malprac tice but not other propertycasualty risks such as the risk that physicians office might burn down these insurance companies also must be owned by the members of the group all policies issued by risk retention group mu st bear federally mandated warning that the policy is not regulated nor guaranteed in the same way as other insurance group members are required to be businesses in cluding individual professionals such as physicians and attorneys or government entities such as public universities school districts and town or city administrations who are engaged in similar business or face similar risks the exact corporate structure of ri sk retention group can vary many are licensed as captive insurers5 which typically have lower capital requirements but some are licensed as reg ular mutual insurers risk purchasing groups are likewise groups of entities in similar business or facing similar risks instead of creating their own insurance company these groups join together to purchase commercial insurance from established insurance companies if risk retention groups must be licen sed as an insurer under the existing laws of an individual state the obvious questions arise what advantages do they possess why go to the trouble and expense of creating such group the answers are in the different regulatory treatment of these gr oups as they operate outside of the state where they are chartered or domiciled under normal circumstances an insurer who wishes to operate outside of its do miciliary state must receive license and submit to regulation from every state in which it wishes to do business this means complying with 51 different sets of state or district laws and re gulations in order to do business across the country the impac t of this multiplicity of regulation ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32176crs3 6 for more information on the optional

continuedparticularly high in insurance as compared with other businesses because both the prices and the content of insurance policies are highly regulated in most states this perceived burden of multiple state regulatory systems is also the primary argument cited currently by some in the insuran ce industry for creating federal charter to replace or supplement the current state system6 risk retention groups are exempted by federal law from the requirement to be licensed in all states in which they operate as well as from other state laws regulating the business of insurance they must register and file documentation with states insurance regulator but after this filing they are essentially free to do business in that state this exemption from state law extends to most laws on the business of insurance but laws such as those on fraudulent trade practi ces nondiscrimination and unfair claim settlement practices still apply they also must pay state premium taxes as regular insurers do in add ition nondomic iliary states insurance regulator is empowered to monitor the financial so lvency of group including requiring that group submit to financial condition examin ation if the chartering state regulator refuses to do such an exam and seeking an injunction to force it to cease doing business if the group is in hazardous fina ncial condition this regulatory oversight is less than that accorded regular insura nce companies however and some observers fear that this might lead to an increased danger of such groups becoming insolvent in the case of risk retention group inso lvency the policyholders have recourse to state guaranty fund because membership in these funds is specifically prohibited by the federal statute risk purchasing groups are given similar but more limited exemption from state law many states have laws known as fictitious grouping laws that specifically prohibit or limit groups from pur chasing insurance for the members of the group particularly if the group exists sole ly for the purchase of insurance state insurance regulators use these laws to pr otect consumers and ensure solvency risk purchasing groups are exempted from thes laws and from countersignature laws which are laws requiring local brokers or agents signature on an insurance contract otherwise they are regulated by each state in which they operate the insurance that such groups purchase on beha lf of their members must meet the laws and regulations of the state that is signated as the domicile of that group legislative history the 1981 product liability risk retention act the first product liability risk reten tion act was introduced in 1979 and an amended version became pl 9745 in 1981 its origin can be traced to an interagency task force created by the

the possible creation of alternatives to the traditional insurance market the 1981 act was rela tively narrow limiting risk retention groups and risk purchasing groups to in surance covering product liability8 as well as completed operations liability9 the 1981 act also limited members of these groups to product manufacturers wholesal ers distributors and retailers10 risk retention groups had to be chartered nd thus regulated as an insurer in one of the united states including the district of columbia or in bermuda or the cayman islands11 the act specifically ex empted risk retention groups fro m most regulation by any state in which they operate aside from the chartering state this federal exemption however did not cover laws that were not specific to the business of insurance such as fraud or deceptive practice laws the act also preempted any state laws preventing risk purchasing groups from purchasing the same narrow range of insurance as that allowed to be offered by risk retention groups by the time the act became law in ptember 1981 the market difficulties that prompted so much attention had largely passed with regular commercial insurance available and relatively inexpensive there was little incentive for companies to undertake the expense of forming risk rete ntion or purchasing groups and only three of the former and four of the latter were formed in the first four years of the acts operation despite the lack of market action congre ssional interest in the issue continued in 1983 clarification of the risk rete ntion act s 1046 eventually pl 98193 was passed by voice votes of both the house and the senate this act was response to model state law suggested by th national association of insurance commissioners naic12 this suggested model law

state to rt laws tended to have more narrow definition than that desired by congress pl 98193 specified clearly that the definitions in the federal statute would be the controlling definitions for purposes of the risk retention act13 the 1986 liability risk retention act in the mid1980s the insurance market began to harden again and congress again heard of many problems faced by businesses and individuals in finding and affording insurance one of the congre ssional responses was to reconsider the 1981 act numerous bills were introduced to expand the provisions so that more consumers might avail themselves of the additional insurance supply mechanism that congress had created congress ultimately passed s 2129 eve ntually pl 99563 which renamed the 1981 act the liab ility risk retention act and brought the law to its present form pl 99563 expanded the scope of the insurance to include most types of commercial liability insurance and expanded the organizations that could form such groups to include any business as well as st ate or local governments or governmental entities as long as all the members of si ngle group were engaged in similar business activities or were exposed to similar ri sks this expansion however did not retroactively include the small number of fo reignbased risk retention groups these groups formed under the temporary author ity described above were allowed to continue in the area of pr oduct liability insurance but we re not permitted to expand into other kinds of commercial liability insurance it also included changes designed to allow some increased oversight of ri sk retention and purchasing groups including the requirement to file doc umentation in nonchartering states and the right of non chartering commissioners to c onduct examinations if the ch artering state fails to do so and to seek injunctions against groups in hazardous financial situation in general however the clear intent of congress remained to allow these groups to operate throughout the country while being regulated largely if not solely by single state regulator rather than facing 51 jurisdictions with very different laws and regulatory styles rrgs

individual groups are formed and retired based on the business d ecisions made by those seeking insurance in the period from 1987 to 2001 total of 142 risk retention groups were formed and 73 retired reasons for group retirement vary greatly some became insolvent some changed status to become regular insurer or were absorbed by regular insurer and some simply ceased operati on when insurance on the regular market became more affordable15 the relative calm in the marketplace that prevailed through the 1990s and into the new century ended quickly with the rdening of the insurance market in 2001 this hard market has been ascribed to the downturn in both in terest rates and the stock market as well as to unexpected cl aims particularly the estimated 35 billion in insured losses due to the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 making many of the price increases even more dramatic has been the fact that the soft market of the 1990s lasted for so many years leading to some compl acency on the part of both insurers and insureds interest in risk retention groups increas ed along with the prices of insurance the number of rrgs increased to 90 in 2002 then 141 in 2003 and 177 in 2004 the total premium for rrgs increased to 12 billion in 2002 then 17 billion in 2003 and 22 billion in 2004 the number of rrg insureds however did not follow the same pattern as the number of groups and

occurred particularly in the health care arena in the 2004 survey for example 28 of th 41 new groups were insuring some form of health care liability in the 2007 study the comparable number was 34 of 52 new rrgs within healthcare nursing homes are show the largest growth going from zero nursing home rrgs in 2002 to 20 at the end of 200518 the growth in health care rrgs seems largely due to widely reported difficulties that health care providers are encountering in obtaining medical malp ractice insurance in one interesting reported case pennsylvania department of public welfare grant provided the initial 5 million in capital for vermontdomiciled risk retention group with the purpose of insuring nursing homes solely in pennsylvania19 apparently this occurred because the chartering laws on the creation of smaller or captive insurers in vermont are more favorable than those in pennsylvania individual difficulties have come along with growth the growth of risk retention groups s not been without some problems as was noted above the number of insured declined from 2001 to 2004 this was largely due to the liquidation of three tennesseedomiciled groups20 that insured physicians lawyers and other professionals for professional liability the liquidation was forced by the insolvency of regular virginiabased insurer who had provided reinsurance for these risk rete ntion groups individual policyholders of regular insurance are normally eligible for protection in the case of insolvency under the various states guaranty funds this how ever would typically apply only to those directly insured by the virginia company not to policyholders of companies that are reinsured by this company these policyholders are considered creditors of the company not insureds and thus have lowe r priority claim on the assets of the failed company further complicating the legal situation is the statutory prohibition on risk retention group partic ipation in state guaranty funds class action lawsuits21 have been filed by insureds seeking guaranty fund protection for the insured along with damages for other malfeasance and are still ongoing22httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32176crs8 22

the insolvency of the national warranty insurance risk retention group hereafter national warranty although physically headquartered in lincoln nebraska national warranty was incorporated in th cayman islands it was one of the handful of companies that were incorporat ed outside of the united states before 1985 and was thus grandfathered out of regulation by any of the individual states prior to its being declared insolvent in august 2003 it acted as an insurer of the obligations taken on by its members mainly marketing companies and auto dealerships who sold vehi cle service contracts lthough the actual group was made up of only approximately 580 mbers the potential effect of the insolvency is more widespread as these members sold contracts to or through more than 5000 auto dealerships in 49 states23 the text of the lrra requires insureds to be members and part owners of risk retention group however this line was appa rently somewhat blurred in the national warranty case national warranty acted both as an administrator adjusting claims on behalf of its members and as the insurer of these members24 this dual role apparently gave the impression that the final consumers were purchasing service contracts directly from national warranty rather than from the individual group members the insolvency thus resulted in confusion about to whom the consumers should be making claims when they need repairs on their cars th at should be covered under the terms of the contracts in 2003 accountants with kpmg acting as joint official liquidators in the cayman islands insolvency proceedings have indicated that any consumer claims should be dir ected at the individual group members and that national warranty is not directly obligated to the consumers25 while the national warranty liquidators did set up process to accept us claims in 2006 it is unclear that many claims will be accepted26 policy issues and considerations for several years interest groups have made

prominent doubter has been nebraskas insurance commissioner who has been at the forefront of dealing with the national warranty insolvency at the september 2003 meeting the naic was couraged to adopt draft resolution that would put the group on record as oppos ing the expansion of risk retention groups29 among the reasons cited in the re solution was the danger to consumers from limitation on states regulatory authority the example of the national warranty failure and the absence of an availability problem in property insurance that has not been addressed by statebased solutions resolution

1986 stripping aw ay jargon this question can be phrased as an issue of availability vs reliability those who would support expansion often focus on failure of the current insurance market and the current regulatory system to make sufficient supply of insuran ce available so that consumers who need insurance can find it at reasonable price the question they pose is essentially what happens to community when bus iness school or doctor cannot find or afford insurance those who w ould oppose expansion often focus on the dangers in allowing insurance to be sold that is not subject to same

will do an insufficient job in protecting the consumers who live in other states hr 5792 discussed be low addresses some concerns raised in the past about the reliability of risk retention groups th rough the provisions addressing corporate governance structures and stat consumer protection laws secondary arguments are of course also made proponents point out that because the insured are the owners of risk retention group they can see to it themselves that the insurance provided is reliable it is also argued that the rates of failure of regular insurers nd risk retention groups are n early the same and that the recent failure of national warranty is unique situation since it was an offshore group that was unaccountable to any stat regulator doubters may counter by questioning what sort of impact risk re tention groups might have when even with their recent growth they still occupy fr action of percent of the propertycasualty market in addition even if the failure rates are similar the impact of state regulated insurer failure is likely to be mitigated by its participation in state guaranty funds which are specifically unavailable to insurers operating under the liability risk retention act assessing the arguments on either side will be challenge for congress the broad question posed here as availability vs reliability is in some sense basic philosophical question about the degree of regulation needed by insurance markets and may not have an absolute empirical answer some see insurance philosophically as public good akin to basic utility and one that must be highly regulated in price and content to protect consumers othe rs do not share this philosophy and feel insurance should be lightly re gulated with the market di ctating prices and content in general the states who have faced such basic insurance regulatory questions for many years have attempte d to suit the amount of regulation to the perceived sophistication of the consumer thus the market for commercial insurance is usually left relatively less regulated on the theory that the businesses purchasing in the commercial market have the knowledge and experience to discern the intricacies of insurance policies and companies or at least hire professionals to make these reliability judgments for them individual consumers are presumed to be less able to accurately make these judgments thus the market for such insurance particularly homeowners and auto tends to be much more highly regulated internationally the insurance markets in general have tended to be less regulated particularly with regard to the direct price and content contro ls found in some of the united states32 the differential regulatory approach ba sed on the sophistication of the consumer can be seen for example in the operation of state guaranty funds these funds are intended to step in and pay claims arising from insolvent insurers but they typically have relatively low cap on the amount th at can be paid to each policyholder keeping this amount low implies that c onsumers with relatively low claims presumably most individuals will be nearly fully protected against loss while consumers with relatively high claims presumably larger businesses will be only partially protected this cap on guaran ty fund claims also affects the directhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32176crs11 33 see the insurance

businesses face potentially large claims the value of guaranty fund protection will be less to them than to individuals with presumably lower claims in assessing some of the more factual arguments it is certainly true that risk retention and purchasing groups occupy ve ry small part of the insurance market for comparison with the risk retention gr oup totals the total pr emium written in the propertycasualty market in 2006 was approximately 444 billion33 economic theory suggests however that it is not necessary for competitor to have large market share in order to have an impact on prices or availability anecdotal cases particularly ones such as the pennsyl vania nursing home risk retention group mentioned above also suggest that the act is expanding the availability of insurance especially in local situations with seve re supply difficulties the department of commerce came to the conclusion in 1989 th at the 1986 act had been successful in addressing supply problems34 and the gao made similar findings in the previously mentioned 2005 report35 an assessment of risk retention and pur chasing groups also may offer insight into wider questions involving the federal role in insurance re gulation particularly since the passage of the grammleachb liley act some have advocated for an increased federal role in insurance re gulation up to comple federalization of regulation for all interstate insurers others have suggested some lesser federal role to address specific problems they see caused by the multiplicity of state regulators such as slow approval time s for
