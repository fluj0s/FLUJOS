ronald orourke specialist in naval affairs foreign affairs defense and trade division summary the navys proposed fy2009 budget requested 2712 million in procurement funding for cvn78 the first ship in the gerald r ford cvn78 class of aircraft carriers which was earlier known as the cvn21 class although cvn78 was procured in fy2008 the navys budget includes procurement funding for the ship in fy2009 fy2010 and fy2011 the navys proposed fy2008 budget also requested 1214 million in advance procurement funding for cvn79 the second ship in the class which the navy wants to procure in fy2012 the navys estimated procurement costs for cvn78 and cvn79 are about 105 billion and 92 billion respectively this report will be updated as events warrant background the navys current carrier force the navys current aircraft carrier force includes one conventionally powered carrier kitty hawk cv63 and 10 nuclear powered carriers the oneofakind enterprise cvn65 and 9 nimitzclass ships cvn68 through cvn76 the most recently commissioned carrier the ronald reagan cvn76 was procured in fy1995 and entered service in july 2003 as the replacement for the constellation cv64 the next carrier the george h w bush cvn77 also nimitzclass ship was procured in fy2001 and is scheduled to be commissioned into service on january 10 2009 as the replacement for the kitty hawk the aircraft carrier construction industrial base all us aircraft carriers procured since fy1958 have been built by newport news shipbuilding of newport news va shipyard that forms part of northrop grumman shipbuilding ngsb newport news is the only us shipyard that can build largedeck nuclearpowered aircraft carriers the aircraft carrier construction industrial base also includes hundreds of subcontractors and suppliers in dozens of states crs2 cvn77 cvn77 which was named the george h w bush on december 9 2002 is the navys tenth and final nimitzclass carrier congress approved 40537 million in fy2001 procurement funding to complete the ships thenestimated total procurement cost of 49749 million section 122 of the fy1998 defense authorization act hr 1119pl 10585 of november 18 1997 limited the ships procurement cost to 46 billion plus adjustments for inflation and other factors the navy testified in 2006 that with these permitted adjustments the cost cap stood at 5357 billion the navy also testified that cvn77s estimated construction cost had increased to 6057 billion or 700 million above the adjusted cost cap consequently the navy in 2006 requested that congress increase the cost cap to 6057 billion congress approved this request section 123 of the fy2007 defense authorization act hr 5122pl 109364 of october 17 2006 increases the cost cap for cvn77 to 6057 billion gerald r ford cvn78 class program the navys successor to the nimitzclass aircraft carrier design is the gerald r ford cvn78 class design the design was earlier known as the cvn21 class which meant nuclearpowered aircraft carrier for the 21st century compared to the nimitzclass design the fordclass design will incorporate several improvements including an ability to generate substantially more aircraft sorties per day and features permitting the ship to be operated by several hundred fewer sailors than nimitzclass ship significantly reducing lifecycle operating and support costs navy plans call for procuring at least three fordclass carriers cvn78 cvn79 and cvn80 in fy2008 fy2012 and fy2016 respectively table 1 shows funding for the three ships through fy2013 table 1 funding for cvn78 cvn79 and cvn80

as the replacement for enterprise which is scheduled to retire in crs3 2012 at age 521 the navy projects that there will be 33month period between the scheduled decommissioning of enterprise in november 2012 and the scheduled commissioning of cvn78 in september 2015 during this 33month period the navys carrier force will decline from 11 ships to 10 as can be seen in table 1 although cvn78 was procured in fy2008 the navys fy2009 budget includes procurement funding for the ship in fy2009 fy2010 and fy2011 this is consistent with section 121 of the fy2007 defense authorization act hr 5122pl 109364 of october 17 2006 which granted the navy the authority to use fouryear incremental funding for cvn78 cvn79 and cvn80 the navys proposed fy2009 budget requests 2712 million in procurement funding for cvn78 the navy estimates cvn78s total acquisition ie research and development plus procurement cost at more than 137 billion as shown in table 1 this figure includes about 33 billion in research and development costs through fy2013 and about 105 billion in procurement costs the procurement cost figure includes about 24 billion for detailed design and nonrecurring engineering ddnre work for the cvn78 class and about 81 billion for building cvn78 itself including the ddnre costs for ship class in the procurement cost of the lead ship in the class is traditional navy ship procurement budgeting practice cvn79 and cvn80 the navy wants to procure cvn79 in fy2012 and have it enter service in 2019 the navys estimated procurement cost for cvn79 is about 92 billion in thenyear dollars and the navys proposed fy2009 budget requests 1214 million in advance procurement funding for the ship the navy wants to procure cvn80 in fy2016 and have it enter service around 2023 the navys estimated procurement cost for cvn80 is about 107 billion in thenyear dollars as shown in table 1 the navy plans to request an initial increment of 201 million in advance procurement funding for the ship in fy2012 procurement cost cap section 122 of pl 109364 establishes procurement cost cap for cvn78 of 105 billion plus adjustments for inflation and other factors and procurement cost cap for subsequent fordclass carriers of 81 billion each plus adjustments for inflation and other factors the conference report on pl 109364 hrept 109702 of september 29 2006 discusses section 122 on pages 551552 issues for congress accuracy of cost estimate for cvn78 both the congressional budget office cbo and the government accountability office gao have questioned the accuracy of the navys cost estimate for cvn78 cbo reported in june 2008 that it estimates that cvn78 will cost 112 billion in constant fy2009 dollars or about 900 million more 1 section 1012 of the fy2007 defense authorization act hr 5122pl 109364 of october 17 2006 expressed the sense of the congress that cvn78 should be named for president gerald r ford on january 16 2007 the navy announced that cvn78 would be so named cvn78 and other carriers built to the same design will consequently be referred to as ford cvn78 class carriers for further discussion of navy ship names see crs report rs22478 navy ship names background for congress by ronald orourke crs4 than the navys estimate of 103 billion in constant fy2009 dollars and that if cvn78 experienced cost growth similar to that of other lead ships that the navy has purchased in the past 10 years costs could be much higher still cbo also reported that although the navy publicly expresses confidence in its cost estimate for cvn78 the navy had assigned confidence level of less than 50 to its estimate meaning that the navy believes there is more than 50 chance that the estimate will be exceeded2 gao reported in august 2007 that costs for cvn 78 will likely exceed the budget for several reasons first the navys cost estimate which underpins the budget is optimistic for example the navy assumes that cvn 78 will be built with fewer labor hours than were needed for the previous two carriers second the navys target cost for ship construction may not be achievable the shipbuilders initial cost estimate for construction was 22 percent higher than the navys cost target which was based on the budget although the navy and the shipbuilder are working on ways to reduce costs the actual costs to build the ship will likely increase above the navys target third the navys ability to manage issues that affect cost suffers from insufficient cost surveillance without effective cost surveillance the navy will not be able to identify early signs of cost growth and take necessary corrective action3 technical risk the navy faces challenges in developing certain new technologies intended for cvn78 particularly the electromagnetic aircraft launch system emals an electromagnetic as opposed to the traditional steampowered aircraft catapult problems in developing emals or other technologies could delay the ships completion and increase its development andor procurement cost gao reported in march 2008 that five of 15 current critical technologies for cvn78 are fully mature including the nuclear propulsion and electric plant six technologies are expected to approach maturity while four others will remain at lower maturity by construction contract award of cvn 21s technologies the electromagnetic aircraft launch system emals the advanced arresting gear and the dual band radar composed of the volume search and multifunction radars present the greatest risk to the ships cost and schedule challenges in technology development could lead to delays in maintaining the design schedule needed for construction emals will not be tested at sea but production model is now scheduled to begin landbased testing in 2009 difficulties developing the generator and meeting detailed navy requirements have already led to 15month schedule delay problems manufacturing the generator recently delayed testing scheduled to begin by february

execute navy shipbuilding programs statement of paul l francis director acquisition and sourcing management team testimony before the subcommittee on seapower and expeditionary forces committee on armed services house of representatives july 24 2007 gao07943t p 15 crs5 2008 the navy is considering authorizing production of the generators prior to completing initial testing in order to ensure delivery to support cvn 78s construction schedule as consequence production may begin prior to demonstrating that the generators work as intended timely delivery of emals remains at risk problems that occur in testing or production will likely prevent emals from being delivered to the shipyard to meet the construction schedule the dual band radar is being developed as part of the ddg 1000 destroyer program4 in 2007 dod reassessed the multifunction radars readiness since modes critical to cvn 21 have not yet been tested including electronic protection and air traffic control the radar could not be considered fully mature while the multifunction radar has been tested at sea considerable testing remains for the volume search radar due to problems with critical circuit technology the volume search radar will not demonstrate the power output needed to meet requirements during upcoming testing full power output will not be tested on complete system until the first production unit in 2010 and the radar will not be fully demonstrated until operational testing on ddg 1000 in 2013 problems discovered during testing may affect installation on the carrier scheduled to begin in 2012 the advanced arresting gear completed early verification tests that proved the systems concept and tested components integrated testing with simulated and live aircraft is scheduled to begin in 2009 delays have led the navy to consolidate test events in order to maintain the shipyard delivery date leaving little time to address any problems prior to production late delivery will require the shipbuilder to install this system after the flight deck has been laid disrupting the optimal build sequence and increasing cost other technologies will not be fully matured by construction contract award but present less risk to ship construction according to the navy the design for cvn78 is on track to support construction however the program may face challenges in maintaining its design schedule due to delays in the receipt of technical information on some key technologies in particular late delivery of information on emals is driving inefficiencies in design development and must be resolved to prevent late delivery of design products needed for construction5 decline in carrier force between enterprise decommissioning and cvn78 commissioning as mentioned earlier during the projected 33month period between the scheduled decommissioning of enterprise in 2012 and the scheduled commissioning of cvn78 in 2015 the carrier force under navy plans is to decline from 11 ships to 10 10 usc 5062b requires the navy to maintain force of at least 11 carriers the navy in 2007 asked congress for legislative relief to waive this provision so as to permit the carrier force to decline to 10 ships during the period between the decommissioning of enterprise and the commissioning of cvn78 congress in 2007 did not act on that request the navy in 2008 again asked congress for
