issue is the or ganizational placement of the position there is disagreement over whether the federal ci should be placed in omb or if new office should be established within the white house second issue is the scope of respons ibility of the position some proponents suggest that the federal cio should coordina information security issues critics argue that individual agencies may believe they have reduced obligation or will devote fewer resources to information security at time when threats to information resources are climbing another area of concern is budgetary authority many observers

information technology it or ganizational and management issues in private sector organizations with ci this person serves as the senior decisionmaker providing leadership nd direction for information resource development procurement and management with focus on improving efficiency and the quality of services delivered the possibility of creating federal cio to be located in the office of management and budget omb was originally considered in an early draft of what became th clingercohen act in 1995 pl 104106 however the idea of single federal cio was dropped in favor of creating cio positions within the executive agencies in the final version of the law the mixed results of agencylevel cios combined with growing interest in better managing government technology resources brought renewed attention to creating national cio position during the 106th congress in addition th recent piecemeal efforts to move governmental functions and services online has led some observers to call for an electronic government egovernment czar or federal cio to coordinate these efforts1 during the mid1990s congress consid ered several bills focusing on governmental reform and imp roved management of public resources the option of establishing federal cio was one of severa l proposals to address these problems the success of cios in the private sector is often cited as an example for government to follow however the interest in establishing cios in the federal government was generated by the experience of local and state governments at the time forty states had some form of cio operating in policy capacity as did several major cities for many their experience demonstrated that there was need for someone to articulate vision of information resources that helped coordinate agency activities and goals rather than reinforce the artificial stovepipes that separated them however the idea of federal cio was dropped in favor of agencylevel cios following testimony at july 1995 senate government affairs committee hearing at this hearing number of arguments were made in favor of eliminating the single federal cio provisions in the clingercohen act some critics of the

performance and efficiency indicators was poor fit with the traditional policy role of omb other critics argued that creating federal cio was adding another layer of bureaucracy and centralizing decisionmaking procedures they contended that it wa s counterproductive to the purpose of the clingercohen act which was to decentralize decisionmaking processes and purchasing decisions away from the general services administration gsa to the individual executive agencies third argument made by some critics at the time was that the role of federal cio was too big for any one person or agency to handle proponents of this view noted that the size of the department of defense alone was larger than some state governments and that crossagen cy groups focusing on specific problems would be more effective approach in light of this opposition congress decided to instead designate cio in each of th major executive branch agencies these agencylevel cios were tasked with the following responsibilities 1 providing advice and other assistance to the head of the executive agency and other senior manage ment personnel of the executive agency to ensure that information technology is acqui red and information resources are managed for the executive agency in manner that is consistent with chapter 35 of title 44 united states code and th priorities established by the head of the

of issues that remain unresolved this includes whether federal cio should in fact be established if so the organizational placement of the position and the scope of responsibility and authority assigned to the position needs to be determined some of these issues arise from the implicit paradox of trying to centralize management of decentralized technologies others are the result of differing opinions regarding how information technology fits into the general scope of governance should there be single federal cio although there is disagreement about th exact nature of the position support

2001 p 50 20bush urged not to name federal cio government executive magazine 5 february 2001 http wwwgovexeccomnews indexcfmmodereportarticleid19336below supporters cite vari ety of reasons to justify creating federal cio position some of the reasons include need to develop governmentwide cybersecurity17 measures and need for voice to advocate the appropriate budgetary support for both short and long term information tec hnology projects another reason frequently cited is the need to coordinate the growing number of federal egovernment initiatives as more government functions become available online sustained and focused central leadership becomes critical to improving federal it performance and enhancing the delivery of services18 this includes the development of government information technology standards that will contribute to robust and secure information infrastructure common th eme underlying many of these arguments is the belief that the role of informati on technology in governance requires leadership with strategic vision to ensure that the improved productivity and efficiency expected by the investment in technolog is realized some observers also point to the role of cios in improving the performance and pr oductivity of private sector organizations as an example of what could be done in the public sector19 in response opponents of efforts to establish federal cio argue that the responsibilities of such position are t oo complex and unwieldy for one person they believe that it is not possible for an individual to manage and coordinate the various information technology projects and needs across the entire us government related to this argument some critics also contend that centralizing management of government information technology is step backward rather than forward instead they suggest it is more appropriate to approach it needs through smaller interagency groups focusing on specific task such as th processing of student loan applications online or improving online tax filing procedures20 another reason cited by some opponents is the organizational obstacles to change that will not disappear with the establishment of federal cio one obst acle cited is budget process that favors separate agency projects rather than crossagency initiatives another is shorter term focus when major it projects require long term planning and implementation some critics are also concerne d about the implications for agencylevel planning and responsibility they fear that centralized management by fe deral cio will be signal to agencies that they can rely on the federal cio to supplant their responsibility for tougher it issues and can reduce their resource commitment toward solving them in contrast these critics believe

over wh ether the federal cio should be placed in the office of management and budget omb or if new office should be established within the white house to focu s solely on information technology issues in september 2000 the subco mmittee on government management information and technology of the government reform committee of the house of representatives held hearing regardi ng two bills proposed by representatives turner and davis earlier that summer dis cussed above much of the testimony focused on the relationship between the pr oposed federal cio and the omb then deputy director of management at the omb sally katzen argued that situating oversight of information technology mana gement within ombs management and budgeting authority was essential for the successful budgeting and execution of information technology programs in response critics of this approach argued that information technology programs are crucial enough to warra nt autonomous management and budget authority by specialists who can devote their full energy to the success of government information technology projects in ddition some observers suggest there are lessons to be learned from the lackluster results of the agencylevel cio provisions in the clingercohen act the gao has cite d the divided attention of agencylevel cios with multiple sphere s of responsibility as an obstacle for implementing information technology manage ment reforms the gao s further stated that the role of the cio is fulltime leadership position requiring complete attention to information resource management issues22 the bush administration has indicated preference for assigning some of the responsibilities associated with proposals fo r federal cio to the deputy director of management of omb the bills intr oduced by representatives davis and turner during the 106th congress both called for the crea tion of separate position within the white house it has been reported th at senator

the organizational location of the position if the federal cio is expected to manage interagency projects and influence budget decisions then the position will need the appropriate authority and stature to successfully carry out the mission of the office however there is some disagreement over wh at that appropriate authority should be some proponents including representativ davis and turner and many federal agencylevel cios favor the idea of the federal cio being cabinetlevel position other policymakers including president bush and senator lieberman contend that the federal cio does not require cabinetlevel status24 on the other hand in its recent report egovernment the next american revolution the council of excellence favors the creation of multiple positions at both the cabinet and sub cabinet levels25 information security more specifically questions have been raised about oversight of government information secu rity some propone nts have advocated that the federal cio should be empowered to develop and implement comprehensive response to information security threats indeed some observe rs cite information security as one of the most important roles for potential federal cio noting that federal information security currently falls under the jurisdiction of twelve congressional appropriations subcommittees and in practice is carried out through multiple of uncoordinated and potentially incompatible efforts by various agencies and departments26 in the september 2000 testimony before the house government management information and technology subco mmittee the gao made three primary recommendations regarding governmental ac tion to improve the state of federal information security two of these three recommendations focused on the centralization of respons ibilities one recommendati on was to have greater prescriptive guidance regarding the level of protection that is appropriate for these systems27 the gao witness observed that disc retion is left primarily with the individual agencies to decide which com puter security measures to take and how strenuously to enforce them the second recommendation was to implement stronger central leadership and coordination of information securityrelated activities across the government28 the gao witness stated that oversight of government information security was divided among number of

sharing of information regarding information security vulnerabilities and solutions29 one of the central arguments in favor of centralized federal information security management is that it will establish clear leve l of accountability for federal information security that is currently diffu sed however it is th is very concern about accountability that has concerne d opponents of this idea critics of proposals for an it security czar argue that agencies will assume they can minimize their responsibility to secure their computer ne tworks instead th critics suggest it problems such as computer security must be addressed at the agency level where change takes place30 budgetary authority another issue is budgetary authority many observers consider some cont rol over funding of it projects critical to the success of federal cio they note that major it projects require long term planning and implementation that is illsuited to the shor tterm focus of most budgetary processes currently interagency proj ects coordinated by the ci council are funded through an ad hoc voluntary p assthehat process31 supporters of proposals to give fede ral cio some budgetary authority argue that having someone who recognizes the financial needs of information technology projects and has control over the flow of f unding will help contribute to more stable planning and ensure the completion of the project there appears to be little if any significant oppositi on to assigning the federal cio some form of budget authority there has also been relativ ely little debate about what form it would take some observers have suggested either having the federal cio control portion of the various agencies budgets for information technology projects or providing the federal cio with single fund to suppor t interagency projects president bush appears to favor the latter option on february 28 2001 president bush proposed an egovernment fund with an in itial funding of 10 million in
