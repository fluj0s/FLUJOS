sena bill added up to 8 million in outlays and 11 million in budget authority through fy2003 afterschool programs and the child and adult care food progra m cacfp the 1998 reauthorization laws major initiative expands the availability of federal subsidies for snacks served in afterschool programs in two basic ways first it allows institutions schools and publi c or private nonprofit organizations that provide care to atrisk schoolchildren those living in lowerincome areas during afterschool hours to receive federal payments without family income test for the recipient child for snacks served free to participating children includin g adolescents second it permits schools spo nsoring afterschool programs to receive payments varied by family income for snacks served in their afterschool programs including those serving adolescents when the program is not operated in lower income area the house and sen ate versions of this initiative differed primarily over how far to extend federal subsidies for free snacks in afterschool programs other changes in the new law affecting outsideofschool program sponsors 1 allow them to participate in the cacfp so long as they meet state or local health and safety standards unless st atelocal licensing or approval as child care provider is required f them 2 only require schools operating day care programs receiving federal child nutrition payments to meet state or local child care licensing or approval standards if they are covered by them ie alternate federal standards will not b applied to them and 3 permanently provides funding for demonstration project operating in iowa and kentucky that expands the availability of cacfp payments to forprofit child care providers the reauthorization measure also includes tw provisions related to improving program integrity in the cacfp requirement for periodic visits to cacfp sites and funding 1 million year for cacfp trainin g and technical assistance activities finally and it makes permanent automati c eligibility under the cacfp for even start program participants school breakfast pilot projects the new law includes provisions for 3year pilot projects under which all elementary school students in participating school s would receive free breakfasts regardless of family income the bill authorizes the projects subject to appropriations summer food service program the reaut horization law loosens limits on the number of sites operated and children served by private nonprofit sponsors this and other changes eg allowing the use of private vendors to provide mealssnacks are intended to make it easier for private nonprof it organizations particularly those in rural are as to participate in the summer food service program the law also adjusts federal subsidy rates in alaska and waii upward to conform to the practicehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97108crs4 in other child nutrition programs and expands authority for schools running summer programs to receive subsidies for meals when child does not take an item offered offer vs serve authority flexibility f or states and schools the new law drops restriction that limits the degree to which states can transfer state administrative expense sae gran t money among child nutrition program operations this will allow sae fundin g including the money derived from separate administrative grant related to th summer food service program to be used as states see fit to help them administer child nutrition programs the law also includes provisions easing administrativ burdens on schools where single state agency administers multiple child nutrition programs it requires that the agency allow schools that run them to operate programs under single permanent agreement with the state as opposed to separat agreements for each program and requires that common claiming procedure b used to obtain schools federal subsidies as opposed to separate procedures an d forms for each program in addition the law loosens requirements on school s choosing to take advantage of paperwor k reduction option to offer all students free meals at additional federal cost often called provision 2 and includes specia l grants to help schools take advantage of current options to reduce paperwork finally the new law includes an amendment extending waiver allowing schools to postpone using weighted averages when reviewing their menus for complianc with federal nutrition standards and another to encourage schools to establis h adequate meal service periods home less children nutrition programs the 1998 child nutritio n reauthorization law merges separate limited nutrition programs for homeles s children into the regular cacfp thereby expanding the availability of federa l support for meals served to homeless children the wic program the reauthorization law contains number of amendments relating to the wic program in general they would give state wic agencies some more flexibility in how they use their federal funds limit agencies ability to retai n unused funds for use in the next fiscal year add provisions aimed at protecting th programs integrity and revise provisions related to the wic farmers marke t nutrition program the law also requires study of cost containment efforts in the wic program and study of the costs of delivering wic services specifically the new law eases rules governing wic agencies ability to convert funds provided fo r food to spending on nutrition services and administration allows wic agencies to use money provided for food to purchase breas t pumps permits wic agencies to retain and spend forward unused nutrition services and administration funding in the following fiscal year but only up to n amount equal to 1 of their total grant or up to 15 if the additiona lhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97108crs5 wic gencies will not be allowed to spend forward unused food dollars and whe n2 compared to prior law it is important to note that the new law reduces wic agencies spendforward authorityamount is used for management information or electronic benefit transfe r systems2 permits wic agencies to retain and spend back unused funding to cove r costs incurred in the prior year above th amounts allowed under prior law encourages states to pursue abuse in the program by loosening the rule s governing use of any miss pent money they recoup so that wic agencies can use the money for program purposes as late as the fiscal year following th fiscal year in which they were collected requires wic agencies to permanently disqualify vendors convicted f trafficking or other serious violations requires wic agencies to design and implement systems to identif individuals who might be participating at more than one site requires wic agen cies to identify highrisk participating vendors retailers and follow up with compliance investigations includes provision s requiring that those involved in trafficking face forfeiture of property associated with the trafficking requires wic participants to have income documentation to support thei r eligibility while granting wic agencies some authority to waive th requirement mandate s that individuals be physically present at each certification an d renewal of eligibility while granting wic agencies some authority to waiv the requirement requires the development of longrange plans for wic managemen t information and electronic benefit transfer systems requires wic agencies to take into consideration the prices stores charge for wic foods when selecting vendors for participation and loosens requirements on states participating in the wic farmers marke t nutrition program by allowing them use any additional funding to increas benefits rather than adding participants and allowing them to count incom they receive from donations and vendor fines toward meeting the require d match for farmers market program grants httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97108crs6 the law retains quartercent adjustments for the special milk program and commodit y3 distribution assistance note the cacfp is the only child nutrition program with special setaside of mone y4 for state audits sae money may be used for this purpose and the new law increases states flexibility in using sae dollarsgeneral provisions the 1998 reauthorization law 1 requires health an d safety inspections for s chools in the school meal programs 2 requires that schools whenever possible buy food products produced in the united states 3 extends authority for an information clearinghouse on food assistance and selfhel p initiatives and 4 extends authority for the agriculture department to carry ou t activities to help accommodate those with special dietary needs in addition the reauthorization law 1 makes clear that states and schools can enter into procurement contracts with suppliers that have provided assistance i n developing tract specifications 2 boosts from 2 million to 3 million year the money provided to the national food service management institute and 3 extends authority for grants in support of projects that integrate food and nutritio n education into elementary school curricula finally the law more than doubles th maximum fine for serious violations of any child nutrition laws offsetting savings provisions the new laws major amendment providin g offsetting savings requires tha t when federal child nutrition subsidies are indexed for inflation each july virtually all be rounded down to the nearest whole cent not to the nearest quarter cent at present this is the case for most subsidies for meals and snacks provided to nonpoor children additional savings arise from provisio n3 reducing from 2 to 15 the funding set aside for state udits of sponsors and providers under the cacfp program4 commodity provisions the reauthorization law includes number f amendments affecting c ommodity distribution operations that were suggested by the admini stration they 1 ease requirements to collect customer acceptability information 2 authorize the transfer of commodities among the various domestic food assistance programs 3 provide funding for the removal of commoditie s provided by the agriculture department that pose health or safety risk and 4 allow the agriculture department to accept commodities provided by other federal sources for distribution through all its domestic food assistance programs major differences from the administrations reauthorizatio n package most of the prov isions recommended by the administration as part of their child nutrition reauthor ization proposal hr 3666s 2166 are contained in the 1998 chil d nutrition rea uthorization law however it expands on the administration proposal to extend federal support for afterschool programs and its proposals for the wi c program it also does not include administration proposals to eliminate the 2 set aside for cacfp audits and allow states to keep half of any claims they recoup from schools and other providers through stateconducted reviews of child nutritio n programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97108crs7 other bills before congress house bills in addition to hr 3874 and the administrations bill five other bills were before the house the extensions of appropriation authority in hr 3871 3873 are included in the new reauthorization law as is expansion of support for after school prog rams contained in hr 3086 however two major proposals advanced in hr 308 6 and hr 3405 are not hr 3086 proposed to mandate federa l subsidies for free br eakfasts in all participating elementary schools without regard to family income the new law includes demonstration project for this hr 340 5 would have greatly eased the rules governing participation of forprofit child car providers in the cacfp along the lines of what is already allowed in demonstration project operating in iowa and kentucky which is extended by th 1998 reauthorization measure the new law does not s

as in hr 3086 noted earlier the child nutrition reauthorization law authorizes pilot project to test this concept s 1556 the child nutrition initiatives act the major provisions of thi s measure included amendments to restore 1 startup and expansion grants for school breakfast and summer programs and 2 subsidies for some additional mealssnacks served in day care centers and summer programs these 2 forms of federal support were ended by the 19 96 welfare reform law the bill also would have increased and extended funding for an information clearinghouse and expanded support for th summer

1556 are not included in the child nutrition reauthorization measure s 1581 the child nutrition reaut horization act this measure would have reauthorized through fy2003 all expiring provisions of child nutrition law see later discussion of programs up for reauthorization with program or fundin g changes extension of virtually all expiring authorities is included in the 1998 child nutrition reauthorization law other relevant bills in addition to the measures not ed above three other bills in the 105 congress are rel evant as passed by the senate in late 1997 s 1150 anth agricultural research measure would have spent over 100 million through fy2002 on child nutrition initiatives eg as in s1556 it would have restored startup and expansion grants for breakfast and summer programs and additional mealsnac k subsidies in day care centers and summer programs however the conferenc agreem ent on this measure dropped all child nutrition amendments and none wer enacted hr 3531 the new mothers breastfeeding promotion nd protection act included proposal similar to that included in the new child nutritio n reauthoriz ation law to allow wic agencies to use funds provided for food s opposed to nutrition services and administration money to support and promot breastfeeding thereby giving wic agencies more flexibility in how they suppor t breastfeeding hr 1507 the hunger has cure

elementary school students i n5 continuedcare centers as well as sense of congress statement supporting full funding for the wic program s 1556 also incorporated these initiatives other enacted legislation other than the 1998 child nutrition reaut horization legislation discussed earlier and appropriations measures discussed in child nutrition programs backgroun d and fun ding crs report 9825 only one item of child nutrition legislation wa s enacted in the 105 congressth wic benefits for overseas military personnel and dependents provisions in the national defense authorization act for fy1998 pl 10585 seek to provide funds for wic benefits for overseas military personnel and dependents the national defense authorization act for fy1998 includes an amendmen t seeking to make funding available to carry out 1994 provision of law calling fo r extension of the wic program to serve overseas military personnel and dependents the defense department estimates that about 5 million year would be needed to fund this program extension however it is unclear whether the amendment wil l actually provide funds for an overseas wic program without separate specifi c appropriation for the purpose the new law requires the secretary of defense t submit to c ongress report regarding the secretarys intentions as to implementing this extension of wic services and any plans to do so major issues in bills before congress school breakfast initiatives there were three initiatives affecting the school breakfast program in th measures before congress one would have authorized demonstration projec t providin g free breakfasts to elementary schoolchildren without regard to famil income hr 3874 s2286 second would have actually established program of free breakfasts in p articipating elementary schools hr 3086 and s 1396 and third would have restored startup and expansion grants to schools wishing t establish or expand breakfast program s 1556 hr 1507 although in excess of 70 of school lunch program schools offer breakfas t programs student participation in breakfast programs is low 20 of childre n enrolled in school breakfast program schools vs nearly 60 of enrolled childre n participat ing in lunch programs in order to increase participation primarily b removing the stigma associated with receiving free breakfasts while others pay and reducing schools paperwork associated with means testing program advocate s advanced the idea of providing federal subsidies such that all elementary schoo l students in participating schools can be offered free breakfasts others argued that5httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97108crs9 continued5 relatively lowincome areas the overwhelming majority of participating children receiv free breakfaststhe relatively low participation can be attributed to factors other than stigma price and administrative b urdens eg timing of breakfast serving hours bus schedules parental choice opposed universa l free breakfast program in elementary schools that would subsidize free meals for middle and upperincome children an d supported pilot projects to test the idea instead the house version of the child nutrition reauthorization bill authorized pilot project to test the effects of offering free breakfasts to elementary school childre n without regard to family income on participation academic achievement tardiness dietary intake and attendance however sup porters of the universal free breakfast proposal tinued to argue for mandatory funding of this demonstration project to make sure the concept is tested and the senate measure included mandator funding of 20 million in the end the house approach was included in the 199 8 child nutrition reauthorization law observers credit the startup and expansion grant program for infrastructur and other nonrecurring costs with helping to boost schools participation in th school breakfast program from under half those operating lunch programs to over 70 of school lunch program schools and advocates argued for reinstituting it so that program coverage would more closely approximate that of the school lunc h program which operates in more than 90 of the countrys schools opponent s contended tha t the grant program has done its basic job and that reintroducing what they see as aggressive federal support for further expansion is unwarranted n revival of the startup and expansion grant program was included in the 1998 chil d nutrition reauthorization measure afterschool and child care initiatives both the house and senate child nutrition reauthorization bills include d significant expansion of federal support for snacks served in afterschool programs particularly for programs serving adolescents in lowerincome areas the only major opposition expressed was concern over paying for the cost of these expansions under prior law schools could get federa l subsidies for afterschool snacks only if 1 they were getting them in may 1989 only few thousand schools qualified or 2 separately applied and qualified as child care center and assumed th additional administrative burden and meet child care center standards moreover in neither case were subsidies availabl for children over 12 in afterschool programs private nonprofit sponsors could only get subsidies as child care providers but t for children over age 12 proponents argued tha t the lack of major support for after school care is serious gap in existing child care efforts especially for lowerincome atrisk adole scents and that allowing schools to easily extend their regular school meal programs to afterschool settings would be an important contributor to fillin g the gap they also argued that private nonprofit sponsors should be able to receive support for afterschool programs they run for adolescents the 1998 child nutritionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97108crs10 reauthorization law includes substantial expansion of federal support for snack s served in afterschool settings including programs serving adolescents in addition to afterschool program initiatives there were two major proposals dealing with the cacfp before congress one would have restored subsidies fo r extra mealssnacks served to children in care for longer than eight hours ie fourth mealssnacks in participating child care centers s 1556 hr 1507 another would have opened up participation in the cacfp to forprofit day car centers serving significant proportion of lowerincome children hr 3405 neither proposal was included in the new child nutrition reauthorization law child care providers asked f or restoration of fourth mealsnack subsidies they viewed their elimination for child care centers as unfair to working families wit h children in care for long periods of time supporters of the 1996 amendmen t dropping these subsidies pointed ut that the child care food program is not intended to cover all the food needs of participating children that tracking food service fo r children in care more than 8 hours day is difficult and can lead to unwarrante d claims and that greatly increased federa l child care funding in 1996 and 1997 welfare reform and balanced budget legislation more than makes up for the relatively smal l loss of fourth mealsnack subsidies federal assista nce under the child and adult care food program cacfp for forprofit child care provid ers is limited to 1 those who receive compensation from programs under title xx of the social securi ty act the social services block grant for not s than 25 of their enrolled eligible participants and 2 provider s participating in demonstration project operating in iowa and kentucky where t least 25 of the children have family in come meeting the criteria for free or reduced price school meals ie have family income below 185 of the federal povert income guidelines where the provider is public or private nonprofit provider there are such restrictions as result very few forprofit providers receive aid under the cacfp forprofit providers called for opening up the cacfp to for profit providers at least by allowing all forprofit providers to participate in th cacfp under the terms of the iowakentucky pilot project others were reluctant to expand federal assistance to forprofit providers especially given the cost summer program initiatives while participation in school meal programs continues to grow especiall among lowincome children participation in the summer food service program is far below that in the school programs moreover the 1996 welfare reform w substantially reduced subsidies for meals and snacks served in summer programs one initiative in s 1556 would have raised summer lunch subsidies to encourage increased summer program participation by sponsors and children however opponents noted that even after the 1996 subsidy cut summer program subsidie s remain somewhat higher than subsidies for free meals in other programs recognizing that there are some dded costs to running summer program s 1556 also would have in effect made in easier for sponsors to qualify eg it would allow sites i n areas with 40 rather than 50 lowerincome children to participatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97108crs11 on the other hand the 1998 child nutrition reauthorization law makes modest changes in the summer program to open up participation to more private nonprofi t sponsors eg loosening limits on the number of sites operated and children served by private nonprofit sponsors finally coalition of summer program advocates advanc ed proposal to restore startup and expansion grants for the summer food service program as with similar grants for breakfast programs they were dropped in the 1996 welfare reform law however opposition developed because of cost concerns and worries about undoing welfare reform changes and restoration of summer program startup and expansion grants was not included in the 1998 reauthorization law wic initiatives there were three major issue areas relating to the wic program wic directors argued that they need more flexibility in managing wic funds more authority to keep unspent money for use in the next fiscal year more authority to convert foo d dollars to spending on nutrition services and administration and were leery f being given added administrative tasks the administration the appropriation s committees and other were worried that wic agencies have too much authority to keep unspent money rather than return it for reallocation to states that might nee d additional funds and congress and the administration were concerned that th program is too vulnerable to abuse the 1998 reauthorization law attempts to strike compromise by giving wic agencies some more flexibility in managing their funds but not as much as desire d by wic dir ectors limiting their authority to retain funds for spending in the nex t fiscal year but not as much as proposed by the administration and th appropriations commit tees and adding number of provisions intended to protect the programs integrity however the national association of wic director s continues to m aintain that they have not been given enough flexibility and that some of the program integrity provisions will impose too great an administrative burde n on them additional issues of note during congressional consideration of reauthorization legislation child nutrition program ad vocates pushed for several substantial changes in child nutrition law that were not included in the final reauthorization measure or only partially addressed the american school food service association asfsa and others called for legislative and administrative changes that would create seamless set of meal prog rams operated by schools in effect they asked that rules be changed so tha t schools can run the full range of child nutrition programs including school meal child care afterschool and summer programs under single set of standards an d subsidies thereby reducing their administrative burden and expanding th ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97108crs12 separately oregon sought approval of demonstration project that would allow the state6 to adjust program rules so that schools would operate child nutrition programs under uniform set of rules and subsid rates with federal funding provided as single annual grant adjusted for enrollment changes and inflation however the project was not approvedavailability of the programs fully implementing this type of initiative eg uniform6 operating standards and federal subsidies could be costly and the administratio n and others in congress indicated that they were hesitant to go forward with majo r changes instead the agriculture department issued limited set of program coordination policy guidances in the spring of 1 998 and the 1998 child nutrition reauthorization law includes amendments 1 c alling for single agreement between state agencies and schools running multiple programs and common claiming procedure for these schools to obtain their federal subsidies and 2 expanding schools role in th provision of afterschool snacks the asfsa also asked that an agriculture department proposal to require that schools follow federal procurement rules in school meal programs be quashed arguing that some of the federal rules are too burdensome on schools and woul d prevent them from procuring th items they felt most appropriate for their programs congress declined but did include one amendment in the 1998 reauthorization law that makes clear that schools can enter into procurement contracts with suppliers that have provided assistance in developing contract specifications finally the asfsa 1 called for modification of the current system fo r auditing schools meal programs the coordinated review ef fort or cre 2 asked to effectively incre ase the income threshold for free meals 3 proposed elimination of rule r equiring schools to offer variety of milk consistent with studen t preferences in the prior year 4 called for eliminating what it sees as n adminis tratively burdensome rule requiring that certain schools running breakfas t programs account for school breakfast costs in order to receive their full federal subsidy 5 supported increasing what is now relatively minimal state matchin g requirem ent for receiving federal child nutrition funds and 6 asked that rule s governin g waivers from federal child nutrition requirements be changed to mak waivers easier to get these proposals were not acted on the nutriti on education and training net
