increases in the price of crude oil that began in 2004 pushed the spot price of west texas intermediate wti key oil in determining market prices to nearly 100 per barrel in the third quarter of 2007 tight market conditions persisted through the remainder of 2007 with demand growth in chin india and other parts of the developing world continuing certain supply related to political unrest in nigeria venezuela iraq and other places continued to threaten the market and contribute to psycholog that pushed up prices the decline of the value of the us dollar on world currency markets as well as the investment strategies of financial firms on the oil futures markets has also been identified by some as factors in the high price of oil the profits of the five major integrat ed oil companies remained high in 2007 as they generally accounted for approx imately 75 of bot h revenues and net incomes for this group of firms oil pr oduction led the way as the most profitable segment of the market even though oil and gas production growth was not strong the refining segment of the ma rket performed relatively poorly independent oil and na tural gas producers are small relative to the integrated oil companies and their financial performance was weaker with more than half of the firms reporting declines in net income independent refiners and marketers also experienced difficult year that was reflected in profits in 2007 the combination of high crude oil prices that raised their costs and the inability to quickly pass cost increases on to consumers lowered refining margins resulting in generally declining profits the potential volatility of the world oil nd financial markets coupled with the weakness of the us and other economies makes any profit forecast for 2008 highly speculative while continued high oil prices are likely the price of oil reached 110 per barrel in the first quarter of 2008 the ability of the industry to pass those prices on to consumers of gasoline and other products during 2008 is uncertain due to possibly weakening demandhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34437contents introduction 1 i n t g r t d i l c m p n p r f i t s 2i n d p n d n t i l n

nigeria venezuela and the persian gulf remained both threat nd sometime r eality as the strength of product demand began to weaken in the latter stages of the year responding to high petroleum product prices as well as possible slow down of economic growth refinery margins began to narrow suggesting that the companies were less able to pass through the increased cost of crude oil to consumers however even in the face of uncertainty and weakening markets th oil industry enjoyed record revenues and profits in 2007 in 2007 the oil industry recorded re venues of approxima tely 19 trillion of

industries3 the api comparisons are based on returns on reve nue they found that the oil and natural gas industries earned 76 per cent on revenues compared to 58 percent for all us manufacturing industries although this result implies 31 percent margin over the returns earned by all us manufacturing industries it is less than the 92 percent earned by all us manufacturin g industries excluding the automobile and auto parts industries that had negative 26 percen t return for the third quarter of 2007 calculating return on revenues dilutes the effect of growing total profits of the oil industry due to higher prices and grow ing revenues another standard percentage measure of profitability return on equity is presented in table 1 this measure indicates the success of the companies and industry in earning profit by utilizing the invested capital of the owners ie the shar eholders of the company this measure is widely used by investor s and financial analysts in evaluating the

performance of the integrated oil companies in 2007 table 1 and table 2 show that upstream net income growth led overall corporate net income growth for most of the companies and they earned almost 80 of their total net income from upstream activities oil and gas production declined for each product lmost 3 in oil and less than one half of one percent in natural gas four of the five largest oil producers had declining output in natural gas only bp and sh ell experienced declining output in 2007 table 3 presents financial results for the downstream activities of the integrated oil companies for 2007 net incomes declined by more than twice as much as product sales suggesting that profit margins per barrel of crude oil refined had declined in the fourth quarter of 2007 only exxonmobil and conocophillips were able to produce positive net income growth with all the other firms showing negative net income growth or in the case of bp financial losses from downstream activities crude oil prices increased rapidly dur ing the second half of 2007 and reached over 110 per barrel in march 2008 during this period gasoline price increases were thought by many to have lagged behind crude oil price increases potential weakening of the demand for gasoline in the united states was thought to be responsible for the lag with percep tion of weakening demand passing

presents data for 2007 for the independent oil and gas producers although they are large companies with revenues of more than 10 billion in 2007 for the industry leaders their total revenue s are only about 5 of the integrated oil companies their net incomes however were approximately 15 of the net incomes of the integrated companies although all of the companies in this cat egory experienced increases in revenue six out of ten experienced negative net income growth all of the companies except andarko and newfield experienced increases in production of oil and natural gas or both with prices for both oil and natura l gas rising late in 2007 these companies seemingly should have performed better w ith respect to net income growth possible explanation for the declining net income experienced by some companies might be the large outlays the companies made investing in unconventional oil asset explor ation and development ma ny of these companies are involved in shale oil work

barrel in the first quarter of 2008 should the price of crude oil remain at or above 100 per ba rrel for large portions of the year the profits of oil producing fi rms should be high however the economic conditions will likely be difficult for firms that refine crude oil but do not have their own supplies it is likely that greater effort will be made by refiners to adapt technologies that allow them to use heav sour oil stocks these lower quality crude oils are more readily available than high quality oils and sell at price discount relative to the reference oils west texas intermediate for example another key factor in the industrys profitab ility is whether demand for petroleum products tinues to grow in the united states and the rest of the world us gasoline demand is arguably beginning to weaken as result of high prices4 some projections see 4 per gallon gasolin in the second and third quarters of 2008 while prices at that level might allow refine rs to recover the cost of crude oil they might also reduce demand putting downward pressure on price demand for petroleum products outside the united states remains strong and will likely remain strong as consumers in developing nations use their higher incomes to fuel additional consumption worldwide economic slowdown is the most likely factor that would lead to slower demand growth httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34437crs8 conclusion the oil industry in general continued to generate high profits as it has since 2004 however it might be that the first sign of problems in at least part of the industry have arisen weakening dema nd for petroleum products specifically the us demand for gasoline has put pressure on the downstream side of the industry while demand growth political uncertainty the weak us dollar tight spare capacity and other factors make it likely that the price of crude oil will remain high in 2008 the weakening us economy coupl ed with the demand reducing effects of higher prices may make it more diffi cult to raise petroleum product prices new capacity investments in refineries one possible source of gasoline price relief for consumers are likely to be sl owed by the poor profit performance of the refining sector if new capacity does not come on line the need for imported gasoline will remain key factor in avoiding shortages in the us market
