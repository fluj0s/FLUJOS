economics government and finance division terrorism risk insurance issue analysis and legislation summary following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks insurance protecting against property losses that might occur in future attacks became costly or unavailable for many businesses in response congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 tria pl 107297 116 stat 2322 creating temporary reinsurance backstop that would spread terrorism losses over time and over wider base of companies and policyholders while having taxpayers absorb some of these losses particularly in the event of largescale terrorist attack tria was limited to commercial property and casualty insurance covering up to 100 billion each year after set insurer deductibles the government would have paid 90 of insured losses over the deductible if the losses were under certain amount ranging from 10 billion to 15 billion the industry would have been required to pay back the governmentprovided funds through industrywide recoupments concern was expressed even before the enactment of tria that threeyear program would be too limited to allow the private sector to develop the capacity to insure terrorism risk responding to these concerns the 109th congress passed the terrorism risk insurance extension act of 2005 triea pl 109144 119 stat 2660 in december 2005 triea extended the program two years until the end of 2007 and generally reduced the governments exposure to terrorism losses it did this by 1 excluding number of insurance lines that had been covered 2 increasing the minimum event size necessary for the government backstop to pay losses from 5 million to 100 million 3 increasing the individual insurer deductibles from 15 to 20 4 increasing the industrys aggregate retention amount from 15 billion to 275 billion and 5 reducing the governments share of losses from 90 to 85 as with the initial threeyear tria the twoyear extension was considered by many to be insufficient to address adequately the challenges that arise from the need to insure against terrorism losses some of those seeking to further extend tria argue that terrorism is completely uninsurable and thus permanent program is needed other tria supporters take the view that the private market may be able to insure against terrorism in the future but the current tria program has not existed long enough to allow the private market to develop third point of view is that tria itself is stifling the development of the private market and should be further reduced if not eliminated to allow the development of private market solution in the 110th congress the house passed hr 2761 on september 19 2007 this bill would make substantial changes to tria including adding 15 years to the program adding group life insurance requiring that insurers cover nuclear biological chemical and radiological attacks and lowering the program trigger amount to 50 million s 2285 bill that would extend the program only seven years and add domestic terrorism to the program was reported out of committee in the senate on november 1 2007 this report provides an overview of triarelated issues including

insurance issue analysis and legislation background prior to the september 2001 attacks on the united states insurers generally did not exclude or separately charge for terrorism risks the events of september 11 2001 however changed this as insurers realized the extent of possible terrorism losses estimates of insured losses from the 911 attacks are around 35 billion in current dollars the largest manmade insurance disaster on record these insured losses were concentrated in the following lines business interruption 33 of the losses property 30 and liability 231 while primary insurance companies those who actually sell and service the insurance policies bought by consumers certainly lost significant amounts of money the heaviest insured losses were absorbed by foreign and domestic reinsurers the insurers of insurance companies due to the lack of data on or modeling of terrorism risk reinsurers felt unable to price for such risks and largely withdrew from the market for terrorism risk insurance once reinsurers stopped offering coverage for terrorism risk primary insurers also suffering from lack of data and models also withdrew or tried to withdraw from the market in most states state regulators must approve policy form changes and state regulators generally agreed to insurer requests to exclude terrorism risks from their commercial policies just as they had long excluded war risks terrorism risk insurance was soon unavailable or extremely expensive and many businesses were longer able to purchase insurance that would protect them in future terrorist attacks although most of the evidence is anecdotal this problem is thought to pose threat of serious harm to the real estate transportation construction energy and utility sectors in turn threatening the broader economy insurability of terrorism risk stripped to its most basic elements insurance is fairly straightforward operation an insurer agrees to assume an indefinite future risk in exchange for definite current premium from consumer the insurer pools large number of risks such that at any given point in time the ongoing losses will not be larger than the current premiums being paid plus the residual amount of past premiums that the insurer retains and invests plus in last resort any borrowing against future profits 1 l james valverde jr and robert p hartwig 911 and insurance the five year anniversary available on the insurance information institute website at httpserveriiiorgyy_obj_databinary760752_1_0september201120anniversary pdf crs2 if this is possible for the insurer to operate successfully and avoid bankruptcy it is critical to accurately estimate the probability of loss and the severity of that loss so that sufficient premium can be charged insurers generally depend upon huge databases of past loss information in setting these rates everyday occurrences such as automobile accidents or natural deaths can be estimated with great accuracy extraordinary events such as large hurricanes are more difficult but insurers have many years of weather data coupled with sophisticated computer models with which to make predictions terrorism risk however is seen by many to be so fundamentally different than other risks as to be essentially uninsurable by the private insurance market and thus requires government solution the argument that terrorism risk is uninsurable typically focuses on lack of data about both the probability and severity of terrorist action the reason for the lack of data is generally comforting to our nation very few terrorist attacks have succeeded this however does not assuage the fiduciary duty of an insurance company president not to put company at risk by insuring against an event that too easily could bankrupt the firm as replacement for large amounts of historical data insurers turn to various forms of models similar to those used to assess future hurricane losses even the best model however can only partly replace good data and terrorism models are certainly still in their infancy one prominent insurance textbook identifies four ideal elements of an insurable risk 1 sufficiently large number of insureds to make the losses reasonably predictably 2 the loss must be definite and measurable 3 the loss must be fortuitous or accidental and 4 the loss must not be catastrophic ie it must be unlikely to produce loss to large percentage of the risks at the same time2 terrorism risk in the united states certainly fails the first criterion it also likely fails the third due to the malevolent human actors behind terrorist attacks whether or not it fails the fourth criterion is largely decided by the underwriting actions of insurers themselves ie whether the insurers insure large number of risks in single geographic area that would be affected by terrorist strike unsurprisingly insurers generally have sought to limit their exposures in particular geographic locations making terrorism insurance more difficult to find international experience with terrorism risk insurance although the us experience with terrorism is relatively limited other countries have dealt with the issue much more extensively and have developed their own responses to the challenges presented by terrorism risk spain which has seen significant terrorist activity by basque separatist movements has included terrorism in broader governmentowned reinsurer dealing with catastrophes since 1954 the united kingdom responding the irish republican army attacks in the 1980s created pool re privately owned mutual insurance company with government backing specifically to insure terrorism risk in the aftermath of the september 11 2001 attacks many foreign countries reassessed their terrorism risk and created variety of approaches to deal with the risk the uk greatly expanded poolre while 2 emmett j vaughan and therese vaughan fundamentals of risk and insurance hoboken nj john wiley sons 2003 p 41 crs3 germany created private primary insurer with government backing to offer terrorism insurance policies germanys plan as with tria in the united state is temporary measure it is set to expire at the end of 2007 and decision on renewal has been reached not all countries however concluded that some sort of government backing was necessary for terrorism insurance canada specifically considered and rejected creating some sort of government program following september 11 2001 and has not changed this position even after attempted terrorist attacks on canada itself previous us experience with uninsurable risks terrorism risk post2001 is certainly not the first time that united states has faced risk perceived as uninsurable that congress chooses to confront during world war ii for example congress created war damage insurance program and there are current programs insuring against aviation and flood losses the closest previous analog to the situation with terrorism risk is probably the federal riot reinsurance program created in the late 1960s following large scale riots in american cities in the late 1960s insurers generally pulled back from insuring in those markets either adding policy exclusions to limit their exposure to damage from riots or ceasing to sell property damage insurance altogether in response congress created riot reinsurance program as part of the housing and urban development act of 19683 the federal riot reinsurance program offered reinsurance contracts similar to commercial excess reinsurance the federal government agreed to cover some percentage of an insurance companys losses above certain deductible in exchange for premium paid by that insurance company private reinsurers eventually returned to the market and the federal riot reinsurance program was terminated in 1985 the terrorism insurance market and the economy post911 and pretria the september 2001 terrorist attacks and the resulting billions of dollars in insured losses caused significant upheaval in the insurance market even before the attacks the insurance market was showing signs of cyclical hardening of the market in which prices typically rise and availability is somewhat limited the unexpectedly large losses caused by terrorist action certainly exacerbated this trend more directly the attacks had specific impact on the commercial lines of insurance most at risk for terrorism losses postseptember 11 insurers and reinsurers began either including substantial surcharges for terrorism risk or more commonly they excluded coverage for terrorist attacks altogether reinsurers could take these steps rapidly because reinsurance contracts and rates are generally unregulated primary insurance contracts and rates however are more closely regulated by the individual states and the exclusion of terrorism coverage for the individual purchaser of insurance thus required regulatory approval at the state level in most cases states 3 pl 90448 82 stat 476 the act also created state fair access to insurance requirements fair plans and federal crime insurance program crs4 acted fairly quickly and in the fall of 2001 45 states approved insurance policy language excluding terrorism damage in standard commercial policies the lack of readily available terrorism insurance caused fears of larger economic impact particularly on the real estate market in most cases lenders prefer if not require that borrower maintain insurance coverage on property lack of terrorism insurance could lead to defaults on existing loans and downturn in future lending causing economic ripple effects as buildings are not built and construction workers remain idle the 14month period after the september 2001 terrorist attacks and before the november 2002 passage of tria provides some insight into the effects of lack of terrorism insurance some examples in september 2002 include the real estate round table releasing survey that found 155 billion of real estate projects in 17 states were stalled or cancelled because of continuing scarcity of terrorism insurance4 and moodys investors service downgrading 45 billion in commercial mortgagebacked securities5 this picture however was not uniform for example in july 2002 the wall street journal reported that despite concerns over landlords ability to get terrorism insurance trophy properties were in demand6 initial congressional action congressional action to address the perceived broad economic threat from lack of terrorism insurance began when the house committee on financial services held hearing in september 2001 following this its subcommittee on capital markets insurance and government sponsored enterprises held another in october 2001 chairman michael oxley introduced hr 3210 in the 107th congress in november 2001 during the november 29 debate on the bill the house accepted substitute bill by narrow vote the bill provided for temporary government loan to insurers in case of acts of terrorism it also contained controversial provisions on litigation management the legislation subsequently stalled over the tort provisions in the senate four bills were introduced in 2001 but the chamber took action in june 2002 senators christopher dodd harry reid paul sarbanes and charles schumer introduced compromise proposal s 2600 which passed the senate in july 2002 as passed it did not require insurers to repay all federal assistance or contain the controversial liability reform 4 terror insurance drag on real estate still climbing real estate roundtable september 19 2003 available

rises despite vacancies wall street journal july 24 2002 p b6 crs5 the reconciling november 2002 conference report retained bill number hr 3210 and was subsequently passed the president signed tria on november 26 20027 trias original goals and substance trias stated goals were to 1 create temporary federal program of shared public and private compensation for insured losses to allow the private market to stabilize 2 protect consumers by ensuring the availability and affordability of insurance for terrorism risks and 3 preserve state regulation of insurance to meet the first goal tria began shortterm program for the federal government to share insured commercial propertycasualty losses with the private insurance market the program extended from enactment through december 31 2005 the role of federal loss sharing depended on the size of the insured loss for small loss there was federal sharing for mediumsized loss the federal role was to spread the loss over time and over the entire insurance industry paying claims upfront but then recouping the payments through broad levy on insurance policies afterwards for large loss the federal government was to pay most of the losses although recoupment was possible in these circumstances as well the precise criteria under tria were as follows 1 the federal government would have shared in any insurers losses only if the industrys aggregate insured losses from an act of terrorism exceeded 5 million and 2 each insurer would have been responsible for paying out certain amount in claims known as its deductible before it could call upon federal assistance its deductible was directly proportionate to particular insurers size rising from 7 of earned premiums in 2003 to 11 in 2004 and 15 in 2005 once these two thresholds were passed the federal government would have paid 90 of each insurers losses above its deductible if however the aggregate industry loss had been below 10 billion for the year 2003 125 billion for 2004 or 15 billion in 2005 the amount that would have been paid to individual insurers was required to be recouped through surcharge added to all commercial insurance premiums in following years this surcharge could be maximum of 3 of premium and would last until the federal share was repaid if the aggregate industry loss was greater than the 10 billion 15 billion amount then the law imposed mandatory recoupment surcharge although the treasury secretary was given the authority to impose such surcharge the maximum amount that could be paid out under the program in given year was 100 billion the act covered only us commercial propertycasualty insured losses due to acts of international terrorism certified by the treasury secretary it did not cover losses due to acts of war declared by congress except workers compensation losses congress also carved out certain lines disallowing their coverage under tria the carvedout lines were federal crop insurance private crop or livestock insurance private mortgage insurance title insurance financial guaranty insurance of singleline 7 pl 107297 116 stat 2322 see crs report rs21444 the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002 summary of provisions by baird webel crs6 guaranty insurers medical malpractice flood insurance reinsurance and all life insurance products tria addressed the second goal to protect consumers by nullifying all commercial terrorism exclusions in force on trias date of enactment tria required propertycasualty insurers as condition of receiving federal assistance to make terrorism insurance available prospectively to their commercial policyholders by february 23 2003 the coverage could not differ materially from coverage for other types of losses each offer must reveal both the premium charged for terrorism insurance and the federal share of compensation tria in effect gave policyholders coverage for terrorism risk immediately without charge until the policyholder accepted or declined the coverage tria required insurers to offer the policyholder was not however required to purchase coverage if the policyholder declined to do so its insurer could exclude terrorism losses tria did not limit what insurers could charge for terrorism risk insurance though it did give state regulators the authority to modify excessive inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates the legislation made this make available provision effective until the end of 2004 with the treasury secretary having the option to continue it until the end of 2005 trias third goal was to preserve state regulation of insurance section 106 did so expressly with some exceptions one exception was the definition of an act of terrorism trias definition applied despite any other definition in state law second exception was trias limited preemption of state rate and form filing requirements tria preempted all prior approvals through december 31 2003 though it did allow states to invalidate an excessive or discriminatory rate and to review policy forms after their use thus states retained considerable authority over rates and terms for terrorism coverage third exception was trias requirement that workers compensation coverage include not only coverage for terrorism risk but also for war risk finally tria directed the treasury secretary to consult with the state regulators group the national association of insurance commissioners on several application issues in addition to the determination on the make available provisions congress directed the treasury secretary to conduct an expedited study of whether the tria program should be extended to group life insurance and allowed the secretary to extend tria to group life if the study determined that it should be tria also directed the secretary to study the potential effects of acts of terrorism on the availability of life insurance and other lines of insurance coverage including personal lines by august 2003 finally the secretary required report to congress by june 30 2005 on the effectiveness of the program the ability of the propertycasualty industry to offer terrorism insurance after the program ends and the availability and affordability of such insurance for various policyholders including railroads trucking and public transit crs7 posttria activity executive branch the treasury issued guidelines and rules for carrying out tria and carried out most of the studies and made determinations as directed by congress8 three treasury actions drew the most congressional attention and controversy in august 2003 the results of its study on group life insurance were announced and the determination was made that group life not be covered under tria because such insurance was still readily available from primary insurers in the private market this determination would have been overturned by several tria extension bills but it was not overturned by the legislation that ultimately was passed in june 2004 treasury made the determination that the make available provisions should be extended through the end of the program in 2005 determination that drew support from most in congress on june 30 2005 the treasury issued its report on tria with treasury secretary john snows accompanying letter recommending against continuation of tria in its present form9 the secretary stressed two factors the economy had become more robust since 911 and extension of tria would hinder the development of private insurance solutions by crowding out innovation and capacity building to gain support from the secretary the letter specified that any tria extension should include an increase of the event threshold from 5 million to 500 million increases in deductibles and copayments and reduction in the types of insurance covered by tria these requirements differ substantially from previously introduced legislation on the topic particularly the increase to 500 million and the reduction in the types of insurance terrorism insurance market after tria the make available provisions of tria addressed the availability problem that had plagued the terrorism insurance market as insurers were required by law to offer terrorism coverage there was significant uncertainty however as to how consumers would react since there was consumer requirement to purchase terrorism coverage and the pricing of terrorism coverage was initially high initial consumer reaction to the terrorism coverage offers was not overwhelming marsh inc major insurance broker reports that only 27 of their clients bought terrorism insurance in 2003 this takeup rate however climbed to 49 in 2004 and 58 in 200510 the takeup rates varied significantly among industries with the highest rates seen in real estate and financial services 79 in 2005 and the lowest rates in 8 see httpwwwtreasurygovofficesdomesticfinancefinancialinstitutionterrorism insurance for the latest details one exception was the study on availability that was to be done by august 2003 this has yet to be delivered to congress 9 see httpwwwustreasgovpressreleasesjs2618htm 10 marketwatch terrorism insurance 2006 marsh inc p 7 crs8 construction and manufacturing 43 in 200511 rates also varied significantly across the country 67 in the northeast 58 in the midwest 53 in the west and 50 in the south12 similar numbers are reported by others in the insurance market aon another major insurance broker reports an overall takeup rate of 593 in 20042005 with highest rates reported in the real estate and financial services industry nearly 90 aon reported however that the highest takeup rate was in the south nearly 75 while the northeast was much lower nearly 5513 the price for terrorism insurance has generally declined since the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks for example 2005 survey by the department of the treasury found that the terrorism premium as percent of the overall insurance premium was nearly 4 in 2002 and fell to slightly under 3 in 2003 and then rose to slightly over 3 in 2004 for those in high risk cities it was approximately 6 in 2002 5 in 2003 and slightly under 3 in 200414 marsh reported that the median premium for terrorism was 47 of the overall insurance premium in 2004 and 42 in 200515 congressional action in the 108th and 109th congresses oversight and hearings congressional oversight continued after enactment with hearings in both the house and the senate in april and may 2004 the principal points of concern expressed in these hearings were treasurys prior decision to exclude group life insurance from coverage under tria the then upcoming treasury decision on the make available provisions and the possibility of general extension of the act past its scheduled sunset date some concerns about tria extension were also raised at the hearings and whether all who expressed support for tria extension agreed on the exact form of this extension was unclear as well officials at the treasury department had previously indicated repeatedly that they expect the program to expire as the law provides when pressed for the bush administrations then current position on tria extension at the hearings the treasury witnesses generally indicated strong position preferring instead to wait for the results of the then ongoing study issued on june 30 2005 and discussed above through the early part of the 109th congress many members and interest groups seemed to be waiting for the treasury report that was expected to provide the administrations position on possible tria extension the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee did hold general oversight hearing on tria on april 14 2005 shortly after the release of the treasury study both the house july 13 2005 and the senate july 14 2005 held hearings featuring secretary 11 ibid p 8 12 ibid p 9 13 property terrorism update tria in the balance aon inc pp 3133 14 us department of treasury report to

interested parties to testify at hearing entitled the future of terrorism insurance on july 27 2005 tria extension legislation two bills s 467 and hr 4313 were reported out of committee to extend and revise tria in the 109th congress different versions of s 467 passed both the senate and the house by early december 200516 s 467 was introduced in the 109th congress by senator christopher dodd on february 18 2005 prior to the treasury report it was marked up in the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee on november 16 2005 the committee amended the bill substantially before reporting it favorably s 467 as reported extended the program by two years and left the framework largely intact while further limiting federal government exposure as suggested by treasury secretary snow specifically it 1 removed additional of types of insurance commercial auto burglary and theft surety farm owners multiple peril and professional liability except for directors and officers liability 2 raised the insurer deductible to 175 in 2006 and 20 in 2007 3 increased the insurer copayment from 10 to 15 for 2007 and 4 raised the event trigger to 50 million in 2006 and 100 million in 2007 after markup the bill was brought to the senate floor and passed by unanimous consent on november 18 hr 4314 was introduced by representative richard baker on november 14 2005 and marked up by the house financial services committee on november 16 relatively minor amendments were made in committee including language prohibiting life insurers from denying coverage due to lawful travel undertaken by individuals hr 4314 as reported extended tria and revised the program extensively it limited the types of insurance covered by removing commercial auto but it expanded the program to cover domestic terrorist events also it increased the types of insurance covered to include group life and specific coverage for nuclear biological chemical and radiological nbcr events it raised the event trigger to 50 million in 2006 and an additional 50 million for every future year the program is in effect it also changed the insurer deductible but did so differently for different lines of insurance raising the deductible to as much as 25 for casualty insurance but lowering it to 75 for nbcr events hr 4314 would have raised the insurer copayment to 20 for events under 10 billion while lowering it gradually to 5 for events over 40 billion in the event of terrorist attack the deductibles and event triggers would reset to lower levels with deductibles possibly as low as 5 in the event of large attack it removed the cap on the mandatory recoupment provision so that all money expended under tria would be recouped by the federal government through surcharge on insurers in the years after the attack hr 4314 also would have created tria capital reserve funds crf which would allow insurers to set aside untaxed reserves to tap in the case of terrorist attack the 16 for additional information see crs report rl33177 terrorism risk insurance legislation in 2005 issue summary and sidebyside by baird webel crs10 majority of the text of hr 4314 was inserted into s 467 and the house passed this bill on december 7 2005 although the house called for conference committee reconciling the differences between the two bills the senate did not ultimately further amendment to s 467 samdt 2689 passed the senate on december 16 2005 and the house followed passing s 467 as amended on december 17 2005 the president signed the bill into pl 109144 on december 22 2005 pl 109144 closely tracks the senate version of s 467 the only substantial difference is an increase of the aggregate industry retention amount from 175 billion and 20 billion to 25 billion and 275 billion for 2006 and 2007 current congressional action with the extended tria set to expire at the end of 2007 many in congress have called for further legislation to reauthorize the program both chairman christopher dodd of the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee and chairman barney frank of the house financial services committee indicated early in the session that terrorism insurance legislation was high priority for their committees in the 110th congress the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee held hearing on february 28 2007 entitled examining the terrorism risk insurance program and the house financial services subcommittee on capital markets insurance and government sponsors enterprises held two hearings the need to extend the terrorism risk insurance act in new york city on march 5 2007 and policy options for extending the terrorism risk insurance act on april 24 2007 terrorism risk insurance revision and extension act of 2007 trirea representative michael capuano along with 23 cosponsors introduced hr 2761 on june 18 2007 referred to the financial services committee the bill was the subject of hearing in that committees subcommittee on capital markets insurance and government sponsored enterprises on june 21 2007 hr 2761 as introduced would have extended and revised the current structure of the terrorism risk insurance program adding significant new elements to this structure within the existing tria structure the bill would have extended the program 10 years to the end of 2017 while reducing the program trigger to 50 million and generally leaving the individual insurer deductibles and aggregate retention unchanged at 20 of direct earned premium and 275 billion respectively it also would have expanded the scope of tria by including domestic terrorism as covered event adding group life insurance as covered line and mandating that insurers make available coverage for nbcr terrorist events under the bill as introduced group life insurance would have had separate pool with its own deductibles and recoupment amounts based on the amount of insurance at risk rather than direct earned premiums nbcr coverage would have had lower 75 crs11 deductible compared to nonnbcr terrorist events 20 in addition hr 2761 as introduced included socalled reset provisions that would have lowered the program thresholds for areas that have suffered past terrorist attacks or that suffer terrorist attacks in the future if the damage from the attacks exceeds 1 billion finally the bill would have expanded the mandatory availability provisions to include restrictions on life insurers ability to consider lawful international travel as factor in underwriting decisions hr 2761 was marked up by the house financial services committees subcommittee on insurance capital markets and government sponsored enterprises on july 24 2007 and by the full committee on august 1 200717 substantial amendments were adopted at both markups the subcommittee markup began with complete substitute amendment by chairman kanjorski being adopted by voice vote this substitute changed the nbcr provisions delaying the make available provisions until 2009 and lowering the deductible to 35 with 05 increase per year it also included requirement for biennial reporting on the tria program by the treasury and changed the composition of the independent commission created by the bill to make recommendations on the program several amendments to reduce the 10 year extension of the program were rejected as was one to require full recoupment of federal funds expended beyond the 275 billion aggregate retention amount in current law amendments adopted by the subcommittee included one by representative gary ackerman to include the secretary of homeland security in the certification of terrorist attack under tria and one by representative richard baker to apply the lower trigger amount in the retrospective reset provisions to the entire country rather than just to the affected area the full committee markup began with an amendment by chairman frank making number of technical changes and three primary substantive changes first chairman franks amendment changed the reset provisions removing the retrospective reset altogether and applying the prospective reset provisions to the entire country thus if there is future terrorist attack resulting in more than 1 billion in damages the trigger would by reduced to 5 million and the insurer deductible would be reduced to 5 for those insurers suffering terrorism losses second it included temporary preemptions from state rate and form approval laws for nbcr coverage mandated under the bill third it established terrorism buy down fund in the us treasury which would essentially allow insurers to put aside reserves that would grow taxfree to cover losses from future terrorist attacks that are not reimbursed by tria the us treasury could also borrow from this fund to cover the federal share of future terrorist attack the committee adopted number of additional amendments including 1 an exemption for small insurers from the requirement to make nbcr coverage available 2 the return of farmowners multiple peril as triacovered line 3 the specific allowance for insurers to partner in meeting the requirement to make nbcr coverage available 4 the indexing of the various dollar amounts in the bill to an unspecified measure of inflation 5 the provision for report by the secretary of the treasury in the event that the secretary decides not to recoup expended federal funds beyond 275 billion 17 the full committee markup began on july 26 but hr 2761 was the last of number of bills to be marked up crs12 6 the extension of the program for 15 years to the end of 2022 and 7 an increase in the postreset deductible by 05 per year the amended bill was forwarded to the full house by vote of 4920 the congressional budget office cbo issued cost estimate for hr 2761 on september 6 2007 cbo found that the bill as reported would increase direct spending by 37 billion from 2008 to 2012 and 104 billion from 2008 to 2017 this spending would be offset by additional revenues of about 100 million from 2008 to 2012 and 20 billion from 2008 to 2017 since the cost estimate found that an increase in the budget deficit or decrease in surplus would result from the bill it may run afoul of the payasyougo paygo rule adopted by the house at the beginning of the 110th congress18 in response to the paygo issues the special rule hres 660 under which trirea was considered on the house floor included selfexecuting amendment that inserted language into the underlying bill that would require passage by congress of joint resolution before any funds could be expended hres 660 provides for expedited consideration of this future resolution including waiver of all points of order against it and its consideration this requirement for future congressional action introduces uncertainty to the tria program that did not exist before it is unclear exactly how the insurance market might react to this uncertainty should this language become law hr 2761 was brought up on the house floor
