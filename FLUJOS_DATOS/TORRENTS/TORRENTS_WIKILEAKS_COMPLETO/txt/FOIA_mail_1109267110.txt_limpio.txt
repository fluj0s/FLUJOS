eugene r wahlealfrededu scott rutherford srutherfordrwuedu thanks keith ive made these changes and few very minor changes just to improve the grammar in places etc also im embarassed to say that scotts name was accidentally left out of the author list so ive included that back in there was one bit about the highpass filtering and lowpass filtering which you changed based on i think some minor confusion about what i meant ive fixed that im assuming that tim will be ok w the attached final version so im going to go ahead and submit to nature now well have ample opportunity for revision at later stage lets cross our fingers thanks again everyone mike at 1101 am 2242005 keith briffa wrote sorry mike still dashing but attached shows some slight wording changes only early and late missed track changes so just compare sorry to mess up otherwise go with this for now and lets see reaction keith t 0040 22022005 you wrote dear phil et all of the suggested changes have been made and some others additional changes have been made for clarification including descriptions of updated versions of the figures scott can you get to pdf versions of figures 1 and 3 that have the correct degrees symbol on the axis alsowe need an updated url for the pseudoproxy data at foxrwuedu as noted thanks in advance for getting back to asap on these changes indicated in yellow highlighting will try to prepare final draft for submission once ive heard back from keith tim and anyone else who has any remaining comments ive also attached draft cover letter to go to nature along w the submission thanks mike at 0914 am 2212005 phil jones wrote mike heres few modifications to the text keith and tim are pretty happy with it as well but thell reply as soon as they have some time off again tomorrow to chicago back in next week happy for you to submit this as soon as you have their and other comments cheers phil at 2244 12022005 michael mann wrote sorry text revised yet again more changes until i receive comments from everyone thanks mike at 1203 pm 2112005 phil jones wrote mike keith and tim are here next week but very busy with proposal to the eu so you may have to hassle them bit or hang on for week or two nature dragged in the ipcc angle which annoyed i tried to explain to him how ipcc works ipcc wont be discussing this in beijing in may except as part of chapter 6 hans von storch will likely regret some of the words hes said fyi just as ncar have put up web site to give the whole story re chris landseass resignation from ca in the atmos obs chapter to help kevin trenberth out knmi are doing the same re rob van dorland and that dutch magazine the chief scientist at knmi has got involved as rob didnt say the things attributed to him ill find out more on this in pune as guy from knmi will be there several other cas on our chapter pulled out or just didnt do anything their stories never got run dicks report was good and my bit in nature cam across well say hi to all there and wish steve well cheers phil at 1619 11022005 michael mann wrote philthanks thats great really happy to hear that everyone is on board with this im at symposium honoring steve schneider out at stanford right now lots of folks hereas i talk this over w them and see dick kerrs coverage of this etc i realize its not so badi was afraid this would be spun as bolstering the contrarians but it hasnt in large part due to quotes from you and others pointing out that the study actually reinforces the key conclusions etc and the fact dick kerr showed keith and tims plot showing the scattering of multiple reconstructions etc which takes the focus off mann bit nonetheless i am convinced their methodology is suspect as the analysis i sent shows so i will really appreciate input from keith tim and you to make sure the language and wording are appropriate and fair i will revise as i get input from various people with an aim to having this submissionready in about 10 days so you can have one final look after you return and before you have to head out again looking forward to getting peoples comments feedback etc thanks again mike at 0805 am 2112005 phil jones wrote mike et ive talked to keith and tim here and it seems best if we all come in with you on this response what you have done is basically fine we can discuss specific wording later my problem is that im off tomorrow to pune till feb 20 and email may be sporadic or nonexistent so can you discuss revised drafts with keith and tim but keep on lower down as im away im here on feb 21 then off to chicago to review the vertical temperature report for the nrcnas feb 2225 keep on the emails in case email works well in pune cheers phil at 2335 10022005 michael mann wrote dear caspar gene scott phil i am attaching response ive drafted to the moberg et paper attached for those of you who havent seen it the message is pretty clear and simpletheir method overemphasizes the lowfrequency variability to demonstrate this ive made use of stuff from mann and jones and from the mannrutherfordwahlammann j climate letter on pseudoproxies so i would welcome any of you to be coauthors on thisjust let now if youre interested ive been in touch w keith he and tim are potentially working on their own independent responsewaiting to hear further this is very rough draft so comments much appreciated looking forward to hearing back mike
