especially from 1980 forward to continuing military deployments especially us military participation in multinational operations associated with na to or the united nations most of these post1980 instances are summaries based on presidential reports to congress related to the war powers resolution comprehensive commentary regarding any of the instances listed is not undertaken here the

2001 attacks on the united states and the war with iraq in 2003 with the exception of the korean war all of these conflicts received congressional authorization in some form short of formal declaration of war other more recent instances often involve deployment of us military forces as part of multinational operation associated with na to or the united nations the majority of the instances listed prior to world war ii were brief marine or navy actions to protect us citizens or promote us interests number were actions against pirates or bandits covert actions disaster relief

list reviews hundreds of instances in which the united states has utilized military forces abroad in situations of military conflict or potential conflict to protect us citizens or promote us interests the list does not include covert actions or numerous instances in which us forces have been stationed abroad since world war ii in occupation forces or for participation in mutual security organizations base agreements or routine military assistance or training operations because of differing judgments over the actions to be included other lists may include more or fewer instances 1 the instances vary greatly in size of operation legal authorization and significance the number of troops involved range from few sailors or marines landed to protect american lives and property to hundreds of thousands in korea and vietnam and millions in world war ii some actions were of short duration and some lasted number of years in some instances military officer acted without authorization some actions were conducted solely under the presidents powers as chief executive or commander in chief other instances were authorized by congress in some fashion in eleven separate cases listed in boldface type the united states formally declared war against foreign nations for most of the instances listed however the status of the action under domestic or international law has not been addressed most instances listed since 1980 are summaries of us military deployments reported to congress by the president as result of the war powers resolution several of these presidential reports are summaries of activities related to an ongoing operation previously reported it is important to note that inclusion in this list does not connote either legality or level of significance of the instance described this report covers uses of us military force abroad from 1798 through mid september 2007 it will be revised as circumstances warrant
