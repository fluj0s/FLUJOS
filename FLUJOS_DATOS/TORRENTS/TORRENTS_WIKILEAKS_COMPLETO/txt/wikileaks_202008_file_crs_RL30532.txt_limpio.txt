army training facility founded in 1946 largely for spanishspeaking cadets and officers from latin american nations the school was located at fort benning georgia controversies developed in recent years concerning human rights abuses committed by school graduates and there were several legislative attempts since 1993 to cut funding for the school the school was charged by pl 100180 10 usc 4415 with the mission of developing and conducting instruction for the armed forces of latin america the law stipulated that the school would promote military professionalism foster cooperation among the multinational military forces in latin america and expand latin american armed forces knowledge of us customs and traditions according to critics the school had abusive graduates who violated human rights they maintained that soldiers who were chosen to attend were not properly screened with the result that some students and instructors attended the school even after being implicated in human rights violations in september 1996 concerns over the school intensified when dod made available excerpts from seven spanish language training manuals used at the school from 1982 until 1991 the manuals discussed forms of coercion against insurgents including execution and torture supporters of the school contended that it had the potential to help bring about greater respect for human rights in latin america by providing human rights training to thousands of latin american military officials supporters maintained that those graduates who committed human rights violations did not commit the violence because of their training at fort benning but rather in spite of it they argued that only small number out of total of over 60000 school graduates have been accused of human rights violations supporters also argued that most latin american militaries now support civilian democratic rule congressional oversight of the school of the americas increased since 1993 essentially focusing on human rights issues four house attempts to cut funding for the school were rejected in 1993 1994 1997 and 1998 in 1999 the house voted to cut funding for the school during consideration of

extent and effectiveness of such instruction see human rights training below prior to 1989 the school notes that it provided human rights training both formallyin classroom instruction on the laws of land warfareand informallythrough exposure to american institutions since 1989 the school established policy on human rights training and revised its curriculum to integrate human rights training into every course taught according to the school the basic block of human rights instruction was 8 hours long but almost all students received substantially more than 8 hours with additional training woven into the classroom instruction and into field training exercises according to the department of the army the school of the americas budget for fy2000 was estimated to total 4455 million from two principal sources the schools fixed budget came principally from operations and maintenance army oma which was provided through the defense departments authorization and appropriations legislation for fy2000 the schools oma funding level was estimated to be 3117 million the oma funding paid for all of the schools overhead costs including civilian pay guest instructor program costs supplies and equipment certain travel expenses and contracts about 90 of oma funds were spent on civilian pay and the guest instructor program additional dod funding for fy2000 was estimated to total 88000 the

concerns about the school centered on graduates who were implicated inor are alleged to have been responsible forhuman rights violations in their countries in recent years congressional oversight focused on the adequacy of the selection and screening crs3 process for the schools students and on the adequacy of human rights training at the school human rights violations according to critics the school had history and tradition of abusive graduates who violated human rights observers pointed out that school alumni included 48 out of 69 salvadoran military members cited in the truth commissions report on salvador for involvement in human rights violations including 19 of 27 military members implicated in the 1989 murder of six jesuit priests2 and more than 100 colombian military officers alleged to have been responsible for human rights violations by 1992 report issued by several human rights organizations3 school graduates have also included several peruvian military officers linked to the july 1992 killings of nine students and professor from cantuta university other graduates included several honduran officers linked to clandestine military force known as battalion 316 responsible for disappearances in the early 1980s4 critics maintained that soldiers who were chosen to attend were not properly screened with the result that some students and instructors have attended the school after being implicated in human rights violations for example in 1995 concerns over the school were heightened when it was reported that guatemalan army colonel julio roberto alpirez implicated in human rights violations had been trained at the school in 1989 colonel alpirez was implicated in march 1995 press allegations for involvement in the 1990 murder of us citizen michael devine and the 1992 killing of guatemalan guerilla leader efrain bamarca velasquez married to us citizen jennifer harbury 5 in september 1996 concerns over the school intensified when dod made available excerpts from seven spanishlanguage training manuals used periodically at the school of the americas from 1982 until 1991 the manuals discussed forms of coercion against insurgents including execution torture and blackmail 6 subsequently in february 1997 dod inspector general concluded that repeated mistakes were made that resulted in objectionable material being included in the manuals but that there was deliberate attempt to violate dod or us army policies and that further investigation was necessary to assess individual responsibility 2 the truth commission

crs4 concerns about the schools graduates were again raised in january 2000 when retired guatemala col byron disrael lima estrada who attended the school of the americas in the 1960s was arrested for involvement in the death of guatemalan bishop juan jose gerardi in 1998 bishop gerardi was murdered in april 1998 just two days after he released report accusing the guatemalan military for most of the human rights abuses committed during the countrys civil conflict7 some critics labeled the school of the americas school for dictators because of the high number of former latin american dictators who attended the school among the ten former latin american heads of state who attended the school of the americas two were panamanian military rulers general manuel antonio noriega facto ruler from 1983 until his ouster from power by us forces in december 1989 and general omar torrijos who emerged as panamas political leader after the national guard overthrew the elected civilian government in 1968 torrijos ruled either as official head of government or facto political leader until his death in plane crash in 1981 two additional school alumni who were military rulers are ecuadorian major general guillermo rodriguez 197276 and peruvian major general juan velasco alvarado 19681975 both of whom overthrew elected governments breaking with the pattern of previous military leaders in these two countries rodriguez and alvarado initiated extensive periods of direct military rule seven years in ecuador and twelve years in peru the six remaining latin american military rulers who attended the school of the americas consist of two each from argentina bolivia and honduras all of whom succeeded military rulers in argentina lieutenant general roberto viola led shortlived military government from march to december 1981 after argentinas return to democracy viola was convicted and sentenced to 17 years in prison for criminal responsibility for human rights violations during argentinas socalled dirty war against subversion in the 1970s8 viola was succeeded by lieutenant general leopoldo galtieri another school graduate who ruled from december 1981 until june 1982 galtieri led argentina during the unsuccessful war with britain over the falkland islands in bolivia general hugo banzer suarez led bloody coup in 1971 according to many observers banzers rule until 1978 was repressive with labor leaders and leftist politicians exiled jailed and killed9 in contrast another school graduate from bolivia major general guido vildoso calderon who ruled from july to october 1982 was chosen by the military to return the country to civilian rule in honduras brigadier general juan melgar castro became president in 1975 when the military command ousted another military

boulder co westview press 1990 p 369 banzer became president once again in 1997 when he won in free and fair elections crs5 supporters of the school pointed out that in many latin american countries military service is traditionally an avenue to political and economic leadership they contended that the opportunity to train thousands of latin american military officials at the school on us human rights processes and international human rights has significant potential for bringing about greater respect for human rights in latin america supporters of the school maintained that only small number out of total of over 60000 school graduates have been accused of human rights violations they argued that those graduates who have committed human rights violations did not commit the violence because of their training at fort benning but rather in spite of it acknowledging the past abuses of some graduates some school supporters recommended stricter set of criteria for student selection along with restrictions for countries with high percentage of students later convicted of human rights violations the department of the army maintained that the united statesthrough the department of stateactively and continuously screened potential candidates for training for any record of human rights abuse criminal activity or corruption according to dod the state department sent cable to us embassies in 1994 reminding them of the requirement to screen prospective students supporters of the school contended that democracy was being respected throughout the region and that the school of the americas played key role in the resurgence and defense of democracy in latin america they pointed out that latin america is now more democratic and less militaristic than at any time since the second world war they contended that most of the cited military leaders were in power more than decade ago and that the more recent record demonstrated that most militaries throughout latin america now support civilian democratic rule and defend civilian governments from coup attempts they argued that two of the military leaders discussed above honduran general policarpo paz garcia and bolivian general guido vildoso calderon were responsible for transferring power back to civilian democratic rule as examples of school success stories supporters of the school pointed to former ecuadorian minister of defense who began comprehensive human rights training program for the military in 1993 and three high ranking venezuelan military officers all school alumni who played key roles either in putting down or preventing the success of two coup attempts in 1992 human rights training critics of the school maintained that it only paid lip service to human rights training for its students they asserted that few hours of human rights training will not make difference and that there is hostile attitude among the students regarding the mandatory human rights training former school logistics instructor retired army major joseph blair maintained that the human rights message was not taken seriously by the latin american students and contended that the soldiers associate human rights with subversives10 guest human rights lecturer at the school believed that the schools changes in its human rights curriculum was nothing more than facelift and said that much of the training at the school was done by officers from latin american militaries which had strongly resisted increased 10 mccarthy tim school aims at military control national catholic reporter april 8 1994 p 11 crs6 civilian control and accountability11 critics of the school maintained that although some courses for civilian participation were offered at the school actually most students were from latin american militaries and police according to 1996 general accounting office report less than 1 of the schools students were civilians12 supporters of the school pointed out that since 1989 it began to emphasize human rights training throughout its curriculum making it unique among us army schools they indicated that the school also began to meet expanded imet objectives by including courses for civilian officials on the creation and maintenance of effective military judicial systems and military codes of conduct school supporters maintained that for many latin american soldiers the school was the only training they would receive in human rights and that the school provided unique setting to influence latin american militaries on the importance of respecting human rights according to major michael travaglione former chaplain for the school who took part in many of the practical exercises involving human rights training the human rights message was getting across to the students13 supporters also pointed to efforts by the school to improve its promotion of human rights including the addition of class in december 1994 to show students how to develop human rights training program in their own country the formation of an internal human rights advisory committee to oversee the human rights content of coursework at the school and the formation of board of visitors in 1996 which included noted human rights advocates14 proposed restructuring of the school in november 1999 secretary of the army louis caldera discussed with reporters concept that envisioned restructuring of the school making it more academic and recruiting civilians from latin american governments as well as military students from the region as outlined in the press at the time the proposal would rewrite the schools charter with the objective of making it regional training institute that would focus on fighting postcold war security problems15 more courses on democracy and international law would reportedly be added to the curricula although combat training would be provided 11 call charles t academy of torture miami herald august 9 1993 12 us general accounting office school of the americas

both the house and senate versions of the fy2001 defense authorization bill hr 4205 although there are some differences in the provisions of the two versions both repealed the current legislative authority for the school and replaced it with new institute that would provide professional education and training to military law enforcement and civilian personnel from nations in the western hemisphere in the house version the new facility would be called the defense institute for hemispheric security cooperation while in the senate version it would be called the western hemisphere institute for professional education and training both versions provided for board of visitors to review the institutes curriculum for more details on the two bills see legislative action below some critics of the school expressed skepticism that such proposal would go far enough in repairing its reputation and believed that as long as the school still existed in some form even with new name problems would remain16 other critics maintained that the proposal contained substantive reforms that would change existing practices and argued the new institute called for by the secretary of the army was clone of the old school they argued that before new institute was created there should be thorough investigation of the existing school and critical evaluation made of the training model upon which it was based on the other hand supporters of the proposal to reconstitute the school as new institute argued that the new facility would emphasize such topics as human rights the rule of law due process the appropriate role of military in democratic society and missions such as disaster assistance and counterdrug operations they believed that just as the old school the new institute would serve vital role in its ability to have an impact of the thought and actions of latin american militaries legislative action congressional oversight of the school of the americas increased since 1993 essentially focusing on concerns over human rights issues in 19931994 the house voted twice on measures to cut funding for the school but these were rejected however legislative action in 1994 did require report on the schools promotion of respect for human rights and civilian authority in 1995 and 1996 there were congressional votes to restrict funding for the school in defense or foreign operations measures although the house appropriations committee did include language on the school regarding human rights training in its reports accompanying foreign operations bills for those two years in 1996 the committee requested report on the schools selection process and monitoring of the human rights practices of its graduates in 1997 the house rejected an amendment to eliminate funding for the school during september consideration of the fy1998 foreign operations appropriations bill hr 2159 but that same bill contained house provision prohibiting imet funding for the school unless

which was to detail the selection and screening process for students and longterm monitoring of the schools graduates was due to congress by january 15 1997 but was not received until june 25 1997 the committee asserted that the report was woefully inadequate and did not respond to the committees specific request the report provided brief general information on the selection and screening process of school candidates indicating that it differs from country to country and that the host country is responsible for selection and initial screening according to the dod report after candidate is selected by the host country the name is forwarded to the us embassy and all appropriate us mission offices and agenciesare expected to conduct thorough background check against their own records with regard to longterm monitoring of the schools graduates the report stated that neither dod nor the department of state have formal monitoring programs but noted that some us embassies maintain records
