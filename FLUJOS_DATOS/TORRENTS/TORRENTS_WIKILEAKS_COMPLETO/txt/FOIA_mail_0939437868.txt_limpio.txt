from wolfgang cramer wolfgangcramerpikpotsdamde to mike hulme mhulmeueaacuk subject re apologies date fri 8 oct 1999 225748 0200 replyto wolfgang cramer wolfgangcramerpikpotsdamde dear mike i can understand you very well i would have been more nervous about this hadnt the preparations and registrations been going as well as they have done just now i feel pretty comfortable about the meeting sure its pity not having you around but i guess you are taking the appropriate decision under your particular circumstances perhaps i shouldnt be doing this but let add very confidential piece of information for you it wont make your life less stressful during the next few days and i really must ask you to keep this confidential at your end since i am effectively breaking confidentiality here and i wouldnt want edinburgh to know that but i received the following email on october 6 dear dr cramer i am contacting you on behalf of prof paul jarvis to check whether you are willing to have your name mentioned in association with project he is hoping to undertake the project is part of much larger package of projects which forms the nucleus of bid being made by the university of edinburgh and other partners to host new climate change centre to be funded by the uk research councils at 10 million gbp over 5 years for further details of this opportunity see httpwwwnercacukpressaooclimhtml i work in small unit of the university of edinburgh that has responsibility for coordinating multidisciplinary environmental research bids currently we are preparing the outline bid deadline 15 october so nothing should be regarded as firm and details will be open to modification in the full bid which we will prepare if the outline bid is successful below i reproduce the text we are proposing to include in the outline bid please confirm whether or not you are willing to have your name included please treat this email as confidential best regards simon allen dr s j allen research coordinator centre for the study of environmental change and sustainability cecs university of edinburgh john muir building kings buildings mayfield road edinburgh eh9 3jk tel 0131 650 7215 email simonallenedacuk fax 0131 650 7214 httpwwwcecsedacuk issue will terrestrial carbon sinks saturate it has been proposed that the assimilation of co2 by vegetation will reach saturation within the foreseeable future as atmospheric co2 concentrations continue to rise and that conversely increase in temperature will lead to openended increase in respiration by soil heterotrophs so that at some point in the not too distant future co2 efflux will come to exceed co2 influx this farreaching assumption derives from global models that lack consideration of acclimation feed backs and biological constraints acting on these processes this proposition will be critically evaluated using dynamic global vegetation models dgvms that include appropriate feed backs derived from new data that are becoming available from ongoing experiments in the uk and elsewhere this core project will be executed over two years by research fellow at the university of edinburgh under the supervision of professor paul jarvis frs the project will involve close collaboration with the max planck institut fur biogeochemie prof i colin prentice and the potsdam institute for climate impacts research dr wolfgang cramer where fully

50 k 52 k travelinteraction 4 k 4 k total project cost 54 k 56 k end of edinburgh mail to this comes at very strange moment since i am with bert bolin in very strange situation with the completion of our second draft of the ipcc special report on sinks due land use and forestry the very issue they propose to collaborate with colin and myself about was the most contentious one of all and paul on one side and several others including myself on the other side had diametrically opposing opinions in fact i simply believe jarvis either wasnt able or not wasnt willing to understand what the real issue was anyway i dont know whether and if in which way this may or may not affect your completion of the uea bid but i thought id better let you know obviously i discussed this with colin and his response is that he would place his bet on your rather than the edinburgh bid in terms of potential success and b that he nevertheless thinks edinburgh is proposing the appropriate thing to do here and that he therefore will reply positive to their request for collaboration unless you see strong reason for recommending to not do the same we can talk about this in brussels of course i shall probably reply in the same positive way take care wolfgang ps i am really uncertain whether i do something terribly bad in sending this to you after the explicit request for confidentiality so please keep this among the two of us on freitag 8 oktober 1999 you wrote wolfgang i shall have to apologise but i will not be able to make the eclat meeting at all the pressures of getting our uk national climate change centre outline bid together for the 15th october are now such that i have to be here on the 13th and 14th being in brussels in the 12th is not very helpful either but i can at least get back to uea for wednesdaythursday to wrap up the bid i have the lead responsibility now at uea for coordinating our proposal 8 institutions 24coapplicants so you can imagine the headaches involved but we want to make sure hansjoachim has good proposal tabled from uea when he meets with the assessment panel later in november i really regret not being there you have done great job in pulling the programme and people together amidst ipcc activities i have asked tim carter to present the ipccacacia speech and i am sure he will tim carter and david viner will coordinate over what needs doing for the proceedings which i insist will be cramer et ed 19992000 publication david and ruth will bring several dozen copies of the helsinki book for distribution it is important to get the breakout groups to get text together on their deliberations while at the meeting you will see what we have done to the helsinki material for the green workshop we should not exceed 100pp cf 128pp for helsink and colour should be avoided where possible cru will take over the subediting and desktop publishing role again i guess i will see you in brussels anyway gabi please cancel my hotel reservation and travel pickup thank you for your efficiency in organising all this best regards mike mailtowolfgangcramerpikpotsdamde
