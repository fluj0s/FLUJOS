congress ronald orourke foreign aﬀairs defense and trade division june 15 2007 abstract the issue for congress is whether to maintain current practices for funding navy ship procure ment or change them by for example increasing the use of incremental funding or starting to use advance appropriations congresss decision on this issue could be signiﬁcant because the full funding policy relates to congresss power of the purse and its responsibility for conducting oversight of department of defense dod programs consequently the issue can be alternately expressed as how to procure navy ships eco nomically while maintaining key congressional prerogatives congresss decision on ship funding approaches could also aﬀect future navy capabilities annual navy funding requirements and the shipbuilding

congresss ability to control dod spending and carry out its oversight of dod activities under incremental funding weapons cost is di vided into two or more annual increments that congress approves separately each year supporters could argue that using it could avoid or mitigate budget spikes associated with procuring very expensive ships such as aircraft carriers or largedeck amphibious assault ships opponents could argue that using it could make total ship procurement costs less visible and permit one congress to budgetarily tie the hands of future congresses under advance appropriations congress makes onetime decision to fund the entire procurement cost of an end item that cost can then be divided into two or more annual increments that are assigned to in budget terminology scored in two or more fiscal years supporters could argue that using advance appropriations could avoid or mitigate budget spikes without some of the potential disadvantages of incremental funding opponents could argue that advance appropriations retains or even expands key potential disadvantage of incremental findingthat of tying the hands of future congresses using incremental funding or advance appropriations could under certain circumstances marginally reduce the cost of navy ships under certain other circumstances however it could increase costs options for congress include ma intaining current shipprocurement funding practices strengthening adherence to the full funding policy increasing the use of incremental funding beginning to use advance appropriations and transferring leadship detailed design and nonrecurring engineering costs to the research and development account arguments could be made in support of or against each of these options this report will be updated as events

navy ships were procured with incremental funding which is discussed in the next section for dod procurement programs the full funding policy requires the entire procurement cost of usable end item such as navy ship to be funded in the year in which the item is procured the policy applies not just to navy ships but to all weapons and equipment that dod procures through the procurement title of the annual dod appropriations act in general the full funding policy means that dod cannot contract for the construction of new weapon or piece of equipment until funding for the entire cost of that item has been approved by congress sufficient funding must be available for complete usable end item before contract can be let for the construction of that item under traditional full funding portion of usable end items procurement cost is funded in year after the year in which the item is procured 1 crs report rl31404 defense procurement full funding policybackground issues and options for

imposed the full funding policy on dod in the 1950s to make the total procurement costs of dod weapons and equipment more visible and thereby enhance congresss ability to understand and track these costs congresss intent in imposing the policy was to strengthen discipline in dod budgeting and improve congresss ability to control dod spending and carry out its oversight of dod activities understandin g total costs and how previously appropriated funds are used are key components of congresss oversight capability the full funding policy is consistent with two basic laws regarding government expenditures the antideficiency act of 1870 as amended and the adequacy of appropriations act of 1861 regulations governing the full funding policy are found in office of management and budget omb circular a11 and dod directive 700014r which provide guidelines on budget formulation omb circular a11 states among other things that good budgeting requires that appropriations for the full costs of asset acquisition be enacted in advance to help ensure that all costs and benefits are fully taken into account at the time decisions are made to provide resources full funding with regular appropriations in the budget year also leads to tradeoffs within th budget year with spending for other capital assets and with spending for purposes other than capital assets full funding increases the opportunity to use performancebased fixed price contracts allows for more efficient work planning and management of the capital project or investment and increases the accountability for the achievement of the baseline goals when full funding is not followed and capital projects or investments or useful segments are funded in increments without certainty if or when future funding will be available the result is sometimes poor planning acquisition of assets not fully justified higher acquis ition costs cancellation of major investments the ss of sunk costs or inadequate funding to maintain and operate the assets 2 support for the full funding policy has been periodically reaffirmed over the years by congress the government accountability office gao and dod3

assembly facility such as shipyard but at separate supplier firms in navy shipbuilding ap payments have most commonly been used to pay for nuclearpropulsion components of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers and submarines congress in recent years has occasionally approved ap funding for conventionally powered navy ships such as destroyers and amphibious ships for which the navy did not request any ap funding for longlead items congress in recent years has also occasionally approved ap funding for advance construction work on certain ships which apparently refers to early shipyard activities for building the basic structure of ship as opposed to manufacturing longlead components to be installed into the ship the use of ap funding for shipyard advance construction activities is not recognized in executive branch budget regulations on the full funding policy at least not in the same way as these regulations recognize the use of ap funding for longlead components congressional decisions to approve ap funding for ships for which the navy did not request such funding or for shipyard advance construction activities could be aimed at one or more of the following goals generating shipyard construction work and thus shipyard revenues and jobs on particular ship in year prior to that ships year of procurement creating an early financial commitment to procuring ship that is planned for procurement in future year which can enhance job security for construction workers at the yard that would build the ship reducing the total construction cost of ship through improved sequencing or year toyear balancing of shipyard construction work and reducing the portion of ships cost to be funded in the year of procurement

procurement programs use annual cont racting under which dod lets one or more contracts for each years worth of procurement of given item multiyear procurement is special contracting authority approved by congress on programbyprogram basis that permits dod to use single contract to procure set of end items that are scheduled to be procured across series of up to five fiscal years ie th budget year in question plus up to four future years an myp arrangement approved for the navys fa18ef strikefighter program for example permitted the navy to use single contract for total of 198 to 224 fa18efs procured during the fiveyear period fy2000fy 2004 congress over the years has granted myp authority for relatively small number of procurement programs

governing myp arrangements is set forth in 10 usc 2306b this provision permits ap funding to be used to finance at the outset of an myp arrangement the procurement of long lead components for all of the end items to be procured under the myp arrangement the myp arrangement to procure total of five virginia ssn774 class nuclearpowered attack submarines over the fiveyear period fy2004fy2008 for example permits the navy to procure in the first years of the arrangement five sets of longlead nuclearpropulsion components this upfront batch procurement of longlead items is called an economic order quantity eoq because it procures ie places an order for these items in the form of batch that can be manufactured in an efficient ie economic manner 5

funding provided in prior years most dod procurement items are funded through single decision by congress to provide the entire cost of the item in the items year of procurement for this reason the full funding policy for dod procurement programs can be described in simplified terms as one decision for one pot of money 6

policy few navy and dod ships have been procured in recent years are currently being procured or are proposed to be procured with incremental funding examples include dod sealift ships the attack submarine ssn23 the amphibious assault ships lhd6 lhd8 and lha6 7 the first two ddg1000 formerly ddx destroyers and the aircraft carrier cvn78 the dod sealift ships were procured through the national defense sealift fund ndsf dod revolving and management fund that is outside the procurement title of the dod appropriations act and therefore not subject to the full funding policy in the same way as dod procurement programs funded through the procurement title lhd8 was incrementally funded by expl icit legislative direction ssn23 lhd6 lha6 the first two ddg1000s and cvn78 amount to cases of facto incremental funding for additional information on these ships see appendix c of this report these ships constitute recent exceptions to the use of full funding in the procurement of navy ships prior to the 5 10 usc 2306bi4b states the secretary of defense may obligate funds appropriated for any fiscal year for advance procurement under contract for the purchase of property only for the procurement of those longlead items necessary in order to meet planned delivery schedule for complete major end items that are programmed under the contract to be acquired with funds appropriated for subseq uent fiscal year including an economic order quantity of such longlead items when authorized by law 6 when congress approves ap funding for an item it does so through funding decision for that year that is separate from the decision that congress subsequently makes in the items year of procurement to fund the remainder of the items procurement cost items procured with ap funding thus involve two or more funding decisions from congressone or more decisions to approve ap funding in one or more years prior to the year of procurement plus final decision in the items year of procurement to fund the remainder of the items procurement cost decision by congress to approve ap funding for an item does not create an obligation on the part of congress to approve the remainder of the items procurement cost in some future year but it usually indicates that congress anticipates doing so 7 lha6 is the first of the lha replacement or lhar ships

the full funding policy in the 1950s however much of dod weapon procurement was accomplished through incremental funding under incremental funding weapons cost is divided into two or more annual portions or increments that can reflect the need to make nnual progress payments to the contractor as the weapon is built congress then approves each years increment as part of its action on that years budget under incremental funding dod can contract for the construction of weapon after congress approves only the initial increment of its cost and completion of the weapon is dependent on the

procurement can be advantageous because it can do one or more of the following permit very expensive items such as large navy ships to be procured in given year while avoiding or mitigating budget spikes ie lumps that could require displacing other programs from that years budget which can increase the costs of the displaced programs due to uneconomic programdisruption startup and start costs avoid potential bias against the procurement of very expensive items that might result from use of full funding due to the items large upfront procurement cost which appears in the budget overshadowing the items longterm benefits which do not appear in the budget or its lower life cycle operation and support costs compared to alternatives with lower upfront procurement costs permit construction to start on larger number of items in given year within that years amount of funding so as to achieve better production economies of that item than would have been possible under full funding recognize that certain dod procurement programs particularly those incorporating significant amounts of advanced technology bear some resemblance to research and development activities which can be funde d in increments even though they are intended to produce usable end items reduce the amount of unobligated balances associated with dod procurement programs 8 8 for an explanation and

been used in navy ship procurement but have been used by other executive branch agencies to fund various programs 9 advance appropriations is an alternate form of full funding that is permitted under executive branch budget regulations as funding approach it can be viewed as lying somewhere between traditional full funding and incremental funding advance appropriations is not to be confused with advance procurement ap funding that can occur under traditional full funding under advance appropriations as under traditional full funding congress makes onetime decision to fund the entire procurement cost of an end item that cost however can then be divided into two or more annual increments as under incremental funding that are assigned to in budget terminology scored in two or more fiscal years10 in contrast to incremental funding under which congress must take positive action each year to approve each years funding increment under advance appropriations congress following its initial decision to fund the item would need to take positive action to cancel or modify an annual funding increment in futureyear budget in this sense advance appropriations can be thought of as legislatively locked in form of incremental funding the futureyear funding increments will occur unless congress takes action to stop them omb circular a11 allows for the use of advance appropriations to help finance capital assets under certain circumstances regular appropriations for the full funding of capital project or useful segment or investment of capital project in the budget year are preferred if this results in spikes that in the judgment of omb cannot be accommodated by the agency or the congress combination of regular and advance appropriations that together provide full

principle 1 full funding is met as long as combination of regular and advance appropriations provide budget authority sufficient to complete the capital project or useful segment or investment full funding in the budget year with regular appropriations alone is preferred because it leads to tradeoffs within the budget year with spending for other capital assets and with spending for purposes other than capital assets in contrast full funding for capital project investment over several years with regular appropriations for the first year and advance appropriations for subsequent years may bias tradeoffs in the budget year in favor of the proposed asset becau with advance appropriations the full cost of the asset is not included in the budget year advance appropriations because they are scored in the year they become available for obligation may constrain the budget authority and outlays available for regular appropriations of that year if however the lumpiness caused by regular appropriations cannot be accommodated within an agency or appropriations subcommittee advance appropriations can ameliorate that problem while still providing that all of the budget authority is enacted in advance for the capital project investment or useful segment the latter helps ensure that agencies develop appropriate plans and budgets and that all costs and benefits are identified prior to providing resources in addition amounts of advance appropriations can be matched to funding requirements for completing natural components of the useful segment advance appropriations have the same benefits as regular appropriations for improved planning management and accountability of the project investment 11

futureyear budgets to the financing of an item procured in prior year and requiring positive action from future congresses to undo those commitments opponents could also argue that compared to full funding advance appropriations under certain circumstances could increase shipconstruction costs by causing work on ship to stop and then be restarted specifically they could argue if given increment of construction work on the ship is completed before the end of fiscal year and that years funding increment is entirely expended the navy might have to halt work on the ship and wait until the start of the next fiscal year to access the next increment of funding and re sume work under full funding in contrast the 11 omb circular a11 july 2003 appendix j section c principle 2 of four principles

time that this funding approach is used by several federal agencies other than dod 12 although use of advance appropriations for navy ship procurement was supported by some navy officials and some members of congress13 the navy in 2001 apparently did not receive approval from the office of management and budget omb to use the approach for ship procurement and did not officially propose its use as part of its fy2002 budget submission to congress14 congress in 2001 did not adopt advance appropriations as mechanism for funding navy ships the house appropriations committee in its repo rt hrept 107298 of november 19 2001 on the fy2002 defense appropriations bill hr 3338 stated that it was dismayed that the navy continues to advocate the use of alternative financing mechanisms to artificially increase shipbuilding rates such as advanced appropriations or incremental funding of ships which only serve to decrease cost visibility and accountability on these important programs in attempting to establish advanced appropriations as legitimate budgeting technique those navy advocates of such practices would actually decrease the flexibility of future administrations and congresses to make rational capital budgeting decisions with regard to shipbuilding programs accordingly the committee bill includes 12 source slides for may 3 2001 navy briefing to crs advance appropriations for navy

could using incremental funding or advance appropriations reduce instability in navy ship procurement plans using incremental funding or advance appropriations could help reduce instability in navy ship procurement plans by avoiding or mitigating budget spikes that can occur when traditional full funding is used to procure ships that are very expensive and are procured once every few years the ships that best fit this description are aircraft carriers and largedeck amphibious assault ships16 accommodating budget spikes for such ships within an overall shipprocurement or department of the navy budget for given fiscal year can require the navy to move to other fiscal years other ships that the navy would have preferred to procure in the spike year or conversely require the navy to move the carrier or amphibious assault ship from preferred year of procurement to lesspreferred year that happens to have fewer other navy ships in it such movements of planned ship procurements can be

appropriations could marginally increase the number of ships that could be built for given total amount of shipprocurement funding or conversely marginally reduce the total cost to procure given number of ships by avoiding instances in which budget spikes caused ships to be moved from one year to another in shipprocurement plans using incremental funding or advance appropriations can avoid perturbations in the production schedules for these ships such perturbations can increase the cost of ship reducing at the margin the total number of ships that can be procured for given total amount of ship procurement funding in addition if situation arises in which annual funding for ship procurement limits ship procurement in the near term to low rates with poor production economies of sale

g343g343g561construction to begin on additional ships in the near term improving nearterm production economies of sale while still permitting the navy to procure ships in future years at economic rates of production improving nearterm produc tion economies of scale while preserving acceptable production economies of scale in later years might result in marginally higher average economies of scale for the entire period in question and thereby reduce at the margin the collective cost of all the ships procured in the near term and the later years this second scenario however is dependent on realizing the expected increase in ship procurement funding in the later years if this increase is not realized then using incremental funding or advance appropriations could simply trade poor production economies of scale in the near term for poor production economies of scale in future years put another way it would simply trade an inability to afford something now for an inability to afford something later in discussing the potential effects of using incremental funding or advance appropriations it is possible to construct presentations showing how decision today to begin using incremental funding or advance appropriations can increase perhaps dramatically the number of ships on which construction can be started in the near term this is simply because using incremental funding or advance appropriations would defer much of the procurement cost of the ships in question to future years in those future years the remainder of the cost of these ships would still have to be paid as result other things held equal the number of new ships that could be procured in those future years for given amount of shipprocurement funding will be reduced because portions of those futureyear budgets would now be needed to pay for the ships on which construction had started in prior years presentations that show dramatic nearterm increase in the number of ships on which construction can begin by starting to use incremental funding or advance appropriationsif not tempered by cautions that it would also reduce the number of new ships that can be procured in future years for given amount of shipbuilding fundingcan mislead audiences into concluding that using incremental funding or advance appr opriations can dramatically increase the total number of ships that can be procured over the long run for given total amount of ship procurement funding incremental funding or adva nce appropriations by avoiding perturbations in ship production schedules or improving average production economies of scale over period of several years can marginally reduce shippro curement costs and thereby marginally rather than dramatically increase the total number of sh ips that can be procured over the long run for given amount of shipprocurement funding the reduction in shipprocurement costs might be sufficient for example to increase from 20 to 21 the total number of ships that could be fully paid for with certain total amount of funding under certain other circumstances using incremen tal funding or advance appropriations could increase rather than reduce shipprocurement co sts as discussed earlier using incremental funding can increase the procurement cost of ship if one of more of the ships funding increments is reduced or deferred and the ships production schedule is consequently disrupted in addition if budget circumstances require reducing the shipprocurement budget for given year and some portion of that years budget is already devoted to paying for ships started in prior years with incremental funding or advance appropriations then preserving that portion of the budget so as to avoid disrupting the production schedule of those prioryear ships would mean that the budget reduction would fall more heavily on the remaining part of the shipprocurement budget this could increase the chance that the reduction would lead to decision to defer to future year the procurement of ship planned for that year which could increase the procurement cost of that ship httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32776g16g138g159g162g561g21g145g146

procuring almost all ships with full funding procuring small number eg aircraft carriers and largedeck amphibious assault ships with facto or explicit incremental funding and approving for some ships being fully funded advance procurement ap funding that th navy did not request or for purposes of shipyard advance construction activitie s rather than longlead components supporters of this option could argue that curre nt funding practices give dod and the congress the flexibility to use incremental funding on limited basis for certain ships while not formally abandoning the full funding policy they could similarly argue that current funding practices provide congress with flexibility for using ap f unding for purposes other than funding longlead items requested by dod such flexibility they can argue is important for meeting policy goals such as preserving the shipbuilding industrial base within available funding opponents of this option could argue that current practices weaken adherence to the full funding policy by making even limited use of incremental funding and by using ap funding for purposes other than funding longlead items requested by dod such

involve reducing or eliminating the use of incremental funding in navy ship procurement and reducing or eliminating the use in ships being fully funded of ap funding for purposes other than funding the procurement of longlead items requested by dod supporters could argue that this option by strengthening adherence to the full funding policy would reduce the chance that supporters of other kinds of dod procurement items such as aircraft would seek to have them funded using incremental funding budget spikes associated with procuring aircraft carriers or largedeck amphibious assault ships they could argue can be anticipated years in advance permitting their effects to be carefully managed they could argue that stability in navy shipprocurement plans can be increased by encouraging the navy and dod to better define their thinking regarding navy requirements and that shipprocurement costs can be reduced through measures other than incremental funding or advance appropriations such as multiyear procurement contracts that are structured to provide incentives to shipbuilders to control costs and investment in improved shipyard production capabilities opponents of this policy could argue that it wo uld deprive congress of th flexibility it has under current funding practices to use incremental funding on limited basis when absolutely necessary and to use ap funding for purposes other than funding longlead items requested by dod congress they could argue should not deprive itself of tools that might help improve stability in navy shipbuilding plans reduce shipprocurement costs and preserve the shipbuilding industrial base within available funding congress they could argue has recently taken steps to discourage the spread of incremental funding to dod procurement items other than ships and can continue doing this while preserving some flexibility for itself in funding ship procurement

using incremental funding for aircraft carriers using incremental funding to procure all not just some largedeck amphibious assault ships or both it could also involve funding the procurement of the lead ships of each new class of navy ships in the navys research and development account rather than the shipprocurement account as the navy has proposed in previous years supporters of this option could argue that it would take maximum advantage of opportunities for avoiding or mitigating budget spikes associated with the procurement of these ships they could also argue that it could strengthen the full funding policy by making it clear to observers that only certain ships and other dod procurement item s may be procured with incremental funding they could argue that current funding practicesunder which aircraft carriers and selected other ships can be funded with incremental funding either facto or explicitcan send confusing signals regarding adherence to the full funding policy and that clear explicit policy of using incremental funding only for certain ships would send clear signal that these ships represent special exceptions to an otherwise strict practice of adhering to the full funding policy opponents of this option could argue that any use of incremental funding weakens the full funding policy increasing the likelihood of proposals to use it for funding other dod procurement items incremental funding they could argue should be used to avoid or mitigate budget spikes only when doing so is necessary to avoid disruptions in shipprocurement programs that would

for ships such as aircraft carriers or largedeck amphibious assault ships supporters could argue that this option like the previous one would take maximum advantage of opportunities for avoiding or mitigating budget spikes associated with the procurement of these ships since advance appropriations is form of full funding they could argue that this option would not weaken the full funding policy they could also argue that compared to the previous option this option would create less risk of an increase in the cost of an aircraft carrier or large deck amphibious assault ship due to decision to reduce or defer funding increment because under advance appropriations funding increments occur automatically unless congress takes positive actions to stop them opponents of this option could argue that even though advance appropriations is form of full funding introducing its use into navy ship procurement would still amount to relaxation of the application of the full funding concept to dod procurement that could serve as precedent for subsequent proposals to relax its application still further this option they could argue is unnecessary because budget spike associated with the procurement of an aircraft carrier or largedeck amphibious assault ship can be accomplished through the currently accepted practice of occasionally using incremental funding starting to use advance appropriations for aircraft carriers or largedeck amphibious assault ships they could argue creates risk of increasing the procurement cost of other ships as result of concentrating potential reductions in futureyear shipprocurement budgets on those ships 18

ddnre costs in the procurement cost of the lead unit is practice that is not followed by other dod procurement programs such as prog rams for procuring aircraft ground vehicles and missiles if it were the lead units of these other types of procurement programs would be significantly more expensive to procure one response to the challenge of paying for lead ships whose procurement cost includes significant ddnre costs would be to fund the procurement of lead ships through the navys research and development rd account rather than the navys shipprocurement account as the navy has proposed in 2004 and 2005 this approach which would permit both ddnre costs and the handson construction costs of lead ships to be funded incrementally while not violating the full funding policy can be viewed as an example of the previouslydiscussed option of increasing the use of incremental funding as discussed earlier congress in acting on the navys proposed fy2005 and fy2006 defense budgets rejected the navys proposal to procure the lead ddg1000 through the navys research and development account directed the navy to fully fund the lead ddg1000 in the navys ship procurement account and fully funded the two lead lcss in the navys research and development account an alternative approach to the challenge of paying for lead ships whose procurement cost includes significant ddnre costs would be to treat ddnre work as the final stage of the rd process and transfer ddnre costs to the navys rd account under this option the ddnre costs for ship class could be incrementally funded without violating the full funding policy while the actual handson construction cost of the lead ship would be fully funded in conformance with the full funding policy this option can be viewed as an intermediate pproach that is between the current practice of fully funding both ddnre costs and the lead ships handson construction costs and incrementally funding both these costs in the rd account as would occur under the navys proposal supporters of this option could argue that ddnre work is best viewed as the final stage of research and development and should be treated as such in the budget and that shifting these costs to the rd account would make navy shipprocurement programs look more like dod procurement programs for things such as aircraft ground vehicles and missiles opponents could argue that nnnre work is more closely related to production than to research and that the current practice of including ddnre costs in the procurement cost of the lead ship makes these costs more visible to congress which is important because detailed design costs for certain past navy ships have experienced significant cost growth httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32776g16g138g159g162g561g21g145g146

procuring lha6 but did not recomme nd approval of the navys proposal to use split funding in fy2007 and fy2008 for procur ing the two lead ddg 1000s the committee for fy2007 instead recommended full funding for one ddg1000 and design funding for second the committees report states the budget request recommends incremental funding for 3 of the 7 ships in the request including for the first time construction of surface combatant the nextgeneration destroyer ddx furthermore during the consideration of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2006 pl 109163 the navy sought and was granted the authority to use incremental funding for the next aircraft car rier cvn78 which will be recorded as procured in 2008 the committee remains concerned that the use of incremental funding is not solution to the navys problem in funding shipbuilding while incremental funding can allow the navy to smooth out the dramatic spikes in shipbuilding funding required as result of aircraft carrier construction every four or five years it does not fundamentally increase the number of ships that given amount of money will purchase during the committees hearings on shipbuilding all witnesses emphasized the importance of program and funding stability as the top priority for reducing the cost of shipbuilding and sustaining the shipbuilding industrial base the committee notes that cong ress adopted the full funding policy in the 1950s in part because of concern that incremental funding was detrimental to funding stability future congresses may find themselves unwilling or unable to fund completion of ships begun in prior years and only partially funded the committee remains convinced that the full funding policy is the correct policy for funding shipbuilding the committee understands that the department of defense this year considered submission of legislative proposal that would permanently authorize the use of split funding for aircraft carriers and large deck amphibious ships and the navys fiscal year 2007 shipbuilding plan already assumes such auth ority for the second lha class amphibious assault ship the committee has approved the use of split funding for certain ships in certain cases however the committee does not believe that blanket policy supporting incremental funding for any class of ship is appropriate and has not included such provision in the bill pages

approval of the navys proposed use of split funding fy2007 and fy2008 for procuring lha6 and the two lead ddg1000s the report states the committee recommends provision that would authorize the secretary of the navy to incrementally fund procurement of cvn21 class aircraft carriers over four year periods commencing with cvn78 procurement in fiscal year 2008 the budget request included 7391 million in shipbuilding and conversion navy scn for cvn78 advance procurement and 451 million in scn for cvn79 advance procurement the provision would also authorize advance procurement for cvn80 commencing in fiscal year 2007 in reviewing the budget request for fiscal year 2006 the committee received testimony from the navy and industry that the low rate of shipbuilding was driving higher costs which in turn further reduced shipbuilding rates creating downward spiral the committee believes that stable ship requirements increased fund ing in the shipbuilding budget and increased flexibility for funding large capital ships are critical elements of any strategy to reverse this trend the secretary of the navys fiscal year 2007 report to congress on the longrange plan for the construction of naval vessels identifies requirement to procure the cvn21 class aircraft carriers at 4year intervals commencin g in fiscal year 2008 the navy originally planned to procure the first cvn21 class aircraft carrier cvn78 in fiscal year 2006 since then the navy has delayed procurement to 2008 which has delayed fielding this vital capability while significantly increasing the aircraft carriers procurement cost the committee believes that procuring and deliverin g the cvn21 class aircraft carriers over 4 year periods in accordance with the navys longrange plan is vital to the national defense strategy and is vital to the affordability of these capital ships elsewhere in this report the committee has expressed concern with cost growth on the cvn 77 program and has urged the navy and the shipbuilder to identify opportunities to improve affordability of future aircraft carriers procurement delays excess inflation and material escalation have been reported as significant contributors to cvn77 cost growth the shipbuilder has proposed to achieve significant cvn21 class program savings through stable procurement plan and through procurement of economic order quantity material for cvn79 and cvn80 in conjunction with cvn78 procurement in view of the potential for significant program savings the committee recommends an increase of 500 million in scn for cvn21 class advance procurement and directs the secretary of the navy to review economic order quantity and long lead time material procurement for the cvn21 class the secretary is to submit report to the

procurement of the followon ships of the ddg1000 nextgeneration destroyer program however it is the expectation of congress that the secretary of the navy will structure the ddg1000 program so that

g10g152g158g156g142g561 in its report hrept 109504 of june 16 2006 on hr 5631 the house appropriations committee recommended approval of the administrations proposed use of split funding fy2007 and fy2008 for procuring the amphibious assault ship lha6 but did not recommend approval of the administrations proposal to use split funding in fy2007 and fy2008 for procuring the two lead ddg1000 destroyers the committee for fy2007 instead recommended full funding for one ddg1000 th committees report states for fiscal year 2007 the committee faces several challenges in recommending appropriations for the department of defense and the intelligence community first the presidents budget proposes an unorthodox approach to funding two major procurement programs the f22 fighter of the air force and the ddx destroyer of the navy in both cases the budget request includes incremental or partial funding for these two programs in the case of the f22 incremental funding is requested in the middle of the production run the use of incremental funding mortgages the future of the procurement budget of the defense department in manner that is not acceptable to the committee in addition the precedent of incremental funding for these programs could be applied to variety of other procurements leading to loss of budget transparency and reducing the ability to perform oversight therefore the recommendations in this bill include full funding for one ddx destroyer and the f22 fighter program funding of 2568111000 is recommended to complete full funding of one ddx vessel this is the same level as the funding request for this item but under the presidents budget these funds would have been allocated on an incremental basis against two ships page 4

also states the committee recommends 2568111000 for the procurement of 1 ddx destroyer the budget requested 2568111000 to incrementally fund 2 ships with the balance of funding to be provided in fiscal year 2008 the committee cannot support such farreaching policy change which has implications beyond the navys shipbuilding program further the navys proposal requires special legislative authority to be executed and this authority is not included in the housepassed national defense authorization act 2007 hr 5122 page 139 g21g142g151g138g157g142g561 in its report srept 109292 of july 25 2006 on hr 5631 the senate appropriations committee recommends approving the navys request for fy2007 procurement funding for the first two ddg1000 destroyers the report states consistent with the senatepassed authorization bill and the navys current acquisition strategy the committee recommendation supports the budget request of 2568111000 for dual lead ships the committee reminds the navy that this is unique acquisition strategy and should not be used as precedent for incrementally funding any future ddg1000 or any other shipbuilding program page 115 the report recommends funding the procurement of one littoral combat ship or lcs rather than the requested two in fy2007 and rescinding funding in section 8043 for one of the three lcss procured in fy2006 the report states with the fiscal year 2007 b udget submission of 520670000 for the fifth and sixth lcs flight 0 ships the navy revealed the lcs unit cost estimate used as basis for last years appropriation was exclusive of contract change orders planning and engineering services program management support and other costs not included in the ship construction contract as result the navy is unable to procure both the third and fourth lcs flight 0 ships without the availability of additional funding the committee is troubled by this revelation and recommends rescinding the insufficient fiscal year 2006 funds currently allocated to the fourth lcs flight 0 vessel the committee is further troubled by reports that the first two lcs flight 0 ships under construction are exceeding their cost as prev iously budgeted as result the committee believes the fiscal year 2007 budget request is insufficient to procure two ships and recommends 300670000 to fully fund procurement of one lcs seaframe which is reduction of 220000000 and one seaframe from the request the comm ittee notes that this recommendation puts the navy on its previously established path of procuring four lcs flight 0 ships by the end

g344g343g561the conferees agree to provide 2568111000 for the ddg1000 formerly ddx destroyer program and agree to delete language proposed by the house requiring full funding of single lead ship the effect of the conference agreement would allow the navy to split fund twin lead ships of the ddg1000 cla ss if authorized in separate legislation by the congress this action is being taken based upon the expectation that the total cost of these two ships is well understood and low risk the conferees are willing to make this onetime exception to the full fund ing principle because of the unique situation with the shipbuilding industrial ba and with the ddg1000 program the conferees will not entertain future requests to fund ships other than under the full funding principle except for those historically funded in this manner aircraft carriers and some large deck amphibious ships the unusual procurement of twin lead ships raises the risk that future design changes or production problems will impact two ships under construction simultaneously this could raise costs significantly compared to other lead ship programs however the navy believes the cost and schedule risk in the ddg1000 prog ram is low enough to permit the twin lead ship acquisition strategy the navy has identified the total cost to procure the twin lead ships of the ddg1000 class as 6582200000 the conferees insist that the navy manage this program within that total cost and will be unlikely to increase funding through reprogramming or an additional budget request except in the case of emergency natural disaster or other impact arising from outside the navys shipbuilding program page 180 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32776g16g138g159g162g561g21g145g146

g10g152g158g156g142g561 in its report hrept 109119 of june 10 2005 on hr 2863 the house appropriations committee stated in the section on navy shipbuilding that it supports the lhar amphibious assault ship program and it directs the navy to reconsider its proposal to request split funding for lhar over the fy200708 timeframe and inst ead follow the full funding principle for this ship class to ensure an adequate budget is in hand before contract award page 146 g21g142g151g138g157g142g561 in its report srept 109141 of september 2 9 2005 on hr 2863 the senate appropriations committee stated the committee remains gravely concerned about the overall health and stability of navy shipbuilding fleet inventory and capability requirements remain unstable as do program performance and costs of primary concern are soaring cost overru ns the committee finds unanticipated cost overruns to be the root cause of much of the instability in the program until budget estimates become more realistic requirements stabilize and penalties for exorbitant cost overruns are exercised ship construction costs are unlikely to improve the committee is aware that the new chief of naval operations cno is actively reviewing shipbuilding programs and is considering several options for controlling longterm costs in an effort to assist the navy in the shortterm the committee recommends providing the navy financial management authorities that have previously been denied for fiscal year 2006 the committee recommends providing the navy additional reprogramming authority this authority allows the navy through above threshold reprogramming procedures to increase funding for programs experiencing unforeseen shortfalls the committee understands that in fiscal year 2005 after exhausting the 100000000 of the transfer authority the congress provided the navy sought to use dollars specifically appropriated for outfitting and post delivery to address funding shortfalls the committee is concerned about this change in navy policy as it will only further obscure actual program costs the new reprogramming authority is provided only with the understanding that this change will not be implemented in the future the additional reprogramming authority essentially provides the navy reactive mechanism or approach to cost management the committee believes the situation requires more proactive program budgetary and contract management and encourages the department of defense to consider whether using advance appropriations in future budgets will improve the shipbuilding program page 126 the committee also stated the fiscal year 2006 presidents budget requests 225427000 for theddg51 destroyer program for what the navy describes as program completion requirements and shutdown costs these funds are requested for mix of class and ship specific plan basic construction ordnance certification and inspection costs such costs are traditionally included in the budget request for each ship

appropriated the committee finds this decision troubling first budgeting for such costs after procurement of the last vessel obscures the actual cost to procure each ship and overstates savings attributable to the multiyear contract authority under which these ships were purchased the congress approved the navys request for multiyear procurement authority in fiscal year 2002 assuming level of savings to the taxpay er that are now not being realized most disconcerting about this change in policy and resultant budget request is the navys assertion that if these costs are not funded the navy will not be able to meet its contractual obligations and the chief of naval operations will not be able to accept delivery of these ships the committee is alarmed that the navy would knowingly sign multibillion dollar contract for ships that would be both nonoperational and undeliverable unless additional dollars outside the contract were provided the committee directs the secretary of the navy to provide detailed report of all the costs required to complete each of the remaining 11 ships and rationale for such contractual arrangement by december 1 2005 until sufficient explanation is provided the committee recommends only providing funds for plans and those costs directly attributable to ships scheduled to deliver in the nearterm as such the committee recommends reducing the budget request by 195654000 page 127 g5g152g151g143g142g155g142g151g140g142g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561 the conference report hrept 109359 of december 18 2005 on hr 2863 states the conferees do not

national defense sealift fund ndsfa revolving fund in the dod budget for the procurement operation and maintenance of dodowned sealift ships 20and transferred procurement of new military sealift ships and certain navy auxiliary ships from the shipbuilding and conversion navy scn appropriation account where they traditionally had been procured to the ndsf21 since the ndsf is outside the procurement

fy2003 22 have not been subject to the full funding policy as traditionally applied to dod procurement programs as discussed in 1996 crs report23 although individual lmsrs were ostensibly fully funded each year by congress like ships procured in the scn account dod in some cases actually applied lmsr funding provided in given year to partially finance the construction of lmsrs authorized in various years for example although congress ostensibly approved 5464 million in fy1995 for the procurement of two lmsrs th fy1995 funds were actually applied to help finance portions of 16 lmsrs whose constructi on contracts were awarded between fy1993 and fy1997 in explaining its use of funds in the lmsr program dod stated the national defense sealift fund ndsf is not procurement appropriation but revolving fund dollars appropriated by congress for the fund are not appropriated to purchase specific hulls as in the case of for example the navys ddg51 program rather dollars made available to the ndsf are executed on an oldest money first basis therefore full funding provisions as normally understood for ship acquisition do not apply 24 20 sealift ships are cargo ships that transport military equipment and supplies from one land mass to another governmentowned sealift ships are operated by the m ilitary sealift command using mostly civilian crews 21 congress created the ndsf through

procured in the fy1992 defense budget which congress passed in 1991 in early 1992 the george h w bush administration terminated procurement of further seawolfclass submarines and proposed rescinding funds for both the second seawolfclass boat ssn22 which had been procured in fy1991 and ssn23 in acting on this proposal congress rejected the request to rescind funding for ssn22 ie congress affirmed the procurement of ssn22 effectively suspended the procurement of ssn23 and gave the secretary of the navy the choice of whether to reinstate procurement of ssn23 in 1993 as part of its bottomup review bur of us defense policy and programs the clinton administration decided to reinstate procurement of ssn23 in fy1995 or fy1996 it later settled on fy1996 by this point 3824 million had already been obligated and expended on ssn23 congresss action on the 1992 rescission proposal also made an additional 5402 million in funding available for obligation to ssn23 as consequence completing the approximate 24 billion cost of ssn23 would require about 15 billion in additional funding the administration requested 15075 million in fy1996 to complete the cost of ssn23 congress approved the procurement of ssn23 in fy1996 but provided only 700 million in procurement funding leaving about 8075 million to complete the cost of the ship rather than requesting all 8075 million or so in fy1997 the administration requested 6991 million in fy1997 for ssn23 and deferred the final 105 million or so needed to complete the cost of the ship as adjusted to fy1998 cong ress as part of its action on the fy1996 defense budget approved 6491 million rather than 6991 million for ssn23 leaving about 155 million to complete the cost of the ship the administration requested 1534 million in fy1998 to
