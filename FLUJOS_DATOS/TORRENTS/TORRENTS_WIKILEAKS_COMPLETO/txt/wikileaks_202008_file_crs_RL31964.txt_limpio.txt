intern on rotation from the us department of health and human services under the supervision of emilie stoltzfus domestic social policy division child welfare waiver demonstrations introduction the federal government assists the states in providing child welfare services through wide array of programs and funding streams the majority of federal funding dedicated to child welfare programs is granted to states through titles ive and ivb of the social security act which govern child welfare services such as foster care adoption assistance independent living and family preservation and support1 in fy2003 approximately 73 billion is be available to states through titles ivb and ive in order to be eligible to receive these funds states must comply with numerous federal rules which may limit how the states implement their child welfare programs frequent criticism of federal child welfare policy is its inflexibility regarding the use of funds by states2 in order to provide states with additional flexibility in their use of titles ivb and ive funds the 103rd congress included provision in the social security act amendments of 1994 pl 103432 allowing the secretary of the us department of health and human services hhs to grant waivers to states to design innovative child welfare programs using funds from titles ive and ivb the original legislation was amended by the 105th congress in the adoption and safe families act of 1997 pl 105893 number of states have been granted waivers and have used these funds to establish an assortment of waiver projects ranging from managed care programs to substance abuse services for parents this report provides background information on the child welfare waivers and description of the progress states have made on these demonstration projects 1 title ivb consists of two subparts subpart 1 is the child welfare services program which is discretionary program that provides grants to states for services that protect the welfare of children subpart 2 is the promoting safe and stable families program which provides mandatory and discretionary funds to states for family preservation family support timelimited reunification and adoption promotion and support title ive provides funding for the foster care adoption assistance independent living and related data systems for additional program information see section 11 of the house ways and means committee green book wmcp 10614 october 6 2000 available through the house ways and means committee web site httpwaysandmeanshousegovdocumentsasp 2 see crs report rl31082 child welfare financing issues and options by karen spar and christine devere 3 see crs report rl30759 child welfare implementation of the adoption and safe families act by karen spar crs2 legislative history prior to 1994 numerous bills had been introduced to establish child welfare waiver demonstrations but had not been passed by the congress child welfare officials who desired additional flexibility had long advocated for waiver authority in child welfare such as had been available in other programs including medicaid and aid to families with dependent children afdc4 advocates of waivers hoped that states would then be able to use title ive funds for prevention and family preservation services title ive funds currently defray state costs that are primarily related to the outofhome care of children and constitute by far the largest percentage of the total federal funds dedicated to child welfare the social security act amendments of 1994 included proposal to establish child welfare waiver demonstrations and were enacted on october 31 1994 as pl 103432 authority for the waiver demonstrations is found in section 1130 of the social security act the 105th congress extended and enacted other changes to the child welfare waiver authority through the adoption and safe families act asfa of 1997 pl 10589 the authority to approve new child welfare waiver demonstrations expired at the end of fy2002 and has not yet been reauthorized details of the waiver authorization principles and objectives the secretary of hhs was authorized to permit states to conduct child welfare demonstration projects that promote the objectives of titles ivb and ive and which may require the waiver of certain provisions of those laws titles ivb and ive are the sections of the social security act that govern child welfare services such as foster care adoption assistance independent living and family preservation and support states conducting waiver demonstrations are still bound to the key principles of protecting and promoting the safety permanency and wellbeing of children through these demonstration projects the federal government seeks to test new approaches to child welfare that will help lead to improvements in the delivery effectiveness and efficiency of services5 provisions excluded from waiver authority certain provisions of titles ivb and ive may not be waived for the purposes of these demonstrations the legislation sought to assure the safety of children protect the rights of children and their families and ensure permanency for children and therefore excluded from waiver are all protections regarding the periodic reviews of the status and progress of foster care cases permanency hearing requirements requirements that certain information be contained in childs case plan child protections such as placement setting guidelines family protections such as procedural safeguards to ensure that 4 child welfare waivers promising directions missed opportunities the cornerstone consulting group houston tx 1999 httpwwwaphsaorgcornerstonecwwtocasp 5 federal register june 15 1995 p 3147831483 crs3 parental rights are respected the requirements of collecting data on foster care and adoption cases and the entitlement of any child or family to benefits6 duration of waiver demonstrations under the asfa amendments the secretary of hhs was permitted to grant waivers for up to 10 demonstration projects in each of fy1998 through fy2002 for potential total of 50 demonstration projects over the course of the 5year authorization all states the district of columbia and puerto rico were eligible to receive waivers under the original authorization of the waiver demonstrations pl 103432 the secretary had only been permitted to grant waivers to total of up to 10 states the distinction between demonstration project and state is important because each state may implement more than one demonstration project each project may be conducted for up to 5 years not including time for startup and final evaluation preparation and as allowed by the changes made by asfa the secretary of hhs may grant extensions for the demonstration projects cost neutrality as mandated by pl 103432 the waiver demonstrations must be cost neutral to the federal government therefore the approved allocation over the course of demonstration project must not exceed the amount that would have been expended by the federal government if the demonstration project were not conducted to achieve cost neutrality the costs of the control group which consists of children being served by the existing state programs are used as the basis for determining the costs of the experimental group generally the same average cost perchild is applied to the experimental group allocation and cost neutrality formulas may differ among the projects and are dependent on the details of the project in addition how the federal government funds the project depends on which provision of the statute is waived in order to implement the project if title ive provision is waived then the federal funds are drawn from title ive currently all of the waiver requests have been for title ive provisions and therefore all of the federal funding for the demonstrations are from the title ive funding stream states are responsible for paying for demonstration project costs beyond the agreed upon federal allocation states may be able to receive upfront funding in order to make initial investments in their projects if after implementation it appears that cost neutrality cannot be maintained throughout the duration of the project hhs will work with the state to modify the project or take other actions as necessary to achieve cost neutrality see appendix b for statebystate list of project expenditures for each of fy2000 through fy2002 expenditure data prior to fy2000 are not available evaluations each state that conducts waiver demonstration must obtain project evaluation from an independent contractor this evaluation must at minimum make comparisons between the demonstration project the experimental group and existing state plans the control group regarding the outcomes of children and families the service delivery methods and the fiscal consequences it must also assess the cost effectiveness of the project states must provide interim and final 6 for more information on some of the provisions mentioned see crs report rl30759 child welfare implementation of the adoption and safe families act by karen spar crs4 evaluation reports to hhs the cost of this evaluation is excluded from the projects cost neutrality calculations applying for waiver states must submit an application to hhs that includes among other items description of the project the expected benefits an estimate of costs or savings list of the title ivb and ive program requirements for which waiver would be required to conduct the proposed project and description of the proposed evaluation design both the state and federal governments are required to obtain public comments on the proposals if necessary hhs and the applying state will negotiate the terms and conditions of the waiver demonstration the secretary of hhs makes the final decision on the approval of waiver projects during the review process for the waiver applications hhs gave preference to proposals that met certain criteria or addressed certain issues hhs initially provided guidance in the federal register regarding the social security act amendments of 1994 that it would grant waivers to test the same or related policy innovations in multiple states however later policy guidance on the asfa amendments gave preference to states that proposed unique policy alternatives and also to states that were not already operating demonstration project the adoption and safe families act also included requirement that certain types of proposals must be considered if submitted these are proposals that identify and address barriers that result in delays to adoptive placements for children in foster care identify and address parental substance abuse problems that endanger children and result in foster care placements and address kinship care additionally hhs provided guidance that it would give priority to proposals that addressed certain departmental priorities for fy2000 and fy2001 proposals hhs listed the following interest areas performancebased systems integrated systems for behavioral health substance abuse and mental health effective preventionearly intervention adoptionpost adoption services service improvements for children in the placement and care responsibility of tribes service improvements for adolescent youth and reunification services for adolescent youth7 other provisions several additional amendments were made to the waiver authorization under asfa section was inserted into the legislation that prohibits hhs from granting waiver to any state that does not provide health insurance coverage to any special needs child living in the state whose adoptive parents have entered into an adoption assistance agreement with any other state hhs reported that it had received certification from all states that they provide such coverage additionally hhs is required to consider the effect that approving state proposal would have on the terms and conditions of court order determining that the states child welfare program has failed to comply with provisions of titles ivb or ive or with the constitution of the united states 7 hhs

implementation these states include california which is currently implementing another project florida new york texas west virginia and the district of columbia according to hhs these projects were never implemented for reasons including project cost issues changes in state resources or leadership and other administrative problems extensions for waiver projects as previously stated the secretary of hhs has the authority to grant extensions for waiver demonstrations and although the authority to approve new waiver projects has expired he may still grant extensions to projects that were approved before the end of fy2002 on may 23 2002 hhs issued an information memorandum outlining the criteria and process for obtaining an extension9 to begin the application process states must later than 6 months before the termination date of the demonstration project submit letter requesting an extension after receipt and review of the request letter hhs will grant to the state temporary shortterm extension that is 4 months after the due date of the final evaluation report this bridge extension allows hhs time to review the final evaluation and financial reports before granting the actual extension hhs will make its final decision within 4 months of receiving the final evaluation report decisions will be based on the successes the project has achieved in improving outcomes for children and families but state does not need to fulfill all of its goals and objectives to obtain an extension if state can document the factors that led to projects shortcomings and propose detailed strategy to reach its goals in the future the state may still be able to obtain an extension if waiver extension is approved the original terms and conditions of the project may be amended to reflect any agreed upon changes as with the original waivers extensions may be granted for up to 5 years if an extension is not granted the state will be required to phase out the project thus far the
