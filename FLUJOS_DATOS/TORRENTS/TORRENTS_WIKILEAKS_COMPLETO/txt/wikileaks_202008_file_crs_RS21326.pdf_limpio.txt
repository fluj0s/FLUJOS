negotiating objectives that call for negotiators to ensure that parties do not fail to effectively enforce their environmental laws in manner affecting trade and to make such failures subject to dispute settlement another objective seeks language in trade agreements committing parties not to weaken environmental laws to attract trade the act also calls for greater openness in proceedings related to trade disputes it does not include an objective to protect environmental measures from challenge by fo reign investors and consequently the act lost some support in congress and from envi ronmental groups this report discusses the environmentrelated provisions of the new law it will be updated as events warrant background environmental issues have received growing attention in trade liberalization debates as trade agreements have broadened in sc ope from primarily invol ving negotiations to reduce tariffs to including negotiations on nont ariff trade barriers congressional interest in addressing environmental c oncerns in trade agreements s extended to the debate over renewing the presidents trade promotion au thority tpa trade promotion authority also referred to as fasttrack negotiating authority provides that congress will consider trade agreements within mandatory d eadlines with limited debate and without amendment to maintain its influence on the content of agreements negotiated by the president under tpa congress generally in cludes objectives in such legislation tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21326crs2 establish priorities for nego tiators and places

addressed only in negotiating objectives regarding trade in services and foreign direct investment these provisions directed us negotiators in pursuing stated objectives to take into account legitimate united states domestic objectives including but not limited to the protection of legitimate h ealth or safety essential security environmental consumer or employment opportunity interests

agreements and ministerial d ecisions this authority expired in 1994 congressional consideration of the relationship between trade and environment has continued to grow efforts to renew tpa in the 104th 105th and 106th congresses failed in large part because of disagreement over the inclusion of environmental and labor issues the 107th congress gave unprecedented consideration to these issues

au thority for trade agreements background and developments in the 107th congress the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 title xxi renews the presidents trade promotion authority the act covers trade agreements reached by june 1 2005 with twoyear extension possible the law lists overall and principal objectives in trade negotiations and priorities the president must promote to maintain us competitiveness under provisions of the act agreements w ould have to make progress in meeting the negotiating objectives and the president woul d have to satisfy the consultation and assessment requirements the trade act so establishes new congressional advisory body on trade negotiations called the congressional oversight group environmentrelated provisi ons of the trade act of 2002 the 2002 trade act contains several nvironmental objectiv and related provisions and overall gives substantially gr eater consideration to environmental matters than did the omnibus trade and compe titiveness act of 1988 unde r which fasttrack procedures were last appr oved the environmentrelate d negotiating objectives and priorities included in the new law are discussed below environmental objectives the law includes two overall negotiating objectives on environment the first objective is to ensu re that trade and environmental policies are mutually supportive and to seek to protect nd preserve the environment and enhance the international means of doing so while optimizing the use of the worlds resources httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21326crs3 1 environmental provisions in the usjordan fta and the nafta are compared in crs report rs20999 usjordan free trade agreement nalysis of environmental provisions the second overall negotiating objective is to seek provi sions in agreements under which parties strive to ensure that they do not weaken or reduce the protections afforded in domestic environmental and labor laws as an encouragement for tradesections 2102a5 and 7 this objective parallels language in the usjordan free trade agreement fta and nafta chapter 11 inve stment both of these trade agreements assert that it is inappropriate to encourage trade by relaxing domestic environmental laws and generally state that party should not waive or otherwise derogate from such measures to attract investment nafta ar ticle 1114 further provide s that party may request consultations if it considers that anot her party has done so1 environmental advocates had argued for such trade negotiating objective to deter countries from weakening their environmenta l standards to promote trade advantage they further called for making such actions subject to dispute settlement procedures those who opposed this proposal expressed cern that if this approach were taken legitimate changes in domestic environmental measures could be subject to challenge by us trading partners under the trade act the overall negotiating objectives are not subject to dispute settlement procedures the 2002 trade act also includes several principal negotiating objectives on environment section 2102b11 in st to the overall negotiating objectives the principal negotiating objectives are subject to dispute settlement procedures perhaps most notably the new law states that it is principal negotiating objective to ensure that party to trade agreement with the united states does not fail to effectively enforce its environmental or labor laws through sustained or recurri ng course of action or inaction in manner affecting trade between th united states and that party related objective is to recognize that parties retain the right to exercise discretion with respect to prosecutorial regulatory and compliance matters and to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources to enforcement with respect to other environmental matters determined to have higher priorities these two negotiating objectives mirror provisions contained in the usjorda n fta and the nafta environmental side agreement however this latter objective goes further than the usjordan fta to clarify the rights of government to estab lish its own levels of environmental protection by adding retaliati on may be authorized based on the ex ercise of these rights or the right to establish domestic labor standards and levels of envir onmental protection other principal negotiating objectives on environment contained in both bills and the final law include 1 strengthening trading partners capacity to protect the environment through the promotion of sustainable development 2 reducing or eliminating government practices or po licies that unduly threaten stainable development 3 seeking market access for us environmental technologies goods and services and 4 ensuring that environmental health or safe ty policies or practices of the parties do not arbitrarily discriminate against us exports or serve as disguised barriers to trade other environmentrelevant objectives the 2002 trade act sets forth other principal negotiating objectives that have implications for environmental laws and relatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21326crs4 14 see crs electronic briefing book on trade nafta

disputes under trade agreemen ts these include the objec tives on dispute settlement foreign investment transparen cy and regulatory practices dispute settlement and enforcement the effectiveness of trade agreement obligations is related to the strength of an agreements dispute settlement process environmental interests argued that envir onmental obligations should be included within trade agreements and that dis putes involving these obligati ons should be treated the same as commercial disputes including using the same remedies busine ss interests and others favored flexibility in addressing various kinds of disputes the act parallels the us jordan fta and goes beyond nafta by calling for the inclusion within the texts of trade agreements of an obligation for parties to enforce their environmen tal laws the dispute settlement objectives section 2102 b12 direct negotiators to seek provisions that treat all us principal negotiating objectives equally with respect to the ability to resort to dispute settlement and to have available equivalent dispute settlement procedures and remedies thus the law seeks to make all disputes equally subject to dispute settlement but it provides flexibility in procedures and remedies foreign investment investment provisions have become an environmental issue because of the types of claims that ve been brought under the nafta investment provisions allowing foreign investors to arb itrate disputes with nafta parties in some cases foreign investors have sought compen sation for the negative impacts of government environmental regulations claiming that the government action is form of indirect expropriation or is tantamount to expr opriation nafta provides that compensation must be equal to the fair market value of the expropriated investment these nafta provisions and related claims have prompted concerns by states and environmental groups that this language may dampen the enforcement of environmental regulations in signatory countries and that foreign investors ma have greater rights under the nafta with respect to expropriations by federal state or local government in the united states than domestic investors have under the fifth amendment takings clause14 the new tpa provisions appear to addre ss this concern to some degree the principal negotiating objectives for inves tment section 2102b3 seek to reduce tradedistorting barriers to foreign investme nt while ensuring that foreign investors in the united states are not accorded greater substantive rights with respect to investment protections than united states in vestors in the united states and to secure for investors important rights comparable to those that would be available under united states legal principles and practice the investment objective calls for achieving these goals by seeking the establishment of standards for expropriation and compen sation for expropriation consistent with united states legal principles and practice and by seeking to establish standards for fair and equitable treatment consistent with ited states legal principles and practice including the principle of due processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21326crs5 the trade act further calls for negotiators to seek to improve mechanisms used to resolve disputes between an investor and government through mechanisms to eliminate frivolous claims procedures to enhan ce opportunities for public input into the formulation of government positions and th establishment of an appellate body to provide coherence to the inte rpretations of investment pr ovisions in trade agreements it calls for negotiators to ensure the fu llest measure of transparency in investment disputes by ensuring that requests for di spute settlement are ma public promptly ensuring that proceedings submissions fi ndings and decisions are made public and establishing mechanism for accepting amicus curiae submissions from businesses unions and nongovernmental organizations provision in the sena tepassed bill that was dropped in conference woul d have directed the presiden t to negotiate an amendment to chapter 11 of the nafta to increase the transparency of chapter 11 proceedings in specified ways and would have required the us trade representative to certify to the congress within one year of enactment that the president has fulfilled these requirements environmental groups favored adding lang uage in the investment objectives that would direct negotiators to seek provisions in trade agreements to limit expropriation provisions and otherwise protect legitimate environmental measures from challenge by foreign investors other stakeholders wanted to ensure checks are maintained against the potential for disguised or unfair barriers to foreign investment neither the house nor senate bill called for negotiators to seek exceptions for environmental measures in the investmentrelated obligations of trade agreements an amendment was offered in the senate to require agreements to limit expropriation provisions including by ensuring that payment of compensation is not required fo r regulatory measures that cause mere diminution in the value of private property and to provide that nvironmental and health protection measures are generally consistent with an agreement the failure of this and related proposals resulted in reduced support for the trade act by some in congress transparency various interests including the administration environmental groups and others have put priority on incr easing transparency ie openness in trade matters and increasing public access to the dispute resolution process environmental and business interests agree that greater openne ss would allow increased awareness of the possible impacts of trade decisions relevant to their concerns the house and senate bills contained identical provisions to increase public participation in trade matters compared to current practice section 2102b5 provi des that principal negotiating objective is to obtain wider application of the principle of transparency through increased and more timely public access to information on trade i ssues and activities of international trade institutions increased openness in the wto and other trade fora including with regard to dispute settlement and inve stment and increased and mo re timely public access to all notifications and supporting doc umentation submitted by wto pa rties the law contains additional transparency provisions for the principal negotiating obj ective on investment regulatory practices further with respect to transparency the trade act includes principal negotiating objective on re gulatory practices addressing the use of government practices to provi competitive advantage fo r domestic producers service providers or investors the goal of this pr ovision is to lessen the use of regulations for the purpose of reducing market access for u s goods services or investments this objective calls for us negotiators to achieve increased transparency and opportunity for the participation of affected parties in the development of regulations section 2102b8 such an approach seemingly woul d benefit both environm ental interests andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21326crs6 15 us senate bipartisan trade promoti on authority act of 2002 report to accompany hr 3005 srept 107139 feb 28 2002 p 8 16 eo 13141 issued by president clinton in november 1999 commits the united states to policy of careful assessment and consideration of the environmental impacts of trade agreements and to factor environmental considerations in to the development of its negotiating objectivesus business additionally the objective is t require that proposed regulations be based on sound science costbenefit analyses risk assessment or other objective evidence the inclusion of this objective drew some critic ism from environmental groups that called for language that would protect the ability of federal state and local governments to take precautionary measures against risks in cases where scientif ic or other knowledge may be suggestive but incomplete however proponents of the objective argued that on the other hand without such disciplines regulations can too easily be used to create barriers to trade promotion of certain priorities in addition to negotiating objectives the trade act requires the president to promote certain priorities in order to address and maintain us competitiveness in the gl obal economy section 2102c the senate finance committee report accompanying hr 3005 s rept 107139 explained that the priorities are not negotiatin g objectives themselves but th at they should inform trade negotiations or be pursued pa rallel to trade negotiations15 among these priorities the act contains several environmentrelevant provisions specifically the president must 1 seek to establish consultative mechanisms to strengthen us trading partners capacity to develop and implement standards for protecting the environment and human health based on sound science and to report to the house committee on ways and means and the senate committee on finance 2 conduct environmental reviews of trad and investment agreements consistent with executive order 1314116 and report to the house committee on ways and means and

environmental exceptions under the gatt in general the trade negotiating aut hority provided under the 2002 trade act addresses environmenta l concerns to an unprecedented degree reflecting the evolving attention to the potential interconnections between trade liberalization and environmental quality and protection efforts nonetheless the act falls short of the environmental objectives that some members and interest groups sought while it is uncertain how the new environmentrelated objectives may inform trade negotiations during the next several years it seems likely that the debate on how to address environmental issues in trade negotiations and tpa legislation will continue outcomes of investorstate disputes involving challenges to environmental meas ures may be particul arly informative for future tpa deliberations
