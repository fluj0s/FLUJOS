directly from egis chief general soliman through this channel general solimans stature and power in the egyptian establishment and his history of close cooperation with the usg on counterterrorism corroborate the egyptian intent take responsibility for the detainees in such way that protects both us and egyptian security interests in addition to the written assurances regarding the detainees treatment egis has conveyed orally to cairo station that all three will be taken into custody upon arrival in egypt and will be investigated and prosecuted in accordance with egyptian law 4 s we understand the need for specific language on this matter however the danger of seeking specificity beyond what we have already received in egis written assurances is that egis may decide to turn the case over to the mfa mfa involvement will complicate the process and delay disposal of the cases visit embassy cairos classified website httpwwwstatesgovgovpneacairo you can also access this site
