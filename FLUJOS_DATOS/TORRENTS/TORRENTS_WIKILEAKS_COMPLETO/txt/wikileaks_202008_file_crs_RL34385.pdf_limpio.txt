commission issued final report on the actions taken by the federal government to implement the recommendations of the panel the report saw little urgency in the creation of the pclob and noted that

been held staff named work plan outlin ed work begun office established17 eventually dinkins and rauls were c onfirmed by the sena on february 17 2006 all board members were sworn in and had their first meeting on march 14 2006 davis subsequently resigned fro m the board on may 14 2007 because as he indicated in his letter of resignation he felt the board members had interpreted their oversight responsibilities too narrowly and that they had not exercised adequate independence when they accepted extensive redlining by administration officials of the boards first report to congress18 june 2007 report by the house committee on appropriations took issue with the editing of the boards first report to congress and offered the following comment the committee is concerned about the extensive editing made by the administration to the first report to congress of the board the motivation for those edits and how such editing may be detrimental to the independence of the board the committee believes that the board must have the authority and independence to thoroughly review assess and report accurately on privacy and civil liberties matters the committee strongly urges the administration to respect the boards mission and to refrain from substantive editing of its work19 reconstitution as established the pclob to some ppeared to be presidential appendage devoid of the

account within the funding request for the white house office who suggesting that it was subunit of the who although the boards chartering legislation placed it in the eop making it coequal agency to the who that there was dissatisfaction with the status of the pclob was evidenced in march 2005 when representative carolyn b maloney introduced for herself and 42 bipartisan cosponsors legislation hr

five members to senate approval and to sixyear terms the senate counterpart proposal s 4 kept the board in the eop but also subjected its five members to senate confirmation and to sixyear terms

of the 911 commission act ir911ca into law on august 3 200722 transition title v iii of the ir911ca recons tituting the pclob set out the following findings which underlie the reestablished board in its new independent status 1 in conducting the war on terrorism the government may need additional powers and may need to nhance the use of its existing powers 2 this shift of power and authority to the government calls for an enhanced system of checks and balances to protect the precious liberties that are vital to our way of life and to ensure th at the government uses its powers for the purposes for which the powers were given 3 the national commission on terrori st attacks upon the united states correctly concluded that the choice between security and liberty is falsehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34385crs7 23 121 stat 352 24 ibid 25 121 stat 353choice as nothing is more likely to endanger americas liberties than the success of terrorist attack at home our histor has shown us that insecurity threatens liberty yet if our liberties are curta iled we lose the values that we are struggling to defend23 the reconstituted pclob was also given two purposes 1 analyze and review actions the executive branch takes to protect the nation from terrorism ensuring that the n eed for such actions is balanced with the need to protect privacy and civil liberties and 2 ensure that liberty concerns ar appropriately considered in the development and implementation of laws regulations and policies related to efforts to protect the nation against terrorism24 these purposes given further elaboration in the restated functions of the board suggested that it should be concerned with the actions and policy outcomes of both the executive branch and congress the members of the board it was also specified shall appear and tes tify before congress upon request25 in general section 801d of the title indicated that the amendments contained in section 801a and b
