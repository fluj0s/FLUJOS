joint resolution in precisely the same form before it can be presented to the president once both houses have passed the same measure they can resolve their differences over the text of that measure either through an exchange of amendments between the houses or through the creation of conference committee the house and senate each have an opportunity to amend the other houses amendments to bill thus there can be house amendments to senate amendments to house amendments to senate bill if either house accepts the others amendments the legislative process is complete alternatively each house may reach the stage of disagreement at any time by insisting on its own position or by disagreeing to the position of the other chamber having decided to disagree they then agree to create conference committee to propose single negotiated settlement of all their differences conference committees generally are free to conduct their negotiations as they choose but they are to address only the matters on which the house and senate have disagreed moreover they are to propose settlements that represent compro mises between the positions of the two houses when they have completed their work they submit conference report and joint explanatory statement and the house and senate vote on accepting the report without amendments only after the two houses have reached complete agreement on all provisions of bill can it be sent to the president for his approval or veto httpwikileaksorgwikicrs96708g5g152g151g143g142g155g142g151g140g142g561g5g152g150 g150g146g157g157g142

brief summary of house and senate procedures for reaching agreement on legislation it discusses the provisions of house rule xxii and senate rule xxviii as well as other applicable rules precedents and practices the report focuses on the most common and customary procedures there are many exceptions complications and possibilities that are not addressed and the house and senate may modify or waive their procedures by unanimous consent or by other means the report is based upon the authors interpretation of the rules and published precedents of the two houses and an analysis of the application of these rules and precedents in recent practice readers may wish to study the provisions of h ouse and senate rules and examine the applicable precedents especially in the sections on sen ate bills amendments between the houses and conferences between the houses in house practice guide to the rules precedents and procedures of the house and the corresponding sections on amendments between houses and conferences and conference reports in riddick s senate procedure senate document 10128 there also is more detailed information on this subject in crs report 98696 resolving legislative differences in congress conference committees and amendments between the houses by elizabeth rybicki

agreement on its text before it is submitted to the president for his approval or veto the same requirements apply to concurrent resolution and joint resolution proposing constitutional amendment although neither receives presidential action at some stage of the legislative process therefore the house must pass senate bill or the senate must pass house bill the simplest way of meeting this requirement is for one house to pass its own bill and send it to the other body which then considers and passes it with or without amendments frequently however house and senate committees each develop their own bill on the same subject in these cases one house often debates and amends the bill reported by its committee but then amends and passes the corresponding bill that the other chamber already has passed for example after the house passes bill it frequently takes up bill on the same subject that it already has received from the senate the house then amends the senate bill by striking out the text passed by the senate striking out all after the enacting clause and replacing it with the text of the house bill it has just passed the house then passes the amended senate bill also in this way the house passes two bills with exactly the same text but the senate bill is the one likely to become law because both houses now have passed it although with different provisions much the same thing happens in the senate except that the senate does not actually pass its own bill before taking up the house bill instead the senate debates and amends the bill reported by its committee and after third reading and engrossment which ends the amending process the 1 this report was written by stanley bach formerly senior specialist in the legislative process at crs dr bach has retired but the listed author updated the report and can respond to inquiries on the subject

the amended text of the senate bill under these circumstances the senate never does pass its own bill even after considering it at length this process usually is routine but it can become more complicated for instance the senate may pass one bill on several related matters before the house passes two bills of its own which address the same subjects after the house passes its two bills it may take up the one senate bill and replace the text of that bill with the texts of both of its own bills in other instances the house and senate may confront different political and procedural situations that make it convenient for them to include their versions of legislation on one subject as amendments to some third bill on an unrelated subject which serves as convenient vehicle such arrangements can be necessary because the house and senate cannot begin the formal process of resolving their policy differences until these differences are embodied as amendments by one house to the version of the same bill as passed by the other g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561g4g142g157g160g142g142g151g561g157g145g142g561g10g152g158g156g142g156g561 after one house passes bill and the other then passes it with amendments the house and senate attempt to resolve the differences between their po sitions when confronted with major bill the two houses usually create conference committee for this purpose however conference may not be necessary if they can reach an agreement through informal negotiations and an exchange of amendments between the houses the amendments of one house to bill from the other may be amended twice as the bill is sent messaged back and forth between the house and senate suppose for example that the senate passes house bill with amendments the house can accept concur in the senate amendments in which case the differences are resolved alternatively the house can amend the senate amendments concur in the senate amendments with amendments these house amendments are first degree amendments between the houses the senate then can accept concur in the house amendments to the senate amendments which would produce agreement or the senate can concur in the house amendments to the senate amendments with further senate amendments which are amendments in the second degree at this stage the house can concur in the most recent senate amendments but it cannot propose new house amendments to them because they would be third degree amendments that are not permitted of course exactly the same process can occur in reverse if the house passes senate bill with amendments if the house and senate adamantly defend their last amendments they can send the bill back and forth several more times as each chamber first insists on and then adheres to its position in the unlikely event that neither house retreats from its last position or is willing to discuss compromise in conference the bill ultimately dies it cannot be shuttled back and forth indefinitely this process rarely results in stalemate because the two houses either reach agreement or they decide to submit their differences to conference committee however an exchange of amendments sometimes takes the place of conference once the two houses pass their versions of the same bill the members and staff of the house and senate committees of jurisdiction often meet informally to compare the two versions and discuss compromise if they reach an agreement that other concerned representatives and senators also accept the house can for example concur in the senate amendment with house amendment that embodies the negotiated

amendment the house and senate have resolved their differences through the informal equivalent of conference committee

or house amendments to senate amendments to house bill are privileged for floor action by the senate the senate usually decides to consider them by unanimous consent if necessary however the senate can vote on nondebatable motion to take them up motions to dispose of the house amendmentssuch as motions to concur or to concur with amendmentsare debatable and therefore bject to filibusters in practice however the senate rarely debates house amendments for very long either all the interested senators agree to accept or amend the house amendments or they agree to go to conference instead it is also possible for the majority leader to move that the senate concur in the house amendment and then make all other available motions often referred to as filling the tree on motion to concur if the majority leader can garner the necessary support to end debate on the motion to concur 60 senators assuming vacancies then by using this strategy both further amendment to the house amendment and extended debate can be avoided like the senate the house often acts on senate amendments by unanimous consent until the house officially disagrees to senate amendments to house bill or senate amendments to house amendments to senate bill these amendments usually are not privileged for consideration on the house floor motion is in order to concur in the senate amendments with or without amendments when there is little or controversy the house often accepts or amends the senate amendments by unanimous consent otherwise the house usually can do so only through motion to suspend the rules or under special rule recommended by the rules committee and adopted by the house the one motion that representative can make is to disagree to the senate amendments and go to conference but this motion must be made at the direction of the committee that originally reported the bill to the house both houses cannot consider the same bill at the same time because the house or senate can only act if it has the papersthe official copy of the bill as passed by the house in which it originated the official copies of amendments by either house and the messages by which each house informs the other of the actions it has taken after one house acts on bill or amendments from the other it returns all the papers with an accompanying message describing its action thus the house and senate always act in sequence as custody of the papers changes hands g9g152g146g151g144g561g157g152g561g5g152g151g143g142g155g142g151g140g142g561 before conference committee is created to resolve disagreements between the two houses the house and senate each must state its disagreement over bill either by disagreeing to the amendments of the other body or by insisting on its own amendments so long as one house concurs in the amendments of the other with amendments there is formal disagreement but at any point during an exchange of amendments between the house and senate either house can propose that they can go to conference instead the two houses usually decide in one of two ways to establish conference committee when the senate passes house bill with amendments for example it can immediately insist on its amendments and request conference with the house this is likely to happen on major bills and

necessary the house almost always agrees to the conference although it need not do sofor example it could simply agree to the senate amendments instead at other times however when the senate passes house bill with amendments it may merely send back the bill and the amendments in the hope that the house will accept the senates amendments making conference unnecessary if the house does not accept the amendments it can disagree to them and request conference the senate normally then insists on its amendments and agrees to the conference after which it informs the house and returns the papers of course the equivalent of either sequence of events may occur after the house passes senate bill with amendments both chambers normally agree by unanimous consent to the necessary procedural steps to send measure to conference in the house if there is an objection to the unanimous consent request then privileged motion can be made at the direction of the committees of jurisdiction to disagree to the senate amendment or insist on the house amendment and request or agree to conference with the senate if unanimous consent cannot be reached in the senate however then it can be difficult to send measure to conference there are several opportunities for extended debate and delay on the senate floor in the process of sending or trying to send bill to conference three separate debatable motions must be made before sending measure to conference other motions including motion to instruct conferees are also in order and senators may choose to exercise their right to debate any or all of these motions at length 2 g3g153g153g152g146g151g157g146g151g144g561g138g151g141g561g11g151g156g157g155g158g140g157g146g151g144g561g5g152g151g143g142g155g142g142g156g561 each house usually appoints its conferees also known as managers immediately after deciding to go to conference the speaker appoints house conferees the senate can elect its conferees although it almost always decides by unanimous consent to authorize the presiding officer to appoint the managers on the part of the senate the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee or subcommittee that reported the bill are almost always conferees they also play major part in deciding who else is appointed the committee or subcommittee leaders usually prepare list of conferees from their chamber that the speaker normally accepts and the presiding officer of the senate always accepts the party leaders also may become involved in selecting conferees especially if the bill is particularly important if it was reported by two or more committees or if amendments to the bill from the other house touch the jurisdiction of more than one committee most conferees are members of the committee that reported the bill in the case of bill that involves the jurisdiction of more than one committee members of each committee often are appointed as conferees with authority only to negotiate an agreement with respect to the subjects or provisions of the bill that fall within the jurisdiction of their committees thus some members may be designated as conferees for purposes of the entire bill while others are appointed only to address specific section or title representatives also may appointed as conferees for limited purposes when the senate adds to house bill nongermane amendment that is within the 2 for more

may appoint other representatives who for example offered important floor amendments the list of conferees generally reflects the party balance in each house the house and senate do not have to appoint the same number of managers and they frequently do not house conferees vote as delegation as do senate conferees and majority of each delegation must sign the conference report thus three representatives have the same voting power in conference as thirty senators each house is likely to appoint larger number of conferees when the bill involves the jurisdiction of more than one of its standing committees some conference committees have only handful of members from each chamber at the other extreme the conference on reconciliation bill can have more than 250 members representative or senator may move to instruct the conferees from his or her chamber immediately after that house agrees to go to conference but just before the conferees are appointed 3 for example the house can instruct its ma nagers to insist on the house position on particular amendment or the senate can instruct its managers to recede to the house position on another amendment however instructions to conferees are never binding point of order lies against conference report that is inconsistent with house or senate instructions to its conferees the house also can instruct its conferees if they do not report within 20 calendar days and 10 legislative days after being appointed or 36 hours after being appointed during the last 6 days of session

them and the house must vote to authorize its conferees to do so both chambers also require that all conferees be given an opportunity to participate in conference discussions according to house rule xxii managers should endeavor to ensure that meetings only occur if every house manager has been given notice and an opportunity to attend the house rule also explicitly states that all matters in disagreement are open to discussion at an conference meeting if point of order is made and sustained on the house floor that conferees met in violation of clause 12 or that they never met at all the conference report is rejected and the house is considered to have requested further conference with the senate similarly the senate has agreed that conferees should hold regular formal meetings of all conferees that are open to the public that conferees should be given adequate notice of such meetings and that all conferees should be given an opportunity to participate in full and complete debates of the matters before the conference 4 beyond these requirement there are virtually house or senate rules governing conference meetings conferees select their own chairman and usually work without formal rules on quorums proxies debate amendments and other procedural matters conferences are negotiating forums and the two chambers allow conf erees to decide for themselves how best to conduct

rules governing what decisions conferees can make conference committees are established to resolve disagreements between the house and senate over their versions of the same bill therefore the authority of conferees is limited to matters in disagreement as general rule they may not change provision on which both houses agree nor may they add anything that is not in one version or the other furthermore conferees are to reach agreements within the scope of the differences between the house and senate positions for example if the house appropriates 10 million for some purpose and the senate amends the bill by increasing the appropriation to 20 million the conferees exceed their authority if they agree on number that is less than 10 million or more than 20 million it is much harder to determine the scope of the differences when they are qualitative not quantitative also conferees have more latitude under some circumstances than under others when one house passes bill and the other then passes it with series of separate amendments each making change in different provision of the billthese amendments usually are numbered and it is relatively easy for the conferees to determine the scope of the differences over each amendment this is generally not true however when the senate passes house bill or the house passes senate bill with an amendment in the nature of substitute that totally replaces the text of the bill in this situation which arises nearly all of the time there is only one amendment in conferencefor example senate substitute for the house version of bill the two versions of the bill can take very different approaches to the same subject making it difficult for the conferees to isolate every point of agreement and disagreement and to identify the scope of each disagreement under these circumstances the conferees may write their own conference substitute so long as it is germane modification of the house and senate versions if conference agreement exceeds the scope of the differences or deals with matter that is not in disagreement the conference report is subject to point of order when the house or senate considers it the house however typically protects conference report against points of order by adopting resolution reported by the rules committee waiving the applicable rules the senate meanwhile interprets the authority of its conferees generously especially when they develop conference substitute furthermore the senate can waive its rule with threefifths vote of senators duly chosen and sworn 60 senators if there are vacancies the authority of senate conferees is further limited by rule agreed to in the 110 th congress5 under paragraph 8 of senate rule xliv senator can raise point of order against provisions of conference report if they constitute new directed spending provisions paragraph 8 defines new directed spending provision as any item that consists of specific provision containing specific level of funding for any specific account specific program specific proj ect or specific activity when specific funding was provided for such specific account specific program specific project or specific activity in the measure originally committed to the conferees by either house paragraph 8 of senate rule xliv applies only to provisions of conference reports that would provide for actual spending in other words it applies only to discretionary and mandatory spending provisions and not to authorizations of appropriations6 discretionary spending is 5 for more information see crs report rs22733

programs agencies and routine operations of the federal government mandatory spending also referred to as direct spending is provided in or controlled by authorizing law and generally funds entitlement programs such as social security and medicare7 the senate can waive this restrictions on the content of conference reports by threefifths vote of senators duly chosen and sworn 60 senators assuming vacancies when the conferees reach full agreement their staffs prepare conference report that states how they propose to resolve each of the disagreements accompanying the report itself is joint explanatory statement also known as the statement of managers which describes the various house and senate positions and the conferees recommendations in more detail majority of the house managers and majority of the senate managers must sign both the conference report and the joint explanatory statement 8 house rules require that house conferees be given an opportunity to sign the conference agreement at set time and place at least one copy of the final conference agreement must be made available for review by house managers with the signature sheets each chamber then debates and votes on the conference report in turn g8g149g152g152g155g561g3g140g157g146g152g151g561g152g151g561g5g152g151g143g142g155g142g151g140g142g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g156g561 at the conclusion of successful conference the papers usually change hands the conferees from the house that requested the conference bring the papers into conference and then turn them over to the conferees from the other house thus the house that agreed to the conference normally acts first on the conference report however this is practice that is not required by house or senate rules the senate usually considers conference report by unanimous consent although if necessary senator can make nondebatable motion to consider it the report may be called up at any time after it is filed but it is not in order to vote on the adoption of conference report unless it has been available to members and the general public for at least 48 hours before the vote this requirement can be waived by threefifths of senators duly chosen and sworn or by joint agreement of the majority and minority leader in the case of significant disruption to senate facilities or to the availability of the internet under senate rules report is considered to be available to the general public if it is posted on congressional website or on website controlled by the library of congress or th government printing office when considered on the senate floor conference report is debatable under normal senate procedures it is subject to extended debate unless the time for debate is limited by unanimous consent or cloture or if the senate is considering the report under an expedited procedures established by law such as the procedures for considering budget resolutions and budget continued into the congressional record

rule xxviii states that if time for debating conference report is limited presumably by unanimous consent that time shall be equally divided between the majority and minority parties not necessarily between proponents and opponents of the report point of order may be made against conference report at any time that it is pending on the senate floor or after all time for debate has expired or has been yielded back if the report is considered under time agreement if point of order is sustained against conference report on the grounds that conferees exceeded their authority either by violating the scope rule rule xxviii or the prohibition against new directed spending provisionsparagraph 8 of rule xliv then there is special procedure to strike out the offending portions of the conference recommendation and continue consideration of the rest of the proposed compromise 9 under the procedure senator can make point of order against one or more provisions of conference report if the point of order is not waived see below the presiding officer rules whether or not the provision is in violation of the rule if point of order is raised against more than one provision the presiding officer may make separate decisions regarding each provision after all points of order raised under this procedure are disposed of the senate proceeds to consider motion to send to the house in place of the original conference agreement proposal consisting of the text of the conference agreement minus the provisions that were ruled out of order and stricken 10 amendments to this motion are not in order the motion is debatable under the same debate limitation as the conference report11 in short the terms for consideration of the motion to send to the house the proposal without the offending provisions are the same as those that would have applied to the conference report itself if the senate agrees to the motion the altered conference recommendation is returned to the house in the form of an amendment between the houses the house then has an opportunity to act on the amendment under the regular house procedures for considering senate amendments discussed in earlier sections of this report senate rules also create mechanism for waiving these restrictions on conference reports senators can move to waive points of order against one or several provisions or they can make one motion to waive all possible points of order under either rule xxviii or rule xliv paragraph 8 motion to waive all points of order is not amendable but motion to waive points of order against specific provisions is time for debate on motion to waive is limited to one hour and is divided equally between the majority leader and the minority leader or their designees if the motion to waive garners the necessary support the senate is effectively agreeing to keep the matter that is potentially in violation of either rule in the conference report 9 for more information see crs report rs22733 senate rules changes in the 110th congress affecti ng restrictions on the content of conference reports by elizabeth rybicki 10 the form of the motion depends on what the house and senate sent to conference very often house bill and senate amendment are sent to conference the motion in that case would be for the senate to recede from its amendment and concur in the house bill with further senate amendment consisting of the conference committee compromise without the new matter or new directed spending provision if senate bill and house amendment were sent to conference the motion would be that the senate recede from its disagreement to the house amendment and concur in the house amendment with further amendment 11 paragraph 4b2 of rule xxviii paragraph 8b2 of rule xliv

the ruling of the chair and limit debate on an appeal to one hour equally divided between the party leaders or their designees the purpose of these requirements is to ensure that either method by which the senate could choose to apply or interpret these rules through motion to waive or through an appeal of the ruling of the chair requires threefifths vote of the senate usually 60 senators simple majority cannot achieve the same outcome in the house the conference report cannot be considered until three days after being filed and then only if the report and the joint explanatory statement have been printed in the congressional record for the day it was filed copies of the report and the statement also must be available to representatives for at least two hours before they consider it these availability requirements are sometimes waived by rule reported by the rules committee and they do not apply during the last six days of session typically the house calls up conference report under the terms of special rule that protects the report against one or more points of order if the rules committee reports and the house adopts resolution waiving the applicable rules the house debates conference report under the onehour rule with control of the hour equally divided between the two parties however if both floor managers support the report representative opposed to it may claim onethird of the time for debate at the end of the first hour the house normally votes to order the previous question which precludes additional debate if representatives could make points of order against report sometimes the house first considers and agrees to resolution recommended by its rules committee that protects the report by waiving the points of order conference reports are not amendable each report is compromise proposal for resolving series of disagreements the house prevails on so questions the senate on others if the house and senate were free to amend the report they might never reach agreement at the end of debate therefore each house votes on whether to agree to the report as whole however the house that considers the report first also has the option of recommitting it to conference but when one chamber agrees to the report it automatically discharges its conferees as result the other house cannot vote to recommit because the conference committee has been disbanded if the house and senate agree to the conference re port the bill is enrolled printed on parchment in its final form and presented to the president for his approval or disapproval g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 elizabeth rybicki analyst on the congress and legislative process erybickicrslocgov
