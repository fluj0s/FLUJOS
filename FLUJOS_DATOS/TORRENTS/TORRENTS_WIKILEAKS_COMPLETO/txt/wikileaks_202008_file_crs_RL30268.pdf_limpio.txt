free trade zones are geographic areas which primarily facilitate economic development and coproduction the join t production of single good through the efforts of workers in two or more countries all zones are geographic areas which are physically located inside the boundaries f the country but treated as if they were located outside the country for customs purposes thus for go ods or materials which are imported processed and later reexported tariffs are payable and custom s procedures are streamlined the 235 us zones are among nearly 850 zones worldwide but differ fro m them in two m ajor ways first twothirds of the worlds zones are in developin g countrie s producing primarily for export while us zones produce primarily fo r import second whereas many foreign zones are exempt from customs oversight taxes and regulations us zones are subject to customs control as well as most other federal state and local laws and taxes most goods enter the united states through customs at the port of entry an d then travel to their ultimate destination imports which are not yet complete needed or allowed to enter the united states for quota reasons for example after bein g unloaded at ports of entry may be taken to nearby foreigntrade general purpose zone for warehousing or further processing or to special purpose subzone manufacturing site which is separate from but linked to zone the system of us foreigntrade zones has evolved greatly over its 65yea r history since it was set up by the us foreigntrade zones ftz act in 1934 pl 73397 19 usc 81a81u visioned by some as an engine of export growth it has become largely system for avoiding inverted tariff structures on import s higher duties on components than on finished products policy questions relating to zones today are similar to those of decade ago however the answers are different largely because of the evolution of the us and world economies issues today are is the act fulfilling its original intent the intent has evolved have us foreigntrade zones helped or hurt us workers the stion has been eclipsed by the perceived effects of nafta and other trade influences do us foreigntrade zones set us trade policy by circumventin g congress and us tra negotiators perhaps but the issue has dimmed as tariffs and trade barriers decline and since new regulations went into effect in 1991 legislative issues pertaining to zones have moved from the macro to the micro level pl 10636 s report 1062 approved june 25 1999 provides tha t commercial importation data for foreigntrade zones shall be included under

of the group while each country is free to negotiate its own barriers with countries outside the group free trade zones on the other hand do not affect countrys trade barriers rather they set up secure locations often fenced which are inside the boundaries of the country but which are considered to be outside the country for tariff purposes hence the trade barriers do not apply as long as the good is within the zone w hen the good exits the zone only if it then enters the country in which the zone is located do normal trade barriers apply while this report mentions number of specific bills it is not intended as bill tracking2 device it will be updated periodically as neededus foreigntrade zones current issues foreigntrade zones are the us version of free trade zones scattered around the world free trade zones are geographic areas which primarily facilitate economic development and coproduction the join t production of single good through the efforts of workers in two or more countries in the united states this means that1 zones are places where some foreign components are typically mixed with us components in the manufacturing process current policy issues reflect the impact of us zones relat ive to other influences on the us economy many current legislative proposals tend to focus on fine tuning the workings of th zone system or reflect the difference that zone status can make in promoting economic development for community and improvin g competitiveness of company in specific industry first however this report examines what th us zone system is how it relates to zones abroad and ho w the us foreigntrade zone program has changed from its original intent tables detail trade zone legislation in the 105 and 106 congressesth th provide information on application methods and requirements for zone status and list zones and subzones by state2 us zones in world context zones all over th world have an important characteristic in common they are geograph ic areas which are physically inside the boundaries of country but which are treated as if they were located outside the country for customs purposes that is zones are declared to be outside the customs territory of country this separation from the country for customs purposes links world zone s together into type of international nomansland which has two important traits first tariffs taxes on imported goods and in many cases including the united states other taxes sales excise or other are payable on goods so long as they remain in the zone sy stem only when they leave the system and enter country arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30268crs2 zones around the world are called by at least 19 different names depending on the country3 in which they are located or the author or organization referring to them among these are the following generically they are often c alled free trade zones those in the united states are called foreign trade zones those in developing countries producing specifically for export are typically called export processing zones they are also called maquiladoras in mexico special economic zones in china industrial free zones or export free zones in ireland free zones in the united arab em irates and duty free export processing zones in the republic of korea in addition they are called tax free zones or tax free trade zones by walter h an d dorothy b diamond authors of taxfree trade z ones of the world they have been called free export processing zones by the organization for economic cooperation an d development source international labor organisation economic and social effects f multinational enterprises in export processing zones geneva 1988 p5tariffs payable on the imported value of the product and are sales taxes payable n imported goods sold if the goods are reexported duties are payable second cu stoms procedures are streamlined for all goods entering and leaving the zone system as result if buttons from indonesia and fabric from india are sent to trade zone in the philippines for assembly into shirt which is then exported to the united states tariffs are payable in the philippines nd all customs procedures are streamlined until the completed shirt enters the united states for consumption at that time tariffs are payable on the import value and the shirt goes through normal customs procedures the 235 u s zones are part of the world system of 850 zones two thirds of3 these zones are in developing countries whi ch produce primarily for export in these countries zones are often used as an economic development tool production takes place in export processing zones which are ty pically islands of modernization located at ports in countries which lack extensive infrastructure supplies which ar unloade d from container ships travel short distance to be manufactured int components or completed goods which are then reloaded on ships for export multinational corporati ons in developed countries may view these zones as lowcost offshore production sites characteristics of us zones us zones in contrast with the export emphasis of zones in developin g countries are primarily for warehousing or processing of imports prior to goin g through customs at the port of entry us zones differ from other zones around the wor ld in other ways as well us imports which are not complete not yet needed or not allowed to enter the united states for quota reasons for example after being unloaded at ports of entry prior to facing full customs procedures may be taken to nearby foreigntrade genera l purp ose zone for warehousing or further processing or to subzone uniqu us invention the 235 zones inclu seaports airports and fenced industrial parks with warehousing and processing facilities which are run by public corporations as if they were utilities with publis hed rates subzones of which there are about 427 are manufacturing operations which are administratively linked to zone bu t physically separated from it they are typically preexisting operations which havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30268crs3 another difference is that many foreign zones allow companies to operate under special or4 relaxed rules with respect to taxes and customs oversight certain foreign zones requir neither customs documentation or supervision of merchandise while materials are admitted stored or processed in the zone some allow significant tax xemptions including income and property taxes us foreigntrade zones on the other hand are fully subject to all federal state and local laws and taxes except for federal xcise taxes and local inventory taxes they are also subject to full customs supervision throughout while materials are admitted processed and shipped and to custo ms penalties for failure to adhere to requirements and to customs penalties for failure to adhere to requirements in addition prohibited good s including illegal products are not allowed into us zones world wide shipping economic impact analysis by dennis puccinelli august 1985 p5 71 the procedur the zone manufacturer follows to change the tariff rate is as follows when6 the duty rate on the im ported component is lower than that on the end product into which the component is to be incorporated the z one manufacturer must file formal application for the component to receive privileged foreign status it such status is approved the component when it leaves th zone is dutied at its own rate typically that applicable to the product of which it will make an integral partapplied for and been granted subzone s tatus however businesses may also apply for zone status before beginning construction on new manufacturing operation 4 us zones and subzones like other zones around the world are viewed in part as an economic deve lopment tool they allow businesses to save money on imports through duty tariff deferral duty exemption elimination of the need for dut drawback and tax avoidance they also allow us businesses to save small amounts through quota storage zonetozone transfer nd customs and inventory efficiencies see table 1 for details most importantly however subzones in particular allo w businesses to save money in part because they are places where inverted tarif f structures can be changed to uniform rate structures explained below the foreign trade zones board estimates that slightly less than 50 of all foreign merchandise entering through trade zones is being used in the inverted tariff situation what is an inverted tariff structure an inver ted tariff structure means that the tariff rate on product used as component of finished product is higher than the tariff rate on the finished goo d containing the component when imp orted components are combined with domestic supplies in subzones importers can effectively reduce the tariff rate on components to the same level as those levied on completed good 5 thus if zone manufacturer applies for and is granted subzone status he can use his zone status to eliminate the adverse cost effect of the inverted tariff in th industry in which he produces this is because customs provisions allow zone users to choose when the component enters the zone between paying when th component leaves the zone system as part of completed good the tariff on th component itself or the tariff on the component as if it were incorporated into th completed good industries where there may be inverted tariffs include oil refining6 auto manufactu ring electronics chemicals food products pharmaceuticals apparelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30268crs4 and textiles steel and machinery not all zone applicants in these industries hav been granted zone status the granting of zone status by the foreign trade zones board means that zone status has been deemed in the public interest th determination is based in part on the cause of the inverted tariff structure inverted tariffs have arisen in the very extensive harmonized tariff schedule in two ways inadvertently and by design when an industry has an inverted tariff by design it is generally to protect the component industry from import competition in such cases applic ation for zone status may be denied or limitation may be placed on zone status inverted tariff structures are the major reason for zone application in the united states and the greatest source of benefit to users with duty deferral second in recent years tariff levels generally have been negotiated to very low levels an d typically the differences between tariffs on components and tariffs on finishe d products have become smaller and smaller table 1 possible cost savings available to us foreigntrade zone users benefit how costs can be saved duty reduction on inverted tariff situationszone users may choose the lower duty rate when product is entered into customs territory for importation in inverted tariff situations when the rate of the foreign inputs is higher than the rate applied to the finished product produced in the zone zone status however is granted by the ftz board when it determines that such status will result in public benefit typically net positive effect for us businesses and workers duty deferral cash flow savings can result because customs duties are paid only when and if the goods are transferred from the zone to us customs territory for import duty exemption duty is payable on goods which are exported from zone or which are consumed scrapped or destroyed in zone drawback elimination zones eliminate the need for duty drawback that is the refunding of duties previously paid on imported and then reexported merchandise tax savings goods stored in zones and goods exported are not subject to state and local ad valorem taxes such as personal property and sales taxes quota storage cash flow savings and savings from buying in bulk can be made because us quota restrictions do not apply to merchandise admitted to zone until is entered into customs territory when the quota opens the goods may be immediately entered into us customs territory for importationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30268crs5 benefit how costs can be saved most successful zone applicants use general purpose zones for storage manipulation7 and manufacturing and special purpose subzones for specific larger scale manufacturing however some creative uses of zones are also emerging the international wildlif recovery center has t up an operation in the medfordsouthern oregon ftz the center specializ in the decontamination and rehabilitation of

zones act in 1934 pl 73397 19 usc 81a81u it was given the power t o11 approve applications by public corporations for zone status the act itself was fairly short less than six pages in length it entitled each us port of entry to at least one zone and prescribed physical conditions and standards for each zone requirements for operation recordkeeping and goods being moved into and out of zones activities permissible in zones and the applicability of all us laws to zones when the us foreigntrade zones program began in 1934 it was progra m designed to help accelerate us trade in the wake of the restrictive impact of th smoothawley tariff bill of 1930 which raised us tariffs on imported goods as high as 53 some have argued that zones were designed originally to be way stations12 where goods coming in from one foreign port could be transshipped reloaded for export to another foreign port or reexported processed for subsequent export13 the foreigntrade zones legislation was controversial however because there was some fear that it would promote imports of cheaper components used in th manufacturing process and thereby put domestic components manufacturers at risk to make sure this would not happen the act prohibited manufacturing in zones httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30268crs7 historical material in this and the following two sections is taken from us genera l14

expected even sixteen years after the act was passed in 1950 there were still fewer than n zones intense lobbying by manufacturing trade groups to make the zone concept15 more useful led congress to permit manufacturing in zones many reasoned tha t zones were too small for much manufacturing to occur there the foreigntrade zones board took the amendment one st ep further this one step led the zone system on course which eventually made it successful in wa that was ver different from what some originally intended the program to be two years after congress passed the amendment permitting manufacturing in zones the foreign trade zones board issued regulations creating the concept of subzones those regulations declared that when z one was of insufficient size to accommodate manufacturing an emplo yer could apply for subzone status and thereby have access to full zone benefits without having to relocate two administrative decisions by the us treasury department served to make zone status even more attractive for manufacturing operations these decisions one in 1980 u s treasury decision 8087 and another in 1982 modifying the first decision cla rified that manufacturers need not pay duty either on value added or on brokerage or transportation fees connected with imported goods16 1980s the zone system began expanding rapidly once the second treasury decision was handed down in 1982 the zon program began growing very rapidly and changing in nature for number of reasons among these were that the worldwide technological support syste m communications

difficult to m easure effect on us revenue collection employment and the economy in general and somewhat larger effect on the us component s industry particularly in the auto sector not only di d the

were compatible with those reported by gao and itc but went ste p further it found that the foreigntrade zones act and program were in need f extensive revision for failing to carry out what it referred to as the original intent of the act the committee report like the gao and itc reports criticized th program for promoting instead of exports domestic competitiveness and imports for domestic

requests to t he gao and the itc hearings and the report mentioned above continuing periodic congressional interest in foreigntrade zones has been part of broader focus on trade issues zone issues have bee n addressed by minor amendments to the foreigntrade zones act and been included in number of more inclusive hearings and trade laws over the years some of the amendments have increased the benefits of zone imports and exports the zone system today today as during the 1980s zones are predominantly instruments for changing inverted tariff structures into uniform rate structures this is the case even thoug h subzone users may sa ve money in variety of other ways listed in table 1 and even though tariffs overall have declined considerably in the past 15 years from an average rate of 55 in 1984 to an average rate of 20 in 1998 today instead of being23 places where relatively large tariff savings ie 510 per car for example can be made on f ew major components zones are now more typically places where small savings ie 13 per car using the same industry ex ample according to the foreign tradezones board can be made on larger volume of components while th e24 auto indu stry is

23 some of the aut production operations have moved offshore and large numbers of petroleu m operations are still applying for zone status the import ance of trade zones today is evidenced by the following statistics since 1970 the total number of trade zones and subzones combined has grown from 10 to 662 and employment in them has increased from 7000 to 367000 as wa s shown in figure 1

refining which uses primarily imported crude compared to uto assembly which uses mostly domestic components calling zones import zone s rather than export zones and domestic zones rather than foreign

william g reining in the foreigntrade zones board making foreign26 trade zone decisions reflect the legislative intent of th foreigntrade zones act of 1934 northwestern journal of international law and business spring 1995 p 635 the major issues of the late 1980s were documented in the gao and itc report s27 continuedthe second greatest users of zones by 1997 many electronics and auto assembl plants had relocated abroad and petroleum refining had become the dominant zone user today the two industries account for 87 of all zone inputs the future of zones overall most tariffs have continued to be reduced to very low levels in th united states through numerous trade agreements or establishment of freetrad areas this would arguably point to an accompanying reduction in the use of trade zones inverted tariffs will lose their significance when all duties are near the same level in addition the nominal cost savings of duty deferral in country with w tariff rates like the united states would make zone status an unnecessar administrative burden in addition to its reduced effect as protectionist device26 similarly the gradual phasing out of quotas will also diminish demand for zone use however at the same time computers are facilitating zone use by making i t easier for corporations t search through tariffs on all imported parts that potentially go into making certain item in order to identify those that represent an inverte d tariff structure compute rs also make it easier to keep track of quota fulfillment and to calculate final tariffs owed on large and diverse array of small importe d components thus smaller savings from zone use including logistical an d administrative savings may be relatively more important than they once were applications for zone or subzone status are still being approved in 1997 the us foreigntrade zones board approved 8 ne w generalpurpose zones and 37 new subzones consistent with the rate over the past several years increasing the total number of zones by 35 and subzones by 95 thus even though businesses may be reaping smaller savings per imported item used in zones they may be able in some cases to expand the number of items n which they save money in addition international competiti on has become sufficiently great in recent years that even very small savings from zone status through dut reduction deferred duty payment duty exemption tax savings quota storage r other means outlined in table 1 can make important contributions to us competitiveness policy issues relating to zones many of the zonerelated policy issues that were prominent ten years ago are less important to day because the circumstances that surround them have changed27httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30268crs15 continued27 previously mentioned and also in us library of congress foreigntrade zones and the us automobile industry by gwenell l bass and lenore sek crs report 88659e october 14 1988 any program that specifically promoted exports to the detriment of imports could violate28 wto rules against export subsidiesin the 10 ears since the gao itc and congressional studies were conducted foreigntrade zones have become mu ch less an issue of congressional focus than they were thi s has occurred in part because congressional interest has shifted from the employ ment and competitive effects of zone status to increased importation f manufactured goods and the effect this is having on us jobs and the us economy in the ng run economists argue that with increased trade everybody wins however dislocation of workers in various sectors has become an importan t congressional concern is the congressional intent of the foreigntrade zones program being met the answer to questi on on whether the congressional intent on zones is being met depends on whether one judges congress ional intent at the time of passage of the us foreigntrade zones act or as it has evolved over the past 65 years some of the prepassage debate suggested hope that the zones would boos t exports rather than imports in addition while the preamble of the act emphasized the promoti on of trade without reference to either exports or imports section 3 of th act did strictly prohibit manuf acturing in zones sec 3 this language is consistent with arguments that manufacturing was prohibited in order to discourage th importa tion of cheaper components which would compete with domesticall produced components amendments to the act over the years however have reflected gradual shift in congressional intent toward greater accept ance of zones for handling imports the 1950 amendment permitted manufacturing in zones thus reversing the origina l exclusio n in addition certain other amendments including 1990s amendmen t providin g for evaluation of products upon importation from zone make specifi c reference to imports sec 81c of title 19 of the us code 28 therefor one could conclude that the congressional intent as it has evolve d over the years is being met in addition the shifting of congressional focus on the zone issue from major oversight and evaluation to minor tinke ring reflects an apparent acceptance of the us zone system as it stands today httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30268crs16 the general system of preferences provides dutyfree treatment under specific conditions29 for 142 developing countries ftz b oard letter to the file

shifted the perspective on the effects of trad e29 zones on us jobs by way of comparison in the 1980s there was some alarm that increased use of us fore igntrade zones was leading to the loss of us jobs the international trade commission estimated that for the fouryear period 19831987 trade zone s reduced overall employment in the auto industry by net 19 this represents gain in the auto assembly sector and loss in the auto parts sector concern over30 the effect of zones on employment however has been eclipsed in recent years b concern over the effect of trade agreements especially the north american fre trade agreement nafta on employment diff erence in the order of magnitude on particular indus try is shown in the following example in the 1990s over five and onehalf year time period after nafta went into effect increased trade wit h mexico and canada led to 53 job loss in the apparel sector 31 thus small benefits from avoiding the higher tariff rates in industries wit h inverted tariffs differentials which are contin ually shrinking may seem less important today than they did decade ago in addit ion in the 1980s trade zones were viewed as way of encouraging us manufacturing plants to remain in the united state s rather than relocate abroad today th potential cost savings from using zone status to avoid the penalties of an inverted tar iff which may be only percent or two seem small compared to the potential cost savings which some businesses can obtain b relocating laborintensive plant to mexico or some other country with preferential system ie gsp cbera or andean and thus saving large amounts from wag differentials32httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30268crs17 continued32 conditions these arguments were largely drawn from gao and itc reports33 table 2 potential winners and losers from zone use33 potential winners potential losers manufacturers final assemblers could win to the extent components manufacturers could lose to that righting an inverted tariff lets them get the extent that the product becomes less components at lower cost competitive with imported components components manufacturers could win to the extent that they can automate become more competitive with imports and thereby save on production costs workers workers in assembly operations could win either automation or plant closings in to the extent that ftz status results in components industries from losing sales to greater profits which may be passed along importers operating in zones could put to workers workers out of jobs workers in losing industries could win to the extent that job loss encourages them to upgrade skills which could them lead to higher paying jobs community any zone effects could have ripple effects communities with component on the community communities with new manufacturing operations that close may zones may benefit because zones can suffer attract new business into the area consumers to the extent that ftzs help manufacturers consumers may suffer from

example showing the potential magnitude of such tariff revenue loss is an itc finding that zone use reduceda overall tariff revenues by 3 for 1986 overall customs duties of 1216 million represented an overall duty savings of nearly 39 mill ion on the us economy from foreigntrade zone use in 1986 this represents total loss of about 3 of tariff revenues for 1986 source of duty sav ings 1988 itc report op cit source of overall duties highlights of us export and import trade op cit 1986 in addition the question of whether zones have helped or hurt us businesses invites mixed response table 2 shows typical winners and losers from zone use certainly businesses that have applied for and achieved zone status have benefitted on the other hand once one business in an industry achieves z one status others are forced to follow suit to remain competitive as result once auto assembly plants started gett ing zone status virtually all others in the industry followed suit today34 this is occurring in the oil refining industry on the oth er handzone regulations require that us zone activity have ne t positive effect for us businesses and workers in addition the 1991 regulation s applicabl to the foreigntrade zones board specifically require that the boar d disallow any actions that would circumvent us trade policy or programs developed by the administration and congress in keeping with this policy the board s disapproved applications that proposed to use the foreigntrade zones program t circumvent sugar milk textile and apparel quota programs in an attempt to prevent situations where there are losers businesses or workers does the zone system set us trade policy by circumventin g congress and us trade negotiators it can be rgued that the us zone system sets trade policy by circumventin g congress and us trade negotiators the deci sion to lower tariffs is thus shifted from the traditional method involving congress and us negotiators to an alternativ method involvi ng the us foreigntrade zones board and its approval of the use of zones by representatives of various industries however as mentioned the gradual decline of tariffs from an average rate of 55 to 20 between 1984 and 1998 has somewhat diminished the influence of the foreigntrade zones board on us effective tariff rates in addition the foreigntrade zones board is adamant that if it perceives that zone status in an industry usually the assembly sector will harm th components sector it wi ll deny or limit zone status industries where zone status has been deni ed or limited for this reason
