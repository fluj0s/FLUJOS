term comes from european practices in which bankers financed foreign trade and othe r high risk ventures undertaken by merchants such as ship owners and importers for share of the profits rather than receiving interest returns from lending taking stake in venture made it merchant banking potentials for losses and conflicts of interest made it become generally illegal for commercial banks in america via the 1933 glasssteagall act other investors remained free to finance businesses throug h any combination of debt and equity congress restated limits on banking investments in the bank holding company act of 19564 and its amendment in 19705 whether to allow greater banker ties with operating nonfinancial firms and if so under what rules were major issues in th congressional debate that produced glba in 1999 congress recognized that some form s of ownership of commercial firms by banking organizations are the equivalent of pr oviding direct financing to small businesses before glba banking companies could us equityinvesting authority only through small business investment companies sbics and other limited powers bank holding companies could own noncontrollin g interests in nonfinancial companies not more than 5 to 10 of voting securities glba allows fhcs into the highrisk highreward private equity market beyond our borders 32 countries allow banks into that market although five countries do not and ven permit it only w ith restrictions6 what is the private equity market the public equity stock market is generally the one in which anyone can buy or sell securities many requirement s of openness in trading nd reporting apply in the public market by contrast largescal investors fund the restricted private equity market pension funds endowments foundations in surance companies banks and wealthy individuals about third of the private quity market is ventur capital investment in startup and earlystage firms with the rest leveraged buyouts lbo s and investments in existing midsized companies lbos are transactions in which private investors buy out company using debt financing which leverages capital they put into the deal the organized private equity market is tiny compared with the public market equity investing is the highestrisk part of firms financing because it has the lowest priority of claim on the cash flow of the company whose equity financiers purchase significant risks exist that produc ts or strategic plans of startup companies will prove unworkable for lbos risks also come from high levels of debt that magnify profits and losses for owners private equity investments are not registered for public sale the investments are necessarily in small to mediumsized businesses rather than the larger blue chips of higher capitalization and greater predictability of earnings consequently requiring greater anticipated returns to compensate for the riskshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21134crs3 investors generally hold private equity investments from three to seven years or longer they may exit private equity by 1 selling stake in company 2 arranging merger or acquisition or 3 arranging to take the company public returns on private equity are highly volatile and cyclical refl ecting changing conditions in the public equity and corporate mergers market with the ge neral economic and fina ncial slowdown at the start of the century activity in venture capital and similar investments softened new opportunities for merchant banking many securities and insuran ce firms have long been i nvolved in merchant banking european financial firms have been making these deals for centuries in america and abroad securities companies created private equity funds often as limited partnerships this arrangement allows them to share the risks and rewards efficiently with other investors glba granted american comme rcial bankers more opportunities for deal making like those of their wall street and foreign counterparts under glba fhcs but not banks or bank subsidiaries can engage in merchant banking activities til 2004 thereafter regulato ry change could allow banks to own merchant banking subs idiaries if the office of the comptroller of the currency occ which regulate s national banks nd the fed concur many bankers have adopted the fhc structur despite general expectation that only banking firms already active in the securities business would be interested even banking companies with current merchant banking opportunitie s are converting to fhcs regulatory constraints on ba nkers in the field are two 1 capital requirements restricting investments based on capital or dollar amounts and 2 operational requirements restrictin g management and sale of the investments bankers have felt that they must compete with investors not facing these constraints thus glba may not have provided them enough freedom to compete in the new field capital requirements capital requirements princi pal form of financial regu lation remain contentious core capital is what shareholders in banking company have at stake in the business which they stand to lose in case of failure obtaining core capital is more expensive than other means of raising money so bankers seek to hold as little of it as possible minimum capital requirements protect against losses that might otherwise fall back onto the banks federal deposit insurance or the economy if rules force bankers to operate with greater capital than they would otherwise choose th rules in effect tax affected financial activity essentially uses of funds loans and investments come to have higher cost should the sources of the funds be forced to contain larger mix of capital net earnings then become lower although returns beco less risky with the extra capital in its original regulation the fed would ve required fhcs to have core capital of 50 cents against every dollar of merchant ba nking investments for bankers already holding private equities the standard would have multiplied their requirement from the preglba 8 minimum general capitalasset ratio the jump would have sharply reduced earnings on investments including sbics the proposal would have directlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21134crs4 7 us congress senate committee on ba nking housing and urban affairs merchant banking regulations pursuant to the grammleachbliley act of 1999 hearing 106th cong 2nd sess june 13 2000 washingt on gpo 2001 165 pp 8 12 cfr 225172 affected banks as the occ and the federa l deposit insurance corporation needed to issue consistent rule for banks own i nvestments made under authority other than glba bankers questioned whether capital requi rements should be high because some banks had done equity financing safely with less for years criticism also arose over competition because nonbanking firms would not f ace these restraints many of the latter operate with low capital ratios and have great freedom to do deals house and senate committee hearings in june 20007 focused on redrawing the regulation in more banker friendly ways the bank regulators proposed standards in january 2001 that set threetiered sliding capital deduction running from 8 to 25 that rule would still have raised capital requirements from preglba amounts yet was less costly than the earlier proposal investments in sbics would not have to meet the new requirements unless they comprised more than 15 of the owning institutions capital regulators defended the revised proposal on three main grounds first roughly quarter to third of individual deals and fifth of portfolio investments overall lose money second financial risks increase as equity investments account for rger portions of fina ncial firms activities third preglba capital values such as 8 were low precisely because bank equity investments were small at th time and thus did not pose largedollar amounts of risk operational requirements for r esale and management control under glbas wording merchant banking investments must meet two operational requirements 1 fhcs may hold individual investments only for period of time 2 fhcs may not routinely mana ge or operate commercial firms except as necessary or required to obtain reasonable return on the investments upon sale or disposition the fed set the period requirement in final rule of january 20018 at 10 years for direct investments and 15 years for investme nts through private equity funds individual investments can receive exemptions but owners must apply to the fed before the expiration date the fed codified the laws prohibition against actively managing commercial firms and required its approval for fhc to seiz managerial control of company in which it has invested to protect its interests it rest ricted merchant banking investments to 30 of fhc core capital or 20 after excluding private equity funds these percentage restrictions are not costly capital deductions but are quantity restraints effectively limiting investments to small proportions of total ssets example fhc has 10 core capital supporting its entire holdings 10 per 100 of total ssets it may invest perhaps 20 to 30 of the 10 in merchant banking assets 2 to 3 industry commentators criticized the period requirement on two grounds first that the time frames were too short encouraging fire sales as the limits approached
