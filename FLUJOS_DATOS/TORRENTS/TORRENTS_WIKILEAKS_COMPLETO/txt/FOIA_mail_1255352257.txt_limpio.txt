hansen jhansengissnasagov michael oppenheimer omichaelprincetonedu hi all well i have my own article on where the heck is global warming we are asking that here in boulder where we have broken records the past two days for the coldest days on record we had 4 inches of snow the high the last 2 days was below 30f and the normal is 69f and it smashed the previous records for these days by 10f the low was about 18f and also record low well below the previous record low this is january weather see the rockies baseball playoff game was canceled on saturday and then played last night in below freezing weather trenberth k 2009 an imperative for climate change planning tracking earths global energy current opinion in environmental sustainability 1 1927 doi101016jcosust200906001 1pdf pdf of the published version can be obtained from the author the fact is that we cant account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is travesty that we cant the ceres data published in the august bams 09 supplement on 2008 shows there should be even more warming but the data are surely wrong our observing system is inadequate that said there is lot of nonsense about the pdo people like cpc are tracking pdo on monthly basis but it is highly correlated with enso most of what they are seeing is the change in enso not real pdo it surely isnt decadal the pdo is already reversing with the switch to nino the pdo index became positive in september for first time since sept 2007 see 2httpwwwcpcncepnoaagovproductsgodasocean_briefing_gifglobal_ocean_monitoring_c urrentppt kevin michael mann wrote extremely disappointing to see something like this appear on bbc its particularly odd since climate is usually richard blacks beat at bbc and he does great job from what i can tell this guy was formerly weather person at the met office we may do something about this on realclimate but meanwhile it might be appropriate for the met office to have say about this i might ask richard black whats up here mike on oct 12 2009 at 232 am stephen h schneider wrote hi all any of you want to explain decadal natural variability and signal to noise and sampling errors to this new ipcc lead author from the bbc as we enter an nino year and as soon as the sunspots get over their temporarypresumedvacation worth few tenths of watt per meter squared reduced forcing there will likely be another dramatic upward spike like 19922000 i heard someonemike schlesinger maybewas willing to bet alot of money on it happening in next 5 years meanwhile the past 10 years of global mean temperature trend stasis still saw what 9 of the warmest in reconstructed 1000 year record and greenland and the sea ice of the north in big retreat some of you observational folks probably do need to straighten this out as
