199813 this legislation required hud to adopt the standards specified in the march 20 1991 memorandum from the general counsel14 which states that housing owners and managers have discretion to implement reasonable occupancy requirements based on factors such as the number and size of sleeping areas or bedrooms and the overall size of the housing unit 15 hud concluded that an occupancy policy of two persons in bedroom as general rule is reasonable under the fha16 for more information about state and local restrictions on occupancy limits see the group homes section of this report

above the fha applies to public as well as private housing as result number of lawsuits over the years have challenged the fair housing practices of state and local housing authorities and even hud itself particularly with respect to discrimination in low income public housing27 in one recent case africanamerican residents of public housing in baltimore sued hud and various local agencies for race discrimination and the court ultimately held that hud had violated the fha by failing ad equately to consider regional approaches to ameliorate racial segregation in public housing in the baltimore region28 g6g146g156g153g138g155g138g157g142g561g11g150g153g138g140g157g561g6g146g156g140g155g146g150g146g151g138g157g146g152g151g561 in addition to outlawing direct discrimination against individuals on the prohibited grounds mentioned above the federal courts have generally agreed that under some circumstances violation of section 3604a can be established by showing of discriminatory effect29 without showing of discriminatory intent30 the seventh circuit justified such holding in the following way requirement that the plaintiff prove discriminatory intent before relief can be granted under the statute is often burden that is impossible to satisfy strict focus on intent permits racial discrimination to go unpunished in the absence of evidence of overt bigotry which has become harder to find 31 practice that while often not intentional discrimination directed at individual members of minority group but that may have disparate impact on such persons is redlining which is businesss refusal to provide loans home insurance coverage etc based on the characteristics of neighborhood in which the home is located 32 the courts have consistently held that redlining violates the fha the federal court in dunn v midwestern indemnity midamerican fire and casualty co33 explained it this way the availability of appropriate insurance is necessary predicate to the availability of financing and financial assistance is precondition to securing the availability of adequate housing since discriminatory denial of financing violates 3604a discriminatory failure or refusal to provide property insurance on dwellings also must violate 3604a 34 27 see eg naacp v secy of hous and urban dev 817 f2d 149 1st cir 1987 28 thompson v us dept of hous and urban dev 348 f supp2d 398

impact on protected class are prohibited by the fha the decision in thomas v first federal savings bank of indiana35 highlights the need for more than just statistical discriminatory effect in that case black homeowners claimed that the defendant financial institution had redlined the plaintiffs neighborhood when it refused the homeowners application for second mortgage the court held plaintiffs statistical evidence is not sufficient as matter of law to establish violation of section 3605 plaintiffs attorneys offered explanation of the meaning of these figures although section 3605s redlining prohibition makes it illegal to discriminate on the basis of certain characteristics of the plaintiffs neig hborhood eg race color religion sex or national origin there are numerous legitimate business factors that go into decision to make loan which do not form the basis of violation under section 3605 36 the courts however are not in agreement as to how to determine if discriminatory effect violates the act some courts apply fourfactor test originally set out in the seventh circuits village of arlington heights decision these factors are 1 the strength of the plaintiffs statistical showing 2 the legitimacy of the defendants interest in taking the action complained of 3 some indicationwhich might be suggestive rather than conclusiveof discriminatory intent and 4 the extent to which relief could be obtained by limiting interference by rather than requiring positive remedial measures of the defendant 37 other courts apply burdenshifting regime to assess the validity of disparate impact claim pursuant to the fha38 yet there are some differences in the tests applied even among the various courts that apply burdenshifting schemes all courts that use burdenshifting tests agree that the burden is initially on the plaintiff to make prima facie showing generally with the use of statistics that specific policy results in disparate impact upon protected class and that upon such showing the burden shifts to the defendant to show that the policy was initiated for some nondiscriminatory legitimate purpose39 from there some courts keep the onus on the defendant to show there is not less discriminatory alternative that would allow the defendant to meet the same legitimate purpose40 other courts upon defendant showing nondiscriminatory 35 653

prohibited43 one exception to the 1988 law barring familial status discrimination however is that housing for older persons may discriminate against families with children the committee report that accompanied the 1988 amendments explains the purpose of this exemption in many parts of the country families with children are refused housing despite their ability to pay for it although 16 states have recognized this problem and have proscribed this type of discrimination to certain extent many of these state laws are not effective the bill specifically exempts housing for older person s the committee recognizes that some older americans have chosen to live together with fellow senior citizens in retirement type communities the committee appreciates the interest and expectation these individuals have in living in environments tailored to their specific needs 44 housing for older persons is defined as housing that is 1 provided under any state or federal housing program for the elderly 2 intended for and solely occupied by persons 62 years of age or older or 3 intended and operated for occu pancy by persons 55 years of age or older and 41 see eg tsombanidis v west haven fire

grounds discussed above the fha also prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of handicap the act defines handicap as 1 physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such persons major life activities 2 record of having such an impairment or 3 being regarded as having such an impairment 48 the definition of handicap expressly precludes th current illegal use of or addiction to controlled substance49 however because this exclusion does not apply to former drug users the definition of handicap thus could encompass indi viduals who have had drug or alcohol problems that are severe enough to substantially impair major life activity but who are not current illegal users or addicts as result recovering alcoholics and addicts can fall within the definition of handicap50 discrimination on the basis of handicap under the fha includes not allowing handicapped individuals to make reasonable changes to unit that will afford them the full enjoyment of the premises51 however landlord may premise the changes on the handicapped individuals promise to return the unit to its original state landlord may not increase required security deposit to cover these changes but may require handicapped persons to in certain circumstances make payments into an escrow account to cover restoration costs52 discrimination against handicapped person also includes refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules policies practices or services when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling 53 in addition 45 42 usc 3607b2 the remaining requirements for the third category of housing for older persons are that the housing facility or community publish and adhere to policies and procedures that demonstrate the intent required to be housing for older persons and that the facility comply with hud rules for occupancy verification 42 usc 3607b2c and 24 cfr 10030407 46 42 usc 3607b5 47 the

certain design and construction specifications that ensure they are readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons55 the fha s protection for handicapped persons does not require that dwelling be made available to an individual whose tenancy would constitute direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or whose tenancy w ould result in substantial physical damage to the property of others56 it also is unlawful to ask about the handicaps of an applicant for housing rental or purchase or someone with whom they are associated however the regulations do allow raising certain questions that may have some bearing on ones handicap as long as they are asked to all applicants for example all applicants could be asked whether they would be able to mow the lawn as required in rental agreement57 the americans with disabilities act ada58 which was enacted subsequent to the 1988 fha amendments does not apply to housing although it does cover public accommodations including an inn hotel motel or other place of lodgin g except for an establishment located within building that contains not more than five rooms for rent or hire and that is actually occupied by the proprietor of such establishment as the residence of such proprietor59 the ada also covers commercial facilities which it defines as facilities intended for nonresidential use whose operations affect commerce the term excludes however facilities that are covered or expressly exempted from coverage under the fair housing act in other words the ada leaves to the fha the determination as to which statute applies to any particular facility 60 continued seeing eye dogs must be permitted even if building otherwise prohibits pets and handicapped parking spaces must be made available even if spaces are otherwise assigned on firstcomefirstserved basis 24 cfr 100204b 54 covered multifamily dwellings have four or more living units 24 cfr 100201 55 42 usc 3604f3c in 1991 hud published final fair

the residential wing would be covered by the fha even though the rest of the hotel would be covered by the ada however if hotel allows both residential and shortterm stays but does not allocate space for these different uses in separate discrete units both the ada and the fair housing act may apply to the facility such determinations will need to be made on casebycase basis similar analysis would

from housing discrimination under section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 discrimination against individuals with disabilities is prohibited in any federally funded or federally conducted program or activity61 and under the architectural barriers act of 1968 certain publicly owned residential buildings and facilities must be accessible to i ndividuals with physical disabilities62

handicap extends to protect group homes for the disabled from discrimination by cert ain types of state or local zoning laws while the fha does not limit the applicability of any reasonable local state or federal restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy dwelling63 it does prohibit local zoning and land use laws that treat groups of unrelated persons with disabilities less favorably than similar groups of unrelated persons without disabilities 64 nevertheless some municipalities have attempted to restrict the location of group homes for disabled individuals by enacting zoning ordinances that establish occupancy limits for group homes65 typically established to maintain the residential character of certain neighborhoods such occupancy limits frequently operate to restrict group homes for recovering drug users or other disabled individuals it is also possible that citys denial of variance from such an occupancy ordinance could be in violation of the fha if the denial is not reasonable66 as result these limits continue to be the subject of controversy and legal challenges under the fha67 indeed in 1995 the supreme court considered the issue of zoning restrictions on group homes for the handicapped in city of edmonds v oxford house inc 68 group home for 10 to 12 adults recovering from alcoholism and drug addiction was cited for violating city ordinance because it was located in neighborhood zoned for singlefamily residences the ordinance that oxford house inc was charged with violating defined family as persons without regard to number related by genetics adoption or marriage or group of five or fewer unrelated persons 69 continued facilities and other facilities where persons may reside for varying lengths of time

acknowledged that it was in violation of the ordinance but claimed that it was entitled to be in the neighborhood anyway because the fha required the city to make reasonable accommodations in rules policies practices or services when such accommodations may be necessary to afford handicapped persons equal opportunity to use and enjoy dwelling70 the city responded that it was not required to accommodate the group home because the fha exempts from its coverage any reasonable local state or federal restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy dwelling 71 the supreme court held that this exemption did not permit the citys zoning ordinance because the ordinances definition of family was not restriction regarding the maximum number of occupants dwelling may house72 according to the court the fha does not exempt prescriptions of the familydefining kind ie provisions designed to foster the family character of neighborhood instead 3607b1s absolute exemption removes from the fhas scope only total occupancy limits ie numerical ceilings that serve to prevent overcrowding in living quarters 73 because the ordinance set numerical ceiling for unrelated occupants but not related occupants it was clearly designed to preserve the family character of neighborhoods not to place overall occupancy limits on residences as result the court held that the ordinance was not exempt from the fhas prohibition against disability discrimination74 the court did not decide whether or not this ordinance actually violated the fha75 in cases in which the ordinance in question is designed to foster the family character of neighborhood or facially discriminates against fha protected class by differentiating on its face between protected groups and nonprotected groups the burden is on the defendant to show that it is not unlawful discrimination under the fha however the us courts of appeals are split as to which of two discriminatory treatment tests defendants must meet in this situation before addressing the details of these two tests it is important to note that determining if zoning ordinances violate the fha requires casebycase assessment based on the ordinance language and the specific facts surrounding the alleged violation andor the citys denial of variance from the ordinance76 this makes predicting how court will rule on particular ordinance difficult especially in light of the fact that the lower courts do not apply single uniform test however an analysis of existing case law can provide some guidance on the matter minority of courts including the eighth circuit apply rational basis test which merely requires the defendant town or city to show there is legitimate nondiscriminatory purpose for classification or denial from variance on the basis of fha protected class 77 this is 70 42 usc 3604f3b see edmonds 514 us at 72930 71 42 usc 3607b1 see edmonds 514 us at 736 72 edmonds 514 us at 728 quoting 42 usc

low burden to meet the majority rule which is followed by the sixth ninth and tenth circuits on the other hand requires the defendant to meet more exacting test78 in oxford housec v city of st louis the eighth circuit addressed city ordinance that limited single family dwellings to three unrelated indivi duals or in the case of group home to eight unrelated individuals the court stated rat her than discriminating against oxford house residents the citys zoning code favors them on its face79 because the ordinance was not deemed to be discriminatory the eighth circuit held that the city need only provide rational basis for enacting the ordinance requirement which was satisfied by the citys demonstration of an interest in preserving residential neighborhoods80 furthermore the eighth circuit held that the city did not fail to accommodate the oxford house as the act requires because the group home refused to apply for variance for higher occupancy limits and therefore never gave the city the opportunity to grant such accommodation 81 in contrast the sixth circuit court of appeals in larkin v department of social services addressed state licensing requirement that group homes for the handicapped may not be spaced within 1500 foot radius of other such group homes and must notify the communities in which the group homes are to be located82 the court ruled that these spacing and notification requirements discriminated on their face holding that statutes that single out for regulation group homes for the handicapped are facially discriminatory83 once the court ruled that these nonuniform conditions were facially discriminatory the test shifted from rational basis test to more demanding test that required the defendant to demonstrate that they are warranted by the unique and specific needs and abilities of those handicapped persons to whom the regulations apply84 the sixth circuit held that the state had failed to meet this burden in general the department of justice and hud take the position and most courts that have addressed the issue agree that density restrictions are generally inconsistent with the fair housing act 85 with regard to claims that localities failed to make reasonable accommodations for group homes the joint statement by hud and the department of justice states whether particular accommodation is reasonable depends on the facts and must be decided on casebycase basis the determination of what is reasonable depends on the answers to two questions first does the request impose an undue burden or expense on the local government second does the proposed use create fundamental alteration in the zoning scheme if the answer to either question is yes the requested accommodation is unreasonable 86 78 comty house v city of boise

of necessary reasonable accommodation might be allowing deaf tenant to have hearing dog in an apartment complex that normally prohibits pets87 another example might be the provision of variance from an ordinance that bars five or more unrelated people from living in single family home for group home of five handicapped individuals where it is shown that such home would have more impact on parking traffic noise utility use and other typcial concerns of zoning than an ordinary family denial of variance from this ordinance likely would not be unreasonable for group home of 35 handicapped
