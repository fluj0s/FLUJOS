tuesday i reported that the governmentfinally allowed to discuss matters that hadpreviously been protected in regards to myclient alghizzawi in fact the governmentunclassified and allowed for public release apetition for original habeas corpus that i filed inthe us supreme court i released that petitionto the public in accordance with thegovernments designation of unclassified onfriday the department of justice doj told methat it had made mistake and that it hadapparently violated the protective order anorder that sets out the rules for the doj andhabeas counsel in regards to the guantanamocases entered in the case when it unclassifiedand allowed for public release information in thepetition that it wanted to protect and thattherefore i must remove my post of november 17because of the dojs mistake i explained to thedoj attorneys that the petition and my post ofnovember 17th were widely distributed and areavailable at various sites on the webthey do notseem to care about that they only care that inot report about what they are now trying todeclare protected information 5 days afterthey unclassified the material and made itavailable for public releasethis is of course outrageous conduct by thedojin trying to declare something asprotected after being clearly designated anddistributed to the public but what else is newfor those of you who either remember mynovember 17th post or have it available on yourwebsitei originally learned of the so calledprotected information from public sourceand the judge in alghizzawis case still ruledthat i could not discuss it anyway later thisweekend i will try to provide all of the links that ican find from other sources who properlyreported on the petition and my saga regardingit for now i am leaving you with these twolinkshere and here as i happen to have theseeasily availablei also expect several websites and other mediaoutlets to be reporting on this and making thepetition available at their websites because theyreceived it from back when i was allowed todistribute it or otherwise obtained it on theinternet i also provided interviews earlier thisweek and i expect that those will soon beavailable too if any of you have time out there tofind some of the websites where this story andpetition are published please feel free to providea linkor if you see it pop up on websites in thecoming weeks please provide those links as wellthis is not the end of this story under theprotective order the government must actuallyget the judges permission to retroactively keepme and only from publishing and discussionthe information that the government now seeksto protect the doj will have to file documentwith the court explaining why this now verypublic information should be protectedultimately it will be the judges decision if youdo not see my post back up that will mean thatthe judge agreed with the government that ialone cannot talk about those things that you areprivy to discussi will just
