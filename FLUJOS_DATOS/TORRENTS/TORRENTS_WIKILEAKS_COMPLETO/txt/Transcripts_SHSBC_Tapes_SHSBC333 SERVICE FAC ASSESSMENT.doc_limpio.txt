service fac assessment lecture given on 5 september 1963 thank you well youre very lucky today very lucky today im not mad at anybody what is this date audience 5th of september five sept ad 13 and we have lecture here on scientology three which wraps up the field of psychotherapy i dont wish to overemphasize these banal sweeping statementsand i dont even think you heard it in fact i know you didnt ill say it again i have lecture here which wraps up the field of psychotherapy thank you thank you all right now we have been walking around the edges of the field of psychotherapy by which we determine its relationship to the neurotic and the insane and so on for very long time weve been giving the boys who we thought were holding down this field the courtesy of more or less staying out of it and so forth but there are some interesting things which you should know before i go into the technical material involved here and this is sequitur to the two lectures which you have heard this week but therere some things which you should know at this stage the word psychiatry has proprietorship has legal definition is supposed to be the treatment of the neurotic or the insane and isnt owned by anybody isnt patented means nothing in law and so forth but does mean something to the public i consider thats interesting we were having some press trouble here few weeks ago and i wrote at that time some articles on this particular subject which clarified i had to study two particular spheresthat of newspaper and had to study the field of psychotherapy to some degree and although i was talking great deal about psychiatry i finally differentiated exactly what i was talking about i was talking about the untrained mental doctor in the field of psychiatry he has business there of course you always look for an aberrated situation youll find that theres lie connected with it things which people cant solve have lie connected with them and that thing we call service facsimile and this happens to be the thirddynamic service facsimile the medical doctor who is not trained for and has business in the field of mental healing is attempting to take dominance over this particular field see hes not trained mental practitioner in fact somebody just gave clippingdown in australia some london bigwig comments on the amount of training given the medical doctor and i think it was ten halfhour lectures most of which were unattended by the students real roast this man is not trained in the field of the mind hes trained in brains and surgery so therefore he applies braingray matter and surgery and force and electric shocknaturally applies these things because he doesnt understand the mind at all he has proprietorship over the mind and as matter of fact hes not trained in the mind at all hes trained in the brain he knows it occupies the skull and that you can shove ice picks in it and this he considers mental healing ah but hes told big lie hes told whopping lie and hes put it across on legislatures and that sort of thing that the medical doctor is qualified to operate in the field of mental healing and of course hes not trained in the field of mental healing and all youd have to do is bring pressure to bear on legislatures that people who are not trained exclusively in the field of the mind may not practice in the field of the mind and youve secured the entire field of the mind i think any legislature would pass this people who are not trained in the field of the mind must not practice in the field of the mind banal its on that stable datum that most legislatures pass laws misrepresentation youve got to be trained in the field of the mind you see thats the isness of the situation the big lie is that people who arent trained in the field of the mind at all are practicing in the field of the mind and calling themselves psychiatrists which they are not theyre medical doctors the only person you have to deny the field of the mind to is the medical doctor and he has business there as far as the field of the human mind is concerned george the other day did survey out of all existing society records and so forth and found out there were 272 mental practitioners in england outside of scientologists 272 and there were some eight nurses who were also qualified to give diathermy to the disturbed272 well we outnumber them man over and over and over i mean just active scientologists outnumber them in england theyre nothing to outnumber there are 70 in south africa in all of south africa there are 70 in other words there is field of the mind theres apparently great deal of advertising theres the medical doctor who is numerically very short in supply and theres lots of articles in the newspapers saying the field of the mind the field of the mind theres legislatures theres appropriations everything is all laid out just as though there is field of mental healing i wish to point out to you my fair friend that its totally unoccupied field there isnt anybody in it they rattle around like an atom in cubic lightyear of space see they arent you dont have an opponent and one of our lies then is that there is some opposition and we have done the trick of putting an item where it isnt see weve said theres opposition there therefore weve mocked up our own opposition and you know how serious it is with pc when you put an extra item into gpm see well weve done that now somebody gratuitously someplace or another i dont know on what budget is advertising the existence of mental healing i dont know but theyre spending fantastic quantities of money on it theres nobody to receive the results of it except us this becomes ludicrous situation therefore people qualified at level iii will very soon have available to them certificate as psychiatric consultant its perfectly all right with if you call yourself psychiatrist marvelous people must be looking all over the society for these psychiatrists you see thats 272 of em isnt this fantastic situation when you look at itwhen you look at it right in the teethyou see that it is fantastic situation now when you recognize that human illness will surrender to r1c and certainly to r2cyou know thats just what solutions have you had to your lumbosis budyoure going to get 60 70 percent return there would be 30 percent 40 percent something like that that wont recover thats because they require further care but just your ordinary healing you know what you can do with an assist you know what you can do in this various levels the medical doctor isnt even then safe in his own field of healing he isnt safe there because i think that an hca an hpa very shortly will be graduated in the field of healing hell know the three corners of the arc triangle and the eight dynamics and hell know some of the basics of scientology and he will know how to keep in an itsa line and keep it directed to the persons illness or something like that and just about that level we have an hcahpa and then your level iii is somebody who can list and do prepcheck so weve opened the gates here by taking out and training and specializing in now when you think of your level of training well this is something else isnt it so that requires much broader recognition and theres lot of hcas and hpas right now who wont be just eligiblethrough the training they are getting right this minutethey wont just be eligible for an hca or an hpa theyll be eligible for an hss dont you see all theyve got to do is round off their qualifications for hcahpa with their itsa line dont you see and that gives them that but theyve already gone on to prepchecking and meters and all kinds of wild things of this particular character and so on so theyve practically completed their hss now how about you how about you sitting here you see what do we do with you well i dont know weve already got you certificate havent we and we can also make this other certificate available to you psychiatric consultant so if you want this certificate listen to this lecture because im not going to have it said about us that we give ten onehalfhour lectures which nobody attended well go them one better youre here listen now youve already had two lectures on this subject the difference is we expect now that you produce some results with this now youve been getting your fingers this is the lecture im giving you now those were mainly announcements giddy world we live in the orientation of scientologyreorientation of scientologylooks very innocent it looks like nothing much happened i put out these five levels of scientology you know and it brought order order order order order and everything has been snapping into place beautifully well youre the winner because youve gone all the way on up through the lot dont you see and the future face of scientology will look bit different but level iii is expected to be able to clear and it also incidentally and accidentally takes in the whole field of neurosis and psychosis and gives you greater purchase on this particular zone and area than any mental practitioner in existence on the face of this planetor any other one for that matter youll be far more qualified to treat the insane if you can do this particular trick because this is the only thing that makes them insane this is the basis of insanity the basis of neurosis and the bringing about of state of clear are all the same breed of cat except theyre just different degrees its what is wrong with the mind but its in different degree the degree is whether person can live with it or not and if he cant really live with it but just worries about it all the time all the time and really cant live it at all and so forth well we say hes neurotic and if he cant even manage himself in his environment we say hes insane but whats wrong with him hes got the final solution hes got final solution and that solution is not necessarily the solution of being insane it is some solution which is allpervading and makes it unnecessary to itsa anything after that he never has to look so of course what happens to him he just disappears in mound of unasised mass he never has to look all he needs is the solution now in processing certain amount of introversion takes place certain amount of introversion takes place by reason of processing but that introversion is only undertaken to bring about extroversion the actual progress of case depends upon the raising of the r and c of that case step by step forward the only way that introversion does not lead introversion and erasure of somethingdoes not then lead to greater ability to reach in the environment or greater arc the only reason that does not occur is when overrestimulation is brought about in other words you restimulate twenty units and pick up ten of charge you see well now although you have advanced the case by means of erasure youve actually increased the introversion of the case by running it at too high level of restimulation that factor still exists in class iv youve restimulated too much but it is full track whole track that is most likely to get pc into this condition youre not likely to get this pc into this condition in the very circumscribed area of one lifetime you have to let his attention wander all over the whole track and on to the backtrack and let him itsa this gpm and that gpm and another gpm and this chain and that chain and not flatten these things and so forth at level iv in order to get this individual more introverted by reason of processing than extroverted but of course youre winning all the time even though youre winning with an introverted pc in other words hes looking in all the time hes looking in he is not reaching more he will eventually come out of the woods at the far end of this thing and have tremendous reach but during the period of his going he is overrestimulated and therefore introverted thats the ills of overrestimulation they are not very great youre not likely to spin anybody thats at level iv what about overrestimulation at level iii well at level iii you take somebody who is very very batty you could probably overrestimulate him in this lifetime lets take somebody who is in catatonic schizophrenia lets use fancy termdoesnt mean anything catatonia means theyre lying still in apathy unmovingly and not reaching anything schizophrenia means scissors i dont know how you can lie still in scissors but theyve managed it just shows you what happens when strange people who dont know anything about the mind try to invade the field and advertise that they can do something in it they get things corned up this way lets put it more factually this character is in total apathytotal unmoving apathy hes lying there in the asylum if you put your finger on the exact button this person could talk about and would talk about the person would communicate with you but if you put your finger on half dozen other things and plunge them into even thislifetime engram or something like that the person would spin more dont you see so the worse off case is even in one lifetimeand this is true for all cases even on the whole trackthe worse off case is the more careful you have to be about overrestimulation if you restimulate something pick up the charge you have restimulated that is the byword on this now you wont see very great upsets by this but once in while somebody willwho is pretty bad off somebody who is pretty neurotic or something like thatif youre treating this person if youre processing this person and you all of sudden just ask them accidentally for any pain or anything that was connected with that incidentand of course theyve been running it on conceptual basis and werent close to anything like thatand they suddenly go into more pain and they practically spin in front of your eyes you got the idea so the worse off case is the less reach they have the less arc they have with their environmentthese are the things which measures worse off see the less reach the less arcthe easier it is to overrestimulate the case becomes very easy to overrestimulate the case because youre using very powerful tools actually and they go into the mind like theyre going through hot butter and its very easy to do this so remember this this datum monitors all clearing efforts and thats level iii you see youre not going on the whole track to clear anybody that is the next thing you must realize that youre going to stay off the whole track if youre going to clear somebody youre going to stay in this lifetime and thats the only place you gonna stay if youre practicing level iii you have not left this lifetime if youre practicing level ii you have not left this lifetime level i you have not left this lifetime you got it the only place you leave this lifetime is level iv and the only reason you take somebody down the line on level iv if their tone arm is sitting more or less in very active condition and it never goes low and it never sticks high and then youre going to run somebody down the track because then its very difficult to overrestimulate them you can overrestimulate them at level iv you can just perforce overrestimulate them in spite of good tone arm action and so forth you can do it but this is level iv this is level iv when you take them on the whole track so class class ii class iii whole track nyet nyet nyet see strictly russian participation in world affairs guy says you know i think ive lived before oh good thank you very much im glad of that now in your immediate environment here have you noticed you understand why because if this person is having trouble now we get to the next factor of restimulation see this is all piece with what youve been hearing about restimulation and everything else it all integrates together very nicely you got another factor youre working uphill with with any pc on this planet particularly and that environmental restimulation and it is environmental restimulation that is the straw that breaks the pcs back if you can audit the whole track on pc who also has environmental restimulation you are doing something heroic it can be done it makes hard auditing and you are doing it right this moment in z unit so dont think it cant be done but you know right there that its source of considerable amount of upset and worry guy has ptps he has this he has that and so forth what are all these things whats all this constant level of restimulation in this environment you take in an hgc where people are walking in off the street these people have ptps theyre just nothing but walking ptp well all right that means their environment is keeping them tremendously restimulated day after day night after night their environment is restimulating them thats environmental restimulation thats the wifes natter and the kids demand for another shilling thats the income tax folder that is lying in the mailbox thats the news that just comes out on tv that all males are now going to be conscripted below the age of and above the age of or maybe see its this its that its the other thing environmental restimulation when this source of restimulation is at high level the pc is unauditable and the difficulty that the auditor has in carrying forward ease to good win is basicallywhen dealing with the public at large and that sort of thingis basically auditor versus environmental restimulation not auditor versus bank at all now this is so great that an individual who has tremendous present time problems in his environment does not make progress on his auditing he will not change his graph now we know that thats stable datum man thats in with spikes and rocks and welded they know that in hgcs before they operate very long they learn that one pc has continuous ptp throughout the intensive there will be graph change of any kind whatsoever if he has ptp throughout the intensive and arc breaks during the intensive the graph will worsen how to make high graph well youve got to audit the pc in such way as to get around the environmental restimulation therefore the practice of an hgc operating mainly with raw public or partially interested scientologists or just newcomers something like thator even oldtimers very oftenis battle with the environmental restimulation the surroundings in which this person lives its not battle with the reactive mind at all now when this environmental restimulation rises or when the pc is more susceptible to it he gets into states which are called neurotic and psychotic there are psychotics on the whole trackno whole track psychotics psychosis is temporary condition which normally exists in one lifetime interesting look isnt it very temporary condition because its environmental restimulation monitored by the susceptibility of the individual to that environmental restimulation and thats all there is to it its his ability to withstand the restimulation of the environment versus the environmental restimulation now of course persons ability to withstand the environmental restimulation is one erg of thrust back you see and the environmental restimulation is three ergs right away youre going to get conditionof course im giving you an erg or dyne or something like that you see as some fantastically i think dyne is the amount of force exerted by one somethingorother infiniteone gram going one centimeter what is this thing its something on the order of lead pencil droppinga lead dropping from the end of the pencil to the table dont you see over distance of about half an inch you know just nothing see well this guys very weak little fellow and he lives on little farm and its long way from every place and its awful quiet but his environmental thrustback is capable of only one erg see and by god one day the pigs get loose and by god he spins you see this is proportional this helps you understand what happens to cases and this other guy has three megatrons of resistance and hes got forty footpounds of thrust in his environment see nothing you see doesnt even dent him see run the whole track like crazy see see his environmental restimulation is fantastic it would have killed forty people see it just doesnt happen to bother him he can handle that much dont you see so its the environmental restimulation on the one hand and the ability of the individual to front up to it on the other hand which gives you your difficulties of cases its those two factors in combinationsee these two factors in combination it isnt just the environmental restimulation well you see theres fifteen office workers and all of sudden concrete mixer sets up across the street and they start putting up new building and one of them goes batty and the fourteen do all right whats this its the same stimuli see same amount of environmental restimulation but one of those girls had very low resistancethat is low thrustback well therefore if you simply studied the environmental restimulation and sought to reduce environmental restimulation by social or public measures making it very quiet life you would make lot of people go sane this is perfectly truebut lot more would go mad with boredom see so the dogooder with his idea of peace peace peace peace is trying to get himself an environment that he can live in that he wont spin in see dont you see and these characters that go out beating the drum along this line as an exclusive thing you see theyll work the hardest at it because theyre the most worried about it but they create in the final analysis very dull world and therefore they get protested against for instance people have hobbies some people have some hobbies some people have other hobbies some people have the hobbies of knitting some people have hobbies of sitting still and daydreaming some people have the hobbies of riding motorcycles and some people have the hobbies of shooting down airplanes see there are various hobbies this is how much randomity an individual thinks is necessary to the environment and youre coming back now to an old principle of acceptable randomity well acceptable randomity is this ratio which i just talked to you about people for long time couldnt understand this factor well heres the understanding of it its the amount of restimulation of the environment measured against the amount of restimulation which the individual can withstand and these two factors together give you constant now its very hard to work out this constant because we have actual figures but express it in terms of life this individual is able to stand one dinner party see and he gets two funerals and suicide you see how you can work this out and heres this fellow who can withstand two massacres you see and wreck and he gets as his environmental restimulation one dinner party see so you get these differences amongst people and it makes them all look different but actually its on the same basis and its on this basis of restimulation now youre busy auditing youre auditing this guy that can stand the randomity of one dinner party and you audit him into an engram where he had wreck now his environment consists of what the ability to withstand dinner party but the restimulation of the environment is what youre running him on which is one wreck hes promptly swamped hes promptly swamped he cant run that kind of an incident he just goes in over his head dont you see well one of the ways pcs solve this is by not going in and it is probably the favorite method of resolution they audit only what they consider safe this is almost line one of book three of dianetics the modern science of mental health see the mind monitoringyou know it wont go in over its head we got techniques now which can push guy in over his head but thats beside the point the point is that the mind tends to shut off any restimulation that will overwhelm it it just tends to its like this guy can stand one dinner party and you say how would you like to have two funerals and wreck uuuhgh see actually this gets so bad that if two funerals and wreck incur in his environment he can actually just be completelythey didnt exist they arent real to him he locks them up out there as not having happened and so does he lock up his bank as not having happened in other words his ability to resist restimulation is too low for him to face up to track and theres your problem as an auditor how are you going to get rid of any track with this boy huh how are you going to get rid of any track at all how are you going to get anything done on this case at all because that ease is liable to sit there and not even come in close to its track or ambitiously going in over its head all the time so cases actually divide into three categories those who are audited easily those who wont even approach the bank and those who are always trying to commit suicide in one well call these cases three two and one with the one the case who can be audited you see and the other two you see as cases that always are going it too strong man in eating youd say their eyes were bigger than their stomachs and all this kind of thing then the other fellow who just wonttwo you knowjust the guy that just doesnt even come near the bank he just doesnt have anything to do with it see what bank you know what bank engrams all over the place you see he just got throughjust got through going through windshield see what engram you know hes cutting his throat with it all the time doesnt exist see and you say well lets run out this accident you just had see what accident where accident i just learn to take things calmly in life you see and hes sick and sick and sick man hes just learned to take things calmly in life see hes got something going there see well how do we convert case two and case three into case one how do we convert these two cases one which audits at suicidal level and the one which audits on noapproach basis at all and you cant get anything done and that noapproach basis is your most flagrant example of the stuck tone arm the low tone arm the dead thetanthese misbehaviors of the tone arm see dont come near the bank hasnt got anything to do with him now how do you convert that case into one that is auditable with good tone arm motion well now i haveive given you lot of technical data here i dont really expect you to do too much with it or think about it too much im sure you understand it but im giving you the actual technical background to the highly elementary material which im now going to give you this material is very elementary all cases tend toward the safe solution all cases tend toward the safe solution youre making note on it write it down and underscore it thats very very important that is an element of simplicity the like of which you never saw see some casessome casesalso adopt vengeful solution getting even with them by dying now when i say all cases adopt safe solution oddly enough the dangerous solution comes under the heading of safe solution this gets wacky but the safe thing to do is to jump off london bridge because it all comes under the heading of safe solution dont you see but its actually sounds highly dangerous and they very often go in over their heads that characterizes then your cases that youre having any trouble with or having any trouble in processing one has simply adopted good safe solution and the other one has adopted dangerous solution because it is safe i know it doesnt make sense thats whats the trouble with it now if you move these cases over into the auditable line you will move them over on the channel of safe solution all cases move over on the channel of safe solutionsafe solution very very important safe solution can be stated as safe decision safe assumption safe treatment safe environment safe position you have world here which is securityoriented it is for instance trying to keep up the ideals and ideals of human rights but we notice that human rights and human liberty are succumbing why because twenty bystanders stand around and watch the cops mess up citizens human rights because theyre all operating on safe solution so all human rights disappear down the channel of the safe solution that is the hole in the bottom of the bathtub its the most dangerous thing in the world to have safe solution because that is the hole out of which sanity drains safe solution inhibits observation and anything which inhibits observation destroys whether person is merely difficult to get over toward his bank or is going in headlong or in much worse statethese are specialized states and are not gradients of the other stateis very neurotic or is completely psychotic they are not cousins to these other states its just to the degree that they have adopted safe solution thats all that establishes it thats the common denominator now you could make lot of out of thatout of just that statement just as philosophic truth and it is philosophic truth and that is the plow that plows the furrow straight down through the middle of the problem of the human mind as it has been approached and as it has been attempted toward solution by mental healinggranting this thing called mental healing that just plows it right up man thats the end of that this datum underlies mental healing with the same sweepingness as survival is the common denominator of existence you see its actually another method of saying survival in aberrated form people make survival solutions which then become so safe that they become contrasurvival so you have entered brandnew datum here youve got brandnew datum which is as compelling and as sweeping and so forth in the field of mental healing as survival is in life people solve things in the direction of survival even when it means they have to succumb when it gets into mental healing you are actually investigating the difficulties people are having surviving but the basic method of survival is the safe solution and that makes the individual right and makes others wrong and therefore intends to enhance the persons survival by bringing about position of dominance permits him to escape domination and permits him to dominate others and then at the higher level permits him to survive and causes others to succumbhe thinks with great amazement youll find committing suicide as survival computation as it becomes more and more aberrated how to survive not to survive of course everybody is solving that the miser how does he survive how does he survive well every once in while in new york they dig somebody out of an attic or something like that hes been dead for three or four weeks and the guy has got stuffing in his mattress at all theres nothing in there but hundreddollar bills you see and his method of survival is to have lots of money and thats very safe solution but hes neglected in his obsession with this safe solution to spend any of it in order to live so as attention becomes more and more concentrated it becomes less and less sensible for an individual to be totally wise it is necessary for him to be able to observe his environment he also must be able to permeate his environment he has to be able to have reach it isnt good enough to have couple of maxims tucked behind your left medulla oblongata to which you can refer in times of stress the arabian ruler every now and then would be calling up poets to help him out in his efforts to rule fleabitten population whose favorite pastime was executing rulers and they would come up with such things such gems as that too shall come to pass away very wise very wise and yet if it were adapted totally itd kill somebody people have philosophy all mixed up with these witticisms these platitudes they look through philosophy for safe solutions and you can take philosophic textbook that has been down in the local library and has been read by pencil marginscribblers and all youre reading there are things which they widely agree with but which they also consider safe solutions philosophy then is not study of wisdom philosophy is simply study of safe solutions makes it very lowlevel activity actually for instance kant had himself safe solution and i imagine thats what made him batty he had good safe solution lot of things were unknowable they were so unknowable that nobody would ever know about them and this of course is completely nuts if these unknowable things can never at any time be sensed measured or experienced how the hell did he know they existed well he didnt so he made up fantasy over there someplace called the unknowable and this made him very comfortable he could live in the knowable and this is so general and so forth you even find it in dianetics modern science of mental healthsays you dont have to know everything in order to know this well thats fine and that disarms ones thrust into this and the amount of overwhelm it lets him compartment things and look at things in sections rather than just be overwhelmed by the whole dont you see well thats an entirely different operation than finding safe solution and then drawing off into corner someplace with this safe solution and never looking at anything again and that activity is what you will find most people engaged in now that safe solution is what we call service facsimile and thats all it is now you can be very cunning auditor you can be very clever auditor and sometimes let impart this to you on the side youre going to have to be clever youre going to have to turn up your genius to cube level to find that safe solution in somebody itll be lying right in front of your face and youll feel like fool when you finally pick it up but there it was but to find out exactly what it is and to use that and so forthits very easy to state very easy to do this but remember in the pc it is extremely alterised complicated and so forth even though its sitting right on top its not believable thats one of the things there could be thousands of them dont you see and its picking out the one from those thousands thats whats going to give you the most trouble and sometimes youre just going to do this on sheer genius and find that you were dead right and other times youre going to exert great deal of time and trouble and sheer genius and youre dead wrong so the final test of it is is did it resolve the case have i found the service fac is answered by when audited did it resolve case if answer is yes i have found service fac on case if answer is it didnt resolve case i have not found service fac and in the first ones you find the most you can hope for is that you have found something that moves the tone arm and has moved you closer to finding the service fac see so you always willing to settle for thatalways willing to settle for something that moved the tone arm because that of course will move you closer to finding the service facsimile see always willing to settle for that and sometimes after youve found two or three of theseand each one you knew was the service fac but somehow or other this pc didnt go free needleactually theyve been very droopy for the next couple of days hahha you know didnt resolve the case we sure found the service fac on that pc except it didnt resolve his ease yeah i can hear you now sitting around the table in the evening coffee shop saying well sure found joes service facsimile you know i sure found it it was very brilliant job we managed to get these three coordinating lines and they all crossed exactly in this place and it was swallowing swords and hes always thought of that and so forth and we got his service facsimile and so forth and so on joe comes up and hes looking or now hes in total propitiation yes they found my service fac yes yes they found it i feel terriblei mean i feel good so you see the test itselfthe statement is very simpleand the test of whether or not you found the service fac is also very simple it actually reads on the meter if you have found service fac on the case the needle will be looser and the tone arm in more reasonable condition see and if you finally walked it all the way through to the service fac on the case see its like all of these extra service facs youve been pulling off it are something like bands of trees and sod that lie up against the mountain peak you see you havent got the mountain peak but you sure got lot of trees off of it you know and you got some rocks off of it and its looking more like peak anyway it was just surrounded in clouds when you first located it see the test of it in each case is looser needle betteracting tone arm see so youre always willing to settle for that now the other rule that you come up against here is that which doesnt run on the rightwrong when found you prepcheck and that which wont run on prepcheck you run on the rightwrong so you got it coming and going this is pretty loose well let see you looked through the pcs folder and you found peanuts and you found brothersand this was other you know this is oldtime stuff thats been found on the pc assessments of one kind or anotheryou found mechanics and you found dog biscuits and you found see various things you know you dug these up out of his old 212 and his parts of existence and his this and his that and that sort of thing well actually you could make progress with the case if you just applied this rule is just prepcheck each one got it you could assess the list and take the one with the biggest read and prepcheck that and then assess the same list again because it must have some residence in the ease you see and whatever else you find prepcheck that dont you see and just prepcheck anything you found see just prepcheck it and the second that youre not getting tone arm action from the prepcheck run this is awful crude what im giving you right now you understand but im just showing it you can take this gun thats been developingthats r3scyou can just take this gun and point it in almost any direction and birds fall out of the sky see its marvelous hunting i mean case is going to make improvement matter what you do well that which you cant prepcheck with tone arm action you could treat as service facsimile see i mean just one two one two see so it either prepchecks or it runs on right and wrong see how would it make you right and make others wrong well pcit doesnt do much on prepcheck and it doesnt do much on rightwrong all right all right so there werent any birds in that section of the sky the gun went off into i mean you havent done anybody any harm you havent done anybody any harm at all and this is sort of creeping up on the mountain you take layer of clouds off of it and you cut couple of trees on the slope and you bulldoze away an avalanche away from the side of the thing and so forth and its looking bigger and starker and so on more clouds coming off of the thing you see and its getting clearer and clearer to view because you cant keep up this type of action without displaying eventually the service facsimile now the funny part of it is even the most obtuse auditor if he kept up this type of action of assessing something or finding something that had been assessed and heprepchecking it and if it didnt prepcheck well run rightwrong on it see you know run the steps of r3sc on it see if you cant prepcheck it its obviously turning on mass so therefore if its turning on mass obviously it has something to do with the service facsimile so you run the rightwrong and you get that out of the road and so forth you just keep going at this sort of thing and keep list of your debris of other things that have turned up maybe in the process of doing so and your clevernessyour cleverness will pay off in length of time the cleverer the auditor the shorter time he can do it in this is about the only thing youre narrowing down but the very very clever auditor can be too clever im not warning you against being clever be genius man perfectly all right but you actually can take this casenow thats why i started this lecture with the restimulation datayou can take this case and there is an assessment im now going to give you which is so powerful that this poor guy has the resistance of one dinner party see and youre going to present him with the guts of his whole case youre probably going to spend the next few hours holding his hand because the walls keep going bloooo zooong now i told an oldtime auditor who is guest here today mike told him little while ago i says you see were auditing the stable datum out of the road of the confusion so the confusion will flow off and thats what the flow is on the emeter and he went bzzzzzzzz you see because hes been taught differently hes been taught that you dont pull the stable datum out from underneath the pc or youll get the confusion see if you do too sudden yank you see and he turned rather pale when i told him this so youll probably be rather pale occasionally in other words you can climb this hill too vertically you can immediately grab the mountain and say its gone see and the pc is saying my god what am i doing in all this mist where am i what is this what is this see whatwhere where where what oohohohoh something terrible is happening to and he feels masses going this way and that way and pains are turning on and off and the end of the roomthe boards all look like theyre going like this see see with great genius you just tsk one mountain less so you see it isnt necessarily the wisest thing in the world not to sneak up on the case but this isnt going to do him any harm providing you run r3sc on it until its flat now you do this assessment and drop it in his lap this is going to be the immediate result its got to be audited now to make it all right so youre going to see periods on pcs when theyre not going to be happy about the whole thing now i told you that any pc is liable to say somewhere in the running of service facsimileone of the tests of service facsimile is does the pc say at any time im not quite sure that it is wise to get rid of this see hes going to say that on real honesttogod service facsimile somewhere along the line thats what hes going to say well you find the service facsimile hes going to say it all at once huhhh hes going to try to put on the brakes all over the place of course he isnt going to make it now youre not going to do anything very desperate to this person as long as you finish him up oh so hes going to have few bad daysits all right its all in the business but you possibly you possiblynow let give you this word of cautionwill practice in field of neurosis or psychosis at some time or another see you go into that field you make awful confounded sure that you unburden the cliffs before you pull the mountain out by the roots because that person by reason of being spinny cannot withstand the environmental restimulation in the first place so youve added the processing restimulation plus the environmental restimulation to somebody who cannot stand the environmental restimulation so of course they cant take any so the only course you can follow with that case even though he is standing thereand this will be true he will be standing there nakedly saying his service facsimile it becomes very tempting you look at some of these characters and theyll be just saying their service facsimile it requires very little genius to figure out exactly what the wording is to make that service facsimile there because hell be saying so now therefore the environmental restimulation has got to be reduced to some degree on the case you follow this in other words the reduction of environmental restimulation should always follow and you should be able to make good that minimal environmental restimulation during processing will occur must always occur and continue to occur during course of processing you have any environmental restimulators present in the vicinity of psychotic and youre not even going to come near it anything matter what you know see because you add the environmental restimulation of processing to you see the actual existing environmental restimulation and itguy is already in whelmedoverwhelmed by the environment so of course he just spins spins harder so thats why you must approach this on gradient now with cases that are just walking about i dont really give you any caution about it at all because it doesnt matter to whether or not these cases go to bed at night and have holes fall in the middle of the floor and various other odd phenomena occur because theyre going to get processed again and the process will take care of the restimulation its ghastly thing to confront and the better the assessment and the less the assessment has been approached on gradientsee in other words the less slopes of the mountain you have processed before you process the service facsimilewhy the greater shock it is to the person theres plenty of restimulation youve just taken their whole difficulties of this lifetime and done an ectomy on it just like thatbang out gone man there it is you see and you leave him with nothing but the confusion there sits the confusion and it hasnt any emeter to bleed through and auditing commands to guide it off and so forth so it just starts hitting the pc from all directions remember this pc adopted this because he couldnt stand the confusion so he adopted safe solution safe solution is always adopted as retreat from the environmental restimulationalways inevitably well therefore doing service facsimile assessment doesnt necessarily require great accuracy at first there have been things found on the case theres things this guy is worried about on the case take some little stable data r1c type of approach to the situation that sort of thing its very good for the case and this becomes healing you see at level ii of scientology youve got healing now you say well what have you done for your lumbosis anybody in your family have lumbosis what did they do for it dont you see what have you done about them any kind of crisscross that might occur on valence shift or something you just get the person talking about it but its solutions youre asking them for safe solutions stable data and the more stable data they have put in the more safe solutions they have put in place about their lumbosis the less the lumbosis will discharge so you keep plucking these things out and eventually the lumbosis will but of course when the environmental restimulation is too great charge will flow off of the case and you will have that percentage of case which just by talking about few things wont give you tone arm shift and thats because this person is already pretty overwhelmed see the environment itself is the overwhelming factor but lets get back to the other how do you raisehow do you raise the ability of an individual to withstand environmental restimulation if this is big factor as i gave you in the beginning of the lecture if thats big factor how do you raise his ability to do it well you doyou pull his service facsimile his service facsimile is what in actual fact reducesbesides his innate capabilities which might be differentits what reduces his ability to see his environment the more safe solutions he has adapted the more environmental restimulation he isnt asising the more he isnt confronting up to the less he can confront up to this becomes dwindling spiral with great speed and rapidity so therefore the thing which reduces his ability to handle his environment oddly enough is the thing he has adapted to handle his environment for him you remove that and you at once increase the individuals ability to handle the environment because hes now seeing it hes inspecting it it might not make him happy but thats not what were trying to make were not trying to make happy person were trying to make an able person theres many lunatic who is quite happy now if you bring about condition then at level iii where an individual does not have environmental restimulation he wont be interrupting his processing because of environmental restimulation and you will be able to go at level iv onto the backtrack because hes longer fighting the environment and that restimulation is not added to his case all the time and its that added restimulation which can be counted on to lock up his tone arm if he has any fragility of his tone arm see its this little added restimulation of the environment the environment is too restimulative therefore he cant go on the backtrack see so its very important that you get that out if you want smooth faster run to ot and now i will let you in on why i have suddenly gone into this line is because i want faster run to ot i dont care anything very much about whether anybody gets clear or not thats just between you and see make hell of lot better human being it solves neurosis solves psychosis makes guy able is fast thing to do it is not slow freight through arkansas you can make clear by getting off enough service facsimiles you can make stable clear so you dont keep apologizing for the fact hes only keyedout clear because hes going to stay that way longer you see and all this is better human beings better human beings and so forth and thats fine and its well worthwhile state to achieve and people will be happy with this state and everything is fine and just between you and i i dont really care about the state at alli want somebody to be able to hit the whole track see so its been developed and i put up the speed of development to cut down the length of time in processing at level iv which is already sizable amount so by reducing the environmental restimulation off of level iv processing by knocking out the service facsimilewhich is what encourages the environmental restimulationwe then have enough attention free so that we can go whole track and erase things faster and were not always being held up by the guy is lowtonearm case the guy has high stuck tone arm we started to do gpm we got little bit mixed up we went into the bear goals and then we got into the helatrobus thenhauhuugh didnt realize it but we were in the invisiblepicture goals all the time now we dont want that pcs tone arm all locked up because of environmental restimulation see session restimulation also drops because any difficulty your pc is having in session is actually environmental restimulation because the session is part of the environment also so if he has session trouble and he has rough sessioning and that sort of thing as one of his difficulties of course if you delete that off he can get lot more done on the whole track anyway so im just getting rid of sources of restimulation dont you see and reasons of restimulation in order to buck into the backtrack and really hit the things that have to be knocked out so we dont have to worry about these other things you see thats important now what is this assessment beyond assessment i see youve all got your paper ready to put down this assessment two or three of you are going to be very surprised youre going to pick up some folders tonight and find yourself looking at it and say why havent you done this you know i mean that kind of an attitude im good at that sort of thing after i get something figured out i have patience with people who dont understand it yeah anyway the assessment is simple one and were back into our old wornout creaking technology of listing and nulling lists and if you dont know how to do this man you just havent been around and i feel sorry for you but im afraid nobody is going to waste much sympathy on you there are many liabilities you can get into with listing and nulling lists and if i hear anybody running partsofexistence list 187 pages why weve got quiet place over at the other end of the estate where gunshot wont be found and so watch it because this just becomes asinine man i mean some people can take these lists and run their service facs crazy on them oh yeah thats fact i mean just run fabulous amounts of lists how long is list well list is as long as it has to be to be nulled its got the item on it and so forth and i can see now people fighting dirty needles and listing and i can see now well did they get the service facsimile on jay did they get the service facsimile yet on jay ill be saying and well theyre still listing lets see when was that oh that was see letswhen did they start listing lets see the folder oh well they started listing month ago youd be amazed ive had this happen so come off of the corn come off of the corn thats just nonsense list is as long as it is necessary to be in order to keep the pc from arc breaking because its incomplete and its just list dont you see so we get into all that trouble but thats perfectly all right we can handle that now any nonsense that we see about it ive already given you what the remedy is see quiet corner of the estate because i frankly am tired of this point of randomity my lists never go longer never go longer than about eight nine ten pages with about twenty items on each page see so i dont understand long list i dont see any reason for long list if your list isnt complete it wont null of course but ive never had to do one longer than that in order to get the thing to null so i dont understand all this otherunless it is simply safe to keep on listing so anyway you do list parts of existence now some of you are highlyyoure already rich because sitting right in your pcs folder will be complete partsofexistence list probably already been done parts of existencething has sometimes even been nulled so you do partsofexistence list and then you null it and i frankly dont care whether it comes out to one in two in three in four in something in that range i dont care i dont care if it rock slams rocket reads i dont care what the resulting item does just as long as it expresses itself some way on the emeter i dont even care if it is right as long as the pc isnt in argument about it thats the one thing that is objected to here so you do good workmanlike job of listing just try to get yourself nice list and null it down rapidly and so forth to point where youve got one item in thats fine thats fine you do that job bless you but if it comes out that four were left in and the list probably wasnt complete in the first place and theres lot of randomity well just do the second step to all four levels left in you understand we couldnt care less its just as long as the pc isnt saying but that couldnt possiblyits because im objecting to it you know i accidentally put down hoop skirts and i dont know why i put them down it doesnt have anything to do with my case at all it doesnt even answer the question and the auditor says well its what is in hoop skirts because youre going for service fac so all things apply and basically the individual is very interested in his service fac now the funny part of it is the pcs will only come close to the mountain and theyll go right on up they cant stop themselves but theres funny zone or area before you get close to the mountain and they sure bounce off of it because theyll dramatize it theyll only do what is safe theyll only say what is safe and they walk very carefully and wont tell you anything mixed up in anything like that theyre walking through life on tightrope see and therefore you may have to do several approaches and this whole assessment may have to be done several times so the accuracy of your first do and the ease with which you can do it or the difficulties with which you do it i dont care about do you understand you probably already got enough in the pcs folder to prepcheck or run r3sc on for some time you understand but i dont even care if you use thatbecause nobody here is in tremulous conditionor just drop the bottom out from underneath him with this assessment because if hes too bad off hes not really going to give you the service fac but hell give its cousin and that cousin is just as good as anything else now youve got list of parts of existence havent you all right and you assessed it didnt you and you wound up with one two three or four bits in all right dandy dandy now we tried to wind up with one in we hoped one would be in makes life simpler and then we take that item that we found and we now list safe solutions for it or safe assumptions about it or safe decisions that can be made about it its what we can clear with the pc what we really want are safe what we really want is service facs with regard to it but thats best expressed by safe solutions or safe assumptions and then you make list there and once more this isnt 187 tightpacked pages leading out because that isnt the processing thats just trying to find something to process you understand so to the best of your ability you get yourself complete list that is nullable and thats got significant phrase or item on it and so forth and you get that out now that doesnt mean youve got the service fac the item there is probably however either as close as you can get to the service fac at this time or the service fac its one or the other so were going to treat it regardless now were going to take this item were going to work it over were not going to do represent list on it were going to work it over were going to get this thing chewed on the final thing that we found out see i dont care what it waswearing petticoats i dont care what it is see and were going to chew on this thing until we can get it till its solution to more than that dynamic we just meanlywe found peanuts on our parts of existence and the thing to do with peanuts the safe thing to do with peanuts was not eat them that was our item see now that is the resulting item for the safe solution to peanuts not eat them see all right now you actually could process this see you could prepcheck it or run r3sc on ityou probably wont be able to prepcheck it because its too close in its going to turn on mass its going to make things pretty sticky but if you talk about this for while to the pc and ask the pc to phrase this up variously how might this type of an assumption apply to other dynamics is there anything else that this would and the pc will have to give you variation of it were taking the partsofexistence list now and were trying to see if this solution fits any other parts of existence and how it would have to be rephrased in order to fit other parts of it and peanuts get the idea were trying to do subtle adjustment here that throws us into broader version of our safe assumption so it applies to more than one dynamic and if we can do that why hurrah hurrah hurrah see were probably sitting on much bigger zone or area of the service fac this is way of graduating it up dont you see but ive told you its perfectly all right for you to just process it just what you found do you understand but youre going to get very smart sooner or later and youre going to say well what do you know you know this fellow says not eat them hmmhmm not eat them not eat them now lets see does that fit to any other part of these dynamics and so forth not eat yeah not eat ah yeah uh it fits uh yes actually fits on the first dynamic fits on the first dynamic fits on the first dynamic and so forth when im processing i always feel like im eating my bank you see its this not eat you know not eat and oh yes yes fourth dynamic you shouldnt eat men yeah fourth dynamic and fifth dyn you sure cant eat mest thats the best answer to mest is not eat it you know and so forth well youve got it away from not eat then this is your most elementary address to the situation you see this thing is broader there was just one little flag sticking up just one little piece of dynamic had this assumption on it but this assumption doesnt actually handle peanuts this handles the whole cockeyed sweeping lot and when youve got one that handles the whole lot man youre sitting there with your paws full of service facsimile and if you havent got it youve got to audit what you did ge youre going to prepcheck it if you cant prepcheck it youre going to run r3sc or youre going to run r3sc on it and if you couldnt run that easily you know questions didnt come upthen youre going to prepcheck it see youre going to handle what you found and then youre going to do the whole operation again only its going to be new partsofexistence list because listen youve prepchecked part of the service fac so his lookingness is going to change so hes going to give you different partsofexistence list see and then youre going to move in on that and youre going to get whatever part of existence you now assessed and then youre going to take that part of existence and youre going to list that you know safe solutions to it safe assumptions about it safe solutions to itwhatever it was you could list that gave you things that sounded like service facs see youre going to get that list complete and then youre going to rip down the line youre going to take one of those out there it sits now youve got nice thing and it says assuming everything will destroy uhoouoouoouooph boy you have hit the bottom of the barrel safe assumption if you dont assume that something might and of course eat peanuts well thats actually devourdevour destroy thats as close as he came into it so on your second assessment he just moved in on the center of it see assuming everything is going to eat up that was the service facsimile you just found an offbeat of it dont you see and you keep working on it you keep working on it and keep working on the pc until you cant make your meter work thats when you end needle gets up toward the middle and it falls see and the needlehave you seen needle that is too difficult to set you cant get it into the set area because it goes and you can guess about where the ta should be but really cant make it very well now thats really free free needle pcs sitting there the pcs not worried about anything but dont think the pc isnt going to worry at some place along this line because youre going to hit this point on every one of these things that you found as you walk in on this if youre doing any kind of job of assessment at all hes going to say ooohh i am not so sure if i get rid of this now theres one other thing you must know about this is you have sometimes processed something on somebody let us saywell lets just use eatan inability to eat and youve processed this out gorgeously see and the pc is still in horrible state with regard to it theres one more step you can do with it after youve finished it all up and the pcthe needle got looser and everything but the pc oh im not so sure about this thing theaa youve just cut the top of it off see so now do safe assumption about the inability to eat or safe assumption about eating you understand you didnt get close enough to the service facsimile you got the idea lets say an inability to eat well actually i gave you bum datum then safe assumption about eating is much more likely to produce the service facsimile in other words this is flipflop he not only used eating but you only caught up to one portion of it you understand and you can work your way through this thing you can get better statement of what you just got through running and finishing up and sometimes you cant get that better statement at which time of course you made it with the first statement im just talking about the adjustments of the assessment see you sometimes will get something like an inability to eat thats service fac and it ran he made people guilty with it and you know he made people wrong and himself right and it all ran out and prepchecked and everything had gotten better but you notice the tone arm still hanging awful still toward the end of this thing it ran well for long time and still at the end of this thing the pc feels kind of you say how do you feel about now the inability to eat well i dont know i meanwhooa there isnt anything for in it to eat and so on and so on well youve flattened everything you could flatten out on the thing dont you see well you better assume that you came close in on the mountain and youd better do safe assumption about the subject of what you found before thats the rule theres some safe assumption with regard to eating that the person could make youre sort of doing safeassumption list on the safe assumption dont you see represent and you get closer into it and that tears up lot more ground got it now that last one may have confused you i couldnt care less because i am not at any moment saying that you must not exercise the highest level of genius in doing this look for identification look for identificationsthat is to say aaa youre doing this prepcheck youre doing this prepcheck on dollsfor some reason or other childrens dolls in this lifetime and so forth on dolls and they say all dolls are cheap or dolls are always given away just watch for it this is totally unreasonable assumption dont you see if you dont watch dolls they are liable to attack you oh yes see completely unreasonable assumption draw little box around it in your auditors reports because youve hit an aaa computation that leads in toward service fac dont you see its completely unreasonable assumption you know why the person is having bad time in this particular zone hes just said so doesnt resolve but the person just said so and youll find out thats cousin to the service facsimile or dead on it see and you keep fooling around and all of sudden why the pc will come up with it and youll come up with it and youll come up with it and the pc will come up with it and ughh all hell will break loose see confusion starts running off and knocking the pcs head off and the pc cant sleep at night and has to have the light on until you get back and process it again but thats all expected randomity this is whats keeping everything in restimulation for the pc and in taking it out you get certain amount of restimulation going but there is the way you find it and the formula i gave you of do partsofexistence list and then do list of safe assumptions or solutions for the item found and then using that as service facsimile directly you will findwill find most of the service facsimiles or if it doesnt the first time you do it will find the next time you do it you see because you can move in on itor maybe the third time you do it so you can do this on crude basis you understand now thatthere will probably be other methods of doing this released there will probably be other material developed on this but let invite your own lookingness on this subject and not at any time get over the idea that certain amount of genius must be invested in it okay thank you very much
