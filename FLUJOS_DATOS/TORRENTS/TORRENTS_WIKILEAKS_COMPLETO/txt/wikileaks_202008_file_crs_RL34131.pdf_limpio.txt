engineers projects summary the most costly natural disaster ever to hit the united states was hurricane katrina it struck land on august 29 2005 as category 3 hurricane the damage to new orleans from the hurricane was larg ely not the result of wind but water with 80 of new orleans under water in june 2008 continuous heavy precipitation caused severe flooding in ven midwestern states after numerous levees along the mississippi river were breached in the wa ke of these major flood events and levee breaches the issue of federal liability for flood damage is getting attention in the media and in congress after katrina lawsuits were filed against the federal government claiming that the levees and floodwalls designed and constructed by the us army corps of engineers corps failed to protect the city to succeed in these lawsuits the litigants first must show that the federal government is not immune from suit one source of government immunity is the fe deral governments exemption under the federal tort claims act for actions that constitute discre tionary function second source of immunity for the government is the flood control act of 1928 which prevents the government from being sued for damages resulting from federally supported damage reducti on projects or flood waters only after those two issues are resolved would the federal govern ments negligence be reviewed this report examines selected issues of the federal governments liability depending on the mechanism of the levee failures and analyzes legal defenses available to the federal government the report uses

reported to have been in the range of 200year to 500year fl ood at some locations however much levee protection for developed areas is built to withstand roughly 100year flood these floodyear designations however do not indicate how often an area may flood rather they are based on the chance that an area may flood in any given year for example the term 100year flood is the flood elevation that has 1 chance of being equaled or exceeded annually it is not the flood that will occur once every 100 years likewise 500 year flood is five times less likely to occur in any given year than 100year flood 02 chance of flooding 3 see national climatic data center httplwfncdcnoaagovoaclimateresearch2005 katrinahtml 4 richard knabb et tropical cyclone report hurrica ne katrina national

flooding of the midwest portions of illinois indian iowa michigan minnesota missouri and wisconsin flooded after water from the missi ssippi river and its tributaries breached at least 35 levees1 the flood was the second worst that the midwest has experienced in 15 years2 this flooding brought renewed ttention to liability after major flood events including the liability for damage caused by hurricane katrina in 2005 hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast on august 29 2005 bringing with it rain highvelocity winds and large stor m surge and leaving behind massive path of destruction much of the extensive da mage that occurred was the result of the storm surge that breached levees and floodw alls protecting new orleans by august 31 2005 80 of new orleans was under water3 the city was not declared free of floodwaters until october 11 20054 some flooding was expected in new orleans primarily because the city sits below sea level and lacks natural drainage but the extent of inundation was not an ticipated some of the pr otective structures in the new orleans area that were breached were part of the federally authorized lake pontchartrain and vicinity project construc ted by the us army corps of engineers corps and maintained by local levee districts in the aftermath of katrina legal claims were filed against the government over liability for the damage resulting from

thus potentially significant but defenses including absolute immunity may be available this report analyzes potential federal lia bility for flood damage specifically relating to hurricane katrina and generally relating to us army corps of engineers flood and hurrican damage protection projects flood control has garnered significan t attention across the country and in congress particularly since katrina congress initiated national levee safety program in the water resources development act of 2007 wrda7 in july 2008 the senate committee on environment and public works held hearing to assess the midwest flooding including the effects of the flood the corps response and options for improving related authorities8 background the legal defenses available to the federal government are closely linked to the facts behind the specific floodi ng incident at issue therefore some factual background regarding hurricane katrinas fl ooding of new orleans is included here before analyzing the legal issues new orleans is city below sealevel virtually surrounded by water with lake pontchartrain to its north and the mississippi river to the south not far to the east is the gulf of mexico the city faces flooding risks from the mississippi river coastal storms and heavy precipitation system of levees and floodwalls was designed to protect the city from the river and coastal storms levees are typically broad earthen structures floodwalls are made of concrete and st eel built atop levee or in place of levee this infrast ructure around new orleans represents combination of federal and local

and floodwalls in new orleans were built by the federal government but are maintained by local governments and local levee districts once th ey are completed some portions of the lake pontchartrain

the levee districts other portions were still under the jurisdiction of the corps the principal federal agency responsible for constr ucting flood and storm damage reduction infrastructure10 the landscape of the mississippi delta s changed significantly since the 1965 lake pontchartrain act according to corps report more than 20000 acres of coastal wetlands have been lost or c onverted because of some storm damage reduction projects in louisiana11 this is meaningful because marshlands may slow storm surges moreover some media repor ts asserted that the corps was planning an array of hurricaneprot ection projects in 2002 in the region surrounding new orleans12 such projects might indicate d ecision by the corps to design new system rather than improve an existing one and could affect the corps liability levee failure with respect to the failure of the hurricane protection system in new orleans two central questions have emerged 1 were the levees and floodwalls breached because their design was exceeded or 2 did they fail due to faulty design construction or maintenance before ever reaching design capacity significant amount of flooding in new orleans resu lting from hurricane katrina resulted from structure failure of levees and floodwalls allowing waters from lake pontchartrain lake borgne and other stormwaters to flow into the lowlying city13 although thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34131crs4 14 the lake pontchartrain act required the syst em to withstand standard storm which is roughly equivalent to what is now called category 3 storm 15 the height of storm surges for hurricane katrina reportedly ranged between 5 and 19 feet in new orleans whereas storm surges for ca tegory 3 hurricanes generally range between 9 and 12 feet see richard knabb et

was category 3 storm at the time of landfall the storm surges were higher than normal for such storm15 in addition katrina dumped more than five inches of rainfall in eight hours the protection system failed in approxima tely 50 locations and for variety of reasons the vast majority of those failures occurred because of overtopping where the waters that exceed ed design capacity went over the floodwalls although most failed in this manner evidence gathered by panel of experts commissioned by the corps suggests that at least four veesfloodwalls were breached before they exceeded their design capacity16 following katrina the corps commissioned an extensive report via multiparty task force known as the interagency perform ance evaluation task force ipet the ipet report did not point to one failure but to system of failures noting that the citys flood protection system was series if one part failed it increased the impacts on the others17 ipet found differences in the qua lity of materials used in levees differences in the conservativeness of floodw all designs and vari ations in structure protective elevations due to subsidence nd construction below th design intent due to error in interpretation of datums all contributed to inconsistent protection within the system the ipet report states that the 17th street and london avenue levees experienced foundation failures prior to wate r levels reaching the design levels of protection the storm surges in the i nner harbor navigation canal ihnc exceeded design levels but ipet also found that the wa lls had subsided by more than two feet contributing to the amount of overtopping that occurred another theory of causation is that the levees were overtopped or breached because the storm surge was enhanced by the

ipet theories of liability and sources of immunity hundreds of lawsuits related to hurricane katrina have been filed many against insurers some against the city and its officials and some against the federal government the lawsuits against the fede ral government and so contractors have been consolidated under the heading in re katrina canal breaches consolidated litigation in the federal district court for the eastern district of louisiana20 as threshold issue before reaching the merits of the claims any suit against the federal government including th corps must overcome the doctrine of sovereign immunity simply put sovereign immunity means that the government cannot be sued this basic concept has been modified over the years to hold that the federal government cannot be sued unless congress specifically provides for such suit21 although the government can be sued under such circumstances it is up to the plaintiff to demonstrate that it has the right to sue the burden is not on the government to show it is immune from suit one such vehicle for suit is the federal tort claims act22 another is the flood control act of 192823 the following subsections of this report will discuss the relevant provisions of these statutes and the protections that they provide to the government in order to illustrate the scope of immunity potentially available to the government an analysis of cases in which courts addressed whether the federal g overnment was immune under these provisions follows the discussion of each statute the federal tort claims act the federal tort claims act ftca waives the federal governments sovereign immunity if tortious act of federal employee causes damage tort generally speaking is harmful act other than breach of contract for which relief may be sought in civil court specifically the ftca creates liability for the followinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34131crs6 24 28 usc 1346b 25 28 usc 2680a 26 dalehite v united states 346 us 15 356 1953 injury or loss of property or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employme nt under circumstances where the united states if private person would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act of omission occurred24 negligence to win negligence claim under the ftca as elsewhere plaintiff must demonstrate four things 1 that the defendant ie the government owed duty to the plaintiff 2 that the duty was breached by the defendant 3 that the breach was the cause of the plaintiffs injury and 4 that the plaintiff was actually injured all of these elements must be shown in order to have valid claim discretionary function exception the ftca contains number of exceptions under which the united states may not be held liable even if negligent notably the discretionary function excepti on the discretionary function exception prevents the government from being sued for any claim based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform discretionary function or dut on the part of federal agency or an employee of the government whether or not the discretion involved be abused25 in determining whether government action is discretionary courts look at whether the course of action was mandatory or whether there was choice claim related to the performance or nonperfo rmance of mandatory function one required by statute would be actionable under the ftca however claim related to an action that requires decision making on the part of the government is likely to be found discretionary and exempt from suit the theory behind this is if congress requires certain action and the government unit fails to comply with that specific directive the government should not be protected for failing to do what congress expressly required sometimes however an action might include both mandatory and discretionary elements the difficulty lies in determining which part of the government action was specifically require d by congress and which part involved discretion in this case for example cong ress specifically requi red construction of the new orleans hurricane protection system to protect against hurricanes however as caselaw illustrates that does not mean that construction of the system was purely nondiscretionary action the supreme court clarified the circumstances in which the discretionary function exception in dalehite v united states the court described discretion as being more than the initiation of programs and activities it also includes determinations made by executives or administrators in establishing plans specifications or schedules of operations where there is room for policy judgment and decision there is discretion26httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34131crs7 27 united states v gaubert 499 us 315 322 23 1991 refining the test developed in berkovitz v united states 486 us

the policies which led to the promulgation of the regulation if the employee violates the mandatory regulation there will be shelter from liability because there is room for choice and the action w ill be contrary to policy on the other hand if regulation allows the employee discretion the very existence of the regulation creates strong presumption that discretionary act authorized by the regulation involves consideration of the same policies which led to the promulgation of the regulations internal citations omitted 28 vaizburd v united states 90 f supp 2d 210 21415 edny 2000 29 id 30 see us v ure 225 f2d 709 71213 9th cir 1955in united states v gaubert the court suggested twopart test for applying the discretionary function exception 1 the ch allenged conduct must involve an element of judgment or choice and 2 the judgment or choice must be based on considerations of public policy27 immunity for corps of engineer projects under the discretionary function exception the discretionary function exception has typically been interpreted broadly generally the disc retionary function exception has prevented claims against the united states for water damage to real property resulting from negligent design or constr uction of flood control or irrigation projects in vaizburd v united states plaintiffs alleged that corps project to reduce storm damage and protect the shoreline damaged their property because of negligent design and implementation28 the court used the gaubert twopart test to find that the corps exercised discretion in the design planning and implementation of the project the corps chose from several different project plan designs and factored in number of policy considerations including cost re liability resource allo cation environmental protection and political implications the court also found that even though the project was required by statute the act ual implementation of the project was not precisely dictated by any plan regulation or statute and thus the corps had degree of choice in how to implement the project29 accordingly even if there has been negligent design or impleme ntation the presence of choi ce and judgment may allow the discretionary function exception to preclude any claim against the united states discretionary function can also be ex ercised when choosing the materials of required project in united states v ure the plaintiff argued the government was negligent in constructing an irrigation can that burst and flooded the plaintiffs property the canal had not been construc ted with stronger and more expensive material available for reinforcement which the plaintiff claimed to be breach of the governments duty to ensure against breaks ultimately the court f ound that the government made costbased decision not to use stronger material that the decision was based on cost was enough to invoke the discretionary function exception and overcome any negligence

meant discretionary f unction exception did not applysimilarly when the government creates infrastructure to withstand certain level of storm desp ite knowing that more powerful st orms are possible courts have held that the discretionary f unction exception applies in valley cattle co v united states the plaintiff contended that the g overnment was neglig ent and liable for damages because of flood preparations th at could handle only twoyear storm despite having the knowledge that storms of much stronger intensity hit the area the court found that the government clearly ma decisions at the planning level to prepare only for twoyear storm base d on policy factors and was immune from liability because of the disc retionary function exception31 even deciding to delay improving project can excuse liability as discretionary action in national union fire insurance v united states the court held the corps decision to delay smaller improvement to breakwater that protected harbor while planning for larger improvement was choice immune from liability the plaintiff asserted the corps was negligent for not discovering the existing structure had subsided and for not acting quickly to improve the deficiency the corps in fact was aware of the problems with the breakwater protection several years before the damage to plaintiffs pr operty actually occurred however the court held that the ftcas discretionary function exception applied because the corps chose to put off the smaller improvement to the breakwater while studying the feasibility of larger improvement the decision of timing with respect to improvements invoked the exception32 the court also decided that considering the cost of greater safety is discretionary function at times discretion has been construed more narrowly in construction context despite the prevailing practice of broad interpretation in seaboard coast line railroad company v united states the court of appeals for the fifth circuit found the government liable for damages caused by drainage system the government claimed that the discretionary function exception applied arguing it was policy decision to create the drainage system in the first place the court found that the decision to build drainage system was discretionary but the construction was not the construction of the ditch had to be performed in nonnegligent manner33 however

government liable for failure to maintain flood control project the court noted that it was the corps decision not to maintain the banks of the project however the fact that decision was made did not mean the discretionary function exception automatically applied the c ourt relied on the second prong of the gaubert test that only governmental decisions based on considerations of public policy are protected by the exception the court found the discretionary function exception did not apply because operating the project incorrectly was not part of the corps mandated policy to prevent flooding36 similar result was found in case where court decided that the failure not to maintain road in national park was not decision grounded in social economic or political policies37 therefore the discretionary exemption did not apply contrary result was found in second cas based on the failure of the national park service nps to maintain road in that case the court looked at whether decision had been made not to maintain it considered that the nps had developed maintenance task list and that maintaining that particular road was to occur following other projects38 that scheduling determin ation was discretionary according to the court agencies are allowe d to establish prior ities by balancing the objectives sought to be obtained against such practical considerations as staffing and funding39 in third case the npss trail maintenance was held to be discretionary action in that case the court reviewed the policyprong of the gaubert test to find that agencies are allowed to balance

difficult to imagine broader language42 the case history of the fca evidences more nuanced application the fca was enacted in response to large flood that devastated the mississippi river valley congress wanted to fund large flood control projects while also limiting the governments liability for those projects one stated purpose during floor debate was to provide safeguards that would prot ect the government against lawsuits if the government provi ded flood protection to the people43 the legislative history illustrates that congress clearly sought to ensure beyond doubt that sovereign immunity would protect the government from any liability associated with flood control according to the supreme court44 the supreme court applied section 702c immunity broadly in the case of united states v james in that case the petitioners filed wrongful death claims against the government after two recreati onal boaters drowned in the reservoirs of federal flood control projects the court wrote that the language of section 702c was unambiguous and should be given its plain meaning45 damage under the act included both personal and property damage46 the terms flood or flood waters applied to all waters contai ned in or carried through federal flood control project for purposes of or related to flood control as well as to waters that such projects cannot control47 this holding was interpreted by most courts to mean if public works project has flood control as one of its purposes section 702c immunity would apply following the james decision the courts split as to what relationship federal project must have to flood control in order for the government to have immunity all circuits agreed that federally funded public works projects wholly unrelated to flood protection purposes are not entitled to section 702c immunity the dissent among circuits arose in determining exactly how connected the project must be to flood control in order to invoke section 702c

not focus on the character of the federal project or the purpose it served but looked at the waters that caused the damage and the purpose for their release th unanimous court held that in determining whether 702c immunity attaches courts should consider the character of the waters that cause the relevant damage rather than the rela tion between that damage and flood control project49 immunity for the federal government under 702c although the supreme court in central green effectively rendered the bulk of fca litigation of little precedential value an ove rview of the types of cases in which courts have applied 702c immunity illustrates the situa tions in which claims might arise and immunity might be applied like th discretionary function exception 702c immunity had been applied in broad rang of cases for instance federal courts have held that 702c immunity is not ava ilable exclusively to the corps but rather may also be available to the bureau of reclamation within the department of the interior50 section 702c immunity may so be applied in cases where the nature of the damage is not specifically flood damage fo r instance the government has been held not liable in case claiming that negligen ce related to flood control project caused damage to the fresh wate r supply not flood damage51 as an example of limitation on immunity at least one fe deral court held that 702c does not provide immunity for breach of contract claims stemming from or related to flood control projects because other legislation waiving immunity had not been repealed52 courts have applied 702c and found the govern ment immune from suit in cases of both property damage and personal injury that result from cases related to flood control projects claims of damage to property fo r which the government was held immune have generally been cases where lands or personal property are damaged as result of flooding53 damages claimed for personal injury and death often arise in cases with

automobile accidents related to flood control projects55 after james split developed in the federal circuit courts on the interpretation of the scope of 702c immunity specifica lly regarding the required nexus to flood control activities in order for immunity to apply56 the us supreme court declined to address the split in the circuits in 1992 when it denied review in hiersche v united states 57 in hiersche the family of diver under contract with the federal government to inspect fish screens on the columbia river sued the government for wrongful death after the diver was fatally injured the family alleged that the death was caused by the government employees failu re to shut off the water flow to the fish bypass system as agreed to the court declined to review the case and justice stevens issued concurring memorandum to explain his reasons for denial the memorandum stated that while it is genera lly the courts duty to resolve conflicts among the courts of appeals some c onflicts including issues presented in hiersche can be resolved more effectively by congress58 justice stevens offered this analysis of 702c immunity the statute at issue here is an anachroni sm it was enacted 18 years before the ftca waived the federal governments sovereign immunity from liability for personal injuries at the time of its enactment consideration was given to the power generation recreational and c onservation purposes of floodcontrol projects or to their possible impact on the then nonexistent federal liability for personal injury and death caused by negligent operation of such projects today this obsolete legislative remnant is nothing more than an engine of injustice congress not this court has the primar duty to confront the question whether any part of this harsh immunity doctrine should be retained59 although congress does not appear to have addressed the issue of 702c immunity the court revisited it in central green it appears that the central green decision was an attempt to clarify test for re solving immunity issues arising under 702 however as statutory grant of immunity c ongress remains able to reconsider these issues legislatively

katrina the ftca and the fca are compatible statutes frequently appearing as defenses within the same case it has been affirmatively held by one circuit court that the ftca does not overrule or invalidat section 702c of the flood control act60 both the ftcas discretionary func tion exception and the immunity provision under the fca are jurisdictional meaning that if they apply the court has authority to hear the case typically in cases brought under the ftca and fca courts first determine whethe r those statutes immunity pr ovisions apply then if the case survives that review the court would consider the application of the facts to the underlying tort claim however in th katrina cases the di strict court for the eastern district of louisiana has ruled that the facts necessary to show whether the corps exercised any discretion are inextricably intertwined with the factual questions that will determine liability61 also the court ruled that the facts necessary to show whether flooding was linked to flood contro l project were insepa rably linked to the determination of whether fca immunity applied62 the court decided it would be judicially inefficient to consider th discretionary exception and section 702c immunity and then have the jury consider the same facts to determine negligence accordingly jury will determine whether the corps used its discretion and whether mrgo caused damages from floodwaters63 significantly none of the other cases cited in this report used juries to decide these issues federal tort claims act to determine whether ftcas discreti onary function exception applies in the katrina litigation the c ourt would apply the gaubert test 1 the challenged conduct must involve an element of judgment or choice and 2 the judgment or choice must be based on considera tions of public policy64 hence to be successful suit based on the ftca would have to show that po licy decisions and g overnment discretion did not play any part in building the hu rricane protection system the resolution of these questions should be independent of any decision regarding negligence or fault congress authorized and delegated primary design and construction responsibility to the corps for the hurrican protection system in the flood control act of 196565 the construction of the system was ongoing through the time hurricane katrina hit the city66 in those several decades the corps had to revise thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34131crs14 66 continued construction was temporarily halted in december 1977 when court decision enjoined the corps from continued building until an environmental impact study could be completed after the study was accepted the corps changed significant portions of the design in response to environmental and cost concerns 67 pl 89298 204 68 for more information about the process of au thorizing and designing these structures see crs report rl33188 protecting new orleans from hurricane barriers to floodwalls by nicole t carter 69 id the prekatrina section has several exampl of studies that were done prior to the stormdesign and construction of the hurricane pr otection system for number of reasons including cost environmental factors t echnical issues the necessity of acquiring additional lands and aesthetic issues thus the overa ll design and construction required balancing many diffe rent policy factors which may provide basis for the corps to invoke discretionary immunity as discussed courts have found that design and construction of project are considered discretionary activities and it appears likely that the various steps that went into designing and building the hurri cane protection system were discretionary actions under existing precedent possible complicating factor is that the statute authorizing construction mandated the vees and floodwalls be constructed to withstand standard hurricane for the re gion which was roughl equivalent to category 3 hurricane the rated strength of katrina67 the decision to design to that standard appears to be nondiscretionary action68 more difficult issue may be liability related to maintenance of the system as discussed earlier the courts are inconsiste nt in finding whether maintenance requires choice or is purely nondiscretionary acti on courts tend to lean away from finding an exemption in cases where decision app ears to be contrary to public policy and not supported by documentation showing pub lic policy considerations behind the decision the corps ongoing evaluati on of new hurricane protection system could bolster the argument that the corps was considering public policy if it were shown that the corps chose to work on new system rather than expend funds on an existing system it also is not clear who was responsible fo r maintenance of the levees and floodwalls because local lev ee districts managed them only after they were completed and not all were completed plaintiffs would potentially be able to bypass discretionary immunity if they demonstrated that the persons at the operational level were required to maintain the system according to prescribed protocol for example if inspections had to meet specific guidelines or if various assessmen ts were strictly prescribed there may be little or discretion involved69 however to be consistent with other caselaw any documented choice involving prioritiz ation would likely be considered discretionary action exempting the government from liabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34131crs15 70 douglas woolley and leonard shabma n draft final report

policies behind the decisions thus satisfying the two prongs of gaubert 71 flood control act of 1928 even if the government cannot i nvoke di scretionary function immunity plaintiff would have to overcome the broad section 702c immunity of the flood control act according to the district court in in re katrina canal breaches the us supreme court central green company decision did not resolve what nexus floodwaters must have to flood c ontrol project to trigger immunity72 under this theory section 702c immunity appears to apply only where the floodwaters are linked to flood control project it is not clear how this ruling fits with the supreme courts statement that courts determine the scope of the immun ity conferred not by the character of the federal project or the purposes it serves but by the character of the waters that cause the relevant dama ge and the purposes behind their release73 there appears to be little controversy that the hurricane protection system was flood control project and so the corps likely would be immune from claims based on that systems failure however some plaintiffs have alleged that their claims are based not on the levee and floodwall failures but on mrgo which they argue is solely navigational project section 702c has already been found not to apply to mrgo by the fifth circuit in 1971 in graci v united states 74 in the 1971 case which followed hurricane betsy litigants argued the construction of mrgo caused their properties to flood the circuit cour t refused to find s ection 702c applied to all flood damage actions stating it

circuit refused to find fca immunity where the action was neither associated with flood control nor clearly re lated to flood control76 seemingly establishing immunity for those projects that are associated with or clearly related to flood control the government has argued that mrgo serves some flood control purposes77 negligence only after court determines that the government is not immune under the ftca and the fca would it consider the ne gligence of the federal government at that point the plaintiffs will still have to show that the federal government owed them duty when it built the hurricane protection system the plaintiffs must show that the federal government breached that duty that the breach caused harm and that the plaintiffs were injured as result of that breach the most difficult factor of negligence for the plaintiffs to prove appears to be the second one that the duty was breach ed by the corps to succeed on this count the plaintiffs would have to s how that the specific property was flooded because the corps failed to exercise reasonable care this argument could be based on the allegedly faulty desig n construction and ma intenance arguing that the levees fell apart or it could be based on theo ry that the system was overwhelmed because of water funneled by mrgo and that this result was reasonably foreseeable and preventable common defense for such claim is that the damage was caused by an act of god in this case hurricane the act of god defense appears to apply the most easily to those levees and floodwalls th at were overtopped by the waters they essentially failed because th eir design capacity was exceeded by the unusually high storm surges brought on by katrina howeve r as was discussed earlier some of the overtopping occurred because some levees and floodwalls had subsided by as much as two feet also plaintiffs may argue that the storm surge was as large as it was because of mrgo which was the result of an act of congress not of god it may be more difficult to defend the system breaches that some studies have attributed to design defects the purporte d design defects reporte dly led to the failure of the four levees nearest downtown new orleans these failures might also be attributed to negligent construction or negligent maintenance the district court would follow state law when reviewing for negligence louisiana is

that tion of the blame attributed to it but not the negligence attributed to the local levee boards or contractors that may have worked on the project current status of litigation and issues for congress in 2008 two key decisions were made in the katrina litigation in january the federal district court dismi ssed certain counts of the cla ss action that alleged federal liability for levee failures citing section 702c immunity as bar to the claims79 that decision barred recovery for flood damage termined to be caused by levee failures but allowed the plaintiffs to proceed with the litigation with respect to mrgo80 in may 2008 the court held that section 702c immunity did not apply to claims that alleged liability for mrgo because mrgo wa s navigation project rather than flood control project81 the liability of the united states army corps of engineers for damages following hurricane katrina appears to be in the hands of jury in such case with the previous decisions issued by the judge regarding section 702 immunity for the levees and mrgo the jury would have to establish first whether any legal defense is available to the corps such as th discretionary function exception under the ftca this determination will examine the design cons truction maintenance and purpose of mrgo the corps liability depends on whether the corps actions are found to be discretionary on ly after making these decisions will the jury consider the question of whether the corps acted w ithout reasonable care in regard to the project even if the corps is found liable its liability could be reduced if other parties share responsibility it does not appear that congress has addressed the issue of 702 immunity in the wake of james hiersche or central green although the supreme court attempted to clarify test for reso lving immunity issues arising under 702 congress remains able to reconsider issues of federal immunity related to flood damage and flood control projects legislativel as statutory provisions of immunity it is within congress authority to define the scope of the protections offered by both the ftca and fca
