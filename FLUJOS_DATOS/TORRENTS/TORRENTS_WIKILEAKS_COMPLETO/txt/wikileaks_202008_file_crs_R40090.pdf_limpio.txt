gasescompounds that trap the suns heat with effects on the earths climate in the united states aircraft of all kinds are estimated to emit between 24 and 34 of the nations total greenhouse gas ghg emissions depending on whether one counts international air travel the impact of us aviation on climate change is perhaps twice that size when other factors are considered these include the contribution of aircraft emissions to ozone formation the water vapor and soot that aircraft emit and the high altitude location of the bulk of aircraft emissions worldwide aviation is projected to be among the faster growing ghg sources if congress and the new administration decide to regulate aircraft ghg emissions they face several choices the administration could use existing authority under section 231 of the clean air act administered by the environmental protection agency epa has already been petitioned to do so by several states local governments and environmental organizations congress could address aviation or aviation fuels legislatively through capandtrade or carbon tax proposals among the legislative options the capandtrade approach setting an economywide limit on ghg emissions and dist ributing tradable allowances to emitters has received the most attention in the 110 th congress most capandtrade bills would have included aviation indirectly through emission caps imposed upstream on their source of fuelthe petroleum refining sector by capping emissions upstream of air carriers and eventually lowering the cap as much as 80 bills such as these would have several effects they would provide an incentive for refiners to produce lower carbon fuels they would increase the price of fuels and thus increase the demand for more fuelefficient aircraft and they might increase the cost of aviation services relative to other means of transport giving airline passengers and shippers of freight incentives to substitute lowercost lower carbon alternatives besides regulating emissions directly or through capandtrade program or carbon tax there are other tools available to policymakers that can lower aviations ghg emissions these include implementation of the next generation air traffic control system not expected to be complete until 2025 although some elements that could reduce aircraft emissions may be implemented sooner research and development of more fuelefficient aircraft and engines and perhaps the development of lower carbon jet fuel this report provides background on aviation emissions and the factors affecting them it discusses the tools available to control emissions including existing authority under the clean air act and proposed economywide capandtrade legislation and it examines international regulatory developments that may

change has identified wide array of sources that emit greenhouse gases ghgscompounds that trap the suns heat with effects on earths climate1 the largest sources of these emissions particularly in developed economies are electric utilities and the transportation sector2 in the united states electricity generation accounts for about 40 of the emissions of carbon dioxide the principal greenhous gas or about onethird of the emissions of the six major ghgs combined3 the transportation sector including cars trucks buses trains ships and aircraft accounts for roughly onethird of us co 2 emissions or 27 of the six ghgs combined g3g146g155g140g155g138g143g157g561g7g150g146g156g156g146g152g151g156g561 aircraft account for about 10 of the us transportation sectors ghg emissions or 24 to 34 of total us ghg emissions but they have been among the faster growing sources of ghg emissions worldwide according to the commi ssion of the european union emissions from international aviation increased by almost 70 between 1990 and 2002 4 the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc in 1999 study that is still widely cited projected that the impact of aircraft emissions on climate would be 26 to 11 times as large in 2050 as it was in 1992 5 if as many argue ghg emissions must be reduced 50 to 80 in that time period emissions from aviation would need to be drastically reduced to provide proportional share of the targeted reduction us emissions from aircraft have run counter to the worldwide trends and projections however since 1990 aircraft ghg emissions have declined both as percentage of total us emissions and in absolute terms see table 1 the biggest factor in the decline was 56 percent decrease in emissions from domestic military operations which more than offset small increase in domestic commercial and general aviation 6 emissions 1 six greenhouse gases are the primary focus of concern carbon dioxide co 2 methane ch 4 nitrous oxide n 2o sulfur hexafluoride sf 6 hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons these six are the subject of international agreements the framework convention on climate change and its kyoto protocol and are the emissions that would be subject to control in most climate change capandtrade bills that have been introduced in congress as will be noted later in this report other emissions from aircraft especially water vapor and the persistent condensation trails contrails that form in jet engine exhaust may have an impact on climate as well but in general they have not been the subject of negotiations internatio nal agreements or legislation 2 for data on these and other sectors see trends in greenhouse gas emissions chapter 2 of us epa inventory of us greenhouse gas

1990 and 2006 that figure was well below the growth in air tr avel according to the air transport association the association that represents the domestic airlines passengermiles traveled domestically on us commercial airlines increased 74 between 1990 and 20067 two types of efficiency increases contributed to the slow growth in us commercial aircraft emissions first load factors the percentage of seats occupied increased to 799 in 2007 compared with 604 in 1990 second fuel efficiency itself increased as older less efficient aircraft were retired in favor of newer more efficient models these savings can be substantial for example american airlines estimates that the 18year old md80s currently flying use 35 more fuel than the boeing 737800 aircraft that are to replace them over the next two years 8 epas inventory of us greenhouse gas emissions and sinks shows that domestic flights of all kinds military commercial aircraft and general aviation accounted for about 10 of the ghg emissions from the us transportation sector in 200624 of overall us ghg emissions aviations impact on climate may be greater than these figures suggest however for two reasons first emissions resulting from international transportation are not currently included in the us emission totals9 these emissions grew from 457 million metric tons in 1990 to 711 million in 2006 56 increase if they were included in the us aviation statistics us emissions from aircraft of all types would have risen 7 since 1990 rather than falling 5 and aviation would account for 34 of the us ghg total second the bulk of the aviation sectors emissions occur high in the atmosphere where their impact on climate is greater than that of emissions at ground level according to number of sources the total impact of aviation could be around twice the impact of carbon dioxide alone when this factor is taken into account 10 emissions from jet aircraft also lead to the formation of cirrus clouds as the condensation trails contrails of water vapor and sulfur particles emitted from engines at high altitudes form ice crystals that persist as clouds under some atmospheric conditions scientists are uncertain how to measure the occurrence and impact of such clouds but they are reasonably certain that the clouds add to the greenhouse effect of aircraft emissions perhaps substantially 11 continued air cargo operators 7 data on load factors and revenue passenger miles as well as other industry data are available from the air transport associations 2008 economic report at

speeds plans to phase out old planes greenwire august 14 2008 9 the framework convention on climate change refers to such emissions as combustion of international bunker fuel and categorizes the emissions separately from nati onal emission totals pending further agreement on how to address related emissions 10 see for example testimony of dr david w fahey office of oceanic and atmospheric research national oceanic and atmospheric administration at the subcom mittee on aviation house committee on transportation and infrastructure hearing on aviation and the environment emissions may 6

g8g158g142g149g561g5g152g156g157g561 the cost of jet fuel represents significant portion of total cost for most air carriers there is great deal of variation depending on the distance traveled the age and efficiency of the aircraft and the price of fuel at any given time but the total fuel expenses of us airlines consumed an average of 24 of airline operating revenues in 2007 according to the air transport association this percentage is expected to be even higher in 2008 although costs are now declining rapidly in the first nine months of the year domestic airlines spent 46 billion on fuel for their domestic and international flights 60 more than the cost in 2007 13 given the importance of fuel costs airlines and air freight companies have major incentive to purchase more fuelefficient aircraft and thus aircraft manufacturers are constantly seeking to improve the efficiency of airplanes and engines these incentives have resulted in sizeable efficiency gains us airlines carried 204 more passenger and cargo traffic in 2007 than they did in 2000 but they used nearly 3 less fuel in doing so this resulted in reduction of 51 12 another source report prepared for the international civil aviation organization icao in 1999 said aircraft are estimated to contribute about 35 per cent of the total radiative forcing measure of change in climate by all human activities and this percentage which excludes the effects of possible changes in cirrus clouds was projected to grow icao environmental env unit aircraft engine emissions definition of the problem at

modernizing the federal aviation administration faas air traffic control system the faa is in the process of transforming air traffic control from groundbased system of radars to sate llitebased syst em dubbed the next generation nextgen air transportation system the primary objective is to enable the air traffic control system to handle projected doubling of current passenger loads by 2025 but when fully implemented nextgen is also expected to cut the ghg emissions of individual aircraft 10 to 15 by allowing more direct routing delay reduction and through ch features as continuous descent approach 16 according to the faa united parcel service aircraft equipped with some of the nextgen technologies have reduced emissions as much as 3417

the fede ral government should regulate aircraft ghg emissions versus continuing to rely solely on market forces to determine the level of emissions some have turned their attention to the poten tial for regulation under the clean air act in december 2007 epa received two petitions requesting that it exercise that authority to regulate ghg emissions from aircraft engines 18 to date epa has not promulgated regulations to control co 2 from any source in 2003 responding to an earlier petition to regulate ghgs from cars and trucks the agency maintained that it did not have authority under the clean air act to do so that determination was challenged by massachusetts and other petitioners and in 2007 decision the us supreme court found that ghgs are air pollutants within the clean air acts definition and thus epa would have authority to regulate them if it so chose19 under section 231 of the act the epa administrator may propose emission standards applicable to any air pollutant from any class of aircraft engines which in the administrators judgment causes or contributes to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public 14 ata 2008 economic report previously

administrator and hold public hearings before finalizing such standards the president may disapprove of such standards if the secretary of transportation finds that they would create hazard to aircraft safety the december 2007 petitions request that epa make finding that aircraft ghg emissions do endanger public health or welfare and that the agency adopt regulations that allow range of compliance approaches these might include emission limits operational practices fees capandtrade system minimizing engine idling time employing single engine taxiing or use of groundside electricity measures to replace the use of fuelburning auxiliary power units at airport gates 20 the decisions about whether and how to regulate aircraft might seem relatively straightforward but the new administration actually faces broader decisions than whether it should regulate ghgs from aircraft for one thing the aircraft petitions are among several others that epa has received to regulate ghg emissions from power plants cars and trucks ships and other sources as result whatever decision is made for any one of these sectors is likely to affect the decisions regarding all the othersultimately large portion of the economy given the relative size of aircraft emissions as compared to say power plants or cars and trucks aviation would seem an unlikely choice to be the first ctor whose ghg emissions epa would regulate in addition although the presidentelect has said that he favors controls on ghg emissions among the questions he faces will be whether to proceed with such regulation under the existing clean air act authority or to support legislation targeted more specifically at ghgs new legislation might be more efficientclearly allowing sources in different industries to trade emission allowances to each other for exampleand it might avoid challenge in the courts if congress were specific regarding the authority it was giving epa to control ghg emissions the current language of the act while arguably providing regulatory authority is sufficiently vague that legal challenges are considered almost certainty if epa proceeds this might delay implementation of controls the two optionsproceeding under the clean air act or supporting new legislationare not mutually exclusive existing epa authority under the clean air act could be used as backstop while congress considers granting new authority if epa moves ahead with regulations it could motivate congress and interested parties to agree on legislative approach by holding open the possibility that regulation of some sort is certainty the development of regulations at epa might speed the enactment of new perhaps more flexible and more costeffective legislative authority

and considerations by jonathan l ramseur especially appendix as noted aviation is considered significant source of ghg emissions despite this the aviation sector like other transportation sources has not been targeted directly by the climate change bills introduced in congress to date in the 110th congress for example the liebermanwarner bill s 2191s 3036 which was reported by the senate environment and public works committee and debated briefly on the senate floor before failing to achieve cloture would have dealt with aviation emissions by including the refining sector in its overall emissions cap thus regulating the aviation sectors emissions upstream 21 the same would have been the case under the draft legislation prepared by representatives boucher and dingell posted on the house energy and commerce committee website in october 2008 but not actually introduced by capping emissions from fuels upstream of the air carriers and eventually lowering the cap as much as 80 bills such as these would have veral effects first they would provide an incentive for refiners to produce lower carbon fuels22 second they would increase the price of fuels as refiners either purchased additional allowances for their emissions or were forced to reduce production in essence rationing fuels through higher price in order to stay beneath the emissions cap third as the cost of fuel increased the demand for fuelefficient aircraft would increase and fourth consumers of aviation services airline passengers and shippers of freight would have incentives to replace highercost air transportation with lowercost alternatives eg videoconferencing by business and government entities increased reliance on loweremission forms of transport greater reliance on local sources of goods etc the cost of air travel and of air freight has been reduced substantially since its inception as aircraft have become more efficient and airlines have reduced other costs in competitive markets according to ta the cost of domestic air travel in real inflationadjusted terms has declined by 519 since 1978 23 by contrast controlling ghg emissions if it were done would likely increase the price of air travel and air freight reducing demand in comparison to business as usual ie without ghg controls scenario

capandtrade bills the european union eu has chosen to regulate aviation directly by including the sector in its emission trading scheme ets 21 the liebermanwarner bill also provided for nationa l academy of sciences study of the aviation sectors emissions including the identification of existing best practices to reduce emissions recommendations for research for technologies and operations with the highest potential to reduce emissions and recommendations of actions that the federal government could take to encourage or require additional emission reductions 22 besides incentives s 2191s 3036 actually would have required the production of low carbon fuels although it is not clear whether the requirement would have applied to aviation fuels for further discussion see crs report rl34489 climate change costs and benefits of s 2191s 3036 by larry parker and brent d yacobucci pp 5455 the boucherdingell draft would have given epa authority to limit lifecycle ghg emissions from transportation fuels although as with the liebermanwarner bill it is not clear that that authority would have applied to aviation fuels 23 ata 2008 economic report previously cited p 11

co 2 from more than 10000 energyintensive stationary sources of emissions the currently covered sectors power plants petroleum refining iron and steel production coke ovens pulp and paper and cement glass lime brick and ceramics production account for about half of eu co 2 emissions24 on january 1 2012 the aviation sectors co 2 emissions are to be added to the ets the scheme is to cover all aircraft operators landing in or departing from the eu with the exception of military aircraft some small carriers emergency services research and humanitarian flights thus flights to and from the eu by us air carriers would be subject to the emission limits for the first year the total quantity of allowances would be equivalent to 97 of the sectors average 20042006 emissions the cap would be reduced to 95 in 2013 with further reductions to be agreed on as part of the ongoing review of the ets in allocating the emissions allowed under the cap 85 of the sectors 2012 allowances are to be given to aircraft operators at cost and 15 of the allowances auctioned the eu commission has proposed that 80 of allowances be distributed free of charge in 2013 with 20 being auctioned the percentage of free allowances is expected to continue declining with goal of auctioning all allowances in 2020 operators emitting more than their allowed cap would need to buy additional allowances on the carbon market special reserve fund taken from the sectors overall cap is to allocate up to one million tons worth of allowances year to ensure access to the market to new operators and to provide allowances to rapidly growing airlines 25 the directive provides sanctions for failure to co mply with the scheme including the possibility that noncomplying airline might be banned from operating in the eu26 according to press reports this warning shot is aimed at foreign airlinesincluding us carriersthat have said they will not recognise the scheme27 for its part the united states has responded by threatening trade sanctions if the eu makes an attempt to force foreign airlines to comply with the emissions trading system28 this dispute highlights general problem in directly regulating emissions from sectors such as aviation or shipping substantial portion of whose total emissions occur outside of national borders without international agreement it may be difficult to enforce emission limits and the imposition of controls by any one country or bloc of countries is likely to be challenged through existing international institutions 24 for description of the eu ets see crs report rl34150

legislative process the 27 member states now have until july 2009 to transpose the directive into national laws 26 the threat of ban is found in whereas clause 26 in the event that an aircraft operator fails to comply with the requirements of this directive and other enforcement measures by the administering member state have failed to ensure compliance member states should act in solidarity the administering member state should therefore be able to request the commission to decide on the imposition of an operating ban at community level on the aircraft operator concerned as last resort 27 airline emissions covered in euets from 2012 ends report july 2008 p 51 28 aviation and emissions trading july 10 2008 euractivecom at httpwwweuractivcomenclimatechange

bills of the 110th congress would have done may avoid some of these issues maintaining level playing field for us and foreign airlines and air freight companies without imposing emission limits that could be directly challenged or circumvented whether enactment of such legislation would be sufficient to address european concerns over us airlines emissions resolving the dispute remains to be seen g11g5g3g17g561 the eu is not the only international body addressi ng aircraft emissions the international civil aviation organization icao the international organization that administers standards and recommended practices for the aviation authorities of more than 190 countries agreed in september 2007 to support the development of an aggressive action plan on aviation and climate change but without fixed timetable or specific emission reduction targets29 the united states has supported the icao as the proper venue for international regulation of emissions and maintains that the eus approach is contrary to icaos charter the chicago convention on international civil aviation30 majority of icaos members agree with the united states that participation in an emissions trading scheme such as euets should only be on the basis of mutual consent31 g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 greenhouse gas emission controls of some sort may affect us aviation in the next few years be they specific controls on engine emissions emission caps applied to the sector as whole upstream caps on fuel refiners or carbon taxes32 depending on their stringency the effects of most of these approaches could ripple through the economy providing additional incentives for aircraft manufacturers to improve the fuel efficiency of aircraft raising the cost of air travel and air freight and providing further pressure to improve the air traffic control system us airlines and air freight companies like many other sectors would prefer that they be allowed to address the ghg issue through voluntary meas ures unlike some other sectors they have achieved substantial increases in fuel economy over the last three decades or more and have stabilized their ghg emissions at roughly their 1990 levels but the sector is still an important source of emissions and its projected growth indicates that it may outstrip the economy as wholes rate of emission growth particularly if one includes emissions from international flights thus it is likely to be included in some fashion in any mandatory economywide approach to reducing ghg emissions on practical level reducing emissions from aviation may be more complicated than it is for most other sectors 29 icao backs mutual agreement approach to emissions reductions but europe objects daily environment report october 1 2007 30 emissions trading eu lawmakers back plan to add aviation to emissions trading scheme in 2012 daily environment report july 9 2008 31 icao annual report of the council 2007 pp 4142 32 carbon taxes are not discussed in this report but their effects might be similar to the imposition of an upstream cap on emissions they would raise the cost of fuel thus encouraging the development of more fuelefficient and lower carbon alternatives httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40090g3g159g146g138g157g146g152g151g561g138 g151g141g561g5g149g146g150g138g157g142g561g5g145g138g151g144g142 g561 g561

thus direct controls on engines or aircraft face obstacles that do not apply in industries composed of fewer and stationary emission sources even monitoring the relevant emissions for this sector is difficult the sectors emissions affect climate in several ways controlling only co 2 emissions might leave other impacts of aircraft on climate unaffected more research is needed to identify the precise effects of some of these such as the impact of contrails on cirrus cloud formation and the effect of such clouds on climate change the sectors impressive progress in making itself more energyefficient in recent years poses obstacles as well improving load factors was relatively easy when they were at 60 at the current level 80 one begins to approach the limits of further improvement some means of emission reduction are beyond the industrys control including the pace of modernization of the air traffic control system and the degree to which aeronautical research and engine modifications can reduce fuel consumption in both cases emission redu ction may depend at least in part on the actions of government agenciesthe faa and nasa in particular according to ta funding for nasa and faa aviation environmental rd programs has been cut by approximately 50 percent in the past 10 years 33 finally the sector faces controls from foreign countries particularly the european union international negotiations for postkyotoprotocol emissions control scheme may give rise to emission limits in other countries as well as discussed congress and the new administration have number of options including several forms of legislation regulation by epa under the existing clean air act is another possibility if the administration so chooses the existing clean air act might prove particularly important tool to bring interested parties to the table while providing backdrop to consideration of legislation by congress 33 ata 2008 economic report previously cited p 17 the faas
