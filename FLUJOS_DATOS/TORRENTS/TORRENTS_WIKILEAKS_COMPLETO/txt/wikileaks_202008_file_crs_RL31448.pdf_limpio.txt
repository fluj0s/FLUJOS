president putin signed the strategic offensive reductions treaty known as the moscow treaty that will reduce strategic nuclear weapons to between 1700 and 2200 warheads by december 31 2012 the us senate gave its advice and consent to ratification on march 6 2003 the russian duma did the same on may 14 2003 the treaty entered into force on june 1 2003 russia entered the negotiations seeking legally binding document that would contain limits definitions counting rules and elimination rules that resembled those in the start treaties russia also wanted the new treaty to contain statement noting us missile defenses would not undermine the effectiveness of russias offensive forces the united states preferred less formal process in which the two nations would state their intentions to reduce their nuclear forces possibly accompanied by document outlining ad ded monitoring and transparency measures furthermore the united states had intention of including restrictions on missile defenses in an agreement outlining reductions in strategic offensive nuclear weapons russia convinced the united states to sign legally binding treaty but the united states rejected any limits and counting rules that would require the elimination of delivery vehicles and warheads removed from service it wanted the flexibility to reduce its forces at its own pace and to restore warheads to deployed forces if conditions warranted the treaty contains four substantive articles the first limits each side to 17002200 strategic nuclear warheads but states that the parties can determine the structure of their forces themselves the second states that start i remains in force the parties can us that treatys verification regime to monitor reductions under the new treaty the third established bilateral implementation commission and the fourth sets december 31 2012 for the treatys expiration and notes that either party can withdraw on three months notice under the new treaty the united states is likely to retain most of the delivery vehicles planned for start ii which would have limited each side to 3500 warheads but the united states will remove additional warheads from deployed forces and leave out of its tally warheads that could be deployed on systems in overhaul or assigned to conventional missions russia is likely to eliminate many of its existing ballistic missiles and submarines retaining perhaps few hundred multiple warhead icbms and fewer than 10 ballistic missile submarines according to official and unofficial reports both sides have implemented the treaty smoothly however they have not held all the planned consultations as there has been little to discuss instead the two nations have begun to hold discussions about the 2009 expiration of the 1994 strategic arms reduction treaty start which contains monitoring provisions that aid with verification of the moscow treaty russia has suggested that the two sides replace start with new formal treaty that contains many of the same definitions and counting rules as start the united states has suggested that the two sides reaffirm the structure of the moscow treaty and possibly add some cooperative monitoring measures to that document the 111 th congress may have the opportunity to review and oversee these discussions this report will be updated when events warrant

strategic offensive reductions treaty known as the moscow treaty that would limit strategic offensive nuclear weapons1 in it the two nations state that they will reduce strategic nuclear weapons2 to between 1700 and 2200 warheads by december 31 2012 press reports and public statements have hailed this agreement as sharp reduction from the 6000 warhead level mandated by the 1994 strategic arms reduction treaty start3 however this new treaty differs from past arms control treaties in that it does not include any of the detailed definitions counting rules elimination procedures or monitoring and verification provisions that have become common in treaties signed since the late 1980s consequently simple comparison of warhead levels counted under start and warhead levels permitted by the new treaty does not provide complete view of the likely effects of the new treaty this report provides brief overview of the two nations objectives when they began discussions on this treaty and summary of how they resolved these differences when concluding the negotiations it then describes the key provisions in the treaty and presents illustrative forces that each side might deploy in the next 10 years it offers brief assessment of how each nation fared in achieving its objectives when negotiating this agreement and summary of reaction from us and russian commentators it concludes with brief review of the issues raised during the treatys ratification debates g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 the first signs of new arms control dialogue between the united states and russia appeared after president bush and president putin met in genoa italy during the g8 summit in july 2001 at that time the presidents issued statement saying that the two nations would shortly begin intensive consultations on the interrelated subjects of offensive and defensive systems 4 each nation had sharply divergent views on the substance and goals for these talks when discussing offensive force reductions russia argued that the two sides should seek agreement on formal treaty that would limit each side to 1500 nuclear weapons the bush administration wanted to pursue unilateral reductions with each side setting its own nuclear force size and structure but it would not offer any details on us plans in this regard until the department of defense completed its review of us nuclear posture this internal review apparently concluded in november 2001 1 officially the treaty is titled treaty on strategic of fensive reductions in english and agreement on the reduction of strategic offensive potentials in russian the two sides were unable to agree on single name the united states reportedly did not want to include the word arms in the title as the subject of the reductions because this would imply that like the strategic arms reduction treaty start the new treaty would require the actual elimination of weapons but the russian language required noun as the subject of the reductions hence the russian title refers to the reduction of potentials see michael wines treaty of whats its name new york times may 23 2002 2 as is discussed below the parties did not define this term 3 the start treaty which was fully implemented in late 2001 limits the united states and russia to 6000 accountable warheads on their strategic offensive delivery vehicles however b ecause start does not include many bomber weapons in its tally the united states can deploy around 7100 warheads on its existing nuclear forces structure russia with fewer bomber weapons in its force has closer to 6000 weapons 4 white house office of the press secretary joint statement by us president george w bush and president of the russian federation vladimir v putin on upcoming

2001 president bush announced that the united states would reduce its operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads to level between 1700 and 2200 over the next decade the president stated that the united states would reduce its forces unilaterally without signing formal agreement with russia he stated that the two nations did not need endless hours of arms control discussions and arms control agreements to reduce our weaponry in significant way he offered to write it down on piece of paper but he indicated that he believed handshake would be good enough 5 president putin responded by stating that he appreciated the presidents decision to reduce us nuclear forces and stated that russia will try to respond in kind he did not offer target number for the reductions at that time but he had stated several times in previous months and repeated in december 2001 that russia planned to reduce its forces to 1500 warheads he did however indicate that he would like to use the formal arms control process to reduce us and russian forces he emphasized that the two sides should focus on reaching reliable and verifiable agreement on further reductions of the us and russian weapons 6

january and february demonstrate that the two sides opening positions contained significant differences by the time they concluded the treaty in may they had resolved most of their differences over form and content in content the treaty encodes us proposals in form it reflects russias desire for formal legally binding document

ensure for the irreversibility of the reduction of the nuclear forces 7 in essence russia sought treaty that followed the model used in the strategic arms reduction treaties start i and start ii with similar counting rules elimination rules and verification procedures but lower limit on warheads after the bush administrations report on the nuclear posture review indicated that the united states planned to hold warheads removed from deployment in storage russia also insisted that the new treaty require the elimination of these nondeployed warheads8 this would contribute to the irreversibility of the limits without such provision russia argued the united states might return warheads to deployed systems and exceed the limits in the treaty in relatively short 5 the white house office of the

it wanted to maintain the flexibility to size and structure its nuclear forces in response to its own needs the united states preferred less formal process such as the exchange of letters in which the two nations would state their intentions to reduce their nuclear forces they might conclude joint declaration to provide for added transparency measures so that each side could understand each others force structures 10 furthermore the united states had intention of including restrictions on missile defenses in an agreement outlining reductions in strategic offensive nuclear weapons 11

within the bush administration pentagon officials argued strongly against incorporating any limits on offensive nuclear weapons in legally binding arms control agreement they wanted the united states to be able to reduce or increase its nuclear forces in response to changes in the international security environment secretary of state powell on the other hand supported the conclusion of legally binding agreement because he believed it would help president putins standing with domes tic critics who opposed his policies towards the united states12 the united states apparently began to move towards russias position in early february 2002 in hearing before the senate foreign relations committee secretary of state powell said that the framework will be something that is legally binding and we are examining different ways in which this can happen13 according to secretary powell the administration could complete the agreement as an executive agreement whose approval would be subject to majority vote of both houses of congress or formal treaty which would require the consent of twothirds of the members of the senate some in the pentagon however continued to oppose the conclusion of treaty limiting strategic offensive nuclear weapons they preferred to limit any legally binding provisions to procedures for verifying the number of deployed warheads 14 in testimony before the senate

strategic forces by legal means and we do not believe it is prudent to set in stone the level and type of us nuclear capabilities15 president bush appeared to endorse secretary powells approach in march he agreed to sign legally binding agreement noting that there needs to be document that outlives both of us he also stated that the exact form of this legally binding document had not been decided but he also endorsed the pentagons emphasis on verification he indicated that the agreement should focus on verification calling it the most important thing 16 in midmarch senators joseph biden and jesse helms sent letter to the white house reportedly demanding that the administration submit the eventual agreement to the senate as treaty they noted that significant obligations by the united states regarding deployed us strategic nuclear warheads would constitute treaty subject to the advice and consent of the senate 17 this letter demonstrated that both parties in the senate agreed on the need to defend the senates prerogatives and supported its right to advise and consent on treaties the white house did not accept the senates position immediately however when the president announced on may 13 that the united states and russia had reached an agreement he stated that it would be treaty18 one administration official noted that the senators position had contributed to the change in the us position in discussions with russia19 g5g152g151g157g142g151g157g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g3g144g155g142g142g150g142g151g157g561 the united states and russia disagreed about several key issues that would be addressed by the proposed arms control agreement these included the definitions and counting rules that the two sides would use to calculate how many warheads should count under the treatys limits the disposition of warheads removed from deploy ed systems transparency and verification provisions and potential restraints on missile defenses

throughout the negotiations russia proposed that the treaty use counting rules similar to those in start to calculate the number of warheads on deployed weapons 20 under start the parties assign number of warheads to each type of deployed delivery vehicle icbms slbms and heavy bombers they then count the number of deployed delivery vehicles and multiply by the attributed number of warheads to calculate the total number of warheads that would count under the treaty limits to remove weapons from accountability the parties could 15 bleek phillip c us russia agree to codify nuclear reductions

change the attributed number of warheads process known as downloading or destroy the delivery vehicles according to complex procedures outlined in the treaty21 however according to some reports russia wanted the new treaty to count the maximum number of warheads that could be carried by delivery vehicle without permitting downloading to reduce that number22 the parties would have to destroy delivery vehicles to reduce the number of deployed warheads the united states did not plan to use the start counting rules and elimination rules to calculate the number of operationally deployed warheads under the us formula delivery vehicles that were not deployed with nuclear warheadseither because they were in overhaul or assigned to nonnuclear missionswould not count against the limits warheads that had been removed from deployed systems also would not count under the limits the parties would not have to eliminate or destroy delivery vehicles or stored warheads to reduce the number of warheads that counted under the agreement 23 the united states preferred this approach to the start counting rules because it wanted to maintain the ability to reverse the reductions if conditions warranted administration officials have also noted that the united states should not have to bear the costs of eliminating launchers and delivery vehicles according to start elimination rules24 for example the navy has converted 4 trident submarines which could carry nearly 800 strategic warheads to carry conventional weapons it did not want to remove the ballistic missile launch tubes from the submarines similarly the air force has assigned many of its heavy bombers to conventional units rather than nuclear units on daytoday basis but it does not want to eliminate the aircrafts ability to deliver nuclear weapons because this would be costly and it could limit aircrafts conventional capabilities in addition the united states plans to have two ballistic missile submarines in overhaul at any one time the bush administration does not count the warheads that could be deployed on these vessels under the treatys limits if all weapons that could be carried on these systems counted against the us limits the united states would retain nearly 4000 warheads hence the united states could not use the start counting rules to calculate warheads retain the force structure identified in the nuclear posture review and reduce its forces to 17002200 warheads russia apparently realized that if it was going to complete an agreement imposing any limits on us nuclear weapons it would have to accept the us refusal to include start counting rules and elimination procedures in the treaty russias acceptance of the us position which apparently occurred in early may cleared the way for the treatys completion 21 according to start to eliminate icbms warheads the parties had to blow up or excavate the silo that had held the icbm to eliminate slbm warheads the parties had to remove the launch tubes from ballistic missile submarines and to eliminate bombers the parties had cut off the wings and tails or convert the bombers so that they could longer carry nuclear weapons 22

warheads removed from service it argued that the treaty must provide for radical real and irreversible cuts in strategic offensive weapons25 the united states on the other hand pointed out that previous arms control agreements such as the start i and start ii treaties had not required the elimination of warheads removed from deployment both sides could keep the warheads for testing spare parts and possible redeployment in midmarch russia appeared to acknowledge this point and soften its objection to the us position26 russias defense minister sergei ivanov sa id that for some period of time those warheads could be stored or shelved even though they would eventually have to be eliminated27 at the same time though russia sought to address the problem of the reload capability through the treatys counting rules as was noted above russia wanted the treaty to count delivery vehicles as the maximum number of warheads they could carry and to require the elimination of delivery vehicles before their warheads could be removed from the treaty totals these rules would have eliminated concerns about stored warheads without the extra delivery vehicles warheads could not return to the force but as was noted above the bush administration rejected this position it wanted to maintain the ability to redeploy warheads on short notice 28 by the end of april it was clear that the united states would insist on retaining its delivery vehicles and maintaining an unspecified number of warheads in storage29 in comments published after the treaty was signed general yuriy baluyevskiy the first deputy chief of the russian general staff indicated that he believed the question of warhead storage had not yet been resolved he stated that the treaty establishes special bilateral commission on implementation and that the two sides could use th is commission to discuss what to do with the warheads removed from deployment 30 the united states did not endorse this view g24g142g155g146g143g146g140g138g157g146g152g151g561 the united states recognized that under its proposed limits the absence of counting rules and elimination provisions would make it difficult for each side to monitor the number of deployed warheads on the other side 31 as was noted above under start the parties count the number of deployed delivery vehicles and multiply that number by the agreed counting rule for each type of system they do not count the actual number of warheads in place on the delivery vehicles the treaty permits onsite inspections that allow the parties to view reentry vehicles but these inspections are designed to confirm that the number of warheads does not exceed the number 25 purdhum todd s russia calls for binding pact to reduce nuclear arsenals new

identify the actual number of warheads on missile if it were less than the number in the data base32 during the negotiations the united states suggested that the two nations include new transparency measures in the agreement these could include more detailed exchanges of information visits to particular sites additional kinds of inspections and additional kinds of activities at sites to enhance confidence and help verify reductions of operationally deployed systems 33 for example the parties could use reentry vehicle inspection system similar to the one in start where they declare number of warheads carried by each type of missile and follow it with inspections that confirm that the actual number does not exceed the declared number or they could institute new procedures th at would allow inspectors to count the actual number of warheads on each missile they might also permit inspections at storage sites to count weapons held in those locations 34 russia concurred that the new agreement needed transparency measures and verification regime russian officials also agreed that the new treaty could draw on the verification regime in start i and include new transparency and confidence measures to monitor nuclear warheads35 however reports indicate that the two nations were unable to agree on which start measures to employ and which new measures to include in the agreement russia apparently wanted formal system of inspections and data exchanges while the united states preferred less elaborate system that called for cooperation more generally instead of specifying numbers and types of inspections permitted at specific facilities 36 although the two sides were unable to reach agreement on this issue before signing the treaty at the moscow summit they did agree to continue discussions after signing the treaty37 furthermore during hearings before the senate foreign relations committee secretary of state powell indicated that the two sides would have sufficient opportunities to collect needed data and information each others forces he noted that the growing level of cooperation between th two particularly through the nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction program provided information and assurances about the status of nuclear weapons programs in addition the start i treaty would remain in force through 2009 and information collected under that treatys verification regime could also contribute to verification of compliance with the new treaty 38 32 for example the us navy designed shield to place over its reentry vehicles during inspections so that inspectors would not see sensitive design information these shields had space for each of the 8 permitted warheads on trident missiles hence the inspections could confirm that the number of deployed warheads did not exceed the number permitted but because the inspectors could not see whether all of the spaces actually contained warheads they could not determine if the missile carried fewer than 8 warheads 33 us department of defense special briefing on the russian visit news transcript washington january 16 2002 34 aldinger charles us russia discuss nuclear cuts moscow

the negotiations russia insisted that the new agreement reflect the organic interconnection of strategic defensive and offensive weapons39 russia sought assurances that the us missile defense program would not be dire cted at or undermine russias strategic nuclear deterrent40 the united states refused to include language limiting ballistic missile defenses in the text of the new agreement the us refusal to accept russias view does not necessarily indicate that the united states plans to deploy missile defenses that could undermine russias deterrent to the contrary the clinton and bush administrations both insisted that the us missile defense program was not directed at russia or its strategic deterrent both argued that the united states needed defenses to address emerging threats from other nations who were acquiring ballistic missiles nonetheless the bush administration has indicated that it does not believe that us missile defenses should be subject to any treaty limits the united states and russia resolved this issue by deferring it to joint declaration that outlines areas of cooperation that the two nations will pursue in their new more cooperative relationship this document states that the united states and russia have agreed to implement number of steps aimed at strengthening confidence and increasing transparency in the area of missile defense 41 these steps could include information exchanges on missile defense programs and tests and reciprocal visits to observe tests they also agreed to explore areas for cooperation in the development of missile defenses such as the expansion of joint exercises and the possible conduct of joint research and development programs for missile defense technologies although this agreement did not impose any limits on us missile defense programs it could provide russia with confidence in its understanding of the goals and capabilities of us missile defense programs if the two sides pursued the cooperative programs however in spite of periodic meetings over the years tensions have increased as russia has responded with concerns about us plans to deploy missile defense interceptors and radar in poland

not indicate whether the parties will count only those warheads that are operationally deployed all warheads that would count under the start counting rules or some other quantity of nuclear warheads the text does however refer to the statements made by president bush in november 2001 when he announced the us intention to reduce its operationally deployed warheads and president putin in november and december 2001 when he indicate d that russia would be willing to reduce its strategic forces to 1500 warheads this reference indicates that the united states and russia could each use their own definition when counting their number of strategic nuclear warheads the absence of an agreed definition could create ambiguities and confusion about each sides progress in reducing their forces however the article does not impose any interim limits on forces or set pace for the reductions so ambiguities that arise during the ten year period should not give rise to questions about overall compliance with the treaty in addition in the absence of interim limits each side can set its own pace for the reductions and even stop or reverse them for period of time during the 10year time frame as long as each side can demonstrate that its forces do not exceed 2200 strategic nuclear wa rheads on december 31 2012 each will meet its obligations under article i article i also specifies that each party shall determine for itself the composition and structure of its strategic offensive arms it does not limit the number of delivery vehicles or impose sublimits on specific types of weapons systems within the overall total of strategic nuclear warheads this differs from past arms control agreements where the united states favored limits that would restructure soviet or russian strategic forces the 1991 start i treaty contained sublimit on the number of warheads that could be carried on ballistic missiles sublimit on the number of warheads that could be carried on mobile icbms and requirement for the elimination of half of the soviet unions 308 heavy icbms the 1993 start ii treaty contained sublimit on slbm warheads and in an achievement that was hailed as major breakthrough in usrussian arms control ban on all multiplewarhead icbms mirved icbms 42 the new treaty clearly indicates however that this ban and all other provisions in the start ii treaty will not be implemented the preamble and article ii of the treaty refer to the first strategic arms reduction treaty as start not start i thus start ii which never entered into force 43 is evident in its absence us and russian officials have both noted the treatys demise assistant secretary of defense jd crouch has said i think we have sort of moved beyond start ii setting it aside and have moved beyond it44 in comments made shortly after the treaty was signed russias general baluyevskiy noted that the start ii treaty never operated and should be considered dead 45 one report indicates that the defense minister and foreign minister informed the russian duma in midmay that the treaty had lapsed46 russia 42 many analysts argue that mirved icbms could be destabilizing in crisis because one or two attacking warheads could destroy up to 10 warheads on the single missile hence nation might believe it needs to launch first in crisis before it lost its forces to smaller attack russia in pa rticular deployed majority of its warheads on these large missiles russia also maintained monopoly in heavy icbms the ss18s and the united states had long sought limits on or the elimination of these weapons in the arms control process 43 the us senate gave its advice and consent to ratification in 1996 and the russian duma approved the treaty in 2000 but the united states never met conditions that ru

withdraw from the treaty on three months notice this provision differs from the w ithdrawal clause in previous treaties in two respects first other treaties such as the abm treaty start i and start ii required six months notice before party could withdraw seco nd these treaties stated that party could withdraw from the treaty if extraordinary events related to the subject matter of this treaty have jeopardized its supreme interests the new treaty does not have similar provision party can withdraw for any reason it chooses without justif ying its actions by citing extraordinary events that have jeopardized its supreme interests reports indicate that during the negotiations the united states proposed that the treaty include withdrawal period of only 45 days it also soug ht provision that would have allowed either side to exceed the limits in the treaty for short period of time without withdrawing if international geostrategic circumstances warranted 50 these proposals reflected the us interest in maintaining maximum amount of flexibility when reducing its forces but they were not needed in the final draft because the treaty does not contain any interim limits or schedule for reductions either party can exceed the limits in the treaty at any time leading up to december 31 2012

the start treaty further the number of warheads carried by minuteman iii missiles is likely to remain constant at between 500 and 600 warheads as the number of missiles declines51 the united states also has converted 4 trident submarines to carry cruise missiles but because it did not remove the slbm launch tubes these also continue to count under start the b1 bombers are longer equipped to conduct nuclear missions but each counts as one warhead under start b2 bombers can carry up to 16 gravity bombs but each also counts as only 1 warhead under start as table 1 shows this force counts as

20 cruise missiles and count as the number they were equipped to carry the b2 bombers would carry and count as 16 gravity bombs hence the united states would eliminate 4 trident submarines and 50 peacekeeper missiles and remove warheads from minuteman and trident missiles to reduce to the start ii limit of 3500 warheads 52 the bush administration initially indicated that it did not plan to eliminate any of the delivery vehicles that the united states would have retained under the start ii treaty to reduce that force from 3500 to 2200 permitted by the moscow treaty it would remove warheads from deployed icbms and slbms however in february 2006 the administration announced that it planned to eliminate 50 minuteman icbms cons equently the administration plans to deploy 450 minuteman iii missiles with 1 2 or 3 warheads on each missile and 14 trident submarines with perhaps 36 warheads on each missile however it will only count the warheads on 12 submarines under the treaty limits because it plans to keep 2 submarines in overhaul at any given time finally the administration announced in the 2006 qdr that it planned to reduce the b52 fleet to 56 bombers 53 because many of these bombers would be assigned to conventional units on daytoday basis the administration would not count the weapons that could be carried on 51 for more detailed discussion on the status of us nuclear forces see crs report rl34226 nuclear weapons in us national security policy past present and prospects by amy f woolf 52 the air force completed the deactivation of the peacekeeper missiles on september 19 2005 53 the 109th congress did not authorize the administrations request for reduction in the b52 fleet to 56 bombers it required that the administration retain 76 b52 bombers however because the number of bomber wea pons counted under the moscow treaty is not related to the number of deployed bombers this report still assumes that the united states will retain and count around 500 cruise missiles for the b52 bombers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31448g16g158g140g149g142g138g155g561g3g155g150g156g561 g5g152g151g157g155g152g149g497g561g22g145g142g561g21g157g155

never publicly identified force structure that it would have deployed under start ii however start ii would have required the elimination of all ss18 and ss24 icbms russia could have retained 105 ss19 icbms but each missile could carry only 1 warhead it also might have retained between 400 and 700 single warhead icbms this number would depend on russias ability to produce new ss27 icbms it had planned to produce up to 30 of these missiles per year but thus far has succeeded in adding fewer than 10 per year to its deployed forces russias submarine fleet might have consisted of as many as 13 submarines 5 typhoons and 8 delta ivs or because the typhoon submarines are in need of significant repairs as few as 6 delta ivs the bomber fleet could have remained at the current level of 78

problem underlined russias interest in concluding new agreement that would limit each side to only 1500 warheads most analysts agree that russias strategic nuclear forces will continue to decline during the next 10 years as it retires aging systems and produces only small numbers of new missiles however 54 in late 2005 the undersecretary of defense approved budgeting decision that called for reduction in the b52 bomber force from 94 to 56 aircraft between 2008 and 2011 it is not clear whether this decision will eventually affect the force size as the document noted that congress has repeatedly directed the air force to maintain 94 b52 aircraft see us department of defense air force transformation flight plan program budget decision 720 december 20 2005 p 5 regardless this plan

might be able to deploy its new icbm with three warheads instead of one if russia produced 30 of these missiles each year and deployed each with 3 warheads and if it retained the existing 6 delta iv submarines and reduced its bomber fleet to 65 aircraft it could retain force of 2064 warheads this force is displayed on table 2 above if on the other hand it produced 10 missiles per year and

the negotiations in search of legally binding treaty that would make radical real and irreversible reductions in us and russian strategic nuclear weapons 55 it succeeded in achieving the first of these two objectives russian officials and other russian analysts have stated that this outcome represents major success for russian diplomacy56 where the united states initially wanted simply to exchange letters or issue joint declaration russia convinced it to negotiate and sign formal arms control treaty in doing so these officials argue russia can be assured that as russia reduces its nuclear forces in response to economic pressures the united states will also reduce its nuclear forces so that the two retain rough nuclear parity furthermore the treaty ensures that the us commitment to reduce its forces will continue to exist after the bush administration leaves office more important according to russian officials the signing of treaty indicates that the united states and russia remain equal partners in the arms control process even though russia can longer claim to be military or economic equal of the united states 57 many analysts believe that retaining this seat at the table was key objective for president putin because it demonstrated to his critics at home that russia will benefit from his new more accommodating policies towards the united states and the west russia did not succeed in convincing the united states to adopt the start i counting rules or to eliminate excess delivery vehicles or warheads when implementing the treaty it also did not convince the united states to include in the treaty provision stating that us missile defenses would not undermine russias offensive deterrent russian officials recognize that they were unable to win these points in the negotiations but they seemed to believe that they could still achieve their objectives as was noted above general baluyevskiy has argued that the issue of how to limit and eliminate nondeployed warheads could be on the agenda for the treatys bilateral commission although discussions on this issue have not to date occurred 55 purdhum todd s russia calls for binding pact to reduce

reference to missile defenses russian officials have claimed that russia achieved its objective of linking offenses and defenses by including in the treatys preamble refere nce to the bushputin statement from the genoa summit where they agreed to hold consultations on the interrelated subjects of offensive and defensive systems emphasis added58 and the joint declaration signed at the same time as the treaty of moscow provides russia its assurances on the scope and intent of us missile defenses by calling for expanded information exchanges and cooperation

flexibility in sizing and structuring its nuclear forces it did not want any limits on its delivery vehicles or its stockpiled warheads and it did not want any limits on us missile defenses it succeeded in achieving these last objectives but did not succeed in avoiding formal arms control treaty the bush administration reportedly acquiesced to russias demands for formal treaty for three reasons first the administration ensured by standing firm on us negotiating positions that the treaty would reflect the us objective of maintaining force structure flexibility the form of the document ultimately became unimportant when it was clear that the substance would not undermine current us plans second key us senators had pressured the administration to conclude treaty third some in the united states hoped that the us concession on signing treaty could strengthen president putins and now president medvedevs ability to cooperate with the united states in other areas of security policy many in russia criticized putin for supporting the united states in its war on terrorism and allowing us troops access to bases on former soviet territory by signing the treaty the administration in essence rewarded putin for his cooperation and allowed him to answer his critics with his achievement however as the years have passed strains and disagreements in the usrussian relationship have continued to surface leading many to question whether progress in arms control can affect the broader usrussian relationship

before it can enter into force in russia majority of both houses of parliament the duma and the federation council must vote to approve federal law on ratification in the united states twothirds of the members in the senate must vote to approve resolution of ratification this has been relatively simple matter because legislators in both nations praised the treaty and one voiced opposition to its approval however both nations legislatures have shown reluctance in recent years to approve arms control agreements without significant debate and on occasion significant reservations in addition the russian duma has often linked its consideration of arms control treaties to its objections on other aspects of us policy 58 russian federation foreign ministry information and press department on the

and consent to ratification of the comprehensive test ban treaty it approved the chemical weapons convention in 1997 but included 28 conditions in its resolution of ratification the clinton administration never submitted several 1997 agreements related to the 1972 abm treaty in part because it feared the senate would reject these agreements and attack the continued viability of the abm treaty the moscow treaty did not however encounter significant opposition in the senate republican members praised the treaty because it did not restrict us flexibility in structuring its forces democrats have also praised the treaty because it demonstrates continuing us commitment to the arms control process many also hoped it would represent first step on path to deeper nuclear weapons reductions the senate could nonetheless have amended the treaty or added conditions to its resolution of ratification to address perceived weaknesses 59 the senate foreign relations committee did not recommend any amendments to the treaty the senate foreign relations committee did however include reservations and conditions in the resolution of ratification that it approved by vote of 190 on february 5 2003 in response to members concerns about the absence of timelines and interim limits in the treaty the resolution requires that the president report to congress each year on the progress that the united states and russia have made in reducing their forces to the treatys limits the resolution also contains nonbinding declarations that require among other things that the united states reduce its forces as quickly as possible and that it provide russia with assistance in securing it s nonstrategic nuclear weapons would only affect us policy the full senate approved the resolution of ratification by vote of 950 on march 6 2003 with these reservations and declarations included some senators proposed amendments to the resolution of ratification but these were all defeated after the chairman and ranking member senators lugar and biden made it clear that they would not support any amendments to the treaty or the resolution of ratification during the debate on the floor of the senate the text of the resolution of ratification appears in appendix b at the end of this report the russian duma has also demonstrated its independence on arms control treaties in recent years it delayed its vote on the start ii treaty for seven years questioning both the foreign policies of president yeltsin and several key elements of the treaty 60 when it did approve the treaty it included condition in its federal law on ratification that stated russia would not exchange the instruments of ratification and allow the treaty to enter into force until the united states approved several 1997 agreements related to the abm treaty since the senate never addressed or approved these agreements start ii could not enter into force the duma could have included conditions in its approval of the new treaty as well it did raise questions about russias financing and support for its strategic nuclear forces the duma also delayed its debate and vote on the treaty in march 2003 after the united states began its military operation in iraq however most analysts agreed that neither the duma nor the federation council was likely to challenge president putin by threatening to reject the treaty president putin had much broader and stronger s upport in the duma than president yeltsin had although the leader of the communist party denounced the treaty as betrayal of russian interests

process of reducing us and russian nuclear weapons they were particularly appreciative of the fact that the agreement is formal treatyit carries the weight of law since it was reviewed and approved by the nations legislative bodies and it will remain in force beyond the terms of president bush and president putin some russian commentators have also noted that as treaty the document will carry more weight in the international political community demonstrating that the united states and russia remain committed to nuclear disarmament as they promised in the nuclear nonproliferation treaty some in both the united states and russia have criticized the absence of provisions that would require the elimination of delivery vehicles or warheads some in russia argue that this would place russia at disadvantage because russia will have to eliminate its weapons systems due to lack of funding but the united states will retain redeployment potential with both extra delivery capacity and extra warheads 62 others in both the united states and russia argue that the retention of excess warheads in storage might create potential new risks because the warheads could be sold to or stolen by terrorist organizations63 in russia some praised the treaty because it signals the end of the start ii treaty and its ban on mirved icbms they noted that under the new agreement russia will be able to structure its forces as it sees fit in particular it could retain aging mirved icbms such as the ss18 or ss 19 or it could deploy the new ss27 and rs24 with multiple warheads 64 in the united states however critics have argued that the demise of the ban on mirved icbms could undermine confidence and stability they note that multiple warhead missiles will still be an attractive target and fearing that it might lose these weapons in an attack russia could still keep them at high state of alert this could increase the chance of an inadvertent launch of nuclear weapons in response to false or ambiguous information 65 furthermore some have argued that the arms control opponents in the united states could use deployment of new mirved icbms in russia as 61 on meeting of working group of state

the agreement and lead to its collapse finally many analysts and the united states and russia have noted that the new treaty does nothing to count contain or reduce nonstrategic nuclear weaponsthe shorter range missiles and artillery reports indicate that russia may up to 8000 of these weapons and some analysts argue they are housed in storage areas that might be at risk for loss through theft or attack analysts also note that these weapons have played greater role in russias national security policy in recent years and that russia might use these weapons in conflict if it lacked the necessary conventional forces in response to concerns about russias nonstrategic nuclear weapons the bush administration noted that the subject would be on the agenda for discussion between the two countries 66 the summit did not address this issue in its public documents but secretaries powell and rumsfeld both noted during their testimony before the senate foreign relations committee that the issue of nonstrategic nuclear weapons was likely to be high on the agenda of the new consultative group for strategic stability which was established in the summits joint declaration discussions on this issue have not however yet occurred g22g145g142g561g20g152g138g141g561g3g145g142g138g141g561 the state department has provided congress with several reports on the implementation of the strategic offensive reductions treaty as mandated by the treatys resolution of ratification 67 these reports indicate that both the united states and russia were on pace to complete their implementation by 2012 and that both parties appeared committed to completing this process in timely manner during the ratification process for the moscow treaty the bush administration assured congress that the united states and russia would confer frequently about the status of their nuclear forces and about their broader strategic relationship few of these talks have occurred however the treatys bilateral implementation commission has rarely met in part because the treaty contains so few rules and definitions that compliance questions are unlikely and the parties have little to discuss as they reduce their forces in addition the two nations have reportedly disbanded strategic offensive transparency working group which was slated to address monitoring and verification issues under the treaty and has instead replaced it with new channel of talks between undersecretary of state robert joseph and john rood and russian deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak these talks have also served as the forum for discussions on the future of arms control after the start treaty expires in 2009 the 1994 start treaty contains wide variety of monitoring and verification provisions that are supposed to help the nations monitor co mpliance with the moscow treaty in the 2005 implementation report the state department noted that the start verification regime provided important data for the united states in its monitoring of the moscow treaty the 2006 report however downplays the value of the start data indicating that the start provisions provide additional data that can be of use when monitoring the moscow treaty this distinction is important as some analysts have argued that the united states and russia should at least extend 66 raum tom tactical weapons next topic moscow times

moscow treaty russia has gone further calling for new treaty that would replace start and contain many of the same types of details and definitions that were present in start but absent from the moscow treaty the bush administration has rejected russias position and has instead proposed that the two sides continue implementing some of the monitoring activities to assist with the verification of compliance with the moscow treaty 68 the start treaty indicates the parties should use the year prior to the treatys expiration to determine whether to extend the treaty replace it or allow it to lapse as was noted above this issue has been on the agenda at several highlevel meetings between us and russian arms control officials congress does not have formal role in the process of deciding the future of start even though several members have called on the president to extend start at least for short time so that next president who will take office 11 months before the treaty lapses will have time to address the future of the treaty 68 for more information on these discussions and the issues associated with the expiration of start see crs report r40084 strategic arms control after
