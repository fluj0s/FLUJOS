zayed classified by ambassador richard olson reasons 14 b and d 1 c mr president shaykh mohammed bin zayed is looking forward to renewing your acquaintanceship established during his 2006 call on you mbz the man 2 c shaykh mohammed bin zayed alnahyan or mbz in usg speak is the man who runs the united arab emirates officially he is the crown prince of the emirate of abu dhabi the most important principality of the seven emirate confederation and his only federal title is deputy supreme commander of the armed forces in fact he is the key decision maker on national security issues he will make deferential noises about his boss elder halfbrother president khalifa distant and uncharismatic personage but we assess that he has authority in all matters except for final decisions on oil policy and major state expenditures 3 c aged 47 mbz is leader not just in the uae but more broadly in the middle east where he is seen as particularly dynamic member of the generation succeeding the geriatric cases who have dominated the region for decades he is reformer actively seeking to improve the life of his citizens and the uaes future through better education and health care and through economic diversification including investments in clean energy to prepare his citizenry for posthydrocarbon future he is proud of the fact that despite having had the option of life of privilege he rose through the ranks of the uae armed forces earning his wings as helicopter pilot and retains common touch that appeals to emiratis mbz and the bilateral relationship 4 c mbz has staked his reputation and his countrys future on its relationship with the united states especially since 1990 when the uae leadership saw that the united states was prepared to shed blood in the interests of preserving international order and stability in the gulf since that formative experience mbz has built armed forces especially his air force that are closely aligned with the us he is also proponent of close economic commercial and where possible political ties with the us he has generally tried to support us where he thinks we have been right afghanistan but also where he thinks we have pursued misguided policies iraq mbz recognizes that partnership with the us is fundamental to the uaes continued success but he also knows that the relationship is controversial among his people and that if the us is perceived as an unreliable protector his own power base will erode iran 5 c mbz sees iran as the primary external threat to the uae and his regime to his eyes tehrans threatening rhetoric dominance by proxy and pursuit of nuclear weapons is reminiscent of saddam in 1990 moreover the confrontations with iran during the late 1980s tanker wars long forgotten in the west are vividly remembered here mbz is probably the most passionately antiiran of the arab leaders and the uaes position is solidly with saudi arabia egypt and jordan in seeing the principal threat to the region as coming from iran mbz is particularly concerned at the divisions among the gulf arabs and sees qatars and omans decision to accommodate rather than challenge iranian power as troubling 6 snf while mbz is hard liner on iran there are accommodationists within his own system especially in dubai where the ruler mohammed bin rashid almaktoum prime minister of the uae takes position that is much closer to qatars for this reason and because of the basic disparity in size and power between the uae and iran the emiratis prefer to be seen as quietly supporting hardline us position rather than staking out their own views mbz is skeptical that us engagement with iran will be successful in reversing iranian positions on nuclear program and believes that policy of engagement puts him in an awkward position both domestically and internationally he will welcome thinking on next steps on sanctions 7 snf regarding the nuclear issue mbz believes that the logic of war now dominates the region he regularly expresses his belief that israel will launch preemptive strike against iranian nuclear facilities most likely within next six months this reflects his own assessment of the netanyahu government but also probably what israelis are telling uae in their private exchanges for this reason one of mbzs highest priorities is to finalize his integrated air defense system including thaad and patriots and advance bilateral contingency planning with the us because of qatari and omani wobbliness he is uncomfortable with multilateral gcc military solutions mbz may float the idea of extending the us nuclear umbrella to the gulf as way of shoring up an antiiran coalition and preventing regional arms race israel and the arabs 8 snf mbzs preoccupation with iran and his secondary concern about islamic fundamentalism lead him to have strategic view of the region that is curiously close to the israeli one but domestic politics flow the other way and he feels constrained in what he can say publicly also for reasons that are not entirely clear the uae still feels need to hide behind arab league and gcc consensus and in particular behind saudi arabia even when as is now the case bilateral relations with the kingdom are rocky 9 snf we should press mbz to expend political capital in resolving the century old arabisraeli conflict the issue cries out for leadership in the arab world not least so that the common interests of moderate arabs and israelis in containing iran can find political expression so far mbz has not been prepared to run real risks in this area but we should press him to he appreciates the bold steps you have taken and expects to be asked for help in this area afghanistanpakistan 10 c the discussion on afghanistan and pakistan should be an easy one the uae has played useful role since 2001 having deployed special forces there since 2003 and recently sending battalion sized task force during the elections mbz tried to organize panarab force but could not overcome the resistance of moroccans and tunisians to send troops in pakistan the uae has been supportive of zardari and played very useful role both as donor and politically as one of the key members of the friends of pakistan grouping mbz agrees on the need to curtail taliban financing but is frustrated by our seeming inability to generate actionable intelligence ctcp cooperation 11 c the uae has emerged as one of our principal partners in ct cooperation through intelligence channels having rounded up number of cells over the past few years and is moving toward cooperation externally as well in the counterproliferation area the uae has interdicted 20 shipments over the past two years including within the past few days seizing north korean systems bound for iran domestic export controls have lagged somewhat but the uaegs bureaucratic structure for implementing its export control laws is finally emerging conclusion 12 c mbz views himself as one our closest partners in the middle east and is keen to build on what has been an important aspect of his lifes work good relationship with the us from my perspective our relationship with the uae is one the most promising and productive in the region olson
