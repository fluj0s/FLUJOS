haitian hemispheric opportunity through partnership encouragement act of 2006 hope i which provides special trade rules that give preferential access to us imports of haitian apparel these rules are intended to promote investment in the apparel industry as one element of broader economic growth and development plan hope i allows for the dutyfree treatment of select apparel imports from haiti made from less expensive thirdcountry inputs eg nonregional yarns fabrics and components provided haiti meets rules of origin and eligibility criteria that require making progress on worker rights poverty reduction and anticorruption measures early assessments of the effectiveness of hope i however were disappointing so the 110 th congress responded by amending it in the hemispheric opportunity through partnership encouragement act of 2008 hope ii hope ii extends the preferences for 10 years expands coverage of dutyfree treatment to more apparel products particularly knit articles and simplifies the rules making them easier to use hope ii also amended the eligibility requirements by requiring haiti to create new independent labor ombudsmans office and establish the technical assistance improvement and compliance needs assessment and remediation taicnar prog ram within 16 months of enactment of the legislation the taicnar program provides technical assistance through the international labor organization ilo to help haiti develop the capacity to monitor compliance of apparel producers in meeting internationally recognized core labor standards those firms that are habitually unable or refuse to comply with thes standards or to accept technical assistance to remedy deficiencies can lose their eligibility for hope act trade preferences in providing preferential access to haitian apparel imports the hope act as amended gives haitian firms competitive price advantage over other foreign producers who must pay us duties on their apparel exports made from yarns and fabrics supplied by nonregional eg asian producers improved competitiveness of the apparel business is intended to attract longterm investment to haitis primary export industry expand output and employment and provide one pillar of policy foundation aimed at promoting economic growth and recovery unilateral trade preferences to help developing countries expand their export base have played longstanding role in us trade policy congress designed the hope act as amended as the most flexible of these arrangements to meet haitis critical development needs the rationale for success is based on the united states being the largest market for haitis primary export industry the labor provisions reflect relatively new approach for incorporating core labor standards because the tariff preferences are tied directly to firm performance in addition the ilo which wields international credibility is actively involved in administering and overseeing the program the model combines government private sector and international agency participation in way that achieved some success under the uscambodia textile agreement congressional oversight is mandated and important for ensuring that the hope act is implemented as intended haiti for its part faces many challenges and will have to find ways to overcome legacy of political volatility economic inequality and social dissension without the transition to more equal and stable society trade preferences may be overwhelmed by the force of broader social and economic factors this report will be updated periodically

alternated between jean bertrand aristide rené préval and interim placeholders none of whom has been able to establish fullyfunctioning and broadly accepted government let alone change the underlying fundamentals of inequality in haitian society the legacy of authoritarianism has continued to unfold in the recent democratically elected admini strations of both aristide and préval prévals second administration begun in 2006 initially sparked ray of hope among the masses but his rule has since been marred by decisions that have weakened the fledgling institutional democracy 3 1 title v of the

postdictatorial political system is new fragile and in many ways susceptible to criticism that it has failed to establish functioning government after two years into his second nonconsecutive term prévals leadership vision and strategy to address longstanding poverty and unemployment are coming under question his delay in appointing prime minister in conducting senate elections and in initiating widely supported constitutional reform particularly to amend repetitive expensive and so far unworkable electoral system has compromised the governments legitimacy the multiparty system rather than consolidating politics may be slipping further into factional partisanship evidence for some of the failure to promote political culture of participation 4 multiple observers note that the government bureaucracy suffers from historic endemic corruption acting to enrich itself while failing to delivery basic services to the haitian people5 haitis uneven social structure lies at the heart of its apparent state of perpetual crisis haitian society has small middle and working classes and is dominated by the chasm between tiny minority of wealthy elite and the impoverished masses the latter of which have little power or participation in governing politics since the transition to democracy in 1986 has not altered this precarious relationship the highly skewed distribution of power

be addressed internally expectations that the haitian government will deliver on changing the daytoday conditions of population immersed in poverty will be difficult to ignore yet many doubt they can be easily fulfilled externally vast amounts of foreign aid expose the legacy challenge to development in country devoid of the basic cornerstones of growth the restoration of growth remains the primary economic goal and is necessary condition for development even if policies can ignite sustainable growth trend however they will not provide the foundation for longterm political and social stability if they cannot begin to address the underlying extreme social inequality g15g138g140g155g152g142g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g18g142g155g143g152g155g150g138g151g140g142g561 haitis dismal economic growth trend epitomizes its developmental paralysis from 1960 to 2000 average real growth in per capita income was dismal 07 by far the worst performance in the western hemisphere growth returned briefly in the 1970s led by exportoriented assembly industries but haiti experienced prolonged economic downturn in the 1980s as did most countries in the region leading to social and political unrest that ultimately contributed to the overthrow of the duvalier dictatorship in 1986 in 1991 following an interim government aristide emerged briefly as the first elected president only to be deposed by military coup within few months to force the return of the democratically elected government the united states and other countries responded to the coup with trade embargo under the auspices of the organization of the american states oas and the united nations although its success in changing political behavior has been questioned its economic effects were concrete and devastating haiti was already experiencing decline in output employment and income but the trend mushroomed during the 19911994 embargo the embargo targeted fuel imports not food but supplies were delayed and all exports overall by 1994 per capita income had fallen by 30 in three years and unemployment peaked at 75 7 6 fatton haitis predatory republic pp 197205 and perito haiti hope for the

manufacturing industry apparel electronics sporting goods centered in portauprince fell by over 80 shedding 32000 jobs one estimate of the multiplier effect suggests that the embargo eliminated some 200000 jobs in the formal sector8 most assembly plants closed permanently with only apparel rebounding in the aftermath of the embargo the inability to import agricultural inputs fertilizers seeds or export agricultural goods had similarly devastating effects on that sectors production in addition because oil imports were blocked there was sudden increase in the production of charcoal accelerating the ecologically destructive trends in deforestation and soil erosion further damaging agricultural production 9 trade was renewed in 1995 but economic growth oscillated for the next decade hampered by recession flooding and ongoing political turmoil in the postembargo peri od annual gdp growth for the decade ending 2006 averaged only 11 lower than haitis 14 average population growth rate recipe for perpetuating chronic unemployment poverty and emigration pressures as seen in figure 2 haitis economic growth has lagged badly compared to latin america and the caribbean as whole region th at is itself known for its poor longterm growth record growth has been positive since 2005 but clined to an annual rate of only 15 in 2008 in part because of the us downturn10 given the many domestic and international challenges facing haiti sustainability of its longterm growth is far from certain see data in appendix haiti is the poorest country in the region in 2006 per capita income was meager 1700 on purchasing power basis adjusted for price differences across countries and 78 of the population lives on less than 2 per day11 inequality is extreme haiti has the most highly skewed income patterns in the americas with nearly half of the nations earnings going to the top 10 of the income distribution real wages have fallen since 2000 inflation has declined and real interest rates have stabilized but haiti experienced upward pressures from sharp price increases in food and energy in the first half of 2008 before commodity prices collapsed to consolidate the short growth trend begun in 2005 in addition to weathering the global economic downturn haiti will have to address core area of domestic policy the lack of productivity growth persistently low or negative productivity is the result of negligible investment in private enterprise human and social capital eg education and health care and public infrastructure it is highly pronounced in the agricultural sector where primitive methods and ancient equipment perpetuate low yields lack of growth in cultivated land and inadequate food supplies much of this due to the sectors decapitalization during the 19911994 trade embargo investment in manufacturing and public sectors has also been sparse jeopardizing prospects for longerterm growth 12 8 ibid p 11 citing united nations data 9 ibid pp 1014 and the world bank haiti

up to 70 of the work force but it has stagnated for decades and declined for five years in row until expanding by 30 in 2007 agricultural growth is limited by the small amount of arable land overuse of soil and poor irrigation it is also constrained by poor rural infrastructure destructive agricultural practices and frequent hurricanes and other natural disasters rice sugar and coffee are produced at fraction of levels achieved decades earlier haiti currently produces little of these traditional exports and output of staples has long been insufficient to meet domestic food needs haiti therefore must import large amounts of food stuffs rising international prices of basic foods compounded haitis inability to feed itself to the point of igniting food riots in april 2008 13 the recent collapse in commodity prices although problem for much of the region may help alleviate some of haitis import bill manufacturing constitutes only 76 of gdp and has shown growth over the past decade it nonetheless is the major foreign exchange earner and holds out some promise for employment growth manufacturing is dominated by food processing 472 and apparel assembly 211 construction and public

dependence on foreign commerce and finance from the colonial days of the sugar trade to the current assistance provided by developed countries total trade exports plus imports equals 60 of gdp but the trade imbalance is large with deficit equal to 33 of gdp haiti is in difficult position because slow growth in output and exports means that it must rely on foreign sources for basic commodities such as food and oil as well as manufactured and capital goods the problem is often made worse by deteriorating terms of trade when prices of oil and other commodity imports rise relative to prices haitis exports haitis trade relationship with the world is dominated by the united states with which it ran 192 million deficit in 2007 15 the united states accounted for 733 of haitis exports followed in order of magnitude by the dominican republic 88 the european union 58 and canada 33 see figure 3 the united states also accounted for 411 of haitis imports followed by the netherland antilles 149 the rest of latin america 141 the european union 77 and china 47 haiti exports primarily apparel which accounts for 7580 of foreign earnings and for over 90 of total exports to the united states cacao

relying on foreign sources of income principally remittances foreign aid and grants transfers finance haitis fiscal and current account deficits but they are poor substitute for production nd exportdriven financing they promote long term dependency and create technical problems such as exchange rate appreciation that exacerbates haitis structural trade deficit with concomitant growth in productivity or output that is typically associated with an exportdrive n exchange rate appreciation these transfers so necessary for haitis shortterm survival are dependent on the fortunes of expatriate citizens and the generosity of foreign governments diminishing haitis control over the future of its economic wellbeing 16 haiti has poorly diversified export sector overly dependent on one type of product and single foreign market strategy that has so far shown little lasting positive effect on longterm development17 the risk to this export structure becomes increasingly clear with the

most pronounced on the import side haiti imports manufactured goods machinery transportation equipment raw materials energy and food it is unable to produce most of these needs and will be large net importer for the indefinite future haitis vulnerability became acute over the last decade with the rise in food and energy prices which has had huge budgetary effect from 2002 to 2007 the value of food and energy imports rose 57 and 159 respectively even as volume declined slightly in 2008 petroleum accounted for 25 30 of total imports this trend points to two fundamental problems first higher commodity prices make food and energy imports more expensive decreasing haitian purchasing power second to compensate there is compounding substitution effect in which other goods must be given up to spend more on food and energy this effect may be seen in the decline of manufactured imports which fell by 37 from 2002 to 2007 19 foreign direct investment fdi in haiti has been historically very low net fdi inflows ranged from 4 million in 2000 to 14 million in 2004 and then spiked to 160 million in 2006 before falling to 75 million in 2007 the large increase appears to be related to an investment boost in construction and tourist industries which may be limited in duration construction activity in the public and private sector has expanded briskly but fdi inflows are not expected to continue at this recent higher levels20 one approach to attracting fdi to haiti rests on reinvigorating the apparel industry strategy that the us congress supported with the hope acts 18 banque

jobs and output apparel assembly is the core export industry and possible source of employment growth in the formal sector the fortunes of the apparel sector have paralleled the broader trends of the economy which have been subject to tremendous social and political turbulence historically the apparel heyday in haiti lasted from the 1960s through the end of the duvalier dictatorship in 1986 the troubled transition to democracy including the 1991 military coup and trade embargo that followed caused massive downturn in production for years since 1994 the haiti apparel industry has entered into slow and tentative period of rebuilding employment and output data on the apparel industry are sketchy at its peak in the 1980s haitian apparel industry sources estimate that the number of jobs ranged from 60000 to 100000 the 199194 trade embargo effectively closed apparel operations causing employment to fall to near zero for short time as many apparel manufacturers apparently left haiti for honduras and other sites in the region in its rebuilding haitian apparel assembly increased employment to high of between 20000 and 22000 but by 2008 industry sources estimated that it had settled to approximately 18000 employees operating in 17 plants 21 apparel output data are not available from industry sources because over 90 of apparel production is exported to the united states us import data can serve as reasonable proxy for production trends figure 4 shows the trend of us imports of haitian apparel by volume note that imports were falling in the tumultuous afte rmath of the duvalier dictatorship the downward trend hit bottom during the 199194 trade embargo with temporary return to relative political calm us imports again as reflection of output rose but fell again after 2000 as production was lost to competition and continuing political uncertainty kept investors at bay growth renewed after 2002 with industry restructuring but employment failed to return to levels achieved two decades earlier by 2006 new downturn is ticeable likely related to two events that occurred at that time the end of global textile quotas put in place under the world trade organization wto

of 1983 often referred to as the caribbean basin initiative they did not however cover textile or apparel goods 30 in 2000 congress passed the caribbean basin trade partnership act cbtpa which provided additional incentives on temporary basis to select textile and apparel articles assembled or knittoshape by firms in designated beneficiary countries in the caribbean region in general to qualify for the tariff preferences the articles had to be made from inputs produced in the united states or the region the hope act as amended builds on this precedent providing benefits exclusively for haitian apparel exports as way to support growth and development in haiti the hope act as amended offers dutyfree treatment for us apparel imports from haiti under rules that allow for more flexible sourcing of materials than those offered to haiti and other caribbean countries under the cbtpa the basic difference is that under the cbtpa apparel goods receive dutyfree treatment if assembled or knittoshape from us yarns and fabrics 31 under the hope act dutyfree treatment is extended to apparel articles if wholly assembled or knittoshape in haiti from materials yarns fabric and components sourced from any country provided minimum portion of the materials is produced by country that is party to us unilateral preferential trade arrangement or free trade agreement fta in effect the special rules exclusively allow haiti apparel exports to contain limited amounts of lowercost inputs from anywhere in the world and still enter the united states free of duty because the united states is the dominant market for haitian apparel the economic benefit conveyed from the preferences is expected to have significant effect on investment output and employment in that sector 29 ibid

the haitian hemispheric opportunity through partnership encouragement act of 2006 hope i as title v of the tax relief and health care act of 2006 hr 6111pl 109432 now referred to as hope i the act provided special rules for the dutyfree treatment of select apparel imports from haiti made from thirdcountry yarns and fabrics provided haiti met rules of origin and eligibility criteria to be eligible haiti had to make progress toward establishing market economy the rule of law the elimination of barriers to us trade and investment policies to reduce poverty system to combat corruption and protection of internationally recognized worker rights the act required that all eligible exports be shipped directly from haiti it also established an overall cap on total qualified apparel imports equal to 12 of total us apparel imports it included short supply rule that allowed dutyfree treatment of goods made from fabrics found to be in short supply as defined in all other preference arrangements and ftas of the united states and gives preferences to wire harness automotive imports at the heart of hope i were three specific new rules of origin first quotas were established for the dutyfree treatment of apparel articles made from inputs that meet the 50 to 60 value added content requirement from countries that are party to us fta or are beneficiary countries under unilateral preference arrangement there are restrictions on the source of the remaining inputs second additional quotas were established for dutyfree treatment of woven apparel that could not meet the 5060 valueadded rule allowing all inputs for these articles to be sourced from anywhere in the world third single transformation rule of origin allowed for dutyfree treatment of brassieres made from components sourced anywhere in the world provided the garments were cut and sewn or othe rwise assembled completely in haiti the united states or both despite these new trade rules favoring haitian apparel producers hope i soon came under criticism for being ineffective in 2007 the first year of operation only 3 of haitian apparel imports entered under hope i the rest still entering duty free under the cbtpa 32 among the major criticisms of hope i were33 the threeyear program was too short to attract new investment the 50 value added rule was too high more liberal valueadded rule like that given wovens was needed for knits because they represent 80 of haitian apparel production the requirement of direct shipping from haiti was cumbersome and costly since apparel finishing eg washing and applications had to be done in the dominican republic and then the articles shipped back to haiti for export to the united states and the overall cap on imports was too small 32 usitc textiles and

contending that because they permitted use of thirdparty fabrics and other inputs they were effectively displacing textile jobs in the united states and the caribbean with those in asia us producers also argued that the rules of origin were vague and difficult to enforce and that the tariff preferences could result in diverting apparel production to haiti from countries in the region that had apparel trade preferences in other agreements with the united states34 the usitc found that in 2007 haiti imports of yarns and fabrics from china and hong kong increased significantly possibly in part as response to hope i in general however because haiti accounts for less than 1 of total us apparel imports the usitc opined that hope i had negligible effect on the us textile industry in addition there was little evidence of trade diversion from other apparel manufacturers in the region35 g10g17g18g7g561g11g11g561 because early assessments of the effectiveness of hope i were critical of its

sustainable economic growth and development 37 congress responded to haitis longterm economic challenges in part by creating and then expanding the hope act unilateral trade preferences for developing countries have played longstanding role in us trade polic and congress designed the hope act as the most flexible of these arrangements to address haitis special circumstances as the poorest country in the western hemisphere it has the greatest need for development assistance because the united states is the primary market for haitian apparel exports trade preferences may affect export and production levels enough to help rejuvenate the apparel industry this could help haitis struggling economy by providing additional incentives to invest in an industry that has the potential to create employment relatively quickly and which is also the largest foreign exchange earner in the country apparel exports to the united states have stagnated since 2005 and turning this trend around would be an important indication that the preferences might be having the desired effect however because of the need for both public infrastructure and private facilities capital investment increased apparel production may lag for some time trade preferences are also only one policy response limited to affecting one sector of the economy success in attaining broader development goals therefore may face many other challenges presented by haitian society that will require much deeper political and social reform hope ii does support social reform by requiring that internationally recognized core labor standards be enforced and strictly monitored the labor provisions reflect relatively new approach for incorporating core labor standards beca use the tariff preferences are tied directly to firm performance in addition the ilo which wields international credibility is actively involved in administering and overseeing the program the model combines government private sector and international agency participation in way that achieved some success under the uscambodia textile agreement 38 congressional oversight is also clearly mandated in the hope act as amended and will likely be an important factor in assuring it continues to be implemented as congress intended and in ways that support haitis longterm development haiti for its part will have to find ways to overcome legacy of political volatility economic inequality and social dissatisfaction without the transition to more equal and stable society trade preferences may be overwhelmed by other factors 37 these were made worse by hurricanes fay and gustav which tore through haiti in august 2008 us agency for international development assistance for hurricane relief totaled 337 million as of december 18 2008 38 see
