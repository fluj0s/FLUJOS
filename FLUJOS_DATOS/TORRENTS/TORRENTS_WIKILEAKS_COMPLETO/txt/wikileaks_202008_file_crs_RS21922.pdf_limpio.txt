g14g138g151g141g156g140g138g153g142g561 us policy has been to extend the authority and encourage reform of afghanistans president hamid karzai and his central government predicated on the observation that weak and corrupt governance is causing some afghans to acquiesce to taliban insurgents as providers of stability and credible justice karzais is the first fully elected government in afghan history although there were parliamentary elections during the reign of king zahir shah the last were in 1969 presidential parliamentary and provincial elections and adoption of constitution were part of posttaliban transition roadmap established by united nationssponsored agreement of major afghan factions signed in bonn germany on december 5 2001 bonn agreement 1 after the taliban had fallen the political transition process is depicted in the table below the united states provides about 22000 forces to 51000 troop natoled peacekeeping coalition there another 14000 us troops continue the original postseptember 11 counterterrorism mission in afghanistan since its formation in late 2001 karzais government has come to be progressively dominated by ethnic pashtuns who are about 42 of the population and traditionally have governed afghanistan however the intelligence directorate continues to be headed by nonpashtun amrollah saleh tajik and adhering to ta cit consensus the other security ministries defense interior tend to have pashtun leadership but with nonpashtuns in key deputy or subordinate positions one prominent example is the defense ministry in which the chief of staff is tajik bismillah khan who reports to pa shtun defense minister abd rahim wardak still it is the national assembly parliament particularly the 249 seat elected lower house wolesi jirga that is the key institution for the ethnic minorities to exert influence many seats in the lower house are held by personalities and factions prominent in afghanistans recent wars the lower house is divided into mainly pashtun prokarzai mainly minority opposition figures and independents of varied ethnicities not strictly organized according to afghanistans 90 registered political parties karzai has not formed his own party but his core support in the wolesi jirga consists of former members of the hardline conservative pashtun based hizbeislam party and supporters of abdirab rasul sayyaf prominent islamic conservative mujahedin party leader another base of support for him is the delegation from qandahar karzais home province including several karzai clan members one clan member in the body is his cousin jamil karzai and relative by marriage aref nurzai karzais elder brother qayyum was in the lower house representing qandahar until his october 2008 resignation due to health reasons also prokarzai are former pashtun militia and taliban leaders including hazrat ali nangarhar province who had gained fame for leading the afghan component of the failed assault on osama bin ladens purported redoubt at tora bora in december 2001 pacha khan zadran paktia who by some accounts helped osama bin laden escape tora bora and mullah abdul salam mullah rocketi from zabol the opposition

in 2006 however the bloc says its disputes with karzai will remain political and peaceful in april 2007 wolesi jirga speaker yunus qanooni and former afghan president burhanuddin rabbani both prominent northern alliance figures organized broader opposition bloc called the united front uf which includes both of karzais vice presidents and some pashtuns prominent in the sovietoccupation era such as sayed muhammad gulabzoi khost province and nur ulhaq ulumi who chairs parliaments defense committee the uf advocates amending the constitution to give more power to parliament and to empower the elected provincial councils instead of the president to select governors and mayors fearing pashtun consolidation the uf has been generally opposed to karzais overtures to taliban fighters to end their fight and join government an initiative that has begun to draw backing from the us and british governments the opposition first showed its strength in march 2006 following the december 19 2005 inauguration of parliament by requiring karzais cabinet to be approved individually rather than bloc increasing opposition leverage however karzai rallied his support and all but 5 of the 25 nominees were confirmed one of those defeated was female nominee for minister of womens affairs leaving afghanistan without any women ministers the post was held by female since it was established in 2002 in may 2006 the opposition compelled karzai to change the ninemember supreme court the highest judicial body including ousting 74yearold islamic conservative fazl hadi shinwari as chief justice parliament approved his new court choices in july 2006 all of whom are trained in modern jurisprudence in may 2007 the uf achieved majority in parliament to oust karzai ally rangin spanta as foreign minister however karzai refused to replace him instead seeking supreme court ruling that spanta should remain on the grounds that his ouster was related to refugee issue irans expulsion of 100000 afghan refugees not foreign policy issue the court has to date supported karzai and spanta remains foreign minister karzai and the uf often battle for the support of the many independents in the lower house among them are several outspoken women intellectuals and business leaders such as 37 year old malalai joya farah province leading critic of warera faction leaders in may 2007 the lower house voted to suspend her for this criticism for the duration of her term but she continues to legally challenge the expulsion others in this camp include ms fauzia gailani herat province ms shukria barekzai editor of woman mirror magazine and mr ramazan bashardost former karzai minister who champions parliamentary powers usbased international republican institute iri has helped train the independents the national democratic institute ndi has assisted the more established factions karzai has fewer critics in the meshrano jirga partly because of his 34 appointments onethird of that body he engineered the appointment as speaker an ally sibghatullah mojadeddi noted islamic scholar who headed the postcommunist mujahedin government for one month may 1992 and who now heads the effort to reconcile with taliban figures peace and reconciliation commission or ptsd program karzai also appointed northern alliance military leader muhammad fahim perhaps to compensate for his removal as defense minister although he resigned after few months and later joined the national front there is one hindu and 23 women 17 are karzai appointees and 6 were selected in their own right this body tends to be more islamist conservative than the lower house advocating legal system that accords with islamic law and restrictions on press and westernized media broadcasts in late 2008 the body approved law opposing usafghan plan to establish tribal militias to help keep taliban httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21922g3g143g144g145g138g151g146g156g157g138g151

criteria and weeding out of the rampant official corruption afghan ministries are growing their staffs and technologically capabilities although still suffering from low resource and skill base us officials have generally refrained from publicly criticizing karzai when in the interests of political harmony he has indulged faction leaders with appointments and tolerated corruption however presidentelect obama has been somewhat more publicly critical of karzais shortcomings than has the bush admini stration karzai argues that compromises with faction leaders and tribes are needed to keep the government intact as he focuses on fighting unrepentant taliban insurgents partly as result of these compromises as well as what many afghans view as predatory central government some afghans are said to be losing faith in the government and in karzais leadership to the point where his reelection appears increasingly uncertain karzais popularity also is being undermined by civilian casualties resulting from usnato operations following an august 21 2008 airstrike that some afghans said killed 90 civilians the incident is in dispute near herat city the afghan cabinet called for bringing foreign forces under afghan law replacing an 2001 in terim status of forces agreement with the coalition afghanistan and the united states conducted joint investigation of the incident

the issue of official corruption has become key us agenda item as karzais leadership image fades some observers such as former coordinator for counternarcotics and justice reform thomas schweich in july 27 2008 new york times article have gone so far as to assert that karzai to build political support is deliberately tolerating officials in his government who are allegedly involved in the narcotics trade the new york times reported allegations october 5 2008 that another karzai brother qandahar provincial council chief ahmad wali karzai is involved in narcotics trafficking the perception of governmental corruption was not improved by karzais decisions in 2007 to empower two supr eme court chief justice abdul salam azimi and attorney general abdul jabbar sabit to instill confidence in the justice sector and enhance accountability nor was confidence improved when karzai fired sabit on july 16 2008 after sabit declared his intention to run against karzai in 2009 several

services or assistance routinely requires sometimes onerous bribes3 transparency international german organization that assesses governmental corruption worldwide ranked afghanistan in 2008 as 176th out of 180 countries ranked in terms of government corruption to try to address the criticism in august 2008 karzai with reported us prodding set up the high office of oversight for the implementation of anticorruption strategy with the power to investigate the police courts and the attorney generals office and to catalogue the overseas assets of afghan officials karzai said publicly in december 2008 that he believes that many high officials have bank accounts overseas such as in dubai in october 2008 karzai replaced the ministers of interior of education and of agricultu re with officials particularly the new interior minister former sovietera official muhammad hanif atmar believed to be dedicated to reform of their ministries and weeding out of official corruption however atmars appointment incurred further uf concern because atmar pashtun replaced tajik zarrar moqbel in that post in december 2008 the lower house voted commerce minister amin farhang out of office nearly unanimous vote for failing to bring down energy prices karzai has marginalized several major regional strongmen but has been hesitant to confront them to the point where their followers go into armed rebellion in 2008 some observers cited karzais handling of prominent uzbek leader abdurrashid dostam as evidence of political weakness dostam is often referred to as warlord because of his command of partisans in his redoubt in northern afghanistan jowzjan and balkh provinces and he is widely accused of human rights abuses of political opponents in the north to try to separate him from his militia in 2005 karzai appointed him to the post of chief of staff of the armed forces on february 4 2008 afghan police surrounded dostams villa in kabul in response to reports that his followers attacked and beat an ethnic turkmen rival but karzai did not order his arrest for fear of stirring unrest among dostams followers to try to resolve the issue without stirring unrest in early december 2008 karzai purportedly reached an agreement with dostam under which he resigned as chief of staff and went into exile in turkey in exchange for the dropping any case against him 4 karzai has curbed prominent tajik political leader former herat governor ismail khan by appointing him minister of energy and water in february 2007 bo th houses passed law giving amnesty to so called warlords karzai altered the

came in august 2007 when karzai placed the selection process for local leaders provincial governors and down in new independent directorate for local governance idlgand out of the interior ministry the idlg with advice from india and other donors has also developed plans to empower localities to decide on development priorities in march 2008 karzai replaced the weak and ineffective governor of

than poppy some observers say that th central government has not given mangal the support he is requesting such as delivery of seeds and other goods to encourage helmand farmers to grow legitimate crops and there are reports karzai wants to replace him with the former governor sher mohammad akhundzadeh who is ac cused of human rights abuses when he was governor during 20022005 but who remains powerful in the province the unodc report said that improving governance in some provinces had contributed to the increase to 18 poppy free provinces out of 34 from 13 in the same report in 2007 the governor of qandahar was changed to former general rahmatullah raufi replacing asadullah khalid after the august 7 2008 taliban assault on the qandahar prison that led to the freeing of several hundred taliban fighters incarcerated there karzai changed that governorship again in december 2008 naming canadianafghan academic tooryalai wesa as governor perhaps hoping that his ties to canada would assuage canadian reticence to continuing its mission in qandahar beyond 2011 the idlg also has replaced the governor of ghazni province and several other governors are slated to be changed the idlg is also the chief implementer of the recentlylaunched social outreach program which provides financial support about 125 per month and other benefits to tribal and local leaders in exchange for their cooperation with usnato led forces against the taliban insurgency the civilian aspects of the program are funded partly by usaid more controversial security aspect of the program is called the community guard program partial resurrection of the traditional tribal militias arbokai that provided local security before afghanistans recent wars us commanders say us weapons will not be provided to the militias only training but some weapons may come from the afghan government the security components of the program are partially funded with dod funds cerp commanders emergency response program the program has been launched in wardak province and will also be implemented in kapisa ghazni and lowg ar in early 2009 some see the shift toward new local militias as reversal of the 20012007
