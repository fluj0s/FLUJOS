from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk to joos joosclimateunibech subject re climate reconstructions date fri aug 4 151006 2000 dear fortunat i am pleased to hear from you i have still not been in touch about the data i showed you in vienna as for your question of course i will send the series you mention but it is only an average of three regional treering chronologies northern sweden yamaltaimyr and not calibrated in terms of temperature nevertheless it is representative of summer warmth over large russian region we have recently submitted paper describing different standardization approach for preserving low frequency variance applied to big highlatitude network of treedensity data this yields regional up to 600year calibrated reconstructions and hemispheric curve all representing aprilsept season i have asked my colleague tim osborn here to send the data and copy of the papers to you i am on the verge of leaving for 2 weeks so if you need more information contact him as for other areas of the world phil jones has an alternative hemisphere curve and there are some southern hemisphere chronologies temp sensitive there are short precip reconstructions for several spots but systematic palmer drought indices for the us from about 1700 i will be happy to talk on the phone about all these in two weeks best wishes keith at 1101 am 71900 0200 you wrote dear keith how are you hope everything is going well i am writing because i am interested in your climate reconstruction for the last millennium the etheridge ice core data of co2 indicate that co2 was below average in the 17th and 18th centuries by few ppm very few 12 points of ice core c13 data francey tellus 99 suggest that this drawdown was caused by additional terrestrial carbon storage joos et grl 99 trudinger tellus 99 we try to investigate this suggestion using the lundpotsdamjena dynamical global vegetation model lpjdgvm diploma student of mine philippe bruegger has used the mann et annual mean temperature patterns 2 eofs only in combination with the etheridge co2 record to drive the lpj model instead of absorbing carbon the model is releasing carbon due to reduced co2 fertilization effect in the model that outweights any climatic effects thus the model results is clearly not compatible with the ice core results obviously the study is hampered by the limitation of the climate reconstruction as well as by the few c13 ice core data instead of changes in monthly values of temp and precip and cloud cover changes in annual mean temperature were used to force lpj could you or phil jones provide alternative forcing fields that focus eg more on summer temperature any info about precipitation i would also appreciate very much to obtain reprints of your most recent articles namely the article in quaternary science rev 2000 thanks for any help you can provide regards fortunat new fax number new fax number new fax number new fax number fortunat joos climate and environmental physics sidlerstr 5 ch3012 bern phone 41031 631 44 61 fax 41031 631 87 42 email joosclimateunibech internet 1httpwwwclimateunibechjoos references 1 httpwwwclimateunibechjoos
