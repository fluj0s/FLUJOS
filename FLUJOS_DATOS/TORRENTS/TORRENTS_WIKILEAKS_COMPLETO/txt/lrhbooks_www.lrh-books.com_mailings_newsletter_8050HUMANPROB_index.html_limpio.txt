untitled document apr 16 2008 why people have trouble with bodies now it happens it happens that man has reached point in his track where he either starts to run these machines or theyll run him right on out and off this planet see he either has to start to run this equipment or its going to run him out why because it is so easy to depend on equipment now people have trouble with bodies because they depend on bodies to get them around which is about the silliest thing anybody ever looked at when he really starts to look at this if you want good laugh get an intensive sometime its one of the silliest things to just be carting bodies around all the time and so on people have trouble with these bodies now why do they have trouble with bodies they have trouble with bodies because they are dependent upon bodies they cannot do without them excerpted from the london congress on human problem being efficient with your body an article by l ron hubbard from the london congress on human problems you boot somebody out of his body he doesnt know the time the square root of zero the einstein theory and as matter of fact he just goes completely stupid he does he couldnt even tell you who his mother was why you separate him from the mass you separate him from something that he thinks is doing all of his memorying anyhow his brain although how brain remembers anything i dont know i had brain once and i asked it some questions and so forth but it just sat there in the alcohol but here he is here he is dependent upon this thing for locomotion commotion and all kinds of other otions hes dependent upon it he says i cannot do without it and thats about the silliest thing that anybody ever said you get somebody three feet back of his head and exercised up and squared around on the subject of mass and so forth and he says what am i doing with that thing and you say now its the social thing to do old boy to carry it around hell say oh and hell take care of it hell do well with it and so forth but he has gotten over needing it and what do you know the body gets well why does the body get well whats this got to do with it well i tell you theres this thing called power of choice and if every time body wants to sleep you wake it up and every time body wants to eat you make it wait bit and every time body wants to take vacation you go back to work at eight oclock the next morning youll see that its power of choice is continually upset in other words its needs are not rather uniformly answered why because it is pressed into the continuous emergency of affairs it is in continuous state of emergency that is to say it has to get here and it has to go there and it has to do that and it has to do something of the sort and fellow driving one of these machines after while just drives it out through the bottom well thats not because the body is overworked its because the body has choice particularly and if fellow doesnt need body all the time to do all of his thinking and entertaining and everything else for him he can put it down on couch and let it sleep once in while he can let it eat once in while you know the thetan is trying like mad to protect the body various other things occur in relationship to bodies but this is not lecture on health in spite of the program his dependency on it has reduced the only ability present the thetans the body doesnt have any ability you put it down on couch and itll just stay there you put it down at table it wont even pick up fork it just sits there its alive the heart keeps on beating it keeps on breathing but it doesnt do anything not thing until thetan comes along and says go here and go there and do this and do that now the thetan gets pressed into an emergency level and says go here and go there and do this and do that and do something else so continuously that the function of the body which is evidently built on so much rest and so much food and so much this and so much that is overset and we get bad condition but most important most important about this combination of the thetan is the operator if he is inefficient he works the body nine times too much in other words the thetan has become irresponsible with regard to the body irresponsible because the body is it the body is everything the body is all that is there and the body does all the work see his dependence goes over and creates then state of irresponsibility and having created this state of irresponsibility we get decay of the body the only thing that is there to be responsible is the being running the machine l ron hubbard
