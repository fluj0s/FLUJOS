and brazil bought more 159 billion from the us than italy and spain combined 152 billion2 on the import side the united states remains the most important market for the majority of countries in the western he misphere canada and mexico are the two countries most heavily dependent on the us market in recent years both have shipped over 75 of their exports to the united states these shipments in turn accounted for 30 of total us imports and 84 of ll us imports from the western hemisphere most of the caribbean and central american countries also tend to be quite dependent on the us market sending anywhere from onefourth to onehalf of their total exports to the us the larger countries of south america particularly brazil argentina and chile are less dependent on the us market historically the us market has accounted for only about 20 of their total exports us economic ties with the western hemisphere are also strengthened through large stock of foreign direct investment in 2000 the countri of the western hemisphere were host to 366 billion or 29 of total us foreign direct investment worldwide by contrast europe accounted for 52 and the p acific rim countries 16 of the total stock of us foreign direct investment the strong us commercial position in th western hemisphere has been spurred by farreaching marketoriented economic refo rms and unilateral reduc tions in trade and investment barriers undertaken by most all the countries in the region during the 1990s most notably the average tariff applied by latin american and caribbean countries has dropped from around 35 in the 1980s to around 12 today the liberalizing trend has been compleme nted by the evolution of subregional groupings that have deepened economic and po litical ties among partner countries these groups not only have established free trade ar eas but in some cases have evolved into customs unions some of the groups have ne gotiated preferential trade agreements with other countries in the hemisphe re and some are bolstering th eir trade and investment ties with the european union in the process th region has become much more open to trade and trade in turn has become more important engine of economic growth subregional groupings five subregional groups have made considerable prog ress over the past decade in reducing barriers to trade and investment these include the north american free trade agreement nafta the common market of the south mercosur the andean group the caribbean community and comm on market caricom and the central american common market

fully integrate into the free trade area by 2005 as result of the free trade area the five members of the community have become not only more integr ated among themselves but also with the rest of the hemisphere4 in 1999 the andean presidents pledged to transform the andean community into common market by 2005 whereby not only goods and services but also capital and labor would move freely efforts

have made substantial progress but serious political and economic obstacles remain slowing economic activity throughout the region luke warm political support in brazil and the united states ongoing economic or political turmoil in countries such as argentina colombia and venezuela nd efforts to launch new r ound of multilatera l negotiations are major challenges that will have to be overcome if the ftaa is to come to fruition if efforts to create the ftaa are derailed fo r whatever reason it can be expected that the other countries of the western hemisphere will continue to expand their own regional trade groupings and will continue to look for new integration partne rs both inside and outside the region the impact such deve lopment will have on us exports and investments remains uncertain
