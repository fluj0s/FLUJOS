nuclear testing on the marshall isla nds atolls of bikini and enewetak during the 1940s and 1950s the petition request s additional compensation for personal injuries and property damage s and restoration costs dical care programs health services infrastructure and training and radiological monitoring according to various estimates between 1954 and 2004 the united states spent over 500 million on nuclear test compensati on and related assistance in the marshall islands the petition bases its claims for co mpensation upon changed circumstances pursuant to section 177 of the compact of free association the compact of free association enacted in 1986 governs th economic and stra tegic relationships between the united states and the rmi the section 177 agreement granted 150 million

republic of the marshall islands changed circumstances petition to congress introduction background the 109th congress is considering the changed circumstances petition submitted to the united states congress by the republic of the marshall islands rmi for further compensation for damages resulting from us nuclear testing on marshall islands atolls during the 1940s and 1950s key oversight committees are the senate energy and natural resources committee the house resources committee and the house international relations committee on may 25 2005 the house committee on resources and the subcommittee on asia and the pacific of the house committee on international relations held joint hearing on the changed circumstances petition on july 19 2005 the senate committee on energy and natural resources held an oversight hearing on the effects of the us nuclear testing program on the marshall islands according to us government estimates the united states has spent between 520 million and 550 million in the marshall islands on nuclear testrelated compensation and assistance including health care medical surveillance and environmental monitoring cleanup of conta minated sites and resettlement efforts about onehalf of this assistance was provided through cong ressional ex gratia payments1 the compact of free association which established the marshall islands as freely associated state2 extended 150 million for nuclear testrelated compensation as part of full and final settlement3 of claims under section 177 article ix of the compact additional compensation may be requested by the rmi if loss or damages to pers ons or property arose or were discovered that could not reasonably have been identified as of the effective date of the agreement and if such injuries rendered the provisions of the compact manifestly inadequate in september 2000 the marshall islands gove rnment submitted to the united states congress changed circumstances petition requesting additional compensationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32811crs2 4 howard l hills attorney at law histo rical information regarding the marshall islands nuclear claims settlement testimony before the house

america november 2004pursuant to the compact the petition requests compensation for personal injury awards property damages loss of use re storation costs and hardships suffered health services infrastructure health care program radiation exposure monitoring and other programs the petition justifies its claims of changed circumstan ces largely upon new and additional information since the compacts enactment declassified department of energy records in the ear ly 1990s that indicated wider extent of radioactive fallout than previously known or disclosed and scie ntific findings that reduced the levels at which exposure to ra diation was deemed safe as result of and in addition to the above findings th petition and accompanying materials argue that higher than expected health cons equences and costs of health care and environmental cleanup as well as lower than expected investment returns from the nuclear claims fund constitute changed ci rcumstances furthe rmore according to the petitions supporting arguments th nuclear claims fund constituted provisional political settle ment rather than fina l determinati on based upon conclusive scientific assessment of costs the petition contends that the us congress agreed to retain its authority through legislation to approve the compact pl 99239 to appropria additional compensation should the need arise4 furthermore legal counsel for the four nu clearaffected atolls maintain that us courts left open the possibility that rmi plaintiffs could also return to the courts if they did not receive adequate compensation from compact provisions the petitions monetary requests incl ude unpaid nuclear claims tribunal nct personal injury awards of 157 million unpaid nct property damages awards to enewetak atoll and bikini atoll totaling 949 million 50 million for medical services infrastructure and 45 million nnually for 50 years for health care program for those exposed to radiation in november 2004 the us department of state released report compiled by an interagency group departments of stat energy and defense evaluating the legal and scientific bases of the petition5 the report conclude s that the marshall islands request does not qualif as changed circumstances within the meaning of article ix of the nuclear cl aims settlement agreement acted under title ii section 177 of the compact of free association act of 1985 the report also disputes some key scientific claims of the petition regarding the geographical extent of radioactive fallout radiation dose estimates and the pplicability of us standards to conditions in the rmi consequently according to the bush administration there is legal basis for considering additional payments the administration report further suggests that the radiological health care needs of the rmi as requested in the pe tition are addressed in part through healthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32811crs3 6 compact of free association am endments act of 2003 pl

to the compact of free association6 rmi officials point out however that the petitions requests were not part of the bilateral negotiations to amend the compact and that the compact as amended was not intended to take acc ount of nuclear test compensation claims7 they add that large proportion of the expenditures noted in the administration report suppor ted us government research into the effects of radiation upon human beings and the envir onment and benefitted us interests but did not directly benefit communities affected by the nuclear testing this report analyzes and di scusses several issues related to key personal injury health care and property da mages claims in the petition these include expected radiationrelated illn esses in the marshall islands the methodology for determining the value of lost use of da maged properties th appropriate standa rd of risk annual dose limit for determining cleanup levels nd the extent of radioactive fallout finally this report discusse s possible legal options for the rmi in pursuing nuclear damages claims congressional policy options congress has several policy options regarding the marshall islands request for additional compensation for nucl ear damages these include grant or reject the changed circumstances petitions requests in whole or in part on the basis of the changed circumstances rationale continue congressiona l ad hoc ex gratia payments through department of the interior appropriations measures enact legislation that would provide for full and final settlement of claims allow the federal courts through an amendment to the compact of free association to review the judgments of the nuclear claims tribunal and potentially to order the united states to pay these awards in whole or in part8 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32811crs4 summary of analysis the following sections summarize selected key issues related to the changed circumstances petition these issues are analyzed in depth in subsequent sections of the report the petitions personal injury claims and health care requests are modeled after us programs for compen sating radiationexposed individuals and based upon scientific studies tablishing the areas of th marshall islands in which residents likely have been exposed to dang erous levels of radi oactive contamination national cancer institute nci study discussed below provides support for the need for compensation however as noted below there is some dispute regarding the portion of the rmi population that has b een exposed to radiation from the nuclear weapons tests the petitions request for compensati on to conduct further environmental restoration is based on us envir onmental protection agency epa cleanup standard and the rmi assertion that the contamination is more widespread than previous surveys had found the issue of whether the epas standard should apply to the cleanup of the marshall islands as well as disagreement over the extent of contamination are summarized he re and examined later in the report significant amount of the property claim in the petition is based on the claimants loss of use calculations this report provides an assessment of the methodology employed by the claimants in calculating loss of use testrelated cancer estimates the nci in september 2004 estimated that nuclear testing would result in bout 530 additional life time cancers among the 14000 marshall islands residents exposed to the testing nci also estimated that about 5600 cancers would have occurred in that population without the fallout exposure because the cancers caused by testing cannot be distinguished from cancers that would have occurred anyway all victims of certain types of cancers are being compensated nci estimates that bout half the cancers expected in the exposed population have yet to be diagnose d so additional compensation claims are likely loss of use methodology in general the methodology used by the nct to estimate the value of the lost use of th claimants property is considered to be reasonable and appropriate for several reasons however the specific application of the methodology much of the critical data used many of the assumptions and certain statistical procedures applied ie the sampling technique and the regression model result in past and future lossofuse estimates that appear to be overstated which leads to possibly excessive total damages claimed and awarded by the nct the main problem is with the use of inflated average rents per acre which are estimated by applying an exponential regr ession model to unrep resentative sample data that reflect rmi governmentinfluenced rents rather than competitive free market rents this can lead to an overestimate of not only past lossofuse but because estimated rents is critical variable used as an input into futurelossofuse calculations possible overestimate of future lossofuse as well the methodology also 1 assumes that more land is lost to use and for longer periods than is actually the case 2 unde rvalues the rentals on alternative atoll habitation and 3 assumes that recipients of rental proceeds as consumers andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32811crs5 savers would have sa ved 100 of the rental proceeds each of these assumptions can lead to an overestimate of past loss of use cleanup standards the rmi argues that more recent us radiation protection standard warrants further cleanup in the marsha ll islands however the bush administration contends that the sta ndard applied to past cleanup efforts there remains unchanged and that levels of c ontamination remain safe according to this standard for cleanup purposes the rmi has adopted the standard established by the epa for the cleanup of radio active contamination at s uperfund sites in the united states this standard limits annual ex posure to 15 millirems of radiation above natural background levels from all sources the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla pl 96510 reauthorized by pl 99499 established the superfund program to clean up hazardous waste sites in the united states to degree that would be safe for the intended land use of the site epa issued its 15 millirem standard in 1997 as nonbinding guideline for the cleanup of superfund sites 11 years afte r the 1986 compact with the marshall islands this 15 millirem standard is more stringent and more recent than the 100 millirem standard established by the us department of energy doe that was used to determine the degree of cleanup in past efforts in the marshall islands the rmi argues that the 15 millirem st andard is the sa level of public protection that is provided in the united stat and that it therefore should be applied to the cleanup of the marshall islands ho wever the 15 millirem standard is not an enforceable federal regulation as noted above it is an epa recommended guideline that is applied on casebycase basis depending on the feasibility of attaining it at particular site although there is some precedent for applying the 15 millirem standard to certain nuclear w eapons sites in the united stat such sites generally are cleaned up to does less stringent standa rd of 100 millirems which has been used in the marshall islands for past cleanup as noted above consequently the rmis claim that the 15 millirem standard woul d apply to the cleanup of the marshall islands if it were done in the united states today is not n ecessarily the case the bush administration advocates the tinued use of does 100 millirem standard and argues that further cleanup is not n ecessary citing medical tests indicating that doses of radiation among the popula tion are already below this amount contaminated areas in addition to the issue of whether more recent radiation protection standa rd warrants further clea nup there is disagreement regarding the extent of contamination there have been numerous surveys of radioactive contamination in the marshall islands since nuclear weapons tests ceased residents of the islands have expressed longstanding concern as to whether these surveys have identified all contaminated areas the most exhaustive survey of contamination was performed in 1994 the survey found that the greatest contamination was in the northernmost islands not inhabited at that time and that the level of radioactivity in occupied ar eas was safe the rm i has disagreed with these findings and claims that the extent of contamination and health risks were understated the bush administration suppor ts the findings of the 1994 survey and argues that further cleanup is not warranted to protect the residential population however if some of the more contaminated northern islands are to be resettled or used for agricultural purposes further cleanup could be necessary to prevent the risk of exposure depending on the concentr ation of radioactivity deemed safe

groups inha bitants of the bikini atoll inhabitants of the enewetak atoll and inhabitants of atolls and islands that were not used as atomic test sites the court made sepa rate preliminary findings regarding each of these in the case involving bikini atoll inhabitants the court found that claim of takings in violation of the fifth amendment and of breach of an impliedinfact contract survived motion to dismiss based among other things on statute of limitations bar in the case involving the in habitants of the enewetak atoll it was held that breach of contract claim surviv ed motion to dismiss as did takings claim by the plaintiffs who were t on the bikini or enewetak islands subsequently the compact of free association was implemented between the united states and rmi and the nuclear claims tribunal was estab lished under section 177 of that agreement the court of claims then concluded that it was premature to address the question of whet her this alternative proce dure was adequate to provide compensation for the litigants and so it dismissed the cases the rmi argues that the court decision left open the possibility of further compensation beyond that provided by

that the nuclear tests in addition to rendering the four atolls of bikini enewetak rongelap and utrik uninhabitable or dangerously irradiated caused high incidences of birth defects miscarriage and weakened immune systems as well as high rates of thyroid cervical and breast cancer in addition they contend that more than dozen marshall islands at olls rather than onl four were seriously affected11 other analysts counter that the ex tent of radioactiv fallout was limited to the four northern atolls and that rmi experts overestimate the link between radiogenic illnesses in the marshall

the nuclear claims tribuna l adjudicates claims filed by rmi citizens seeking compensation for personal injuries and prope rty damage suffered as result of the us nuclear tests the tribunal used reca

disease in determining which diseases to included on the list the tribuna l reviewed the findings of the radiation effects research foundation in japan and the us national academy of sciences and sought recommendations from dr robert miller an expert in the field of radiation health effects the tribunal reviews the list of compensa ble diseases each year and considers any new scientific evidence on diseases linke d to exposure to ionizing radiation as result of that review process the list has been amended on several occasions since 1991 and now includes total of 35 medical

ecommended that individua l claims be based on probability of causation pc this method employs formula to determine whether an individuals estimated radiation exposure is likely the cause of his or

by the us government and completed in 1994 the surveys results which were rejected by the nitijela the rmi legislature found that only four atolls bikini enewetak rong elap and to lesser extent rongerik contained unsafe levels of radiation or would require limited remediation or dietary restrictions the administration challenges the rmi assertion of ninefold increase in the biological effects of ionizing radiation beir committees estimates of risk from radiation exposure and contends that behlings estimates of average external doses of radiation are about twice s high as those of

in the marshall islands during the 19461958 period of nuclear sting nci estimated that about 6130 cancers would occur over their lifetimes about 5600 of those cancers would have occurred even if the nuclear tests had not taken place the baseline risk and about 530 were estimated to be cause d by fallout from the tests therefore the nci study estimated that the nuclear testing program would increase the cancer rate for the entire exposed population by bout 9 above the baseline ncis baseline cancer risk estimate was derived from cancer rates for all races adjusted to reflect statistics for ethnic hawaiians estimates of the additional risk posed by the nuclear testing program were based on urine samples collected on two nearby atolls after the largest test br avo wholebody data collected years later and 1995 radiological survey of the entire marshall islands although nci estimates that less than 10 of the projected cancers among the testingexposed population would be caused by the nuclear tests those cancers are indistinguishable from the 90 of cancer s that would have occurred anyway therefore to ensure compensation of the testing victims everyone suffering from the specified types of cancer should be eligible for awards this has been the policy of the nuclear claims tribunal and is simila r to the way persons exposed to nevada nuclear testing are compensated

during testing if eligibility is extended to persons born after the end of the testing period the number of potential additional claims could be far higher assuming baseline cancer rates remain steady loss of use methodology50 the lossofuse methodology which is the same for both the enewetak and bikini claim was develope d by consulting firm under contract for counsel for claimants and the nct which provided many of the estimation parameters and assumptions51 according to the consulting firms report alternative methodologies were explored or used52 the resulting estimates of the dollar value of lossofuse were adjusted and awarded by the nct as damages or reparations to the enewetak and bikini peoples53 the adjusted estimates are also the amounts requested in the changed circumstances petition in general the methodology used by th nct to estimate the value of the lost use of the claimants property is viewed as reasonable and appropr iate for several reasons however the specific application of the methodology much of the critical data used many of the assu mptions and certain statistical procedures applied ie the sampling technique and the regression model result in past and future lossof use estimates that appear to be overstated which could lead to possibly excessive total damages claimed and aw arded by the nct the main problem is with the use of inflated average rents per acre whic h are estimated by applying an exponential regression model to unrepresentative sample data that largely reflect government influenced rents rather than competitive freemarket levels54 this leads to an apparent overestima of not only past lossofuse but because estimated rents is ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32811crs20 55 see also crs report for congress rl33029

assumes that recipients of rental proceeds as consumers and savers would have sa ved 100 of the rental proceeds each of these assumptions overestimates past loss of use alternative methodol ogies or assumptions may have led the nct to different outcome the nct methodology the methodology used by the nct to estimate the value of the lossofuse of lands belong ing to the people of enewetak and bikini attempts to calculate the fair market rental value of those portions of the enewetak and bikini atolls that the people were unable to use as result of their evacuation and use appropriation by the us governme nt according to the nct this rental value represents an estimate of the rents that the us government should have paid but were not fully paid according to the claimants to the atoll residents as proprietors for the use of their land compensation is base d on estimated rental values in lieu of nd asset values because the underlyi ng assumption is that the us government did not take or purchase th land but instead used it with the consequence that the inhabitants were unabl to use it there is generally close mathematical relationship betw een rentals and land values lossofuse includes not only the period when the united states tested the nuclear bombs roughly the period from 1946 to 1958 but the period during which the islands remain unsafe due to co ntinued dangerous vels of radiation contamination which for some of the islands at least is roughly the period from 1958 to 202756 more specifically the estimate of to tal lossofuse is the sum of two components past lossofuse which is th present value of rents that should have been paid from the time of evacuation to the date of the appraisal reports publication and future lossofuse which is the present value of estimated rents from the reports publication dates to that estimated date in the future as described below when the lands are decontaminated and usable in addition as part of the past lossof use estimates the nct also awarded what it called prejudgment interest which is the interest income earned on the original judgements from the time they were determined to the time they were awarded see table 1 description of past lossofuse met hodology for enewetak past loss ofuse consists of the estimated rents on the entire atoll 19526 acres from the onset of evacuation december 21

period from may 17 1996 to may 16 2026 which is the estimated date that the 130578 acres of enewetak atoll will be sufficiently decontaminated to permit its safe use for bikini future lossof use is from november 19 1997 to novemb er 18 2027 which is the estimated date that the bikini islanders will have full use of their atoll once again these dates of return were determined by the nct each years projected rentals again the product of estimated average rents per acre and the projected or assumed lost acreage is discounted at the assumed uniform nominal interest rate of 8 average rents per acre are assumed to start at 4105 for enewetak and 4167 for bikini and to remain constant for each year throughout the forecast period each of these rates is the rate projected in the final year of the past lossofuse estimates as discussed above assessment of the methodology in general the methodology used by the nct to estimate the value of the lost use of the claimants property is viewed as reasonable and appropriate lthough as discussed below the specific assumptions data and statistical procedures can produce inflated lossofuse estimates if there was contract either implied or explicit for the lease of enewetak and bikini atolls which was not ad equately paid for or if th ere was contract if the united states is responsible for the inability of the enewetakians and bikinians to use their land the appropriate methodology would be to estimate the dollar value of that lossofuse or equivalen tly the value of the us governments use this would be the sum of the present compounded rent value of past rents and the present discounted value of projected future rent s as was done in the nct reports these rental values would be the fair market average rents per acre times the relevant acreage for the length of time that it wa s rendered unuseable as result of us government activities indeed the mode l underlying the methodology the capital asset pricing model is rooted in sound economic and financial theory and the methodology itself is standard methodolog used by economists as well as the courts in solving similar problems furthermore the ncts methodology atte mpts to adjust each years estimated rentals owed this might be called the gross rentals for 1 any rentals previously paid by the us government 2 the value of alternative accommodations living arrangements provided and financed by the us government and 3 the interest that would have been earned on these rentals in estimating past lossofuse hundreds of actual lease transactions from two distant atolls in the rmi are sampled to estimate average rents per acre for each year critical variable upon which both past and future lossofuse estimates and therefore the total da mages awarded are based in the estimation of the future lossofuse the methodology appropr iately attempts to estimate the value of such lossofuse as the present discounted value of projected rentals up to the date of return for several reasons however the speci fic application of the methodology much of the critical data used some of the assumptions and certain statistical procedures applied ie the sampling technique and the regression model produce past and future lossofuse estimates that appear to be overstated which leads to possibly excessive total damages claimed and awarded by the nct thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32811crs24 main problem is with the past lossofuse estimates but since these are carried over into future lossofuse calculations those estimates appear to be inflated as well overestimates of past lost use past lossofuse damages appear to be overstated for several reasons first nd foremost the methodology uses inflated estimates of average rents per acre critical variable used as an input into both past and futurelossofuse calculations to estimate average rents per acre the methodology uses nonrandom sample of average rents per acre from lease transactions from distant atolls which may not reflect the rents on enewetak and bikini further the sample rent data largely reflect re nts set by government decree rather than as the equilibrium of s upply and demand for the use of land in competitive real estate market which is the underlying assumption of the type of model used to estimate lossofuse since 1979 the rmi cabinet has established above market rentals on government invol ved leases which represent the vast majority of lease transactions in the rm i on january 1 1979 the official government rental was established at 2500acre on october 1 1989 the rate was increased to 3000acre the official rate is benchmark for all other leases and in effect establishes rent floor for all other lease transactions almost all land and buildings are leased at this official rate during the 1970s average rents which were probably still high due to us governme nt leases averaged 597acre according to the darroch report and 511acre acco rding to the hallstrom report second reason for overstated past losso fuse is that the methodology applies an exponential regression model to the inflat ed average rents sample data data biased by the 2500 nd 3000 per acre official rates in effect the official government rents of 2500 and 3000 per acre for recent ears makes it appear that the overall trend of rents since 1946 is exponential which further compounds the upward bias in the estimated average rents per acre and thus overestimates past lossofuse in reality rents reflect values either agricultural land values or urban land values which fluctuate based primarily on economic circumstances third reason for the upward bias in the lossofuse estimates pertains to the quantity of land that is assumed to be denied the people of enewetak and bikini even though some portions of the affected atolls were completely destroyed or pulverized by the nuclear testing 18246 acr of enewetak 934 of the atolls land acreage and 6967 acres of bikini 369 of the land acreage the methodology assumes that they were not the result is that land that longer exists continues to earn inflated rents at com pound interest through 2026 for enewetak and 2027 for bikini given the equivalency betw een the value of land and the rentals earned on that land the appr opriate methodology would compensate the landowners for the value of the destroyed portions of the two atolls determined at the time of destruction plus interest ch value would be based upon reliable estimates of average rentals that would then be capitaliz ed to determine market value this present value would then be adjusted for the time value of money up to the time that the claim would be awarded fourth the assumption is made that the rental value of alternative properties provided to the claimants by the us government the use gained for these substitute living quarters on ujelang and rongerik is generally only 58 of the average rents times the land area of ujelang in the case of enewetak and either 75 or 58 timeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32811crs25 61 this adjustment is more involved for biki because of the relocation to four different atolls rongerik kili ejit and majuro for di fferent time periods on peracre basis the stay on rongerik and ejit is valued at 100 of the enewetak rents but this was from slightly more than two years from march 7 1946 to march 14 1948 for rongerik for more detail see the memoranda of decisions and order for enewetak and bikini attached to the changed circumstances petition 62 memorandum from jonathan m weisgall to philip okney defender of the fund february 23 1998 63 another possible source of overstatement is in the adjustment for prior lossofuse compensation the bush administration argues that the extent of such prior compensation used in the methodology is greater than is allowed for in the nct reports crs was unable for independently verify this but if so this so would contribute to in flated past lost use valuesthe amount of land on rongerik and kili in the case of bikini61 while the deduction for value of alternative habitation is viewed as fair and appropriate the assumption that the average rentals were fraction of those on the enewetak and bikini atolls is problematic not only does this carry over the upward bias from the prior calculations the estimation of foregone rents on the enewetak and bikini atolls but it is inconsistent with the estimating assumptions per the instructions of claimants counsel and the nct that the methodology will not base value on economic use such as production of c opra or potential for nuclear storage62 also there is evidence that the value of alternative domiciles might have been greater due to the investment of the united states in building houses and other infrastructure the nct methodology also makes some assumptions regarding the timing of denied use in the case of bikini atoll that raises the lossofuse damage estimates in particular it assumes that the bikinian s lossofuse was c ontinuous and there was return on march 7 1946 167 bikini islande rs the inhabitant proprietors were evacuated but some of the bikinians returned to two islands of the atoll bikini and eneu islands from june 1 1969 to july 31 1978 while it is true that they returned to contaminated is land internal c onsistency in the methodology requires that the return be counted as such the implication for the lossofuse estimation is that the rentals on these two occupied islands of th atoll would be lower or zero owing to this contamination and that the value of their stay on lternative atolls should not be deducted from the overall rental finally the methodology to estimate past st use assumes that the lessors of the affected rmi atolls would have invested 100 of the rental proceeds in 30year treasury bonds this assumes that the islande rs would have saved 100 of the rental proceeds more realistic assumption woul d be that they would invest fraction of the rental proceeds equal to the assumed savings rate and that they would have consumed the remainder the amount save d based on this calculation would have been invested or saved in savings account or even in us treasury bonds at some appropriate interest rate63 overestimates of future lost use with respect to future lossofuse crs finds again that the present di scounted value methodology is generally appropriate but that the estimated dollar amounts are inflated or overstated thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32811crs26 64 prepared by david bearden analyst in environmental policyprimary reason that future lossofuse is overstated is that the procedure carries over into the calculation of projected future rents the inflated estimates of average rents per acre from the past lossofuse t hus for enewetak rents for 19972026 are projected to be the same as for 1996 4105acre for bikini rents for 19982027 are the same as for 1997 4167acre the assumption that the enewetakians and bikinians could return to use the vapor ized islands also contributes to this overestimate environmental restoration64 the residents of the marshall islands ve expressed ongoing concern about the adequacy of previous efforts of the united states to clean up radioactive contamination in soil from past nuclear tests scientific data suggest that the type and level of radioactivity in most areas are not likely to pose significant health risk from external exposure to the soil itself internal intake of radioactivity from the consumption of foods grown on contaminated soil could pose higher risk however the health risk from internal consump tion would depend on numerous factors such as the concentration of radioactivity ab sorbed and the amount of time it remains present in the body the degree of such risk to residents of th marshall islands has been uncertain and controversial the republic of the marshall islands rmi asserts that the united states performed prior cleanup according to less st ringent standard than would be required in the united states today it further ar gues that additional cleanup is warranted to meet the current us standard noting the policy of the international atomic energy agency iaea that cleanup of contamin ation caused by another nation should be at least as stringent as cleanup within the country of release the rmi also asserts that the area of contamination is larger th an originally thought and therefore argues that further cleanup is warranted the 1986 compact of free association be tween the united states and the rmi permits the awarding of additional financial compensation because of change in circumstances consequently the rmi pe titioned and the nuclear claims tribunal agreed that the united states should award add itional financial compensation to perform cleanup according to more recent us standard and over broader area than had been addressed with prior efforts however the bush administration argues that federal funding to pay this cla im is not warranted asse rting that radiation protection standards pplied to past cleanup efforts have not become stricter the area of known contamination has not changed and radiation doses are

the nuclear claims tribunal recommended that the united stat pay additional compensation of 2515 million to the people of bikini atoll for environmental restoration of contaminated lands the total estimated cost of the restoration is 3605 million the tribunal agreed to lower amount because of adjustments made from 109 million in compensation already paid by the united states in prior years the tribunal also recommended 917 million in additional comp ensation to the people of enewetak atoll for environmental restoration the tota l estimated cost of th restoration of this atoll is 1017 million the tribunal agreed to 10 million less than this amount again because of adjustments made from compensation already paid by the united states in past years the award decisions for both atolls are based on the estimated costs of 1 removing and replacing some of the contaminated soil 2 disposing of excavated soil by using it as sealed filler to construct causeway between various islands and 3 treating and monitoring the remaining contaminated soil with potassium which in other locations has proven to be effective in blocking th uptake of radioactivity by food crops the rmi reports that

although does general cleanup standard is 100 millirems there is precedent for the department voluntarily agreeing to epas 15 millirem standard for cleanup of contaminated soil on at least two former nuclear weapons production sites hanford in washington state and rocky fl ats in colorado such decisions are made on sitespecific basis as would be the case for the cleanup of contaminated soil in the marshall islands if it were us rritory under the jurisdiction of doe the outcome of such decision is uncerta in and would depend on numerous factors including the extent and cost of cleanup th at would be required to prevent exposure to more stringent degree than the 100 millirem limit that doe prefers consequently it is uncertain whether the 15 millirem standard would be applied to the cleanup of the marshall islands if th cleanup were being done in the united states the extent of cleanup necessary to atta in the 15 millirem standard at hanford and rocky flats likely would be significantly less than in the marshall islands on proportional basis because the land uses at hanford and rocky flats are significantly more restrictive in terms of public access consequently there would be less likelihood of human exposure therefore greater concentration of radioactivity could remain in the soil and still pr event annual exposure from exceeding 15 millirems at these two sites rocky flats will serve as national wildlife refuge with human access limited to refuge personnel nd visitors in certain areas hanford is not planned for unrestricted use but it will continue its

argues that the 100 millirem standard is the level of protection that is generally applicable in the united states and that the united states therefore should not pay for cleaning up the marshall islands to more stringent leve l however the report also acknowledged that there are multiple us federal standards applied to various cleanups that cover wide range of doses but in general they tend to control doses to as far below the 1 msv 100 millirems per year limit as is practical82 both the epa and nrc cleanup standards are more stringent and more recent than the 100 millirem standard that the administration advocates alt hough the nrc standard does not apply to nuclear weapons test sites the epa standard could be pplied to the cleanup of test sites in the united states at does disc retion the state depa rtment report did not explain the administrations rationale for not applying epas stricter standard to the cleanup of the marshall islands in advocating the use of the 100 millirem standard the administration did not present an alternative cost estimate in the state departme nt report to conduct additional environmental cl eanup in the marshall islands presumably an estimate is not provided because the administrati on argues that cleanup is necessary to attain that level of protec tion the administration assert s that medical tests indicate current human doses of radioactive isotope s in the marshall islands typically do not result in internal exposure in excess of15 millirems above local natural background levels these tests measure radioactive ma terial that the human body has absorbed the administration argues that the actual dose of radiation absorbed by those tested does not exceed the 15 millirem standard that the rmi wishes to use for cleanup and is far less than the 100 millir em standard that it reco mmends and concludes that additional remediation in the marshall islands is therefore not necessary disagreement regarding areas of contamination there have been numerous surveys of radioactive contamina tion in the marshall islands since nuclear weapons tests ceased resident s of the islands have expr essed longstanding concern as to whether these surveys have identified all contaminated areas the rmi commissioned the nationwide radiological survey in 1994 wh ich was funded by the united states83 many have noted this survey as being the most comprehensive effort to examine levels of radioactivity in soil on islands potentially affected from past fallout including bikini enew etak rongelap and utrik atollshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32811crs33 84 us department of state report evaluating the request of the government of the republic of the marshall islands op cit p iii 85 ibidthe findings of this survey were that levels of radioactivity rise with increasing latitude identifying the greatest contamination in the northernmost islands based on the surveys findings an independent scie ntific advisory pane l concluded that the level of radioactivity in areas inhabited at that time did not pose significant health risk but that some cleanup likely would be necessary for certain islands if they were to be resettled or if foods grown on them were to be consumed the rmi disagreed with these findings based on criticisms rega rding accuracy completeness of data and credibility of the authors and claimed that more contaminated areas do exist that pose health risk in response the dvisory panel supported the surveys findings which were upheld by sc ientific peer review the rmi continues to dispute the findi ngs of the 1994 survey and asserts that potentially harmful contamination is present across greater area and at lower latitudes warranting further cleanup th rmis petition for compensation for enewetak atoll advocated that more c ontamination surveys are needed to fully identify all areas in need of cleanup to protect the residential population the tribunals compensation decision included 45 million to fund such surveys as part of the estimated cost of nvironmental restoration the tribunals compensation decision for bikini atoll did not specify the costs to perform additional surveys of contamination on those islands the bush administration supports the findings of the 1994 survey and argues that cleanup of broader area is therefore not needed to protect the residents of the islands however the administration appears to base its conclusion on the assumption that unoccupied areas with radioactive contamination would not be resettled the administration has acknowledged that certa in areas in the northern atolls are contaminated to degree that warrants restrictions on land use stating some islands may never be suitable for communities or food gathering and should remain off limits84 at the same time the adminis tration indicated that most historically inhabited islands in the northern atolls c ould be resettled under specific conditions85 however it did not specify what those conditions might be or whether the concentration of radioactivity and potential pathways of exposure were examined to determine if cleanup woul d be necessary to allow resettlement if resettlement in currently unoccupied areas were to occur cleanup may be necessary if the degree of contamination w ould result in annual exposure to radiation in excess of either th 100 millirem or 15 millirem standard depending on the concentration of radioactiv ity and pathway of exposure continuing efforts to understand the human health effects of ra dioactive contamina tion in the marshall islands also possibly could reveal that remediation is necessary to protect the residents in currently occupied areas for example if ongoing medical tests administered by the department of energys lawrence livermore national laboratory were to reveal that radiation doses are higher in currently settled areas than present data suggest decisions could be

dismiss was denied as to the takings claims96 although it was allowed as to all ot her claims of these plaintiffs97 around the time of these rulings the compact of free association was agreed to by the united states and rmi plebis cite approving the agreement was held and joint resolution to implement the compact was passed by congress98 section 177 of the compact provides that the united states accepts responsibility for compensation owing to the citizens of th marshall islands as result of nuclear testing between june 30 1946 and august 18 1958 this section further provides that compensation shall be determined based on separate agreement with rmi pursuant to section 177 this separate agreement between rmi and the united states was negotiated establishing nucl ear claims tribunal to provide for the settlement of nuclear testing claims in conjunction with these provisions however article xii of the section 177 agreement provi ded that 1 all cla ims related to the nuclear testing program shall be terminated 2 court of the united states shall have jurisdiction to entertain claims relating to the nuclear testing program and 3 any such claims pending in the courts of the united states shall be dismissed based on these provisions the united states agai n filed motions to dismiss the various cases this time it argued that the cla ims were now nonjusticiable because they involved po litical question relating to the foreign affairs powers of the united states and because the section 177 agreemen t divested the court of subject matter jurisdiction in response to this motion plaintiffs made number of arguments some of which were rejected by the court of cla ims and subsequently by the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit99 for instance the plaintiffs argued thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32811crs36 99 continued states 859 f2d 1482 fed cir 1988 100 juda v united states 13 cl ct at 683 subsequent to th is decision the united nations security council voted to terminate the trusteeship agreement covering the marshall islands apparently making this argument even less tenable 101 some plaintiffs suggested that the secti on 177 agreement did not have the force of statute of the united states because it was not embodied verbatim in any act of congress and the specific terms were not enacted parately the court of claims however determined that the section 177 agreement had the force and effect of law as section 177 of the compact incorporated the s ection 177 agreement by reference id 102 jennifer joseph pows left in

doctrine of continuous nationality 13 cl continuedwhile the compact had been agreed to by the united states and rmi the united nations had not agreed to terminate the trust relationship between the united states and the trust territories and that the pl aintiffs rights could not be terminated without this approval the court of cl aims however rejected this argument100 various other legal argume nts made by the plainti ff were also rejected101 the court however declined to reach number of other issues one such argument made by the plaintiffs was rela ted to the concept of espousal espousal occurs when the government of one country asserts the private cl aims of its nationals against another sovereign102 in such cases it is established international practice to settle these claims by international agreements here the newly formed rmi appears to have espoused the claims of its citiz ens against the united states for damages from nuclear testing and then settled t hose claims under the section 177 agreement as part of the settlement of the espoused claim rmi agreed to waive the legal rights of its citizens to bring suit in the united states for such damages normally such actions by sovereign would be suffi cient to extinguish claims against another nation however the plaintiffs raised an argument that this waiver was not valid as to them because the injury occurred before the claimants were citizens of rmi103 this argument is called the continuous nati onality rule principle of international law which provides that stat does not have the right to ask another state to pay for damages to its citizens if they were not its citizens at the time of the loss or damage104 the rationale behind this doctrine is to prevent persons from obtaining citizenship in one state in order to us that nations powers of espousal to pursue their claims against another state under this argument rmi lacked the legal capacity to espouse plaintiffs claims and so the claims would not have been settled by the implementation of the compact105httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32811crs37 105 continued ct at 686 106 id finding that pursuing these issues wa s premature until the claims procedures

investorstate investment disputes 36 geo wash intl l rev 783 788 2004 108 it should noted further that the united states and european sometimes invoke the vattelian fiction to defeat this rule arguing that where an injury to an individual can also be construed as an injury to the state then the state can espouse claim to protect its own international rights id at 791this issue was analyzed by the court of claims in considering whether the bikini atoll plaintiffs could continue their law suit the court however distinguished the facts of the cases from that doctrine the issue the court indicated was not whether naturalized citizens could bring claims from forum that they had chosen for their convenience rather the i ssue was whether the inhabitants of an area which was under differing forms of governme nt could be adequa tely represented by the existing government the court indi cated that the question of whether the continuous nationality rule should be pplied to an emerging state seeking to espouse claims arising before its cr eation was novel and unexplored area in international law consequently the court deferred decision on this issue deciding the case on other grounds106 thus if these cases are again pursued it seems likely that this issue would be explored further such an exploration might consider th genesis of the continuous nationality rule the rule is considered to be an outgrowth of the broader international law rule that state may not espouse claim on beha lf of someone who is not its national the continuous nationality rule merely pr ovides that this general rule must be satisfied both at the time of in jury and continuously thereafter107 however it is not clear that the doctrinal basis for this latter rule is strong as regards the instant case first the continuous nationality rule appe ars related to the traditional reluctance of nations to espouse claims of indivi duals with whom they have little or connection that rationale may not be strongly applicable in the instant case as the majority of the injured parties are likely to have been citizens of rmi since that states inception second the doctrine app ears to arise from various restrictive interpretations of bilateral treaties for instance where treaty establishing claims commission did not define when person becomes national it was assumed that the parties intended for that term to be construed narrowly to exclude persons who were not nationals when an injury oc curred here however rmi and the united states clearly intended the espousal speci fied in the compact to extend to the plaintiffs108 consequently it is not clear how court would apply the continuous nationality doctrine to an interpretation of the compact the court also considered the argument that limiting the jurisdiction of the court from considering the plaintiffs case was in violation of the constitution under this argument blanket withdrawal of access to judicial forum deprives plaintiffs of all judicial remedies for violation of their constitutional rights under the fifthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32811crs38 109 see united states v klein 80 us 128 13 wall 1871 lynch v united states 292

in itself gives rise to taking of plaintiffs causes of action in violation of the fifth amendment109 the united states responded however by noting that the tribunal established by the section 177 agreement provided reasonable certain and adequa provision for compensation110 of the taking the court of claims concl uded that in light of the section 177 agreement it was premature to address the above arguments and that the question of whether the alternative procedures pr ovided by congress were ad equate would be dependent upon the amount and type of compensation thus whether the settlement provided adequate compensation could not be dete rmined at that time consequently because the jurisdiction of the court of claims had been withdrawn by the congress the court dismissed the case finally it should be noted that if the pl aintiffs from these cases file suit again it is likely that the united states would argue that the case represented political question and should be resolved by the executive branch not the courts111 the political question doctrine first recognized in marbury v madison112 stands for the tenet that certain political questions are by their nature committed to the political branches and to the exclusion of the judiciary the application of this doctrine in this context however is unclear it is true that the supreme court has made sweeping statements that all questions touching foreign relations are political questions113 however the issue in the instant case does not relate directly to the united statesrelationship to foreign country but rather with the relationship of the united states to persons previously under its stewardship further the issue before the court is not the legitimacy of the compact with rmi but is interpretation 114
