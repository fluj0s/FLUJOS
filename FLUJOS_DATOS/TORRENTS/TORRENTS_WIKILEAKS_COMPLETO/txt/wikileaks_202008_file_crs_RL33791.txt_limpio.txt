whittaker specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division possible indexation of the federal minimum wage evolution of legislative activity summary indexation of the minimum wage linking the minimum wage to an outside economic variable in variety of forms has been subject of discussion at least since the early years of the 20th century when early proponents of wage floor began to consider the matter as public policy within the united states they established series of state wage boards these boards were given the authority to fix reasonable rate below which most workers were not permitted to be paid the powers of the boards varied from one state to the next and where they were reasonably effective there was the constant fear that the courts would intervene and overturn whatever authority the boards may have had the boards wrestled with variety of methods for setting the minimum wage some made surveys of the costofliving for lowwage employees and tried to render measure of equality between such costs however defined and income derived from work but surveys proved difficult and gradually reliance developed upon governmental agencies it was not necessarily neat fit and questions remained in 1938 largely moving beyond the state boards congress passed the fair labor standards act the flsa the act established the federal minimum at 25 cents an hour for those relatively few workers actually covered since 1938 congress has revisited the act in sporadic fashion the result through the years has been series of gradual expansions of the act and some variation in wage rates but generally since the 1960s downward spiral in the real value of the minimum wage has set in during the reagan era new increases were made and only two the 1989 and 1996 amendments have been made in subsequent years at present at least five states missouri montana oregon vermont and washington index their state minimum wage standards in several other states the issue has recently been considered in the 110th congress two bills dealing with indexation have been introduced hr 4637 green and s 2514 clinton the issue was not dealt with in the general minimum wage

19922008 49 possible indexation of the federal minimum wage evolution of legislative activity part i introduction indexation of the minimum wage was considered some years prior to enactment of the fair labor standards act flsa in 1938 it continues to be an issue of discussion and in some cases at the state level has been introduced as part of the general minimum wage structure this report provides an evolutionary history of minimum wage indexation and of the federal legislative interest in the concept in 1937 congress decided that certain lowwage workers should be protected by federal minimum wage law and set in motion initiatives that would evolve into the fair labor standards act of 1938 as amended through the years the flsa has become the primary federal statute dealing with wage rates for lowwage workers as the law now stands the general minimum wage is 585 per hour to increase in steps to 725 per hour by july 2009 the federal minimum is fixed by statute and altered whenever there is sufficient support to do so in congress the result has been fluctuation in the real or inflationadjusted value of the minimum wage it reached its highest level in 1968 and has since intermittently been allowed to decline in value to reach the 1968 level in real terms the current minimum would need to be slightly in excess of 950 per hour1 in order to eliminate fluctuations in its real value some have suggested that the federal minimum should be pegged to an outside economic variable for example to component of the costofliving index or to some other relatively neutral series2 matter of philosophy the concept of minimum wage initially was to provide workers with minimum income but how minimal what might be included within minimal standard to whom should not less than the minimum be paid and by whom 1 see crs report rs20040 inflation and the real minimum wage fact sheet by brian w cashell under the minimum wage structure there are various subminimum rates for example payable to certain youth and student workers to tipped employees and to persons with disabilities 2 for general discussion of this issue see crs report rl30927 the federal minimum wage the issue of indexation by gerald mayer crs2 men it was assumed would need at least the minimum wage to support themselves and their families but what about women especially those with an employed spouse and young persons youth workers are certain types of work by definition minimum wage work deserving payment at the minimum wage or below early in the past century some proposed living family saving wage that is to allow for safe and healthful living for procreation and for setting aside little for ones old age still there were problems with definitions how safe and how healthful how much procreation one child two or perhaps five or six setting aside little for ones old age may be appropriate but how much living wage and basic sustenance john ryan an early proponent of minimum wage argued in 1906 study that laborers right to living wage is the specific form of his generic right to sufficient of the earths products to afford him decent livelihood this right father ryan suggested is as valid as his right to life the difference is merely in degree of importance3 later ryan asked rhetorically well what is decent livelihood4 with other scholars of the period ryan was willing to suggest at least modest framework by way of answer if the concept remained vague and perhaps arguable it involved something more than the necessaries which will enable worker to function effectively as an instrument of production and further that amount of goods which will enable human being to live as human being rather than as an animal even well fed animal it supposes that he shall have food clothing and shelter sufficient to maintain him and his family in health and that they shall have the means of some recreation it means the requisites of religious and moral life it means also some opportunities for intellectual development some reading matter and at least an elementary education for the children in general therefore it comprises an elementary degree of physical mental moral religious social and recreational welfare but then ryan added when the concept is presented in terms of money men naturally differ considerably one from the other and yet whenever the thing has been systematically undertaken men have been able to come to an agreement5 other scholars seemed equally sure differences of opinion may develop over the concrete question of how much in any given case this wage must be observed economist henry r seager in 1918 but the principle that wage sufficient to maintain the wage earner and his family in full economic efficiency will 3 john ryan living wage its ethical and

reconstruction pp 6566 crs3 be denied by one seager declared the living wage is thus an indeterminate but highly important basic standard which all wage adjustment boards should have in mind6 wage boards vs fixed rate in 1890 the consumers league of the city of new york was established and quickly blossomed into the national consumers league7 its general purpose was social uplift through the next several years league representatives began systematic exploration of the plight of lowwage workers attempting to connect an inadequate wage with malnutrition and vice gradually attention came to focus upon the minimum wage in 1911 massachusetts became the first state to move for adoption of minimum rate the campaign then spread to oregon wisconsin minnesota california and other states the experiment was new to the united states though it had been tried elsewhere after considerable discussion wage board approach was taken speaking generally because there were differences among the states and in some states other processes were utilized the board would examine an industry and if it found that significant body of workers was being paid less than what was considered minimal new standard might be adopted in one case massachusetts the penalty was moral suasion publicity concerning the failure to pay minimum wage the purpose of the boards was to increase the general standard and then to maintain the value of the minimum wage at constant level or at least at level in keeping with the costofliving as one advocate stated none of the american boards ever arrived at the intelligent arrangements achieved by some of the british trade boards of pegging the rate at given period by providing for its automatic increase and decrease with variation in the costofliving index number8 nonetheless the costofliving connection was very real presence throughout during the early years of the minimum wage movement there was always the threat that statute would be declared unconstitutional in the spring of 1937 the supreme court ruled in favor of washington state labor standards statute triggering 6 henry r seager labor and other economic essays edited by charles gulick

pp 102106 crs4 new round of minimum wage initiatives9 given the new spirit of the court wagehour legislation was promptly adopted by the senate in the house various versions of the measure moved slowly and only in the summer of 1938 notwithstanding the continuing depression was the fair labor standards act adopted and sent on to the white house pl 75718 in the beginning the flsa adopted both fixed rate basis of calculation and the wage board approach for covered workers relatively few in number mostly industrial workers the basic rate was 25 cents an hour to rise in steps to 40 cents an hour seven years from the date of enactment at the same time in order to reach universal minimum wage of 40 cents an hour as rapidly as is economically feasible without substantially curtailing employment the administrator of the new wagehour board shall from time to time convene an industry committee for each industry where an increase would seem to be justified10 part ii focusing on indexation initial concerns during 1937 and 1938 when the future flsa was under consideration by the congress tensions arose that kept the bill from being enacted in its initial form speaking generally compromise was developed that allowed the several parties to claim victory in the negotiations the northern states would have preferred higher wage 40 cents an hour the south agreed to settle for 25 cents an hour leading up to 40 cents some years later representative mary norton dnj then chair of the committee on labor argued that bill of this kind is very necessary if we are going to help the underpaid workers of our country reduce the relief rolls and spread employment11 house hearings in 1947 in the wake of world war ii given escalating costs of living it seemed to some an appropriate time for expansion of coverage under the act but in precisely what manner and under what mechanism remained unclear 9 west coast hotel v parrish 300 us 379 see john w chambers the big

who had moved on to another assignment returned to testify at the flsa hearings like other witnesses norton cited the difficulties of surviving with wage in 1947 of 40 cents an hour ovie c fisher dtx asked if she were opposed to inflation definitely she replied but then i do not think 65 cents an hour will ever bring about inflation with the present cost of living in this country12 samuel mcconnell jr rpa chair of the subcommittee then turned to ms norton with series of questions concerning motivation frankly mrs norton stated the 65cent minimum that i have selected does not meet with what i think is necessary i simply set that figure because i felt that the congress might consider that rather then 75cent minimum 13 chairman mcconnell queried what would be the factors in your mind that would determine minimumwage rate norton replied first of all the high cost of living the dialogue continued mr mcconnell what kind of cost of living would you consider the cost of living for the entire country or the cost of living in certain section mrs norton it is the cost of living for those people who are unorganized and have other method of having their wages raised mcconnell continued to press for specifics you are definite then in your opinion that the minimum wage is to be based on the cost of living and you will stand by that mrs norton opined yes sir i believe that should definitely be considered mcconnell continued mr mcconnell what i am getting at is i would like to get costof living index and fluctuate the minimum wages to that costofliving index rather than relying on some political drive every so often to change it mrs norton how could you do that it would mean you would have to come to congress every couple of months to decide mr mcconnell not come to congress at all i would set up formula in the nature of ratio that would fluctuate minimumwage rates according to the cost of living if we assume that is the way we are going to fix our minimumwage rates then we would have automatic fluctuations according to the change in the cost of living at different periods mrs norton agreed i would be willing to go along with that mcconnell concurred i am assuming we would set it correctly in the beginning and then there would be an automatic fluctuation according to the cost of living if we are working on the assumption that the minimum wage rate is to be determined by the costof living index or by the cost of living mcconnell stated any way you want to say it that is the way it would be handled then he added i have not stated my 12 us cong house

rate14 senator taft makes suggestion 1949 on april 11 1949 labor secretary maurice tobin was questioned by senator robert taft roh about another kind of escalator clause one which was based on wages on general average wages as determined by the bureau of labor statistics say something like 60 percent15 taft had calculated the impact of 75 cent minimum you might have to vary it in different types of industries he said what would you think of minimum wage based on that theory sixty percent of the average wages in the field i would think you would have to have broad fields tobin queried take for example shoes and establish the minimum taft continued manufacturing and perhaps service industries and perhaps mining that might be separate but roughly speaking i think you probably would not need mining what would you think of such plan it seems to that is what we want to do we want to say that anybody in an industry ought to be able to make certain percentage of the average even though he is inefficient or the industry is inefficient or anything else and 60 percent roughly speaking seems to be the present thing in the manufacturing field what would you think of such an escalator clause taft may have caught tobin offguard secretary tobin i would like to illustrate by taking for example the breakdown of any given classification of skill take shoes there is great wide range of minimum wages for shoe cutters over the country you get breakdown of mens work shoes highgrade finished shoes et cetera senator taft we have this legislative problem we have 75cent figure here is 40cent figure when it once gets into the law it is pretty much frozen you have these variations in your industries that is all right however as basic figure in the law instead of having to change the amount every other year to fit into changing conditions could we not find formula based on the average wages paid to all american workers or something of that kind secretary tobin i would want to consider that i couldnt give you an answer immediately senator taft i wish you would because i think it is possible legislative out here secretary tobin under such an arrangement you would take the factory wage which is roughly around 55 week at the present time rather the 14 house hearings 1947 pp 4750 15 us cong senate fair labor standards act amendments of 1949 hearings before subcommittee of the

party this discussion and tafts suggestion has frequently been cited by subsequent proponents of indexation crs7 average factory wage is 138 an hour 60 percent of that would come out to 824 cents an hour senator taft that is factory service would be somewhat lower secretary tobin service employees would be substantially lower senator taft urged the secretary to think it over and to give us your views on it later tobin agreed that he would do so taft concluded that the average wage cost was more appropriate than the cost of living16 reports and amendments 1949 there has been advised representative brooks hays dar in 1949 considerable interest in the socalled flexibility feature of the minimumwage legislation he noted the dispute as to whether the appropriate minima was 75 cents or 65 cents or some other amount but he added in any event it seems to that it should be governed by the cost of living hays continued if we had had such provision ie cost of living formulation when the 1938 act was adopted we would now have minimum of around 54 cents on one formula or 65 cents on another formula and we would be spared this unfortunate controversy as to whether or not it is to go to 75 cents he then turned to study by gustav peck of the legislative reference service now crs the question of flexible statutory minimum wage peck hays stated has assembled all of the arguments pro and for tying the minimum wage to the cost of living index he suggested that pecks study would be of particular interest to members who favor the principle of flexibility in minimumwage legislation17 the peck report characteristic of all wages in progressive society is their flexibility peck commenced wages go up and down at different times in response to changes in the labor market situation to changes in productivity and job content to relative bargaining power to cyclical influences and to changes in the cost of living peck continued rise or fall in the cost of living changes the substance of statutory minimum wage more than such rise or fall affects other wages because contract or competitive wages generally reflect changes in the cost of living while legal minimum wage can not be changed at all except by action of the legislature or in the case of wageboard determinations only after timeconsuming procedures18 congress had resisted attempts to raise the minimum wage and even during the 79th and 80th congresses postwar congresses efforts to raise the 40cent minimum 16 senate hearings 1949 pp 4647 17 congressional record august 3 1949 p 10691 18 gustav peck the question of flexible statutory minimum wage library of congress legislative reference service bulletin 73 july 1949 p 3 cited hereafter as peck the question crs8 died of inaction19 labor spokesmen had sought flexibility but always upward first they called for general revision of the minimum to make the act more realistic second they proposed insertion of an escalator in any new law20 arguments in support of revision of the minimum wage he stated include increases in the cost of living increases in actual minimum wages in industry increases in profits and ability to pay and general increases in productivity generally the costofliving was regarded as the most important determinant of proper statutory minimum further some argued if prices should decline then there should be some provision in any new act to reduce the minimum wage with reductions in prices and the cost of living or reductions in average wages21 under the 1938 statute limited wage board had been created22 some argued however that board might not be able to move any more quickly than congress to increase the minimum wage for board there would likely be delay of recognition of changed situation delay of factfinding and hearings and delay of issuing revised orders thus throughout the late 1930s and during the war years the problem of statutory minimum wages remained one of catching up with the realities of increasing prices and the cost of living peck continued the wage board technique at least as employed in the states is not complete answer to the flexibility problem because these laws were written with the express intent of raising minimum wages above the levels then being paid even though it might be possible under the terms of some of the laws to make findings which would require downward adjustments of the minimum wage such adjustments have ever been made23 inflexible costs he stated could produce contraction of industry and employment and end in the midst of real depression24 he seemed to suggest that if wage rates could move either up or down real flexibility then indexation might be worth trying so long as the timing was right and changes in the rate were not precipitous25

all but puerto rico the virgin islands and most other offshore dependencies but that was not clear when peck wrote 23 peck the question pp 1011 24 peck the question pp 1516 25 peck notes the question p 18 that frequently changing minimum wage is very difficult to administer that it takes time to get across to all employers what their obligations are could make compliance and enforcement more difficult crs9 the lucas amendment on april 14 1949 representative wingate lucas dtx introduced new minimum wage bill which contained the haysmcconnell flexible minimum which he stated was splendid concept26 as the summer wore on lucas presented series of brief statements on the floor promoting the flexible minimum wage bill he explained it ties minimum wages in our law to the cost of living index so that wages will go up in time of inflation and go down in time of deflation there will be stabilized employment it is the best answer i have ever heard for legal equitable and fair minimum wage lucas drew attention to the peck study and urged members to get copy and read it27 he hoped others would be as enthusiastic about this plan as i am28 debate began on august 8 lucas stated if the employee can receive sufficient funds for his labor to provide him with rudimentary standards of decency we will have reached our objective29 representative adolph sabath dil challenged the great stress that lucas has placed on the slidingscale provision of his proposed substitute which would mean nothing but uncertainty and confusion30 at this point lucas introduced his substitute which among other things provided for minimum wage of 65 cents an hour with indexation to follow31 there seemed dispute among constituencies all employee groups so far as i know favor the fixed rather than the flexible minimum stated representative kenneth keating rny so far as i remember not single employer has voiced preference for the sliding minimum32 representative jacob javits rny was similarly disposed when we are fixing minimum wage and concrete floor it must be fixed figure and it should not vary with the costofliving index33 representative charles bennett dfl was in some measure prescient he stated that he had quarrel with the amount of 75 cents an hour but urged certain safeguards first some arrangement would be needed for an exemption for small and marginal businesses second there should be regional basis of arriving at 26 congressional record april 14 1949 p 4627 27 congressional record july 27 1949 p 10289 28 congressional record august 5 1949 p 10844 29

for moderateincome families in large cities lucas added to his amendment that in event shall the minimum hourly wage prescribed by the administrator be less than 50 cents an hour 32 congressional record august 10 1949 p 11197 see industry comments in the section on the ellender amendment below 33 congressional record august 10 1949 p 11204 crs10 minimum wages for it is clear that the cost of living varies greatly between various sections of our country third the minimum wage would need to be tied to costofliving formula bennett continued i strongly favor the principle of tying the minimum wage to the costofliving formula which principle is found in the lucas bill now before us34 through complex parliamentary maneuver bill by representative john lesinski dmi was substituted for the text of the lucas bill and was adopted by the house in the process the flexible minimum wage provision was defeated35 the ellender amendment 1949 senator allen ellender dla proposed his own addition to lucaslesinski debate36 elected to the senate in 1936 he recalled the turbulence that had marked the depression era and the war years and observed the fact is that 10 years of experience under the flsa are virtually worthless as measuring stick of the probable effects of increasing the present wage minimum37 ellender stated that we proceed with the utmost caution and circumspection lest our actions produce decline in employment prices and production and plunge the nation into recession or major depression38 on august 31 1949 with some caution ellender proposed indexation of the federal minimum wage using variation on the consumer price index he urged an increase of the minimum wage then still 40 cents an hour to 65 cents an hour but with ban of flexibility built into its future calculation he added that in event shall the minimum hourly wage prescribed by the administrator be less than 55 cents an hour nor in excess of 75 cents an hour39 ellenders introductory speech seemed at odds with the thrust of his proposal he explained the ripple effect the impact of the minimum wage on other wage differentials and reviewed the southern case against the minimum wage he had reached the 65 cent level he stated because had the original 40 cent figure been indexed that 40cent minimum would be about equivalent to 66cent minimum today40 ellender stated that proposed changes have been considered by at least three congresses and as yet change has been effected the legislative process he stated is too slow and too cumbersome for many of the same reasons he objected to wage board procedures for effecting changes in statutory wage minima 34 congressional record august 10 1949 p 11205 35 see congressional quarterly news features congressional quarterly almanac 81st congress 1st session 1949 pp

senator ellender used the consumer price index for moderateincome families in large cities 40 congressional record august 31 1949 p 12539 ellender stated but instead of making it 66 cents the proponents of the pending bill want to increase it to 75 cents crs11 ellender critiqued various indexes and then concluded that the consumers price index for moderateincome families is appropriate feasible and practicable41 ellender read into the record testimony that seemed to endorse an upordown principle of escalation for example jack garrett scott general counsel of the national associations of motor bus operators we urge that serious consideration be given to statutory plan whereby the minimum wage is geared to living costs both upward and downward based upon indices of the bureau of labor statistics and subject to change each year by the administrator according to the costofliving figures compiled and presented by that bureau italics added howard b carlisle jr the american cotton manufacturers association was cited during other distressed periods we reduced wages but many mills managed to keep going the workers accepted these reductions because they preferred wage cuts to unemployment but with high minimum wage the mills cannot meet conditions realistically if hard times come they will have to shut down and throw their men out of work finally the views of donald kirkpatrick general counsel for the american farm bureau federation were added to the record the afbf he stated has directed its executive officers to oppose without compromise any increase in the maximum basic wage that is not tied to costofliving index using the existing minimumwage base would under flexible formula substantially increase the basic minimum wage under our proposal if the costofliving index goes up or down then the basic minimum wage would be adjusted accordingly by the administrator under formula provided in the law the american farm bureau federation believes this to be sensible and sound in approach one that will not straitjacket our economy italics added in summing up senator ellender argued that his plan was the only sensible one to be adopted there must be flexibility in respect to any wage law enacted42 see table 1 for the rates of change over the years others disagreed notably senator taft taft thought 75 cents an hour is reasonable minimum wage but suggested that some form of indexation might be studied as basis for minimum wages in the future we have had expert advice on the subject he continued personally i feel that the cost of living is not the proper basis for determining wages the cost of living has always seemed to to be an uncertain factor it affects people in different ways the cost of living for man without family is about half of the cost of living for family of four taft 41 congressional record august 31 1949 pp 1254012541 ellender placed in the record extensive evaluation of the consumer price index under the ellender proposal indexation would permit rise or fall in tandem with the cpi 42 congressional record august 31 1949 p 12553 crs12 added if there is sliding scale i should prefer to see it related to the general wage level in the united states rather than to the cost of living43 on the ellender amendment the vote was 26 yeas to 51 nays nineteen members not voting44 as soon as the vote was announced the senator reintroduced new amendment which was identical with the one just voted upon except that instead of fixing the minimum at 65 cents it is fixed at 70 cents once more the amendment lost 25 yeas to 51 nays twenty members not voting45 but in 1949 the minimum wage was raised to 75 cents an hour see table 1 below for the various minimum wage flsa enactments from 1938 through 1997 table 1

was coming out of the great depression and just as it was about to enter world war ii though it appears to have had little disruptive impact the circumstances may not have been ideal for test the 1949 amendments may have been similarly obscured by the war in korea thus as congress considered new legislation that would adjust the minimum wage it seems to have done so with some measure of circumspection the 1955 flsa amendments in the 84th congress members were confronted with range of exemptions exceptions and potential for significant flsa expansion but according to representative graham barden dnc then chairman the committee unanimously decided to consider two items at this time the rate of the hourly wage and the date that an increase should become effective46 senator paul douglas dil reported the measure s 2168 in proposing 100 an hour minimum wage the eisenhower administration had asked for 90 cents two factors were of influence he stated the increase in the cost of living and the increase in productivity taking these increases into account he stated the minimum wage should be raised to just over 100 an hour douglas explained in times past the fair labor standards act has suffered and perhaps it suffers at this moment from the fact that revisions are made sporadically the last increase was postponed from 1944 to 1949 therefore instead of gradual increase jump was then made from 40 cents to 75 cents douglas sought rate not too severe for many industries and many firms to absorb and urged new method of easier transition to higher schedules in the future rather than index the wage rate per he proposed writing into dols reporting requirements mandate that the secretary make recommendations as to any changes which may have occurred in the cost of living changes in productivity changes in the levels of wages and manufacturing the recommendations he stated will make it possible for congress to act more quickly in the future47 the measure was promptly adopted with action now moving to the other chamber in the house minimum wage legislation was called up on july 19 and 20 1955 representative samuel mcconnell rpa see the 1947 debates

concerns following two days of debate the house passed stripped down standalone 100 minimum wage increase 362 ayes to 54 nays sending the bill back to the senate49 ultimately the bill was adopted pl 84381 the 1960s and early 1970s the 1949 and 1955 amendments to the flsa had been contentious but relatively uncomplicated the 1961 amendments extended the minimumwage and with some exceptions the overtime provisions of the act to an estimated 3624000 additional workers50 in 1966 the flsa extended coverage to 91 million workers not previously covered by the minimum wage51 in 1974 new legislation brought approximately 7 million employees including domestics under coverage52 as result of the three enactments the minimum wage moved from 100 per hour to 230 per hour the latter taking effect in january 1976 through the years following enactment of the flsa as noted above indexation had been moreorless reoccurring theme but the issue does not appear to have come up in sustained

1975 representative john dent dpa chair of the subcommittee on labor standards introduced hr 10130 bill that would have increased the minimum wage in steps to 300 per hour thereafter an indexation formula based upon the consumer price index or cpi would take effect53 noting the increase in the cost ofliving the aflcios andrew biemiller agreed some such escalator provision is essential if we are to maintain the purchasing power of the minimum wage54 john erlenborn ril the ranking member opposed indexation you talk about inflation and the loss of purchasing power of the dollar and need to index the minimum wage so we can have automatic increases in it he chided biemiller when it is the wage demands of the people you represent that caused good deal of the inflation that we are experiencing so he continued having caused the problem you now come here and seek relief from it55 the hearing proceeds in some respects organized labor appearing as the lead witness set the stage for events that would follow much of the subsequent testimony represented business perspective robert thompson speaking for the chamber of commerce decried indexation as the most harmful and fiscally unsound provision of the bill he asserted that general application of an automatic costofliving escalator to minimum wage rates would greatly exacerbate the inflationary process thompson noted the upward flexibility of the bill and protested its impact for training and other costs of doing business if indexation were agreed to he suggested mechanism more suitable than the cpi should be used56 we think that tying the minimum wage to the consumer price index will not only increase unemployment but will feed the fires of inflation like nothing this congress has ever done57 53 us cong house

equally firm carl madden chief economist for the chamber termed indexing genuinely terrifying to me58 indexing would be dangerous precedent stated donald white american retail federation adding momentum to the vicious cycle of inflation59 carl beck of the national small business association argued that the cpi was an inexact instrument through which to measure relative wage rates and cited julius shiskin of bls as his source i would suggest you contact mr shiskin because he feels very strongly about it60 using the cpi as determinant in wage adjustments under the minimum wage stated james mclamore national restaurant association nra would represent fundamental change in national policy61 nra opposed the concept removing any necessity for congress to periodically examine minimum wage rates would deny the existing opportunity for periodic examination of the relationship between wages and inflation and remove an important warning signal on the road to even higher inflation mclamore pointed to merit systems such recognition is important to any increase in productivity we believe that making increases in the minimum wage automatic with increases in the cpi he stated would soon destroy any merit increase system or place it beyond the means of most employers like others from industry mclamore urged that congress should not abdicate the important responsibility of weighing the many factors not reflected in the cpi62 abraham weiss then an assistant secretary of labor presented perhaps the most extensive comment on indexation during the 1975 hearings and much of it negative63 dent recognized the nature of dols comment and observed that he was not tied to this particular bill 64 but the congressman added i sincerely believe there has to be some mechanism other than periodic legislative enactments if it is intended to put floor under wages so that worker in that particular category would not be forced to rely on food stamps and welfare payments65 58 house

are scheduled for next year crs17 subsequent comment with the close of the formal hearings various submissions were made for the record here there seems to have been considerable interest in indexation the amalgamated clothing workers of america aflcio suggested one of the problems with the flsa has been that the rates could not be adjusted for some time after they had become obsolete the union urged greater flexibility and suggested that an escalator provision will provide this but indicated that indexation would not obviate the necessity of revising the basic rate it seemed to suggest shift from the minimum wage per to the ratemechanism for its increase66 the associated general contractors of america the agc an industry group took an opposite approach describing indexation as neither new or good and as businessmen we find the proposal unbelievable indexing the agc argued legislates inflation and makes it permanent67 the farm bureau scorned indexation as the most radical and farreaching provision of the bill and totally unacceptable68 while robert w hite associated with mr steak inc denver termed the bill illadvised poorly conceived and fiscally irresponsible69 further action yet one additional year had to run on the 1974 amendments new increase in the minimum wage may not have seemed timely and in september 1976 congressman dent announced plans to hold back his bill until the 95th congress 1977 when there would be more time to consider all aspects of the legislation70 66 house hearings 1975 p 205 67 house hearings 1975 pp 209210 see sol chaikins comments

be added hearings in the house 1977 with the opening of the hearings in the house march 9 1977 the first witness was andrew j biemiller of the aflcio biemiller was followed by series of industry witnesses and ultimately by the new labor secretary ray marshall the opening witnesses biemiller had come directly from meeting of the aflcios executive council in reporting the views of the council he stated the congress should act immediately to increase the federal minimum wage to 3 an hour and include an automatic mechanism in the law to thereafter maintain the wage floor at 60 percent of average hourly earnings in manufacturing71 italics added the executive councils projection to 300 per hour immediately followed by indexation at 60 may have been unduly optimistic biemiller affirmed that indexation because such wages would be quickly spent of necessity would boost the economy there should be youth subminimum wage as to the alleged disemployment impact of the minimum wage he stated we point to the record the several secretaries of labor had not suggested such result indeed their reports have shown substantial benefits and only rare isolated instances of adverse effects involving few small firms and very few employees72 as at prior hearings battery of industry witnesses followed biemiller and proceeded to offer refutation use of manufacturing wages for indexing would add especially to inflation because manufacturing wages have increased faster than average wages during the last 10 years stated jack carlson chief economist for the 71 us congress house committee on education and labor subcommittee on labor standards hearing fair labor standards amendments of 1977 95th cong 1st sess march 9 16 and 24 1977 p 6 hereafter cited as house hearings 1977 under the dent bill the indexation formula would begin at 55 of the average hourly earnings on manufacturing payrolls and expand year later to 60 of average hourly earnings on such payrolls biemiller former member of congress from wisconsin in support of indexation p 9 recalled that an automatic escalator device was proposed by thensenator taft in the course of the debate on the fair labor standards amendments as long ago as 1949 in fact he asked secretary of labor tobin his reaction to setting minimum wages at 60 percent of average wages in manufacturing senator taft may have been ahead of his time but the aflcio agrees with you that this is an idea whose time has certainly come 72 house hearings 1977 pp 69 crs19 chamber of commerce73 john hutchens president united states industrial council argued that indexing the minimum wage to 60 percent of average hourly earnings in manufacturing would result in neverending inflationary spiral74 similarly patrick omalley of the national restaurant association viewed adoption of indexation as major step toward adopting indexing as our national policy75 dent had taken into account the economic impact of indexation and for the purposes of the hearings had secured panel of research economists generally knowledgeable about the field their views if somewhat negative were diverse76 dents views were more pragmatic the minimum wage has always been catchup by the time an increase is passed it brings people back to even he said it is just question of doing nothing doing something or doing too much in between is where i would like to be77 secretary marshall speaks for the administration the new secretary of labor in the carter cabinet ray marshall was an economist marshall began with an analysis of the pending dent bill we have carefully reviewed this proposal and believe that in light of current economic conditions somewhat different approach is warranted at this time accordingly the administration proposes an increase in the minimum wage to 250 per hour for all covered workers on july 1 1977 we propose an annual indexing of the minimum wage beginning on july 1 1978 at rate equal to 50 percent of straight time hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers in manufacturing the administrations proposal would provide for regular minimum wage increases on yearly basis he stated it would eliminate the irregular pattern which has characterized the history of minimum wage adjustments and would enable the business community to more accurately anticipate and adjust its wage costs by providing increases at regularly established intervals indexation would reduce erosion of the real income of recipients noting that indexation represents major 73 house hearings 1977 p 309 74 house hearings 1977 p 393 75 house hearings 1977 p 373 76 finis welch of ucla and william dunkelberg of purdue university seemed more generally opposed to indexation edward gramlich the university of michigan was more favorably inclined but ambivalent the main question gramlich stated is whether the nations interests are best served by having congress reconsider minimum wage legislation every two or three years or by indexing the minimum so as to eliminate the need for periodic action for his part he seemed to favor having congress reconsider the policy every few years armed with whatever new evidence or political views have accumulated in the meantimehouse hearings 1977 p 236 see also ibid pp 97 and 199 dunkelberg was also spokesperson for the national federation of independent business 77 house hearings 1977 p 414 crs20 departure from previous methods of adjusting the minimum wage marshall urged that the issue be studied with report made to the congress78 dents reply was immediate your proposals are quite different than what this congress had hoped for in new minimum wage law however he added the committee will as it always does give it very serious consideration finally i have questions to ask79 representative erlenborn queried you endorse the concept of indexing on behalf of the administration would i be wrong in interpreting that statement to indicate that you are reflecting an inflationary psychology in this administration that it would tie this to an index and might this become way of life that we must anticipate the secretary responded sir it would not80 others were equally critical representative joseph gaydos dpa taking note of the secretarys widely ranging interests in humane concerns asked if he had any problems in drastically reducing and suspending an increase in minimum wage marshall responded it seems to we are recommending diminution in the minimum wage it is lower increase than others would recommend here but the basic idea of having minimum standard is there gaydos replied that i am disappointed i am grossly disappointed with the position that the department takes in this matter81 representative phillip burton dca added i do hope that you do not personally believe that this is an adequate treatment of the problem82 congressman dent stated senator taft advised that we ought to put minimum wage on permanent increment base and we ought to do it with 60 percent based on the average hourly increase in manufacture at that rate the minimum today would be about 336 per hour dent added it is very difficult to conceive how the economists of this administration could sit down and come up with this recommendation which is so far out of line83 hearings in the senate 1977 the senate hearings began on july 28 1977 on s 1871 coauthored by senator harrison williams dnj and jacob javits rny the bill would have raised the minimum wage to 265 an hour in january 1978 and would thereafter have indexed it reaching 53 percent of the average hourly earnings formula ahe84 78

workers and their families who must spend everything they earn merely to get by senator williams stated feel its effects much more sharply than other workers in our society85 senator javits reluctantly concurred normally he stated he had been opposed to indexing as means for fighting inflation but we find that many collective bargaining agreements are indexed social security is indexed and many veterans benefits are indexed i do not see how we can avoid it in this situation senator javits added it offers the advantage to employers of regular predictable wage rate adjustments86 secretary marshall speaks for the administration marshall was the lead witness there was considerable disagreement over our initial approach marshall stated since then the administration had discussed the issue with members of congress labor and industry groups and the president has agreed with the minimum wage proposal which is now included in your bill and in the bill moving through the house of representatives87 indexation marshall suggested was an important aspect of this bill it would protect minimumwage workers and enable employers to plan and to anticipate adjustments to their pay systems88 later javits questioned why the particular pattern for indexation had been chosen was this an eclectic choice marshall replied the reason that we use the straight time hourly earnings in manufacturing is that it is better statistical measure it is uninfluenced by lot of extraneous factors and it gets less feedback from the minimum wage process itself89 the hearings continue pro and hearings in the senate were extensive following the initial statement from the administration there appeared series of witnesses representing labor and industry and simply individuals general views of labor and industry in early 1977 aflcio president george meany recalled the aflcio executive council urged the congress to increase the minimum wage to 3 an hour and to include an automatic mechanism in the act which would maintain the minimum wage at 60 percent of average hourly earnings in manufacturing that recommendation he stated was and is fair and reasonable meany continued that under the current system minimum wage workers sink further into poverty and the real value of their wage is eroded the putative value of 265 an hour is less than we would like but the prospect of bringing the

senate hearings 1977 pp 2829 on pages 5764 of the hearings transcript there appear statistical comparisons of various methodologies for indexing the minimum wage crs22 minimum wage above the poverty level in the early 1980s and indexing thereafter will be guaranteeing the lowwage worker realistic wage floor that will keep pace with general wage trends in the economy90 robert thompson again spoke for the chamber of commerce he argued that the most dangerous and damaging part of the proposed legislation was the indexation formula thompson stated that the bill was bad economic policy with robotlike mechanism that fails to take into consideration the underlying cost push problems in our economy and furthermore treats inflation as if it were permanent part of our economy he chided it is the responsibility of congress to review periodically the minimum wage law and relate it to the state of the economy an indexed minimum wage would represent congressional abdication 91 harwell proffitt associated with proffitts department store alcoa tennessee proposed study to my knowledge there has never been detailed study undertaken to determine the likely economic social and political impact of indexing the minimum wage indexing he stated has simply been offered as supposedly painless alternative to the recurring headache of deciding whether an increase in the minimum wage is warranted92 richard wood the national association of convenience stores agreed retailing strongly believes that the bill should provide for the establishment of presidential blue ribbon study commission93 views from the economic community the senate hearings at mid session were given over to select economists two panels testified one of generally liberal economists and second generally more conservative robert r nathan consulting economist was chairman the national consumers league nathan explained the economics and purchasing power of the minimum wage and observed that he would strongly favor the indexing provision because it does seem to appropriate for the minimum wage level to take into consideration improvement factors in our economy94 in his prepared statement nathan observed that indexation has been adopted in government and business to cover large proportion of wage and salary workers certainly he stated the most poorly paid american workers are entitled to at least as much protection from wage erosion as the more highly paid workers95 90 senate hearings 1977 pp 9495 91 senate hearings 1977 pp 141143 92 senate hearings 1977 p 189 proffitt suggested p 191 that we can be sure if indexing is adopted there will be continued political pressure to raise the percentage of average manufacturing earnings from 53 percent to some higher figure to include overtime earnings and fringe benefits in the measure of average manufacturing earnings et cetera 93 senate hearings 1977 p 204 see also the statement of donald f white american retail federation pp

the flsa citing other economists he suggested that there was still virtually reliable quantitative work on the minimum wage one of the difficulties he stated with respect to most of the studies is that they are based upon macroeconomic data and that heroic assumptions are necessary in order to distill out the effects of economic developments that are occurring simultaneously in the interim he stated about all we can do is to make some tentative observations based upon reading of our past experience and to put in reminder that for 40 years the fair labor standards act has been of considerable benefit to many of the lowest paid in our society without having had any apparently harmful effects on the economy galenson was not partisan of the general concept of wage indexing it has led to many difficulties in countries that have practiced it for long periods but he observed it is fact that great many american workers now enjoy indexing by collective agreement and if any group in society needs this kind of protection it is the low paid many if not most of them are not unionized and do not have collective bargaining machinery to prevent the erosion of their real incomes96 sar levitan george washington university followed levitan stated that he supported the concept which will help prevent the erosion of minimumwage protection in the face of future inflation and other wage increases however he stated i believe the index should be set at 50 percent of the average manufacturing wage more than 50 percent should not be attempted until we realize tight labor markets the bill in question is workable compromise and whatever reservations i have about indexing above 50 percent i support the bill he said97 second panel of economists followed automation escalation sic compounds the problems of the minimum wage law argued thomas sowell of the hoover institution by making it possible to close our eyes to its effects hereafter this seems he advised unconscionable when those affected are poor vulnerable powerless and inarticulate he added if the congress does not monitor what happens to them there is other powerful institution to do so the set of incentives confronting the us department of labor makes it unrealistic to expect it to critically evaluate minimum wage effects and nearly 40 years of history makes it painfully apparent that it has intention of doing so sowell stated the need for critical evaluation of the minimum wage and noted my hope would be that some way might be considered to have the statistical analysis 96 senate hearings 1977 pp 429431 97 senate hearings 1977 pp 431432 crs24 of minimum wage effects performed by some organization other than the agency whose own fate is intertwined with that of the fair labor standards act98 marvin kosters associated with the american enterprise institute tended to focus upon the youth subminimum wage and upon the more generalized impact of wage rates on unemployment he suggested that indexation might cause congress simply to set aside any further oversight of minimum wage issues i believe that the opportunity for the congress to periodically reassess minimum wage policy should be retained so that new research results and experience can be taken into account he suggested that establishing fixed increments is preferable to indexation because it more readily permits reassessment and revision of minimum wage policies in light of new information and experience99 like kosters walter williams of temple university tended to focus upon the youth subminimum wage100 indexing the minimum wage will reinforce the unemployment effect of the rise in the minimum wage he stated one hope against the predicted large increase in youth unemployment should the proposed amendment pass is the inclusion of significant youth differential101 otherwise williams was silent on indexation in his testimony before the committee legislation is considered on september 1415 1977 minimum wage legislation was considered by the house senate consideration of the measure would take place on october 67 1977 debated in the house representative phillip burton called up the minimum wage measure hr 3744 sharing time with representative erlenborn each of whom would play critical role in subsequent debate102 representative carl perkins dky chair committee on education and labor introduced the bill as reported it would have raised the federal minimum wage to 265 per hour after january 1 1978 followed by indexation the indexation formula perkins explained had been conservatively drawn overtime or incentive pay fringe benefits and sixmonth lag between calculation and implementation103 erlenborn stated that he would offer an amendment on indexation the bill substitutes mindless thoughtless rule for the good judgement our constituents have right to expect from us he continued 98 senate hearings 1977 pp 453457 99 senate hearings 1977 p 460 100 senate hearings 1977 pp 492494 101 senate hearings 1977 p

conditions the rate of unemployment the rate of inflation and other factors in the economy and then deciding whether and how much the minimum wage should be increased the concept of this bill is to substitute an indexing formula that will ever drive the minimum wage up enactment of the bill will signal surrender by the congress to inflation as way of life erlenborn proposed series of step increases104 representative quie in support of the bill explained the various technical aspects of indexation he argued that the bill was not mindless exercise because what we are doing is tying the minimum wage to forces in the economy management labor and manufacturing he concluded i believe that that would be far wiser route for us than to operate in the way we have operated in the past105 on september 15 1977 the first item was indexation erlenborn proposed as substitute for the reported language 1 not less than 265 an hour during the year beginning january 1 1978 not less than 285 an hour during the year beginning january 1 1979 and not less than 305 an hour after december 31 1979 except as otherwise provided in this section indexation would thus be removed erlenborn affirmed i do not think that this congress can afford economically or politically to say that we are ready to guarantee rates of inflation as high as we now experience and rates of inflation that will probably rise ever higher106 recorded vote on the erlenborn amendment resulted in 223 ayes to 193 nays stripping indexation from the bill107 once the vote had been tallied representative perkins proposed an amendment creating minimum wage study commission one portion read c the economic consequences if any of authorizing an automatic increase in the rate prescribed in that act the flsa on the basis of an increase in an index of the earnings of category of employees perkins had been member since 1949 when we increased the minimum wage from 40 to 75 cents we have increased it at various times up to 230

debate continued through october 7 1977 the committee on human resources had produced bill with an indexation formula but it was promptly jettisoned by the sponsors williams and javits once it came to the floor111 the indexation formula was said to have been reasonable and important step however williams stated in light of the concerns which have been expressed i am proposing to forego the establishment of indexing for the minimum wage at least for the next few years112 senator orrin hatch rut commended the sponsors for withdrawing the indexing provision of the original bill i think he stated it is very wise and judicious decision 113 john tower rtx was more critical what has been done through the javitswilliams concession he suggested is to achieve the result without the formula it

wage study commission mwsc among the mandates given to the commission was to explore the economic consequences if any of indexation the mwsc would have 36 months in which to prepare and to transmit report to the president and to the congress with legislative recommendations115 the commission reviewed the various aspects of the minimum wage produced seven volume report and ceased to exist in 1981 the cost of the commission was reported to have been 17 million116 former congressman james ohara dmi was named as chairman presiding over blue ribbon panel of representatives from industry labor and the public with an inhouse staff of seven economists117 observations of the commission the key issue to be resolved in indexation the report of the commission stated is the purpose of the minimum wage118 exploration focused upon the post world war ii years and primarily upon the 1950s through the 1970s during the 1950s and 1960s the report explained legislated minimum wage increases caused marked improvements in purchasing power that was not the case during the 1970s many minimum wage earners began working in the 1970s and experienced only the decline in the minimums purchasing power more critically lowincome workers in general and minimum wage workers in particular save very little and cannot provide for the future erosion of the purchasing power of their earnings finally those earlier minimum wage increases were not designed as buffer for the unexpectedly high inflation of the 1970s and 1980s since congress did not foresee the oil crisis and other economic phenomena that boosted the underlying inflation rate into doubledigit figures119 115 pl 95151 section 2e 116 see mary eccles and richard b freeman what another minimum wage study working paper 878 national bureau of

michael wachter commerce phyllis ann wallace hew and sandra willett agriculture aside from the seven staff economists with other assistants the commission arranged for the services of some 53 outside specialists on aspects of the minimum wage mostly economists and some 38 outside discussants 118 report of the minimum wage study commission vol 1 may 1981 published by the commission p 71 cited hereafter as mwsc by volume and page number 119 mwsc vol 1 p 71 crs28 the report explained the pros and cons of indexation and noted the possible methods for its implementation120 it seemed to conclude that there may be really ideal baseformula for indexation the effect of the various methods explored upon employment was assessed to be small although it varies slightly with the method used it was found that corporate profits would increase slightly under each of the plans studied lending support to the theory that firms find it easier to adjust to gradual and expected advances in labor costs than to the more abrupt legislated increases that have at times exacerbated inflation121 but had indexation attached to hourly earnings growth been attempted the report noted the longrun impact on consumer price inflation corporate profits and real gross national product would have been small though beneficial122 in summary the commission concluded first the present system has not maintained the purchasing power of the minimum wage second indexation is not necessarily inflationary if it is based on costofliving or other increases that have already taken place as measured for example by average hourly earnings the consumer price index without the mortgage interest payments or the implicit deflator third indexation would have small beneficial effect on the economy in the long run in the short run the commission concluded indexation could have either small beneficial or small harmful effect depending on underlying economic conditions123 nonetheless the commission recommended that the minimum wage be indexed on the basis of average hourly earnings in the private economy and adjusted each year on the basis of the previous years overall rate of change in this index further it concluded that regular and predictable increases in the minimum wage would be noninflationary and would be easier for business to adjust to than the irregular increases of the present system124 voices of dissent the minority report following congressional practice the report was divided into majority finding with in some cases an expression of minority views for the most part with one exception such minoritydissenting views were short and narrowly focused the robinson dissent s warne robinson chairman of the board g c murphy company had been appointed to the commission to represent industry the minimum wage he began has always represented tradeoff among higher wages for some workers fewer job opportunities for others and higher prices 120 mwsc vol 1 p 73 121 mwsc vol 1 p 79 122 mwsc vol 1 p 79 123 mwsc vol 1 pp 8384 concerning the technical aspects of these issues see crs report rl30927 the federal minimum wage the issue of indexation by gerald mayer 124 mwsc vol 1 p 84 crs29 for everyone125 robinson cited findings produced by objective economists these findings he stated have shaken the very foundations of the flsa robinson stated that the majority has refused to base its conclusions on the inescapable economic facts uncovered in our studies but has instead provided bold and unsupportable assertions in support of the minimum wage126 robinsons comments dealing with variety of minimum wagerelated issues focused as well upon the issue of indexation one of the most farreaching and least supportable recommendations of the commission robinson charged calls for automatic annual increases in the minimum wage indexing is by its nature inflationary it starts with the premise that inflation is fixed and permanent part of the economy and implies refusal to deal with the underlying causes of inflation he continued now is absolutely the worst conceivable time to be building inflationary forces deeper into the heart of our economy yet thats essentially what the majority recommendation for indexing the minimum wage would unavoidably do127 robinson reasoned that there is index that adequately distinguishes inflationcaused price increases from those caused by supply shocks he stated that there were other major problems with indexing ie that it never applies equally to everyone thus the result is that anything short of universal index will always end up redistributing income in some unintended way he continued this will mean those with the lowest job skills will face even worse employment prospects than at present small business will be hurt harder and laborintensive industries like the retail and service trades will be forced to pass on their increased costs to consumers robinson contended everyone eventually winds up worse off due to stepped up inflation including those who thought they were being protected by an index128 finally robinson suggested that federal attempts to set wages in defiance of marketplace realities inevitably create inefficiency in the labor market and in particular deny employment to specific segments of the labor market suffering aboveaverage rates of unemployment historically129 other voices of dissent michael wachter then professor of economics university of pennsylvania was also dissenter the commission he stated was firmly in favor of indexing and the only real question it debated was what index should be used 125 mwsc vol 1 p 182 126 mwsc vol 1 p 182 127 mwsc vol 1 pp 202203 128 mwsc vol 1 p 204 129 mwsc vol 1 pp 205206 crs30 wachter stated that the commission decided to index on general wage rate rather than price index but that the appropriate wage rate to be used as an index was not specified he explained the lack of decision on the appropriate index may seem unimportant but it is the heart of the problem there is perfect index he stated as all available indexes have serious weaknesses he added indexing minimum wages means surrendering control not only of the minimum wage level or floor but also of the cost of the minimum wage policy to employers and the number of workers who may be displaced this is not decision to be surrendered casually to an index number with unknown properties wachter was quick to note that once the choice of an index is made matter how poor the choice turns out to be it is very difficult to change that index130 phyllis ann wallace professor of economics sloane school of business at mit pleaded for more time in which to examine the practical issues of indexing the minimum wage like other dissenters from the commissions report wallace observed most of the suggested indexes as presently constructed have major flaws in agreement with wachter wallace concluded i therefore would not support at this time indexation of the minimum wage131 part iv the reagan presidency ronald reagan 19811989 and minimum wage in 1977 when the minimum wage study commission was created there was every reason to suspect that its report would be read avidly and that at least some of its recommendations might be adopted that would not be the case the reagan policy the minimum wage has caused more misery and unemployment than anything since the great depression ronald reagan was quoted as having said early in the campaign of 1980 how serious he may have been may not be entirely clear but the wall street journal reported that reagan if elected would try to repeal the minimum wage132 in november 1980 ronald reagan was elected president ronald reagan wants to give teenagers better chance in the job market by lowering their minimum wage stated new york times

the christian science monitor suggested minimum wage cut for youth seen as early reaganlabor confrontation134 as the 1981 congress opened representative erlenborn reportedly summed up the situation the daily labor report noted the scheduling of additional annual increases in the nations minimum wage may be too high price to pay for congressional passage of lower youth opportunity wage representative john erlenborn rill tells the industrial relations association of chicago135 some in congress favored youth subminimum wage proposal others higher general minimum wage but without the youth subminimum almost immediately there commenced series of hearings on youth employment and the subminimum wage which would tend to occupy congress throughout the reagan years136 few serious initiatives dealing with the minimum wage were considered during the reagan years for minimum wage workers there was increase in wages during the period nor was youth subminimum enacted the tradeoff suggested by representative erlenborn seemed to be holding137 the minimum wage study commission and its impact even as the mwsc was being organized the american enterprise institute aei announced threeyear research program to evaluate the effects of the minimum wage simon rottenberg university of massachusetts was chosen as director the congress enacts minimum wage laws he reportedly said because majority of its members apparently believe that this is an effective strategy for improving the condition of low income workers many economists have concluded however that such laws are not efficient instruments for ameliorating poverty138 in late 1979 aei hosted conference in washington dc dealing with the minimum wage and published the papers in single volume in 1981 almost at the same

dealing with aspects of the minimum wage although none of this work concerned indexation specifically the generally conservative aei publications tended to counter the more liberal mwsc report when the mwsc report was published in the spring of 198l it seems generally to have been ignored minimum wage was not then before the congress by the end of the decade when congress was again ready to act on minimum wages the mwsc report seemed somewhat outofdate and appears to have been utilized by each side to support their particular perspectives part v legislative initiatives the late 1980s minimum wage and indexation 19871988 in early 1987 several bills were introduced that dealt with the minimum wage two bills hr 1834 and s 837 proposed step increases followed by indexation in this case the mechanism was to create rate equal to 50 percent of the average private nonsupervisory nonagricultural hourly wage rounded upward to 5 cents140 hearings in the house on march 26 1987 representative augustus hawkins dca with others introduced hr 1834 bill to raise the minimum wage to 465 and to index it on april 9 1987 representative austin j murphy dpa chair of the subcommittee on labor standards convoked hearing on the measure the first speaker was mario biaggi dny who lamented the long interval without an increase in the minimum wage endorsed indexation and urged congress to move the bill forward141 gerald kleczka dwi took somewhat different stand referring to hr 659 his own minimum wage bill indexing other frills the kleczka bill had two 50cent increases the latter to take effect on january 1989 kleczka stated we have an administration which is not very friendly to the proposal to begin with and the more complicated we get the more things we add onto the legislation i think increases the chance of veto murphy questioned mr murphy i take it you are not then opposed to the biaggi approach of 3 to 4year mandatory increase plus indexing but you think 139 continued

right lets get the bill signed142 representative tommy robinson dar concurred if we put indexing in the minimum wage i think it will be veto bait and it will be vetoed143 as the hearings progressed there were the usual witnesses for and against an increase in the minimum wage and from industry very strong opinions with respect to indexation144 more supportive of the concept was the testimony of mary dublin keyserling speaking on behalf of the national consumers league she thought it encouraging to hear that the bill is to index the minimum wage145 in october 1987 lane kirkland aflcio president appeared before the subcommittee like mrs keyserling kirkland supported indexation the indexing proposed in the house bill mr chairman is clearly necessary to prevent the deterioration of the minimum wage experienced over the last decade if indexing had been in place gradual adjustment in the minimum wage would have taken place year by year as other wage levels in general rose minimum wages would have risen with them indexing brings certainty and stability to the process of adjusting the minimum wage workers who experience poverty kirkland continued must depend on other forms of income such as public assistance and to the extent that they do the us taxpayers are subsidizing lowwage employers146 hearings in the senate on march 25 senator edward kennedy dma introduced s 837 the minimum wage restoration act of l987 it was roughly the equivalent of the hawkins bill calling for indexing at the rate of 50 percent of average hourly earnings in manufacturing ahe147 142 house

heard dire prophecies of unemployment inflation and business failures and six times these prophecies have been false and america has prospered148 the senate hearings paralleled those of the house and had many of the same witnesses but testimony dealing with indexation may have been more subdued senator dan quayle rin remarked in passing my own viewpoint as concerns the bill before us is that indexing should be discarded149 claiborne pell dri expressed similar thoughts i must say i share the reservation expressed here about the indexing that must be examined very carefully indeed and i am concerned about it150 secretary of labor william brock unlike secretary marshall in 1977 largely ignored the issue151 even james ohara former member of congress and former chair of the mwsc presented only brief statement of support though he was more expansive during questioning152 industry as with prior hearings seemed to have taken hardline in opposition to indexation labor for the most part was more supportive153 following the pattern of 1977 quartet of economists appeared to lay out the pros and cons of an increase in the minimum wage with certain amount of disagreement gerald adams university of pennsylvania and david swinton associated with the southern center for studies in public policy clark college took basically prominimum wage position john glennie with robert nathan associates and finis welch of ucla seemed more critical of the concept154 148 us congress senate hearings on s 837 the minimum wage restoration act of 1987 vol 1 hearings before the committee on labor

to increase the minimum wage seven years since the last step increase had taken effect155 during that time workers employed at the minimum wage had fallen behind as inflationary pressures escalated house action on hr 1834 in late february 1988 as the house subcommittee on labor standards moved toward markup on hr 1834 issues remained156 within the subcommittee and later within the full committee there were apparent disagreements it seems clear that indexation has to come out of the bill at some point representative timothy penny dmn was quoted as saying the question is when hawkins took different approach my position is to protect indexing the dispute rested between indexation and congressional oversight157 on march 3 the subcommittee on labor standards met several members it was reported expressing reservations about the size of the increase and the indexing provided in the bill158 for three hours the subcommittee discussed the wage measure and on vote of 6 ayes to 3 nays along party lines the bill was ordered to be reported to the full committee in the process the indexation provision was dropped reportedly penny had offered the amendment to strike the indexing provision hawkins suggested that it was still possible to restore the indexation formula in full committee but that the chances were better than 5050159 on march 10 the committee on education and labor conducted fullcommittee mark up and adopted bill with fourth sequential increase in the minimum wage to 505160 jay power lobbyist for the aflcio was asked if the final step increase 155 speaking generally there are at least two categories of minimum wage workers some work only temporarily moving on to other occupations others remain at the minimum wage through most of their working lives for

house bill hr 1834 did not come to the floor162 senate action on s 837 the senate as in 1977 was aware of the action by the house subcommittee on labor standards on the indexation provision and of divisions within the house on the general question of raising the minimum wage in committee in the senate with kennedy as chair markup began on s 837 on june 22 1988 under the new bill substitute the final rate was lowered to 455 per hour as the senators met the bill still includes indexing163 however as the bill moved through markup the indexation provision was dropped164 in early september presidential candidate george h w bush indicated that he would support slight increase in the minimum wage there was some indication that president reagan might consider reasonable increase if training wage were included this new compromise seemed to please one critics of the minimum wage were angered seven years of effort to educate the public about the dangers of raising the minimum wage have been undermined by the bush proposal senator hatch was reported to have said labor would not support the bill with training wage included in late september two attempts at cloture failed and on

president was very specific as to what he would and would not accept again indexation became an issue house action on hr 2 on january 3 1989 hawkins introduced hr 2 bill to restore the minimum wage to fair and equitable rate the bill referred to the committee on education and labor with hawkins as chair called for an increase in the minimum wage in steps to 465 an hour after december 31 1991 together with other wagehour changes and finally minimum wage review board 166 the review board proposal on the strength of the several hearings conducted during the 100th congress hr 2 was reported from the subcommittee to the full committee but without it appears reference to the review board167 on march 14 1989 full committee hearing was held with the new secretary of labor elizabeth dole who explained what it was that the president wanted in new minimum wage bill there was considerable discussion about the potential impact of minimum wage increase the potential for job loss the proposal for sub minimum wage for youth but reference was made to the board168 as reported from the committee on education and labor march 20 1989 the board became somewhat more critical though still apparently not of major importance it would have five members and would be required to conduct continuous analyses of economic and other relevant data and to submit periodic recommendations to the congress on the adjustments necessary to preserve the purchasing power of the minimum wage the board would provide permanent group of experts to advise congress on the advisability of making periodic

during the initial debates views were mixed and relatively lowkey charles hayes dil made passing reference to the board which will advise congress on the economic effects of wage adjustments172 bruce vento dmn was pleased that this legislation provides for the establishment of an advisory board to review relevant data and make periodic recommendations to congress on adjustment of the minimum wage173 donald payne dnj pointed to the decline in value of the minimum wage during the reagan era and affirmed that the new board would attempt to redress that with these recommendations congress would be armed with objective economic data to ensure bipartisan support for future minimum wage increases174 there was also dissent ron marlenee rmt stated that the board would provide back door to pay increases each year this sounds he said like another measure to delegate our authority to an unelected commission to propose solutions to politically sensitive problems marlenee affirmed the american people do not want us to abrogate our authority to yet another commission175 as debate moved into second day representative william goodling rpa was more outspoken minimum wage review board is backdoor indexing mechanism that is all it is he charged176 later goodling reiterated at various times during the debate that the issue was backdoor indexing why do i say that goodling protested very simply because now if they want to recommend they must recommend each year to the congress that means each year there is good possibility that the same thing comes up over and over again177 hawkins advised his colleague mr goodling this review board is purely advisory if they recommend an increase that increase would be submitted to this body and to the other body as well as

originally hoped for it is an essential step toward ensuring fair and livable wage for the lowest paid workers183 conversely representative goodling argued they know proponents of an increase in the minimum wage it will be vetoed i know it will be vetoed they know it will be sustained i know it will be sustained he urged his colleagues to vote against the conference report184 debate on the conference report proceeded in routine manner the matter of indexation albeit backdoor indexation in the words of representative goodling was largely ignored as the house moved forward with the conference report ultimately it was adopted 247 ayes to 172 noes185 179 congressional record march 23 1989 pp 52565257 180 congressional record april 12 1989 pp 61696170 see also bureau of national

called up in the senate senator kennedy reviewed the reasons for supporting minimum wage increase but did not appear to raise the principle of indexation however senator hatch followed and he did refer to the issue of backdoor indexing the boards task is predetermined he stated each year they are to transmit to the congress an official recommendation for minimum wage increase in an aside to members hatch observed i wonder how many of my colleagues are anxious to vote every year in perpetuity on minimum wage bill186 the conference report was agreed to by vote of 63 ayes to 37 nays187 the president vetoes hr 2 on june 13 1989 the issue was resolved supporters of minimum wage increase were assembling for news conference to urge the president to sign hr 2 meanwhile during flight to lincoln nebraska president bush authorized the white house to transmit his veto message to the congress while the assemblage waited the veto message was read to the house188 the increase in the minimum wage the president said was of an excessive amount would stifle the creation of new job opportunities and would damage the employment prospects of our young people and least advantaged citizens it would accelerate inflation and would not help those in poverty he affirmed economists universally agree that such an increase in the minimum wage will result in the loss of job opportunities most grievous the training wage it included was ineffective it was too short 60day limitation for learning the nuances of entrylevel employment this can be accomplished only through permanent trainee differential he opined that the training wage would do little to save jobs and affirmed that he cannot support it189 the board the president stated threatens to compound the bills inflationary effect adding that it would be required to make annual recommendations to the congress for increasing the minimum wage in light of increases in wages and prices since any previous minimum wage adjustment finally this has been termed accurately backdoor indexing provision it is unacceptable190 186 congressional record may 17 1989 p 9498 187 congressional record may 17 1989 p 9515 188

who really care about the working poor know that the issue is not raising the minimum wage but minimizing poverty192 on june 14 1989 representative hawkins led off an appeal for an override of the presidents veto there follow series of speeches in some measure redundant ultimately the vote was cast ayes 247 nays 178 to override presidential veto twothirds majority was necessary since that was not achieved the override attempt failed193 during debate on the override the issue of indexation does not appear to have been raised new minimum wage bill hr 2710 following the veto of hr 2 there seemed to be some confusion in congress kennedy and hawkins had initially scheduled joint housesenate hearing on the minimum wage but labor secretary dole indicated that she would not be able to testify because of serious scheduling problems194 meanwhile new legislation was introduced in the senate s 1182 and on june 21 in the house this later bill hr 2710 was to become the basis for accommodation with the white house195 in the senate s 1182 as introduced and reported contained the review board language as did the house bill as introduced on september 14 1989 the house subcommittee on labor standards met and marked up bill with vote of 7 ayes to 4 nays the subcommittee met the presidents demand for 425 limit on the minimum wage196 despite this accommodation to the

for indexation in the 1980s retired in 1990 in the senate jacob javits and harrison williams left office in the early 1980s one might have anticipated shift away from the issue of indexation of the minimum wage the reverse however may have been true change of policy in 1938 the structure and administration for federal minimum wage legislation were established thereafter the practice had been to enact one or more step increases in the rate of the minimum and to implement them at regularly scheduled times the congress would evaluate the state of the economy and would raise the minimum wage rate to higher level 198 bureau of national affairs daily labor report september 20 1989 pp a11a12 199 bureau of national affairs daily labor report november 1 1989 p 11 states murphy told the rules

change has been enacted in the federal minimum wage rate the general rate has remained at 515 since 1997 the highest rate currently under consideration would raise it to 725 per hour to be phasedin two years and 60 days from the date of enactment if the minimum wage had been indexed to its late 1960s value it would now be in excess of 905 per hour203 meanwhile about 27 states have entered the minimum wage arena with wages in excess of the federal but with very different state standards several have indexed their minimum wage rates washington oregon vermont florida with six other states now in the process of implementing indexation it is possible that the issue of indexation may arise during debates in the 110th congress recent proposals for minimum wage indexation since 1992 there have been series of proposals calling for indexation of the minimum wage the proposals vary as does their intent none of the proposals has yet it appears been subject of hearings none of these measures has been enacted but then new minimum wage legislation has been enacted as standalone legislation since 1989204 this segment of the report inventories various indexation proposals of the past 15 years205 the 102nd congress on september 30 1992 representative george miller dca introduced hr 6067 referred to the committee on education and labor subcommittee on labor standards the bill would have indexed the minimum wage to the cost of living in the same manner as social security benefits are indexed206 miller described the extensive use of indexation in variety of federal programs the concept that the federal minimum wage should be living wage enabling workers to support their families has become myth he said at 425 per hour the minimum wage is inadequate to keep workers out of poverty207 203 representative phil english rpa during the 109th congress had proposed legislation hr 5368 that would have raised the minimum to 750 to become effective on october 1 2009 204 from 1938 through 1989 flsa amendments were of single standalone purpose in 1996 the minimum wage came to the floor as an amendment to tax program favored by industry thus though it represents only once such occasion some observers view it as linkage of the minimum wage for workers with tax legislation for employers 205 since these measures were not the subject of hearings and were not considered on the floor there is an absence of negative assessment in this section however negative comments can be inferred from the earlier portions of the paper 206 congressional record september 30 1992 p 29242 207 congressional record september 30 1992 p 29242 crs44 the 103rd congress on january 5 1993 representative miller with some modification reintroduced his proposal from the 102nd congress hr 281 which was again referred to the subcommittee on labor standards208 on january 27 1993 representative bernard sanders ivt introduced hr 692 roughly comparable proposal to the miller bill using the social security formula for indexing the minimum wage209 it was referred to the subcommittee on labor standards the preindexation rate would have been 550 millions of americans he stated find themselves working fulltime but still unable to maintain decent standard of living sanders took note of the tendency toward contingent workforce health insurance vacation days pensions and of course job security and stated record 266 million americans 104 percent of our people are now on food stamps the highest percentage since the program started in 1964 sanders added in effect the taxpayers are subsidizing the low wages being paid by corporations through food stamps medicaid and other programs for the working poor his bill would have increased the minimum wage to 500 and indexed it to inflation210 on march 11 1993 senator paul wellstone dmn introduced s 562 which was referred to the committee on labor and human resources the wellstone bill would have raised the minimum wage in steps to 675 beginning on september 1 1996 and then would have indexed the rate to 50 percent of the monthly average hourly earnings for nonfarm nonsupervisory private workers rounded to the nearest multiple of 005 the measure provided that any amount determined under this subparagraph shall not be less than the amount applicable under this paragraph for the preceding year italics added wellstone explained that the bill would gradually restore the value of the federal minimum wage and further it would also ensure that the minimum wage longer erodes as result of inflation congressional inaction or some combination of both by permanently tying the minimum wage to traditional index onehalf of average hourly us private sector wages the bill would break the cycle of minimum wage hikes enacted at irregular intervals by

minimum wage the bill was referred to the committee on labor and human resources the wellstone bill would have increased the minimum wage in steps to 515 an hour after september 1 1997 and would thereafter index it to not less than 45 percent of the monthly average hourly earnings for nonfarm nonsupervisory private workers for the preceding 12 months the bill also stated that the amount shall

after enactment it provided automatic adjustment for the year involved by percentage equal to the percentage by which the annual rate of pay for members of congress increases for such year the measure was referred to the committee on health education labor and pensions when introducing s 2725 ms clinton pointed out that the federal minimum wage is currently 515 an hour an amount that has not been increased since 1997 sadly she stated during that time congress has given itself eight annual pay raises we can longer stand by and regularly give ourselves pay increase while denying minimum wage increase to help the more than 7 million men and women working hard across this nation221 on june 29 2006 representative green dtx introduced hr 5731 bill that proposed indexation of the minimum wage it was referred to the committee on education and the workforce under the proposal the secretary of labor shall determine the minimum wage rate applicable under subsection a1 of the flsa and shall publish such wage rate in the federal register not later than october 1 of each year the bill states the minimum wage rate determined by the secretary shall be the minimum hourly wage sufficient for person working for such wage 40 hours per week 52 weeks per year to earn an annual income in an amount that is 12 percent higher than the federal poverty threshold for two person household with one person child under age 18 and living in the 48 contiguous states as published for each such year by the census bureau the bill states that if such determination results in lower minimum wage than that

if we in congress can give ourselves raise surely we can raise the pay of working families struggling to make ends meet recalling the long period since the most recent minimum wage increase since 1997 she stated my bill would ensure that working families faced with rising cost of living each year are not forced to wait another ten years for an increase in the minimum wage the clinton proposal would

some observations minimum wage workers for the most part accept lowwage work because other work is available whether they are very young lack training suffer infirmities or have other responsibilities for example care for family members or academic scheduling work at the minimum wage would likely not have been their first choice if higherpaying jobs were available absent alternative and more remunerative employment opportunities some do use entrylevel work as an interim measure some also remain at such work through the better part of lifetime presumably not by choice225 for persons who have entered the workforce at minimum wage level wages may be of some importance some employers already pay rate above the minimum others pay only the wage that is required by law that is the minimum wage under the fair labor standards act few minimum wage workers it would appear are union members and work under collectively negotiated agreement in the case of non union employees their wage may be determined by congressional action congress over the years has acted sporadically in this area it is possible that the resultant gaps in mandating an increase have occurred by design conviction that the minimum wage per is bad public policy and that its inflationary erosion would over time render its use as wage floor less important it may also have been the result of indifference or the urgency of competing national priorities for proponents of higher minimum wage for the working poor such gaps may have produced renewed interest in indexation with indexation regardless of the mechanism used there would be regular predictable wage rate increases for minimum wage workers for the workers themselves at least that minimal amount would be automatically added to their paycheck for employers such rate increase generally in response to inflationary pressures could reasonably be anticipated and prepared for were indexation to be adopted however some things may be lost and some parties may be adversely affected by not indexing the minimum wage and by allowing its continuing decline in real terms certain employers are freed from having to pay higher wages226 further with indexation lowwage workers could 225 in 2005 of hourlypaid workers according to unpublished data from the bureau of labor statistics women made up about 656 of minimum wage earners with only about 344 males in 2005 about 598 of workers at and below the minimum wage were employed on parttime basis of these about 71 who work only parttime were women it may be difficult to analyze just why workers choose to engage in lowwage andor parttime work clearly their perspectives are diverse motivational factors may deserve further study 226 jim snyder regular columnist for hotel management review innkeeping august 1966 p 10 at time when that industry was brought under the flsa reported weve continued crs51 expect progressively higher wages and may feel less need of trade unions although indexation might alleviate the need for oversight of the rate of worker remuneration it might also eliminate discussion of overtime pay child labor and related subjects227 finally for members of congress periodic review of the minimum wage may have certain resonance with voters permitting some to claim credit for an increased wage while others may want to show how firmly they opposed such an increase would indexation whatever its merits resolve the matter of minimum wage increases with formula established whether based on social security percentage of average hourly earnings or the cpi might new campaign arise to take its place for example if indexation were based on percentage of average hourly earnings 40 or 50 or 53 would proponents of living family saving wage now protest that the rate continues to provide poverty level income and that some adjustment may be necessary to 60 or 70 more practical side may emerge to the indexation question first there is perfect methodology for indexation though that issue might be addressed through hearings second if an increase in the minimum wage could be made automatic during good times might decrease also be made automatic during periods of high unemployment or other economic upheavals if the minimum wage goes up when times are good some might argue then might it not come down when conditions are more problematic third how might indexation whether an increase or decrease be factored into other areas of policy such as trade policy or immigration fourth is there nexus between productivity and wage increase if there is merit system in place how might that be affected by an automatic increase in wage rates fifth inflation may be yet another matter some view indexation as method through which lower wage workers can cope with pressures of the cost of living but others view indexation in its own right as an engine of inflation that once in place would be basically unstoppable through the years at least since the 1940s indexation has been frequently discussed but perhaps not actually explored in its varied aspects several of the states now have indexation in place several more will soon have such system installed such experimentation by the states may hold promise or threat for policy makers 226 continued lost all right philosophized one ahma american hotel and motel association spokesman but when you consider that the industry has saved million dollars or so every day its been exempt i guess you could say that the effort was worthwhile 227 as has been suggested through the years indexation could remove one element of contention the level of the minimum wage and replace it with another issue the rate at which indexation should be pegged for other versions of this document see
