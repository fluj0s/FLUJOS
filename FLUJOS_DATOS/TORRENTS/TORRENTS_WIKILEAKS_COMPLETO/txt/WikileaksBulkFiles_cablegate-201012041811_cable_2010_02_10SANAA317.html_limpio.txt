02162010 j sanaa 214 classified by ambassador stephen seche for reasons 14b and d this is an action request see paragraph 12 1 snf summary since the start of 2010 post has seen dramatic increase in the number of amcits arrested over 80 percent of these cases ref ae have had nexus to terrorism and national security issues that have required substantial involvement from rso and legatt this comes as the consular section is attempting to alleviate its sixmonth backlog in upcoming crba appointments post requests tdy personnel to assist with the anticipated staffing gaps in consular from april to september and renews its call to increase fso staffing ref f to address the sharply increased workload end summary arrests of americans up new royg procedures 2 snf post has noted dramatic increase in arrests of americans in yemen since the attempted christmas day bombing of northwest 253 in the last seven weeks seven amcits were arrested for national security concerns and violations of immigration laws ref ae compared to only six in the entire four months prior six of these cases have suspected links to terrorism that have required significant coordination with legatt and rso comment this upsurge in arrests is the result of more scrupulous royg focus on visa overstay cases due to increased international attention to terrorism in yemen end comment 3 snf previously visa overstay would present himself at the immigration authority pay his fines and obtain an exit visa recently however overstays have been detained and have required post intervention in securing their exit from yemen four of the arrestees were abducted by the political security organization pso or national security bureau nsb and were held for between 310 days before post was given official notice of their whereabouts note in the past two years the muslim convert community of amcits living in yemen who make up the majority of overstays has been increasingly linked to extremist activities end note in one case post has still not received official word of the arrest and is unable to inform the family in the us who still believes the individual has been kidnapped the issue of timely notification of arrests was recently raised by posts dcm with the yemeni chief of protocol direct namecheck hits increasing 4 snf in addition to the spike in arrest cases post routinely sees cases of national security interest in the course of its daily visa and american citizen services acs operations on average post has 35 cases per week that require legatt and rso attention the processing time required to clear these hits and allow time for additional interviews is increasingly straining our ability to provide routine services in timely fashion comment post had reduced appointment wait time for firsttime crba applications from six months to three months we will not be able to continue such high appointment numbers given the recent increase in arrest cases and our current staffing levels end comment status of arrestees 5 snf post is currently processing five arrest cases most of which have begun as welfare and whereabouts requests or visa overstays sixth who was not national security or terrorist case was recently released all five that remain have had strong links to terrorism or national security concerns the following is an update on these cases 6 snf xxxxxxxxxxxx ref was being held at the passport authority pending further investigation into both his visa overstay and possible links to terrorism royg previously attempted to deport xxxxxxxxxxxx he was denied boarding however due to his presence on the fly list nfl post had requested guidance from ca on this matter ref g as per applicable fam nfl guidance posts arsoi received call from consulate istanbuls arsoi ref h that xxxxxxxxxxxx arrived in istanbul on february 16 but was denied onward travel to the us due to his nfl status post later received notice that xxxxxxxxxxxx is scheduled to board turkish airlines flight tk1236 to sanaa on february 17 ref i note xxxxxxxxxxxx longer has valid yemeni visa and airport visas are longer available ref j end note 7 snf xxxxxxxxxxxx ref b is being held at the pso prison he is currently still under investigation by the pso which plans to deport him date for his release has been set fbi and ds plan to meet him in the us upon his return 8 snf xxxxxxxxxxxx ref c is being held by the passport authority and is awaiting deportation currently royg authorities are waiting for mr xxxxxxxxxxxx to secure an itinerary and tickets to the us before his release 9 snf xxxxxxxxxxxx ref d is also being held at the pso prison he is currently being investigated for his links to terrorism the royg has not given any information regarding possible charges 10 snf xxxxxxxxxxxx ref is currently being held at the immigration authority prison pending possible deportation it is currently unclear if mr xxxxxxxxxxxx will be able to pay his overstay fines and obtain standard exit visa to return to the us or if he will be deported comment 11 sbu post currently has five fulltime officers assigned to the consular section and one parttime officer prison visits must occur during morning hours pulling officers away from visa and acs cases this increase in workload has pushed our already strained operation beyond capacity and has hampered our ability to work through existing backlogs in acs and iv in ref f and through diplomacy 30 post requested at least one additional acs officer based on workload and staffing in fy09 posts workload in iv has increased by 5722 cases or over 25 times from fy08 to fy09 additionally posts niv workload increased by 918 adjudications up nearly third from fy08 to fy09 end comment action request 12 sbu post renews its call for fulltime fs03 acs officer and fs04 vice consul and requests tdy support to cover officer leave and the anticipated staffing gap from april through september in addition post requests experienced arabicspeaking staff and officer tdy support as soon as possible to assist in working through backlogs in acs and iv post fully expects that the trends of increasing arrests and direct hit cases will continue and looks forward to positive and expeditious response to this request seche
