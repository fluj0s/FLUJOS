economy marc labonte specialist in macroeconomic policy december 9 2008 abstract some policymakers have called for stimulus package to boost economic activity in response to the housing downturn fundamental diﬀerence between stimulus proposals is how much of the stimulus should be composed of government spending and how much should be composed of tax cuts this report considers that issue in the context of conventional economic analysis it ﬁrst identiﬁes any policy change that increases the budget deﬁcit or reduces surplus and is not entirely saved by the recipient as stimulative if the economy is operating below its full potential it then separates the shortrun eﬀects of budget deﬁcit from the longrun eﬀects in this context certain spending proposals would be more stimulative than certain tax reductions in the short run because they result in bigger boost in aggregate spending this advantage may come at the cost of forgone growth in the long run

have suggested that stimulus package might be needed to boost the economy that has been in recession since december 2007 congress approved stimulus package in february 2008 pl 110185 and is now considering another one1 if so key question in designing stimulus package is how to get the most shortterm bang for the buck and one important element of that debate is whet her spending proposals or tax reductions would be more effective in that regard to answer that question one must first distinguish between the demandside aggregate spending and supplyside aggregate production of the economy stimulating the economy refers to boosting aggregate spending on the demandside of the economy stimulus is employed in recession because recession by definition is situation where aggregate spending is insufficient to fully employ the economys resources how should the efficacy of proposed stimulus be evaluated by whether it boosts economic growth might seem to be an obvious answer but complete answer is little more complicated most proposed policy measures have distinct sh ortrun and longrun economic effects and often policy measure that is beneficial in the short run may be detrimental in the long run and vice versa 2 in the short run many policy measures would affect the economy by boosting aggregate spending in slowdown their effects on the productive capacity supply side of the economy are likely to be slightthere is little incentive to add capital or labor when spending is not adequate to support existing production in the long run some proposed policy measures can affect economic growth by changing individuals work effort productivity and the national saving rate by contrast measures effect on aggregate spending can be ignored in the long run because aggregate spending cannot be permanently altered once prices wages and credit markets adjust aggregate spending effects are dissipated if judging measure whose aim is to stimulate the economy in response to an economic shock it seems logical to judge it on the basis of how much it boosts aggregate spending in the short run this does not alter the fact that for better or worse it will also have longrun effects evaluating the stimulative nature of different policy measures does not answer the question of whether fiscal stimulus is needed expansionary monetary policy by the federal reserve fed also stimulates the economy 3 in recent months the fed has reduced the federal funds rate on several occasions in addition prices wages and credit markets naturally adjust to bring aggregate spending back into line with aggreg ate production look at the historical record suggests that these two factors have proven highly capable of moving the economy out of recession in the absence of fiscal stimulus4

decreases the size of surplus would be expected to boost aggregate spending by some degree thereby stimulating an economy operating below its 1 for an overview of economic conditions and congressional action on the stimulus packages see crs report rl34349 economic slowdown issues and policies by jane g gravelle et 2 for the purposes of this report shortterm effects can be defined as the cyclical

g344g561full potential5 the key is that stimulus measures would be financed with borrowed money and credit markets would not fully adjust immediately in terms of higher interest rates so that the spending is new in that context if the measur were offset by spending cuts in other parts of the budget or other tax increases it would largel lose its stimulative effect on aggregate demand implementation of proposals labeled as stimulus package or say higher military spending would both stimulate aggregate spending the most important determinant of measures effect is how much the budget deficit increases as percentage of gross domestic product gdp because the policy brings unused resources back into production the increase in aggregate spending will be greater than the budgetary cost of the measure by some multiplier to the extent that interest rates rise as result of the decline in saving increased budget deficit the multiplier will be reduced because the measure will tend to crowd out private investment and other interestsensitive spending economic theory suggests it will also crowd out exports and import competing goods because higher interest rates will tend to attract foreign capital that will cause the exchange value of the dollar to appreciate similarly if the measure causes inflation to rise some of the spending will be crowded out as real income falls more crowding out will occur as production moves closer to its full potential when the economy is operating at close to full capacity then stimulus package is unlikely to have the salutary effects its proponents desire when the economy is deep in recession and bu siness investment demand is weak the crowding out effect is likely to be small all measures that increase the size of the deficit will boost aggregate spending in recession to some extent but some measures are likely to boost it more than others the government can increase the budget deficit or reduce the surplus in three ways it can spend money directly by purchasing goods and services it can make income transfers by giving cash or inkind benefits to selected individuals or it can cut taxes note that while in budgetary terms government spending and government transfers are both defined as outlays they have different economic meanings and effects government spending is likely to boost aggregate spending more than tax cuts or government transfer because some part of tax cut or transfer would be saved by definition any resources that are saved cannot add to aggregate spending similarly different tax cuts and transfers will have different shortrun effects because they offer different incentives to save or spend and their recipients have different spendingsaving patterns who should tax cut or government transfer target to get the most shortrun bang for the buck empirically there is evidence that lower income recipients are likely to spend more of tax cut or transfer payment than higher income recipients for example twothirds of families in the bottom 20 of the income distribution did not save at all in 2004 whereas only onefifth of families in the top 10 of the income distribution did not save 6 there is strong theoretical rationale to explain this result one fairly wellaccepted theoretical explanation holds that lower income recipients are more likely to be liquidityconstrained than higher income recipients meaning that they are more likely to lack access to credit markets that allows them to alter their borrowing or saving at will thus spending tax cut or transfer payment may allow them to reach level of consumption that they would have undertaken if they had unrestrained access to credit markets 5 for more detailed analysis see crs report rl31235 the economics of the federal budget

on the recipients behavioral response is there any reason to generally expect one or the other to cause greater boost in aggregate demand to answer this question two further points are worth considering first about 30 of lowincome households accrue federal income tax liability although some do pay federal payroll and excise taxes thus there are limited options for targeting lower income recipients through the individual income tax second it would be difficult to target an individual tax cut in such way that it could only be spent 7 the recipients of tax rebates income tax cuts or payroll tax holidays would be free to decide whether to save or spend their payment sales tax holiday is notable exception but raises problematic administrative and federalism issues since sales taxes are levied by state governments by contrast there are other types of tax cuts such as the expansion of tax deferred savings accounts that are intended to stimulate more saving and hence less spending certain types of transfer payments such as food stamps or rental vouchers are more easily targeted in such way that they cannot be saved and must be spent even these policies do not prevent individuals from shifting an offsetting amount of any other income into saving however thus government spending on goods and services remains the only way to prevent the shortterm increase in aggregate spending from being partially offset by private saving in determining measures shortrun efficacy another issue to consider is the lag in policy implementation separate issue from the lag caused by the legislative process it may take considerable amount of time to set up an administrative infrastructure before certain government spending or transfer measures can be implemented alternatively other measures expand existing programs and in some cases can be implemented quite quickly for example revenue sharing between federal and state governments sending fiscal aid to states could presumably be spent quickly by the states since it would most likely be used to finance existing state programs whose budgets would otherwise be cut tax cuts typically take effect in the following fiscal year but exceptions can be made as was the case with the 2008 tax rebate the rebate still entailed lag pl 110185 was signed into law in february but most rebates went out in may and june 2008 8 g14g152g151g144g556g20g158g151g561g7g143g143g142g140g157g156g561 policy measures that stimulate the economy in the short run in terms of boosting aggregate spending may lower economic performance in the long run due to the spendingsaving dichotomy longrun growth depends on investment work effort and productivity gains investment in turn relies on saving since budget deficit lowers national saving while surplus increases national saving policy measure that increases the budget deficit would lower national saving unless it leads to higher saving in other sectors of the economy if so measures that boost aggregate spending in the short run will lower saving and therefore may restrain growth over the long run the extent that national saving is reduced in turn depends on how much private saving offsets the reduction in public saving the increase in the deficit the fact that some part of tax cut is likely to be saved arguably gives tax cuts an advantage over most government spending in the long run in turn tax cut can be crafted to generate more saving by targeting higher income individuals who have higher saving rates or targeting saving 7 it is easier to target business tax cut in such way that it must be spent for instance business could claim the proposed accelerated depreciation only if it purchased new capital see crs report rl31134 using business tax cuts to stimulate the economy by jane g gravelle 8 see crs report rl34349 economic slowdown issues and policies by jane g gravelle et

actually induce private saving depends on whether individuals react to the higher aftertax rate of return by saving more because it is more rewarding referred to as substitution effect or by saving less because less saving is now needed to reach their goal referred to as an income effect similarly tax cuts can be crafted to increase the rewards for working whether this generates more work effort depends on whether people work more in response to higher aftertax pay substitution effect or work less because less work is now needed to achieve given standard of living income effect if tax cut generates more work effort this could also help offset the negative effects on economic growth of raising the deficit marginal income tax cuts have substitution effects that could potentially induce more work or saving if tax expenditures deductions credits or exclusions were cut instead there would be an unambiguously negative effect on work and saving in most cases because there would be an income effect but substitution effect most government spending and transfers do not increase the incentives for individuals to work or save any negative effects on longrun growth caused by the larger budget deficit therefore would not be offset there are exceptions such as government spending on public investment while most government consumption or transfer spending would not be expected to affect economic growth public investment would increase the national capital stock and therefore have positive offsetting effect on growth productivity in government may grow more slowly than it does in the private sector over time also causing government spending to detract from longrun growth 9 although transfer payments may have significant soci value they can also reduce the incentives to work and save if they are meanstested for income level reduction in transfer payments when income rises is equivalent to the incentive effects of marginal income tax increase and some individuals may reduce their work effort or saving to avoid this facto marginal tax increase likewise unemployment benefits can lower the incentive to find work on the other hand there are examples of transfer payments that increase the incentive to work such as transfer payments for which only employed individuals are eligible
