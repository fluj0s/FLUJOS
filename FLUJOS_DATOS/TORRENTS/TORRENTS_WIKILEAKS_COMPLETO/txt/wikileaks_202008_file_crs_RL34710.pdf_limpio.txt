known about effective methods for improving adolescent literacy these reports have also included suggestions for school level re sponses as well as recommendations for federal and state actions to help improve adolescent literacy these reports indicate that for some students reading instruction solely in the early grades is not sufficient this research suggests that some students need ongoing assistance in adolescence if they are to master the skills they need to succeed in the upper grades and in college and work settings in particular the research indicates that students must be fluent readers have sufficient vocabulary and background knowledge be able to comprehend complex material nd be motivated and engaged the most recent national assessment of educational progress data on reading are 2007 data for 4th and 8th graders and 2005 data for 12th graders according to these data both 4th and 8th grade students performed significantly higher in 2007 than in 1992 the first year the test was administered the percentage of 4th grade students performing at or above the basic level in reading increased from 62 in 1992 to 67 in 2007 the percentage of 8th grade students performing at or above the basic level in reading increased from 69 in 1992 to 74 in 2007 in contrast data for 12th graders indicate that the percentage of stude nts performing at or above the basic level in reading decreased from 80 in 1992 to 73 in 2005 in response to concerns about adolescen t literacy the striving readers program was initiated through appropriations measures in 2005 to evaluate and implement programs that have the potential to improve adolescent literacy the us department of education aw ards striving readers funds for the implementation and evaluation of reading curricula and prof essional development programs as well as other activities intended to imp rove reading achievement for middle and highschool students grants are awarded competitively to local educational agencies leas or to partnerships made up of leas institu tions of higher education and public or private nonprofit or forprof it organizations with exper tise in adolescent literacy or rigorous evaluation growing body of research indicating need for greater focus on adolescent literacy issues has heightened interest in federal legislation on this issue the striving readers program was initiated as demonstration program to provide data on programs that are or have the promise of being successful in improving adolescent literacy skills congressional considerati on of reauthorizing the elementary and secondary education act esea in the 111th congress may include discussion of whether this program should receive specific authorization in the esea and whether evidence from the demonstration program in conjunction with other research data supports scaling up the prog ram and converting it to formula grant program or whether the evidence is insuffi cient to support

the current state of adolescent literacy data on college readiness indicate that many students leave high school unprepared to handle collegelevel work 2006 act report noted that only 51 percent of 2005 acttested high school graduates are ready for college level reading and whats worse more students are on track to being ready for college level reading in eighth and tenth grade than are actually ready by the time they reach twelfth grade1 to become reader capable of understa nding the complex material encountered in high school and be yond adolescents must have variety of sophisticated skills these skills include the following how to read purposefully select material s that are of interest learn from those materials figure out the meanings of unfamiliar words integrate new information with information previous ly known resolve conflicting content in different texts differentiate fact from opinion and recognize the perspective of the writer2 clearly single measure of students literacy ability can adequately capture all these skills however for simplicity the discussion of adolescent literacy in this report will use student achievement levels in reading as measure of adolescent literacy the data relied upon here to m easure reading skills are publishe d by the widely respected national assessment of educational progress naep also known as the nations report ca rd naep is the only regular national assessment of student reading achievement this report discusses the naep achievement levels attained in reading by 4th 8th and 12th graders summarizes some of the r ecent

and intervention practices for improving adolescent literacy in particular the guide focuses on how to improve reading profic iency the authors categorized the evidence of effectiveness supporting the research studies they reviewed on adolescent literacy interventions into three categories strong moderate and low for evidence of the effectiveness of an intervention to be considered strong the research supporting it must demonstrate statistically significant finding of positive effects and the intervention must be generalizable12 for evidence of an intervention to be considered moderate the research suppor ting it must demonstrate strong causal conclusions although it may not be gene ralizable or the research must be generalizable but may not s upport strong causal conclusi ons research considered to have low evidence of efficacy could be based on expert opinions derived from strong findings or theories on the basis of an extensive review of the research the practice guide recommended several actions to increase reading proficiency that are supported by either strong or moderate evidence13 the striving readers program the striving readers program was initiated to

performance measures th first is measure of the intensive targeted intervention the second is measure of the whole school program 1 the percentage of adolescent students reading significantly below

increase in the percentage of stude nts participating in the striving readers program who score at or above prof icient on the states assessment in readinglanguage arts data on these measures are currently only available for the first year of the programs implementation fo r 7 of the 8 grantees at the end of the 20062007 school year 30 of the student s participating in an intens ive targeted

of 2006 to 61 in the spring of 2007 issues for the 111th congress congressional interest in legislation focusing on adolescent literacy is based in part on the growing body of research indicating that for some students reading instruction in the early grades is not sufficient to ensure that adolescents will be proficient in the reading skills they need for highschoollevel work and beyond the striving readers program was initiated as demonstration program to provide data on programs that are or have the promise of being successful in improving adolescent literacy skills during reauthorization of the esea19 congress may consider whether this program should r eceive specific authorization in the esea and whether the current demonstration program in conjunction with ot her research data supports scaling up the program and conve rting it to formula grant program or whether the evidence is insufficient to support continuation or expansion of the program many existing federal programs can support among other things reading instruction for adolescents however st riving readers is the only program solely devoted to this purpose other federal education programs that include reading programs as part of the services that can be provided are esea title ia the individuals with disabilities ducation act and esea title iii language

with in conjunction with an esea reauthorization is whether existing programs can adequately address adolescent literacy issues or whether dedicated adolescent literacy program with sufficient funding is necessary to help foster improvements in adolescent literacy
