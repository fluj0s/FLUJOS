securitys treatment under the federal budget summary updated by dawn nuschler1 domestic social policy division summary social securitys treatment in the federal budget is often confusing legislation enacted in 1983 1985 and 1990 excluded the program from official budget calculations and largely exempted it from procedures for controlling budget revenues and outlays however because social security represents more than fifth of the governments revenues and outlays it is often included in summaries of the government s financial flows or what is referred to as the unified budget it is also confusing because people mistakenly perceive that the programs removal from the budget changed how its funds are handled it did not as has been the practice since social securitys inception its taxes are deposited in the federal treasury with appropriate crediting of federal securities to its trust funds and its expenditures are paid from the treasury with the emergence of unified budget surpluses over the past few years there was growing sentiment for reserving portion of them equal to social security and medicare hospital insurance trust fund surpluses budget resolutions enacted for fy2000 fy2001 and fy2002 incorporated totals setting such sums aside with the intent being that these amounts would be used for debt reduction pending reform of social security or medicare congress also considered proposals to create procedural obstacles for bills that would use the set asides for other tax cuts or spending increases among them were measures to create new points of order against bills that would do so to require new limits on publiclyheld federal debt that would decline by the amount of annual social security surpluses and to amend the constitution to require balanced federal budget without counting social security although taken up in the 106th congress none of these socalled lock box measures were ultimately passed the 107th congress began considering similar legislatio n with house passage of hr 2 on february 13 2001 attempts to consider related measures in the senate failed on march 13 and july 10 2001 since the september 2001 terrorist attacks the budget debate has focused on increased spending for the war on terrorism and economic stimulus efforts this report will be updated periodicallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95206crs2 history social security and other federal programs that operate through trust funds were counted officially in the budget beginning in fy1969 this was done administratively by president johnson at the time congress did not have budgetmaking process in 1974 with passage of the congressional budget and impoundment control act pl 93344 congress adopted procedures for setting budget goals through passage of annual budget resolutions like the budgets prepared by the president these resolutions were to reflect unified budget that included trust fund programs such as social security beginning in the late 1970s financial problems confronting social security and concern over its growing costs led to enactment of benefit cutbacks in 1980 1981 and 1983 however because the federal budget deficit remained large interest in curbing social security spending continued this in turn ignited concerns that cuts in social security were being proposed for budgetary purposes rather than programmatic ones in response measures were enacted in 1983 1985 and 1987 making the program more distinct part of the budget and permitting floor objections to be raised against budget bills containing social security changes later in the decade when social security surpluses emerged critics argued that the program was masking the size of budget deficits in response congress in 1990 excluded it from official calculations of the budget and largely exempted it from procedures for controlling spending omnibus budget reconciliati on act of 1990 pl 101508 by these actions however congress excluded social security from procedural constraints designed to discourage measures that would increase the deficits concerned that this would encourage social security spending increases and tax cuts that could weaken social securitys financial condition congress also adopted provisions in that legislatio n permitting floor objections to be raised against bills that would erode the balances of the social security trust funds current budget rules pertaining to social security two key elements of the budget process are 1 explicit dollar limits on discretionary spending mostly for programs requiring annual appropriations and 2 payasyougo rule that requires that increases in direct spending mostly for entitlement programs andor cuts in revenues must be offset by other changes so as not to increase the budget deficit or reduce the surplus originally written to cover the fy1991fy1995 period these budget rules now apply through fy2002 as result of provisions in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 and the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 105 33 if the explicit spending limits or payasyougo rules are violated during this period the president may be required to sequester funds ie cut spending social security is not to be included in these calculations and is exempt from any potential sequestration with the exception of administrative expense s which are counted as discretionary spending the law further permits floor objections to be raised against budget bills reconciliation bills that contain social security measureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95206crs3 lock boxes to set aside social security surpluses while social security is by law considered off budget for many key aspects of developing and enforcing budget goals it is still federal program and its income and outgo help to shape the yeartoyear financial condition of the government as result fiscal policymakers often focus on unified or overall budget figures that include social security with former president clintons urging that future budget surpluses be reserved until social securitys problems were resolved and his various proposals to use portion of the projected surpluses or the interest thereon to shore up the system social securitys treatment in the budget became major policy issue in the past two congresses in his state of the union message in 1998 he had urged setting the entire amount of future budget surpluses aside for debt reduction later in the year the house republican leadership attempted to set alternative parameters with passage of tax cut bill hr 4579 and companion measure hr 4578 that would have created new treasury account to which 90 of the next 11 years surpluses would have been credited the underlying principle was that 10 of the surpluses be used for tax cuts and the remainder used for debt reduction until social security reform was enacted both bills however were opposed by democratic members who argued for setting all of the budget surpluses aside the senate did not take up either measure before the 105th congress adjourned the idea reemerged however in the 106th congress with substantial support shown by both parties for setting aside portion of the budget surpluses equal to the social security and in some instances medicare hospital insurance hi trust fund surpluses budget resolutions for both fy2000 and fy2001 incorporated totals setting aside an amount equal to the social security surpluses for those years as well as reserving funds for medicare reform by setting them aside the resolutions in effect dedicated these amounts to debt reduction the 106th congress went on to consider other socalled lock box measures intended to create additional procedural obstacles for bills that would cause the budget surpluses to fall below level equal to the social security and in some cases medicare surpluses if not used for social security or medicare reform among them were measures to create new points of order that could be lodged against bills that would cause budget surpluses to be less than social security and medicare hi surpluses to require new limits on federal debt that would decline by the amount of annual social security surpluses and to amend the constitution to require balanced federal budget without counting social security while the house approved three specific lock box bills consisting primarily of procedural points of order hr 3859 hr 5173 and hr 5203 the senate could not reach consensus on them and none was ultimately passed the 107th congress passed similarly structured budget resolution for fy 2002 and has again considered various lock box measures the house passed hr 2 on february 13 2001 bill that again attempts to create points of order against measures that would cause the budget surpluses to be less than social security and medicare hi surpluses in the senate similar democratic and republican provisions were offered as amendments to s 420 bankruptcy reform act of 2001 one offered by senator conrad would have taken medicare hi offbudget and enhanced procedural points of order for social security another offered by senator sessions contained provisions similar to hr 2 neither amendment was adopted having been set aside due to procedural points of order raised against them during senate debate on march 13 2001 subsequent attempts in the senate on july 10 2001 also failed see crs report rs20165 since the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 the focus of the budget debate in congress has shifted from lockhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95206crs4 box measures to other priorities particularly on spending for the war on terrorism and economic stimulus also the budget outlook has changed dramatically over the past year with sharp decline in projected budget surpluses in august 2001 cbo projected cumulative budget surplus of 34 trillion over the 20022011 period down from 56 trillion projected in may 2001 cbos latest projections revised on march 18 2002 to reflect enactment of the economic stimulus package pl 107147 show cumulative surplus of 16 trillion over the same period with unified budget deficits projected for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 see table on page 6 social security and the balanced budget amendment action in the 104th congress the 104th congress twice considered constitutional amendm ent that would require the federal government to achieve and maintain balanced budget both the house and the senate versions of the amendment hjres 1 and sjres 1 included social security in the budget totals members concerned that including social security would lead to future cuts in its benefits proposed that it be exempted they argued that because social security would be counted in computing the budget deficit there would be incentives to cut its benefits to achieve reductions in outlays that would make the deficit smaller they stressed that the system is running surpluses with its own dedicated tax receipts and is therefore not contributing to the deficit and argued that including those surpluses in the totals would cause them to be used to finance the deficit in the rest of the budget and thereby hide its true size those who wanted to keep social security in the calculations argued that their purpose was not to cut social security but to recognize that the program represented too large share of federal revenues and expenditures to be ignored they contended that removing social security from the calculations would be fiscally misleading and make the goal of achieving balanced budget more difficult they averred that the real goal of those who wanted social security excluded was to defeat the amendment by making senior citizens fear that their benefits were in jeopardy and by making the deficit targets unrealistically large they argued that if social security were removed advocates of future spending measures would attempt to expand the programs features to achieve other social purposes since social security would be exempt from the balanced budget requirements and that this would threaten the programs ultimate survival on january 26 1995 the house passed its version of the balanced budget amendment by vote of 300 to 132 it called for including social security in the budget totals before the final vote the house rejected four attempts to remove the program from the calculations however the house did pass nonbinding resolution hconres 17 by vote of 412 to 18 on january 25 1995 stating that for purposes of achieving balanced budget the appropriate congressional committees shall not report out legislation that would alter the receipts and disbursement of social security similar measure was passed the same day by the senate in its consideration of s 1 bill to curb the imposition of unfunded mandates on the states the senate version of the amendment as reported by the senate judiciary committee also included social security in the budget calculations however after lengthy floor deliberations the amendment failed to get the requisite twothirds approval of the senate the final vote taken on march 2 1995 was 65 to 35 in the weeks of consideration leading up to the vote social security was major part of the debate onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95206crs5 february 9 1995 the senate agreed by an 8710 vote to instruct the senate budget committee to develop nonbinding plan to achieve balanced budget without altering social security however in later action the senate rejected four measures to either remove social security from the calculations or otherwise alter its treatment under the amendment on february 14 1995 by vote of 5541 the senate tabled measure offered by senator reid to exempt the program from the amendment on february 28 1995 the senate tabled three other related measures one offered by senator feinstein tabled by vote of 6039 would have taken social security out of the calculations in fashion similar to the earlier defeated measure offered by senator reid another offered by senator bob graham tabled by vote of 5940 would have required threefifths of both houses of the congress to approve an increase in the total outstanding debt of the government including the portion held in federal trust funds such as the social security funds the version of the amendment reported by the senate judiciary committee required threefifths approval to raise only the portion of the debt held by the public the graham amendment would have had an effect similar to the other defeated measures that excluded social security from the budget calculations third measure also offered by senator graham tabled by vote of 5743 would have permitted the portion of the debt held by the public to rise without threefifths approval to the extent the rise reflected reduction in the portion held by the social security trust funds after its 1995 defeat the majority leader senator dole said he would bring up the amendment later in the 104th congress he did so again on june 6 1996 and the measure failed second time on 6435 vote to get the requisite twothirds senate approval action in the 105th congress the amendment was brought up again in the 105th congress with the senate taking the lead the senate judiciary committee reported it as sj res 1 in form similar to the amendment the senate considered in the 104th congress that included social security in budget calculations the senate began deliberations on february 5 1997 on february 25 1997 by vote of 5544 it tabled measure offered by senator reid to exclude social security it tabled similar measure by senator dorgan the next day by vote of 5941 as well as one offered by senator feinstein by vote of 6733 the feinstein measure included other alterations of sjres 1 as well yet fourth alternative offered by senator bob graham was tabled 5939 it was similar to one he offered in the 104th congress that would have required 35 approval by both houses to increase the total outstanding debt of the government including the portion held in the social security trust funds in vote on final passage on march 4 1997 the amendment in its original form was defeated by vote of 6634 current house and senate procedural rules to protect social security under budget rules that existed before 1991 social security was included in calculations of budget deficits since there were limits on the size of permissible budget deficits imposed by the grammrudmanhollings deficit reduction rules enacted in 1985 attempts to expand social securitys benefits or cut its taxes were discouraged if not accompanied by measures to offset the cost or revenue loss floor objections could be raised against such actions if the budget totals or allocations were violated and if enacted other programs were potentially threatened with sequestration because the deficit would be made larger in effect the old process imposed the same fiscal discipline on socialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs95206crs6 security as applied to other programs since social security is now exempt from the budget limits except administrative expenses as result the budget rules that took effect in 1991 these implicit constraints longer apply in their place however are rules intended to make it difficult to bring up measures that would weaken the programs financial condition in the house floor objection can be raised against bill that proposes more than 250 million in social security spending increases or tax cuts over 5 years counting the fiscal year it becomes effective and the following 4 years unless the bill also contains offsetting changes to bring the net impact within the 250 million limit costs of prior legislation that fall within the 5year period must be counted an objection also can be raised against measure that would increase the systems longrange average costs ie over 75 years or its reduce longrange revenues by at least 002 of taxable payroll ie national earnings subject to social security taxes in the senate budget resolutions must include separate amounts for social security income and outgo for the first year and the 5year period covered by the resolution ie separate from the budget totals these amounts cannot cause the balances of the social security trust funds to be lower than projected under current law measures that would do so could draw an objection which can be overridden only by threefifths approval of the senate once the resolution is enacted subsequent measures that on balance would cause social security outlay increases or revenue reductions could draw an objection which again can be overridden only when threefifths of the senate votes to do so projected budget surpluses and federal debt federal budget surpluses with and without social securitya by fiscal year in billions 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006
