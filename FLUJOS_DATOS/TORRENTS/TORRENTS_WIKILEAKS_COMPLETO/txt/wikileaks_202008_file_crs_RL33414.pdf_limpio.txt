insurance policies taken out by and payable to companies on their employees directors officers owners and debtors are commonly k nown as corporate or company owned life insurance coli policies such policies are separate and distinct from typical group life insurance policies offered to many employees as an employment benefit in general only the company not the employees family or other beneficiary receives any benefit from coli policy in some cases employees or their families have knowledge of any policy being taken out concerns about people gambling on the deaths of strangers has led to insurable interest laws in most states that require some possibility of financial loss as the result of an insureds death as prerequisite for the purchase of life insurance although employment has generally been accepted to fulfill the need for an insurable interest many have expressed concern about employers holding policies on lowerpaid employees and continuing to hold policies after worker has left employment although the chief historical justification for the favorable tax treatment of life insurance focuses on individuals not companies coli policies enjoy the same basic preferences as other life insurance as result corporation enjoys either taxdeferred or taxfree growth of funds invested in coli plans these tax preferences are large reason for companies to choose coli policies rather than simply investing the money in more straightforward way moreover under certain circumstances companies have taken loans using the cash value of the life insurance policy as collateral used the loan proceeds to pay for the premiums of the life insurance policies and then deducted the interest expense from their taxable income further enhancing the advantages of colirelated transactions in the past congress has restricted the instances in which this interest is allowed to be tax deductible legislation on coli was first introduced by representative gene green in the 107 th congress in the 110th congress representative greens bill the life insurance employee notification act hr 150 was introduced january 4 2007 the 108th congress saw several bills introduced and both floor and committee amendments on the issue while language somewhat limiting coli and requiring employee notice and consent was agreed to in the senate finance committee in 2004 and attached to s 2424 the 108 th congress did not enact any coli legislation into law legislation in the 109th congress with the senate finance committee language regarding coli included s 219 s 1783 s 1953 hr 4 hr 2251 and hr 2830 ultimately the 109th congress passed hr 4 and it was signed by the president on august 17 2006 this report begins with general background on coli followed by an overview of the congressional activity of the past few years it then addresses federal limitations on coli from previous years discusses state approaches to the issue and concludes with an analysis of the issue from publicfinance perspective it will be updated in the event that legislation dealing with coli progresses

g343g561g11g151g157g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561 life insurance policies taken out by and payable to companies on their employees directors officers owners and debtors are commonly k nown as corporate or company owned life insurance coli policies such policies enjoy th same two basic preferences under the tax laws as other life insurance1 first death benefits paid under life insurance policies are not taxable income to the beneficiaries of the policies second increases in the value of the policies over and above the premiums paid that result from investment earnings on such premiums are not taxable unless the policy is surrendered prior to the death of the insured this second preference is generally referred to as the taxfree inside buildup of life insurance 2 therefore the corporation enjoys either taxdeferred growth or taxfree grow th of funds invested in coli plans this tax treatment of coli policies explains large portion of their usage because it is certainly possible for corporation to make similar investment without the complication of life insurance policy without the life insurance policy however such investments would be subject to regular taxation in addition under certain circumstances companies have deducted the interest expense for loans from coli policies from their taxes some companie s have then used the loan proceeds to pay for the premiums of the life insurance policies further enhancing the advantages of colirelated transactions congress has increasingly restricted the instances in which this interest is allowed to be tax deductible the payment of premiums by the company on the other hand is not tax deductible while the federal tax preferences for life insurance have been enacted by congress the ability of firms as well as individuals to purchase such insurance in the first place is regulated by the states because of this the state and federal governments effectively have joint role in the regulation of life insurance policies for tax purposes the most basic requirement that states have instituted for purchasers of life insurance is that policyholder must be able to demonstrate an insurable interest in the insured 3 companies have typically justified an insurable interest in employees officers directors and owners based on the potential financial costs associated with the death of those individuals some states require the insurable interest to be established only at the time the insurance is purchased therefore companies may continue to hold life insurance policies and enjoy the tax advantages of coli po licies covering insureds longer employed by the company g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561g152g151g561g5g17g14g11g561 coli can be acquired on an individual or group basis and the employer generally becomes the applicant owner premium payer and beneficiary of the policy because the corporation pays all of the premiums and receives all of the benefits neither the individuals actually insured nor their heirs receive any of the death benefits thus coli is not an employee benefit and should not be confused with group life insurance benefits that employers provide to their employees

taxfree growth within life insurance policies see crs report rs20923 taxes and the inside buildup of life insurance recent issues by david l brumbaugh 3 an insurable interest is an interest that might be damaged by the death of the insured individual

man insurance have been used by corporations to insure the lives of their top executives and to protect themselves against the death of those key employees who are especially difficult or costly to replace other related uses of narrowbased coli programs have incl uded the financing of individual stock redemption agreements or deferred compensation plans for key employees according to news reports4 some companies have used broadbased coli programs that cover not only key officials but all or most of corporations employees this relatively new application of the principles of coli apparently developed to generate funding source for other corporate purposes eg executive benefits supplemental pensions and broader employment related benefits such as retiree medical plans the use of coli to fund retiree medical benefits is largely attributable to the promulgation of statement 106 by the financial accounting standards board fasb 106 under fasb 106 postretirement benefits including retiree health benefits are required to be recognized as cost as they are earned over the working lifetime of the employee rather than as they are paid after retirement if these accrued benefits are not funded in some manner they create growing balance sheet liability the coli benefits accruing to corporation fr om the death payouts on employees and the tax free inside buildup in the value of the policies can be used to create balance sheet asset that the corporation can use to offset the liability and finance the cost of retiree benefits advocates of using coli to finance such postretirement benefits assert that without such funding many companies would discontinue their voluntary retirement health benefits on the other hand critics claim that companies should not profit from the deaths of rankandfile employees sometimes referring to coli as janitors insurance or dead peasant insurance and note that although companies claim to be using coli to finance employee benefits there is regulation of this use as there is for benefit plans under the employee retirement income security act erisa which also provides for taxpreferred investments to fund employee benefits when banks purchase coli policies they are sometimes referred to as bankowned life insurance boli policies in 1996 the office of the comptroller of the currency occ issued general guidelines for national banks to ensure that bank purchases of boli are consistent with safe and sound banking practices 5 the occ determined that purchase of life insurance is incidental to banking and therefore legally permissible if it is convenient or useful in connection with the conduct of the banks business the occ gu idelines specifically state that national banks may use coli as financing or cost recovery vehicle for pre and postretirement employee benefits that the value of coli is corporate asset even after the employeremployee relationship is terminated and that employees have interest in the insurance other than their general claim against corporate assets arising fr om the corporations obligation to provide the stated benefits in april 2002 the wall street journal initiated

into coli policies insuring thousands of employees the articles pointed out that the death benefits paid to the corporations on their coli policies were tax free and that the value of the coli policies in force also yielded tax free income on their inside buildup although most corporations surveyed by the wall street journal indicated that they use the money from coli insurance benefits to help pay for various employee and retiree benefits some used the benefits for other purposes such as executive compensation the may 2 article stated that some of the largest us banks hold billions of dollars in coli insurance on their present and former employees and the april 26 article alleged that some banks receive as much as 10 to 15 of their net income from the taxfree earnings they get on premiums they pay on coli policies following the wall street journal series other major newspapers including the washington post 7 carried articles critical of coliboli

state regulatory system the congressional approaches to addressing questionable coli practices would address such practices without directly preempting states these approaches include using the federal trade commissions power over unfair trade practices and placing requirements on the taxfree usage of coli ultimately congress passed hr 4 in the 109 th congress enacting an approach based around the tax code g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g343g343g342g157g145g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561 hr 150 the life insurance employee

language section 812 adding requirements to the tax code in order for coli policy to enjoy the typical tax advantages of life insurance these requirements are that these policies must be on directors or highly compensated individuals and that insured employees must be notified and provide written consent at the time the life insurance contract is issued companies are also required to file return with the secretary of the treasury detailing their usage of coli policies s 2424 was reported by the finance committee but not acted upon by the full senate before the end of the 108 th congress

2003 it was followed by an additional markup of the draft s 2424 on february 2 2004 at this markup senator bingamans amendment was replaced with modification presented by the chairman this modification ultimately included in s 2424 and subsequent legislation was strongly supported by the life insurance industry it retained the ta xpreferred nature of coli for policies that met notification and consent requirements and that were restricted to highly compensated employees including key persons 12 the joint committee on taxations revenue estimate indicated that this amendment would have negligible revenue impact suggesting that the total volume of coli usage by corporations will not be significantly affected in addition to this legislative activity the joint committee on

congress capped deductible interest for indebtedness exceeding 50000 per individual contract14 only interest on loans related to policies purchased after june 20 1986 was specifically covered it has been suggested that companies responded to this limitation by expanding the coverage of life insurance from upper management to rank and file employees thus generating more coli related loans albeit at the capped amount15 in 1996 congress approved legislation that entirely eliminated with phaseout rule the interest deduction for loans on policies covering employees or officers except for key persons 16 further congress capped deductible interest rates on key persons and pre1986 contracts based on an average corporate bond rate at least one business reacted by proposing to expand life insurance contract coverage and related taxadvantaged loans to policies covering customers specifically mortgagors17 congress addressed this behavioral response in 1997 by further restricting interest

cash value of corporations life insurance policies to corporations total assets however policies for employees directors officers and specified owners were explicitly excluded from this calculation suggesting the change was intended to address specific policies such as those covering borrowers this mechanical approach has the effect of disallowing the interest deduction for cases such as lender policies covering mortgagors in addition to the increased restrictions congress imposed on coli interest deductions the internal revenue service irs successfully litigated several cases of what it considered to be abuse19 also the irs offered settlement initiative to encourage the disclosure of questionable transactions and induce payment of portion of the presumed tax liability given the several restrictions imposed it is useful to identify the type of interest expense associated with coli loans that continues to be tax deductible interest deductions on debt related to coli remain for at least two types of policies contracts purchased on or before june 20 1986 as result of the tax reform acts grandfather rule and policies covering key persons furthermore because debt is fungible and because the interest expense company pays to support investment in general is tax deductible some companies may borrow for other purposes and simultaneously have the finances available to purchase taxadvantaged coli policies under such circumstances debt that is in fact used to finance coli is difficult to distinguish from that which is not president clinton included an expansion of the pro rata limitation for interest expense deductions as component of his fy1999 2000 and 2001 budget proposals these proposals would have expanded the mechanical pro rata approach passed in 1997 by eliminating the exceptions from the calculation other than for 20 owners however the proposals were not adopted the joint committee on taxation estimated that disallowing interest deductions in relation to the proportion of assets invested in coli would have generated 200 million in additional revenue in fy2004 and 58 billion over the followin g 10 years fy2004 through fy2013 20

insurance companies have been regulated by the states for the past 150 years21 state laws in the large majority of states require that to purchase coli the employer must have an insurable interest in the life of an insured employee however the exact wording of these statutes varies in general the state statutes provide that an insurable intere st exists if the insured employees would benefit from an employee benefit plan provided by the employer or that the insurable interest depends on continued pro rata allocation 19 see winndixie stores inc v commissioner 113 tc 254 1999 internal revenue

provide for an insurable interest in both situations if an insurable interest does exist the next issue under state laws is whether companies must give notice to or receive the consent of employees covered under coli policy at least 48 states now have laws requiring some form of notification or consent from an insured employee before coli policy can be issued number of states require actual consent optin some in writing but others assume consent if the employee does not object optout in 1993 state insurance regulators through their trade association the national association of insurance commissioners naic adopted model coli guidelines explaini ng that coli is generally used to provide employee benefits such as retiree health benefit plan following the controversy generated on the issue the naic revised these guidelines at the end of 2002 the revised naic guidelines recommend that states considering legislative response to insurable interest concerns should consider the following elements for inclusion in their law 2002 additions in italics 1 the law should recognize that employers have lawful and substantial economic interest in the lives of key employees and in other employees who have reasonable expectation of benefitting from an employee welfare benefit plan 2 employers should be required to notify eligible employees of their proposed participation in the plan and the employees should be given an opportunity to refuse to participate on prospective basis employers should obtain written consent of each individual being insured consent would include an acknowledgment that the employer may maintain the life insurance coverage even fter the insured individuals employment has terminated 3 an employer shall not retaliate in any m anner against an employee or retired employee for refusing consent to be insured 4 for nonkey or nonmanagerial employees the amount of coverage should be reasonably related to the benefits provided to the employees 5 with respect to employerprovided pension and welfare benefit plans the life insurance coverage purchased to finance the plans should only be allowed on the lives of those employees and retirees who at the time their lives are first insured under the plan would be eligible to participate in the plan 22 because the naic has ability to compel the states to act on this or any other issue these revisions would become effective only on statebystate basis as state legislatures enact laws following the guidelines meanwhile as to boli policies held by banks occ guidelines applicable to national banks encourage compliance with other applicable legal and regulatory considerations such as state insurable interest laws but do not specifically address the issue of employee notification or consent

encourage behavior that improves the financial security of surviving family members particularly widows and orphans supporters of the coli tax advantages assert that companies purchase policies for two fundamental purposes to meet and structure payments for employee benefits and to protect against potential financial losses in the event of the death of the insured they add that such losses may be particularly significant for small businesses with small contingent of integral employees with regard to employee benefits proponents indicate that coli provides an important financing vehicle with known premium expenses that can ultimately provide stream of earnings to match expected employee benefit liabilities 24 critics question the motivation of colirelated transactions and assert some companies primarily purchase policies to take advantage of the taxfree investment buildup within life insurance policies coupled with taxdeductible interest on related loans critics argue that some companies may simply be taking advantage of the asymmetrical tax treatment stories in the media about surviving family members who were not beneficiaries of life insurance policy themselves while the onetime employer of the insured benefits from taxfree profits at the time of death may fuel the negative appearance of the transactions according to economic theory the primary justific ation for preferences in the tax code is to address market failures in particular provisions in the tax code can be used to encourage or restrain certain behaviors for example common market failure related to the provision of insurance is that of adverse selection adverse selection refers to condition in which policies of high risk enter an insurance pool and due to the in creased risk bid up the cost of the provision of insurance as result lowrisk policies often drop out of the pool and spiraling of costs can ensue if adverse selection presents itself in the market for life insurance under coli then offering tax preferences for coli particularly for policies covering key persons may encourage additional life insurance in market that would purchase less than the optimum amount absent tax advantages all else being equal comparable argument for market failure might be constructed to the extent that it can be shown an incentive is needed to encourage the secure financing of employee benefits but any attempt to offer tax preference to life insurance explicitly puts this investment vehicle at distinct advantage over other investment optio ns that lack such preferences and if the market failure does not exist may encourage overinvestment in life insurance economic theory indicates that absent market failures market prices and returns that are undistorted by tax benefits or penalties are the most efficient way to allocate investment resources another issue is whether existing restrictions on interest on colirelated loans are appropriately designed recurring concern of policymakers over the past two decades has been borrowing from the life insurance policy with taxdeductible interest to pay for coli premiums and offset taxable earnings from unrelated investments 25

against interest deductions further the indebtedness is limited to 50000 for key persons and the applicable interest rate is capped on deductions for both groups however when debt is fungible it is possible that companys overall indebtedness could indirectly support taxpreferred investment in coli currently the irs must attempt to link deductible interest and premiums paid in order to enforce the provisions of law that said there may exist an opportunity to claim an interest deduction on funds borrowed to reduce earned taxable income and fund the premiums of tax advantaged investment one approach advanced to resolve the issue of llowing indirect interest deductions has been to expand the allocation methodology used to disallow interest deductions on policies not covering employees officers directors and specified owners such an approach presumes all assets throughout company are equally financed through the same aggregate proportion of debt and equity opponents of this approach argue that it would amount to tax penalty as it would prohibit the deductibility of unrelated business interest solely because of the ownership of life insurance
