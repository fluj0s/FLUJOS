6401c07 shspec2 good indicators some of the material in this tape is also contained in hcob 28dec63 routine vi indicators part one good indicators the good indicators listed in hcob 28dec63 dont all apply to all sessions but most do they dont just apply to r6 sessions for definition of r6 see p 568 above if you learn what good indicators are you can spot bad indicators an auditor tends to look for wrongnesses that is the nature of scientology because if there werent something wrong with man he wouldnt be here unlike other ologies we see an individual as basically good able and powerful this is the reverse of most peoples approach so the way have to improve man is also different we have tremendous evidence that our concept is true and that the opposite one is erroneous for instance we found that childrens iqs drop more and more the longer they spend in school because the longer they stay there the more false stable data get shoved down their throats truth is demonstrated by workability though some dispute truth because its workability challenges their favorite theories all present sciences have built up to their current state on the basis of workability the idea of deleting something in order to bring about recovery from bad condition is not new with us but the simplicity of asking someone for solutions that he has had to the condition is new departure you can ask what solutions and decisions person has had relative to his lumbosis and get recovery from deletion of additives this is all part of the idea that adding something to being makes him feel worse take being who is feeling blah when we put in midruds we are subtracting actions we are subtracting the livingness of some period and he will feel better lrh has made more extreme test of this theory he subtracted an insane beings body from him by exteriorizing him when exteriorized the being was immediately sane back in his body he was insane again this is not therapeutic it is just an experimental technique the good things of life are havingness at ones own choice the individuals power of choice is the only thing he had to begin with which gave him power capability etc that power of choice has been consistently and continually overthrown by giving him things he didnt want and taking away from him things that he did want someone who solves something and fixes the solution instead of just confronting the thing is putting himself down in power in scientology the only right we have to educate anyone is that we are teaching things that are as close to fact as they can be made and the technology of how it is put together is so close to how it is put together that it runs itself out this is the reason why scientology education doesnt have to usual bad effects of education scientology education runs itself out because it is so close to the truth whenever you have solution to problem it gets stuck except in the case of scientology scientology is the only solution in the universe that erases itself you can do almost anything with scientology because of this when scientology solves something it solves what has solved it its truths are shown to you so that you can reach other truths the data of scientology is so minor so sweet and so pure compared to all the other types of solutions gpms ris service facs electric shock treatment etc that we dont come under the heading of adding aberrative data to the individual as solution to his difficulties even if scientology data sits there for awhile on top of some aberration it will eventually reach through the thing on which it is sitting uproot it and the truth of the data will cause it to blow asis along with what it solved you are all sitting in some ri that could behave in this way an individual becomes aberrated by additives his experiences in this universe are calculated to degrade and depower him all you have to do is to pick up to asis the mess and you will return him to power if you handle his school education for example his iq will rise the data of scientology is restimulation of more basic and fundamental truths which restimulated tend to blow later data some people can just study scientology and leap out of bed well this adds up to the fact that man to date is an addedto being everything that has been added to him has decreased his ability to cope we have gotten him dependent on tools and that sort of thing the more you give person to work with eg the more machines etc he is supposed to work with the less he works his ability to work is reduced by these additives primitive cultures with minimal tools work long and thoroughly to create aesthetic elements as part of ordinary workaday objects someone with lots of tools doesnt get much done for instance the esquimo with very simple tools elaborately decorates his spear whereas the person with drill presses lathes etc says i cant do this thing because i have to have that other thing first theres relationship between having to have and getting things done the more you have the less you tend to get done have to have becomes never do the fellow who has to have and have in order to get anything done does very little the chinese carpenter working with handmade fish bone dowels and bowdrill didnt have to have anything elaborate to drill hole etc yet he was able to get more done by good deal than his western counterpart with his elaborate tools you could have added to the universe of this chinese carpenter the postulate that you cant do without certain tools think about that wording to the point where he could longer do that is an aberrative side to some thetans bent for collecting havingness eg lrh and his cameras in collecting cameras he has paid less attention to any one of them so now he gets fewer pictures with more cameras there can be minimum amount of equipment needed to get job done but an overwhelmed being has to have and cant do the more you add to the workman the less he can accomplish because we are in the business of deleting wrongnesses from the individual we seldom look at rightnesses that is what is wrong with most auditors the recognition of the fact that truth is present to be amplified or increased is vital part of auditing if you dont notice the rightnesses present you dont see the truth present that can then be used to promote more truth so nothing gets done if you only recognize wrongnesses you wont be able to pull anything up gradient because you wont think that you have any rightnesses to work with our only purpose in finding wrongnesses is to increase rightnesses you have to look at wrongnesses to remedy them but you have to look at rightnesses to increase them progress is built on gradient scale of rightnesses by which you delete wrongnesses and they drop away processing is an action by which wrongnesses can be deleted from the case to the degree that rightness is present in the session you cannot take case that has rightnesses present and delete any wrongnesses auditing is the process of maintaining rightness so that you can delete wrongness you are trying to get right being if you dont continuously encourage right beingness you will never get right being to correct wrongness you have to have at least as much rightness present if rightness and wrongness are equally balanced it is dangerous situation you are better off if the rightnesses far outweigh the wrongnesses this will give you an easier job of auditing the pcs ability to asis is rightness of varying magnitude pc who is pretty overwhelmed cant handle or asis large wrongness if you delete good indicators from the session the pc wont be able to asis anything pcs ability to asis or erase in session is directly proportional to the number of good indicators present in the session and his inability to cope in the session rises proportionally to the number of bad indicators in the session if the good indicators have dropped out of the session the pcs ability to handle wrongnesses is much less you have got to get gis back in before you can expect the pc to handle what you want him to handle you have to retrograde the process to match the state of the pc if he becomes bis for instance you may have to run the pc on touch assist or havingness you must watch and if good indicator goes out you look for the bad indicator if you are slow find out what happened and correct it bad indicators dont necessarily appear when good indicators disappear they are separate breeds of cat the auditor must always find out what is wrong in session before the pc finds out that is how you maintain altitude to maintain optimal altitude handle the scene when the good indicator goes out but before the bad indicator comes in spotting the absence of good indicator and remedying the situation with remedy of appropriate magnitude will avoid the expense of auditing time on expensive repairs light indicator means that you should be alert medium indicator requires correction heavy indicator means emergency any process has its own series of bad indicators bad indicators come in when good indicators go out dont spend your time looking for bad indicators just know the good indicators so well that when one of them goes out climb on and handle be alert but dont always be looking for wrongnesses good indicators in routine 6 and lower levels 1 pc cheerful in r6 misemotion is allowable at lower levels for instance the good indicator would be the pc getting more cheerful in r3r misemotion should be diminishing but at level vi the pc should be running like grinning idiot 2 pc cogniting this should happen sometimes on any level lack of cognition indicates that the pc has ptp or an arc break or that he is running at level above his reality at lower levels the good indicator would be the pc cogniting at level vi the pc should be cogniting on ris and goals 3 pcs items found are the ones that the pc thought they were at lower levels it often turns out that what the pc thought was wrong is what was wrong the pcs fundamental rightnesses assert themselves 4 at level vi pc listing items briefly and accurately at lower levels the good indicator is giving things to the auditor briefly and accurately the pc is finding things accurately and speedily 5 properlyreading meter at level vi items found are not rocketreading at lower levels things found give the proper meter responses 6 at level vi short item lists at lower levels it doesnt take long time to get things done 7 items found without lot of wrassle at lower level this translates as being able to get data from the pc without big hassle 8 ta continuing in motion ta not stuck this good indicator can be overridden by the good indicator of the pc easily and rapidly flattening processes 9 active needle the needle is fluid or fluent moving not stuck mark v meter can be set at too high sensitivity giving the appearance of more fluidlooking needle than you really have it moves around on the other hand you may need high sensitivity for pulling withholds etc where it doesnt matter if you clean clean once in awhile on the other hand if you leave the withhold by using too low sensitivity you have had it for r6 sensitivity 8 is maximum for listing and 16 for midruds you can have ta action with gummy needle watch for that this is still missing gi the needle should be swinging cleanly 10 pc not being troubled by pains and somatics when answering auditing questions or any somatic the pc runs into discharges very rapidly somatic that stays there and gets heavier is bad indicator you want change somatics 11 ta goes down when pc cognites you should get further blowdown of the ta when the pc talks about something 12 pc gets warm and stays warm in auditing or gets hot and unheats in auditing the pc doesnt get chilled getting chilled is bi 13 pcs somatics turn on occasionally this is gi at lower levels it is bi in r6 14 ta range 25 to 375 ta range 225 to 30 is excellent this applies at any level 15 good ta action on spotting things the expected ta action for any level is the best indicator 16 getting reads on what you and the pc think is wrong 17 pc has ptp this is good indicator unless the pc is in total propitiation the bad indicator would be the pcs developing ptps about the session in session 18 pc satisfied after auditing and staying certain of the auditing solution 19 pc not critical or arc breaky always gis 20 pc happy and satisfied with the auditor regardless of what the auditor is doing 21 pc looking younger by reason of auditing this is not common but it is good indicator 22 pc without weariness 23 pc without aches pains or illnesses developed in auditing 24 pc wanting more auditing 25 pc confident and getting more confident 26 pcs itsa free but only extensive enough to cover the subject under discussion if the pcs itsa is too extensive he is trying to stop the auditor from auditing the pc should itsa but not too much 27 auditor understanding why it is the way it is when the pc explains it or how it was the way it was the pc is saying things that make sense the auditor should be able to understand the pc 28 pc there under his own volition taken from next tape if all these good indicators are present you know that you are doing good job
