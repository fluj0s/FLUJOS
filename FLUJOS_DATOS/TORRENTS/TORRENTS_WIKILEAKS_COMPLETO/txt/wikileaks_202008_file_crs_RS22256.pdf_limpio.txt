1960s as first the warren and then the burger court grappled with the seemingly intractable problem of racial segregation in the nations public schools1 judicial rulings from this period recognized an affirmative duty cast upon local school boards by the equal protection clause to desegregate formerly dual school systems and to eliminate root and branch the last vestiges of state enforced segregation2 these holdings ushered in two decade era of massive desegregation first in the south and later the urban northmarked by federal desegregation orders frequently requiring drastic reconfiguration of school attendance patterns along racial lines and extensive student transportation schemes school districts across the nation operating under these decrees later sought to be declared in compliance with constitutional requirements in order to gain release from federal intervention the supreme court eventually responded by holding that judicial control of school system previously found guilty of intentional segregation should be relinquished if looking to all aspects of school operations it appears that the district has complied with desegregation requirements in good faith for reasonable period of time and has eliminated vestiges of past discrimination to the extent practicable 3 following the courts lead congress and the executive approved panoply of laws and regulations authorizing either directly or by judicial or administrative interpretation race conscious strategies to promote minority opportunity in jobs education and governmental contracting the basic statutory framework for affirmative action in employment and education derives from the civil rights act of 1964 public and private employers with 15 or more employees are subject to comprehensive code of equal employment opportunity regulations under title vii of the 1964 act 4 the title vii remedial scheme rests largely on judicial power to order monetary damages and injunctive relief including such affirmative action as may be appropriate to make discrimination victims whole except as may be imposed by court order or consent decree to remedy past discrimination however there is general statutory obligation on employers to adopt affirmative action remedies official approval of affirmative action remedies was further codified by federal regu lations construing the 1964 acts title vi which prohibits racial or ethnic discrimination in all federally assisted programs and activities 5 including public or private educational institutions the office of civil rights of the department of education interpreted title vi to require schools and colleges to take affirmative action to overcome the effects of past discrimination and to encourage affirmative action even in the absence of past discrimination to overcome the effects of conditions which resulted in limiting participation by persons of particular race color or national origin6 since the early 1960s minority participation goals have also been integral to executive branch enforcement of minority hiring and employment standards on federally financed construction projects and in connection with other large federal contracts executive order 11246 as presently administered by the office of federal contract compliance programs requires that all employers with 50 or more employees and federal contracts in excess of 50000 file written affirmative 1 this report was originally prepared by charles v dale legislative attorney 2 see eg green v county bd 391 us 430 1968 swann v bd of educ 402 us

maximum practicable opportunity for minority and female contractors 9 in addition 10 of federal highway and surface transportation project funds must be set aside for small disadvantaged firms through the end of fy200910 by the mid1980s the supreme court had approved the temporary remedial use of race or genderconscious selection criteria by private employers under title vii these measures were deemed proper remedy for manifest racial imbalance in traditionally segregated job categories if voluntarily adopted by the employer11 or for entrenched patterns of egregious and longstanding discrimination by the em ployer if imposed by judicial decree12 in either circumstance however the court required proof of remedial justification rooted in the employers own past discrimination and its persistent workplace effects thus firm basis in evidence as revealed by manifest imbalanceor historic persistent and egregious underrepresentationof minorities or women in affected job categories was deemed an essential predicate to preferential affirmative action of equal importance all racial preferences in employment were to be judged in terms of their adverse impact on identifiable nonminority group members remedies that protected minorities from layoff for example were most suspect and unlikely to pass muster if they displaced more senior white workers 13 but the consideration of race or gender as plus factor in employment decisions when it did not unduly hinder or trammel the legitimate expectations of nonminority employees won ready judicial 7 42 usc 2000e16b1 5 usc 7201

sufficiently flexible temporary in duration and narrowly tailored to avoid becoming rigid quotas14 the regents of the university of california v bakke ruling in 1978 launched the contemporary constitutional debate over statesponsored affirmative action notable lack of unanimity was evident from the six separate opinions filed in that case one fourjustice plurality in bakke voted to strike down as violation of title vi special admissions program of the university of california at davis medical school which set aside sixteen of one hundred positions in each incoming class for minority students where the institution itself was not shown to have discriminated in the past another bloc of four justices argued that racial classifications designed to further remedial purposes were foreclosed neither by the constitution nor the civil rights act and would have upheld the minority admissions quota justice powell added fifth vote to each camp by condemning the davis program on equal protection grounds while endorsing the nonexclusive consideration of race as an admissions criteria to foster student diversity 15 in justice powells view neither the states asserted interest in remedying societal discrimination nor of providing role mode ls for minority students was sufficiently compelling to warrant the use of suspect racial classification in the admission process but the attainment of diverse student body was for justice powell clearly permissible goal for an institution of higher education since diversity of minority viewpoints furthered academic freedom special concern of the first amendment 16 accordingly race could be considered by university as plus or one element of range of factorseven if it tipped the scale among qualified applicantsas long as it did not insulate the individual from comparison with all the other candidates for the available seats17 the quota in bakke was infirm however since it defined diversity only in racial terms and absolutely excluded nonminorities from given number of seats by two 5to4 votes therefore the supreme court affirmed the lower court order admitting bakke but reversed the judicial ban on consideration of race in admissions the powell opinion in bakke may help to explain the conflicting results reached by the court in the michigan law school and undergraduate admissions cases in grutter v bollinger 18 5 to 4 majority of the justices led by justice oconnor held that the universitys law school had compelling interest in the educational benefits that flow from diverse student body which justified its consideration of race in admissions to assemble critical mass of underrepresented minority students but in gratz v bollinger 19 six justices decided that the universitys undergraduate policy of awarding racial bonus points to minority applicants was not narrowly tailored enough to pass constitutional muster the law school program was deemed constitutional because it was based on an individualized holistic review of each applicants file in contrast to the undergraduate program which did not provide for meaningful individualized review of applicants but instead assigned every underrepresented minority applicant the same automatic 20point bonus without consideration of the particular 14 united states v paradise 480 us 149 1987 johnson v transp agency 480 us 616 1987 for

in effect grutter enshrined in law the powell diversity rationaleembraced by other justice in bakke that the state has compelling interest in promoting racial diversity in higher education in another series of decisions the court approved of congressionally mandated racial preferences to allocate the benefits of contracts on federally sponsored public works projects fullilove v klutznick 21 while condemning similar actions taken by local governmental entities to promote public contracting opportunities for minority entrepreneurs city of richmond v ja croson co22 contextual differences in the particular kind of governmental activity being challenged frequently account for variations in judicial approach to affirmative action in public employment government contracting admission to public institutions of higher education and election redistricting23 almost uniformly however the law has been marked by failure of consensus on most issues with bare majorities pluralities oras in bakke single justice determining the law of the case not until 1989 did majority of the justices resolve the proper constitutional standard for review of governmental classifications by race enacted for remedial or other benign legislative purpose disputes prior to the city of richmond case yielded divergent views as to whether state affirmative action measures for the benefit of racial minorities were subject to the same strict scrutiny as applied to invidious racial discrimination under the equal protection clause an intermediate standard resembling the test for genderbased classifications or simple rationality in city of richmond 5 to 4 majority settled on strict scrutiny to invalidate 30 setaside of city contracts for minorityowned businesses because the program was not narrowly tailored to compelling governmental interest while race conscious remedies could be legislated in response to proven past discrimination by the affected governmental entities racial balancing untailored to specific and identified evid ence of minority exclusion was impermissible city of richmond suggested however that because of its unique equal protection enforcement authority constitutional standard more tolerant of racial linedrawing may apply to congress this conclusion was reinforced year later when in metro broadcasting inc v fcc 24 the court upheld certain preferences for minorities in broadcast licensing proceedings approved by congress not as remedy for past discrimination but to promote the important governmental interest in broadcast diversity this twotiered approach to equal protection analysis of governmental affirmative action was shortlived however in adarand constructors inc v pena 25 the court applied strict scrutiny to federal transportation program of financial incentives for prime contractors who subcontracted to firms owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals defined so as to prefer members of designated racial minorities although the court refrained from deciding the constitutional merits of the particular program before it and remanded for further proceedings below it determined that all racial classifications by government at

tailored to that end but the majority opinion by justice oconnor sought to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is strict in theory but fatal in fact by acknowledging role for congress as architect of remedies for discrimination nationwide the unhappy persistence of both the practices and lingering effects of racial discrimination against minorities in this country is an unfortunate reality and the government is not disqualified from acting in response to it further guidance is provided however as to the scope of remedial power remaining in congressional hands or of the conditions required for its exercise bottom line adarand suggests that racial preferences in federal law are remedy of last resort which must be adequately justified and narrowly drawn to pass constitutional muster more recently the court agreed to review new legal questions regarding racial diversity in education although the grutter and gratz decisions settled the question of whether racebased policies to promote diversity in higher education are ever constitutionally acceptable the decision did not address whether diversity is permissible goal in the elementary and secondary educational setting to resolve this question the supreme court agreed to review two cases that involved the use of race to maintain racially diverse public schools in seattle and louisville in parents involved in community schools v seattle school district 1 consolidated ruling that resolved both cases the court in fractured decision struck down the school plans at issue holding that they violated the equal protection guarantee of the fourteenth amendment 26 announcing the judgment of the court was chief ju stice roberts who led plurality of four justices in concluding that the school plans were unconstitutional because they did not serve compelling governmental interest although justice kennedy concurred in the courts judgment striking down the plans he declined to sign on to the plurality opinion in full in part because he disagreed with its implication that diversity in elementary and secondary education at least as properly defined does not serve compelling governmental interest according to justice kennedy diversity depending on its meaning and definition is compelling educational goal school district may pursue 27 but neither seattle nor louisville had shown that its plans served compelling interest in promoting diversity or that the plans were narrowly tailored to achieve that goal the courts ruling appears to indicate that raceconscious measures to promote racial diversity in public education remain constitutionally permissible in theory although in practice it is less clear what types of programs the court would consider to be sufficiently narrowly tailored to pass constitutional muster
