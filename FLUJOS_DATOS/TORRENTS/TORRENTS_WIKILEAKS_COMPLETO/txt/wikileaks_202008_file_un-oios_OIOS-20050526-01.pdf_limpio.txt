previous oios audit the activities in xico have drastically changed in terms of nature and magnitude our followup therefore covered onl the issues considered still relevant which were mainly related to the implementing partner act ivities such as the closure of the trust funds for land and microcredit the naturalization of refuge and the private use of vehicles 9 the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and revie w of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations review of implementing partners 10 for the two partners reviewed comar and sf reasonable assurance could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disburs ed in accordance with the subagreements 11 comar and sf maintained computerized accou nting records which were adequate for budgetary control and reporting to unhcr their re spective internal control system was operating adequately in terms of segregation of duties super vision documentation of transactions and evidence of the controls on authorization and appro val of payments both partners maintained an interest bearing bank account and reported interest to unhcr panel of bank signatories was established and the account was operated on joint signatory basis bank reconciliations were performed on monthly basis 12 audit certificates for all partners were r eceived comars accounts for 2003 were audited by órgano interno control oic secretaria gobernación and although this organization reviewed the accounts and issued obser vations opinion was expressed on the unhcr subproject nor was separate unhcr expendit ure statement attached to their report oios recommended that romex obtain from comar an au dit certificate which includes their opinion on the unhcr subprojects romex indicated that such request was done 13 sf submitted for the years 2002 and 2003 an audit certificate relating to its global financi statements as national ngo this did not comply with the requirements of the subagreement as it does not provide specific information on the fin ancial situation of the unhcr subproject oios recommended that romex request sf to submit an audi t certificate providing the required information on the unhcr subproject romex stated that starting in 2005 sf was requested to submit an audit certificate providing the necessary information on the unhcr subproject comar 14 comar an agency of the ministry of interi or grants protection and legal status to refugees and ensures the coordination of the provision of as sistance since the signature of the 1951 conventio n by the government of mexico comar is in charge of the rsd process from the reception of the newly arrived asylum seekers to the submission of t he case to the eligibility committee ec total of 428 requests for refugee status were made in 200 4 11 months and 342 in 2003 3 15 comar is responsible for conducting the in terviews for analyzing the information obtained for performing investigation if necessar for documenting the file and for submitting it t the working group wg it usually takes between ne to two months to reach this stage the wg members meet weekly to issue recommendation to th ec based on the wg recommendation asylum seekers may be authorized to leave the migra tion centre as soon as they leave the migration centre sf assists asylum seekers without financial resources by the provision of food and accommodation the assistance is extended until the refugee has been given the temporary residency documents ie approximately 30 to 40 da ys after the decision of the ec 16 due to its composition highranking officials t he ec cannot meet more than an average of four times year this results in significant ays usually two to three months for the ec to tak decisions oios was informed that the government visages releasing the asylum seekers from the migration centre soon after the interview in cases where the first result of the interview is positive although oios is highly in favour of such measure action would be needed to find accommodation for these asylum seekers 17 considering that delays have financial i mpact on programme expenditure unhcr should take all possible action to reduce them many decis ions of the ec do not require discussion but could be taken on the basis of the wgs recommendat ion which could shorten the procedure oios recommended that romex discuss with the members of the ec the adoption of fasttrack procedures to reduce the duration of the rsd proces s for example straightforward cases which do not require extensive discussions could be circula ted to the members of the ec for their decision romex indicated that they are working actively in p romoting the adoption by congress of draft law drafted with unhcrs advice which will modify the current legislation and contribute to solving this problem recommendation head2right the unhcr regional representation in mexico should continue promoting the adoption by congress of draft law which will modify the current legislation in case such mea sure is not successful other action should be envisaged to red uce the duration of the rsd process rec 01 followup of previous oios audit 18 oios recommendations made in 2000 were t fully implemented for instance comar continued to borrow unhcr funds for government pr oject although the money was later reimbursed to the unhcr project such practice is contrary to unhcr rules and procedures and should be discontinued romex indicated that comar has committed itself to desist from this practice comar did not take timely action to stop the privat use of unhcr vehicles in september 2004 comar had to reimburse unhcr for project vehicle which was stolen when it was being used by comar staff member for priva purposes outside of working hours it was only after this incident that strict instructions w ere issued to stop the private use of unhcr vehicles by comar staff 19 following the issuance of the previous oio s report the government has agreed to absorb most of the costs related to the naturalization of refugees its contribution for finalizing the naturalization programme has been estimated at mn 2600000 approx us 236000 20 in 2000 significant number of projects were being implemented with the trust funds for land and microcredit made available by unhcr due to staff rotation in romex and in comar it was not possible to verify the microcred it funds and to determine whether the reporting 4 and handover procedures had been conducted in sa tisfactory manner regarding the trust fund for land unhcrs involvement resulted in the signa ture of an agreement for the final transfer of property to the former guatemalan refugees locally settled by the government of mexico b fronteras 21 sf provides assistance to urban refugees l iving in mexico covering the sectors of domestic needs healthnutrition community services and leg assistance 22 the report that sf submits to unhcr does n ot give details on the assistance provided in particular on the number of beneficiaries and the mount of assistance paid at the various steps of the rsd process in principle financial assistanc is provided to refugees in mexico for maximum of three months following the issuance of t he migration documents financial assistance and hotel accommodation are however provided when sylum seekers leave the migration centre 23 given that this period tends to be longer oios believes that for monitoring and planning purposes romex needs data on the cost of the assis tance provided before the issuance of the migration documents the three months of assistance paid at the issuance of the migration documents and any additional assistance paid afterw ards oios recommended that romex request sf to report on the assistance provided to asylum s eekers and recognized refugees at various steps of the rsd process and after the payment of the sta ndard assistance foreseen for three months romex indicated that they will follow the recommend ation contractual status of staff 24 sf is currently modifying the contract of its staff to consultancy contracts to avoid paying the employers contribution to the instituto mexicano seguro social imss equivalent to 40 percent of the gross salaries paid in his report the external auditor refers to the possibility tha t imss may not accept the contractual status of the s taff working for the project an eventual retroactive revision of the contribution to imss wo uld have significant impact on project expenditures oios recommended that romex ensure t hat sf is not using contractual arrangements for project staff which may be contes ted by the social security authorities and may lead to financial liabilities for the unhcr project romex indicated that in 2005 sf would change the employment contracts of its staff to re gimen honorarios commonly used in mexico by government and nongovernment institutions 25 in providing assistance sf procures some services such as hotel accommodation for asylum seekers for which the number of beneficiaries is i ncreasing in october 2004 39 persons were accommodated in hotels compared to only 12 in decem ber 2003 the previous oios audit had recommended that the process for the selection of s ervices be made competitively and be adequately documented oios did not note significant improvem ent in this regard the selection of the hotel is made after prior visit to ensure that it meets the requirements although this visit includes negotiation of the price this is not documented ios recommended that romex request sf to properly document the selection of hotels for the ccommodation of asylum seekers as well as the services provided romex indicate that they will endeavor to work with sf at finding the least costly accommodation for asylum seekers in 2005 anwhile sf will be requested to properly document the selection of hotels for the accommodat ion of the asylum seekers b other programme issues 26 oios assessed that project financial monit oring was competently performed romex carried out regular missions in the region guatema belize salvador nicaragua honduras 5 and cuba and mission reports were usually prepared some improvements were however required in planning and documenting the monitoring of activ ities where programme activities were carried out by implementing partners the mission reports d id not provide comparable information on the monitoring exercises made and did not evidence that all significant aspects of programme management were regularly reviewed 27 to facilitate subsequent monitoring missio ns and to ensure regular followup of previous missions oios recommended that romex establish sta ndard terms of reference tor for monitoring missions prepare checklist of monitor ing activities and maintain current and permanent files for each implementing partner romex indicated that standard tor and checklist were being prepared and would be used to undertake regular monitoring missions documents supporting the verification procedures sh all be collected and current and permanent files shall be opened and maintained microfinance 28 unhcr initiated microfinance programme as of dec ember 2003 contribution of us15000 was made and further us10000 is envis aged for the implementation of this activity unhcr is working with sf and microfinance instit ution the fundación dignidad fd oios found that appropriate prescreening was conducted refugee performance was monitored on regular basis and guidance was provided where requi red also monthly meetings were held to discuss individual projects fd conducts regular s ite visits as part of its programme to ensure that refugee projects are functioning as envisaged and t provide professional guidance where necessary for the current size of the projects oios conside rs the current system of monitoring performance as adequate however given that the number of pro jects is expected to grow and with larger portfolio oios recommended that additional financi indicators and information be requested to facilitate the financial monitoring which was agreed by romex c supply management procurement process 29 romex did not fully comply with unhcr proc urement rules and procedures there was focal point for procurement local contracts c ommittee lcc was not established and the documenting of procedures was weak there was not lways an invitation to bid or request for quotation tabulation of bids was not always prep ared the offers received were not always for similar goods and services and purchase order wa s not always sent to the selected supplier oios recommended that romex designate focal point for procurement establish lcc better document the procurement process and maintain proc urement files containing evidence of compliance with the unhcr procurement rules and pro cedures romex indicated that lcc was to be created with immediate effect and that ad equate procurement files had been opened in january 2005 30 due to its regional responsibility romex often procured plane tickets for regional activities since 2002 an amount of us 190000 w as paid to the same travel agency there was evidence of price comparisons or contractual greement with the supplier to ensure competitive prices in 2003 the undp resident coordinator appointed task force composed of agencies including unhcr staff to look into the issue of tra vel the procedures to select new travel agency for all agencies operating in mexico have been i nitiated the request to bid prepared is awaiting the approval of the standing committee in mexico 6 vat 31 in december 2002 the high commissioner ap proved the write off of an amount of us 190957 representing unrecoverable vat paid between 1992 and 1996 romex could not substantiate the amount as it was transferred in b ulk when unhcr took over the management of vat from unog in 1997 despite of the significant amount written off the balance of receivables for vat recorded since 1 january 1998 exceeds us 3 00000 the amount has accumulated due to the passing of vat law reform which the governme nt of mexico introduced in late 1998 this law restricts the reimbursement of vat to major pur chases and only for some commodities as consequence the total amount of vat recorded as receivable has been continually increasing for the last four years out of the us 360000 paid an d recorded since january 2000 only approximately us 68000 has been recovered 32 request for writeoff of us 310000 for vat paid between january 1998 and december 2002 was submitted to the headquarter asset managem ent board hamb in early 2004 in april 2004 the hamb submitted the request to the financi resources service frs for endorsement decision has yet been taken oios did not obtain any evidence that advice of the unhcr legal affairs section was sought on this particular request for writeoff recommendation head2right the unhcr financial resources service should seek t he advice of the unhcr legal affairs section prior to endorsi ng any further writeoffs for outstanding vat refunds in mexico r ec 02 33 to implement oios recommendation made in 2000 romex and the bureau for the americas sought the advice of the unhcr legal affai rs section to determine whether the decision of the government of mexico was common pra ctice in the region by the states party to the 1946 convention on the privileges and immunities of the various correspondences took place between unhcr and the government of mexico in part icular with the ministry of foreign affairs mfa and the treasury the mfa agreed that unhcr h as the right to be reimbursed for all vat paid for humanitarian assistance however the tre asury maintains the current position that only vat on important purchase of goods for official pur poses will be reimbursed 34 given that this does not solely affect unh cr recommended that the vat issue be raised by the united nations office of legal affair s ola on behalf of all agencies operating in mexico in letter to the permanent mission of mexico to the united nations ola pointed out that mexico was violating the convention of privile ges and immunities of united nations and the cooperation agreement between unhcr and mexico 35 in view of the significant amounts at stak and in view of the fact that the practice adopted by the mexican authorities is in violation of inter national law oios believes that unhcr should pursue the negotiations with the government on this issue at the highest level d security and safety 36 romex has demonstrated its security awaren ess and undertaken measures to improve security such as the installation of security doors at the entrance of unhcr office premises access control over the visitors entering in the buildi ng basic security training done by all staff members and regular participation to the security m anagement team meetings romex is moss compliant except that the warden system has not yet been fully implemented additional measures need to be taken by unhcr on training on fire and s ecurity evacuation 7 37 unhcr has also corresponded with centra l administration in mexico on security matters unhcr drafted note verbale to the govern ment of mexico to improve the security measures for the the main security risks are r elated to the building where unhcr premises are located given that the underground parking is n ot controlled by the there are barriers outer perimeter and shatter resistant film have not yet been installed administration 38 in the areas of administration and finance romex generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and trols were operating effectively during the period under review cash management procedures for field office tapach ula 39 since the transfer of the suboffice comit ans activities to field office fo tapachula at the end of 2002 romex has not established adequate banking and cash management procedures also petty cash imprest system or other operati onal cash system has been authorized advances of up to mn 10000 us 875 were paid and monitor ed through receivable account when additional funds were required for operational reas ons advances were paid but recorded directly as expenditures the advanced amounts were deposited i n the personal bank account of the field assistant based in tapachula such practice cont ravenes unhcr rules and procedures 40 the above arrangement does not allow for p roper segregation of duties given that the same person is responsible for receiving the advance ma king payments and subsequently reporting on the expenditure incurred we also noted that some payments were made and reco rded on the basis of either proforma invoice or memorandum by the f ield assistant which reduces the effectiveness of the financial controls over payments oios recom mended that romex establish formal cash procedure for fo tapachula request to establis h petty cash balance imprest system with an appropriate ceiling should be addressed to frs s eparate cashbook should be opened and proper delegation of signing authority should be effected petty cash balance and cashbook were authorised by frs and opened in fmis for fo tapachu as of january 2005 replenishments are to be sent through bank order addressed to the cu stodian of this petty cash cuba expenses 41 following the introduction of the atlas sy stem by undp in january 2004 romex is longer provided with copy of the supporting docum ents for payments and therefore cannot fully verify the charges made in addition romex does n ot have the necessary resources for monitoring individual assistance paid on longterm basis wh ich is the case in cuba oios recommended that measures be taken either to provide romex with the supporting documents to verify the payments made and to ensure that the accounting system can p rovide list of payments by beneficiary for the projects implemented in cuba since the oios mission the unhcr consultants in cu ba send on monthly basis scanned supporting documents of payme nts made by undp on behalf of unhcr establishing list of payment per beneficiary is h owever not feasible considering the cost involved 8 v acknowledgement 42 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and cooperation extended to the auditors by the staff of unhcr and implementing partners in mexico egbert c kaltenbach chief unhcr audit service office of
