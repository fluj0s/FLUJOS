ga listing part ii lecture given on 27 september 1962 all right this is lecture two september what twentysix audience 27 twentyseventh you got day ahead of holy cats here ive been in wednesday all the time and youre in thursday september 27 ad 12 and this is lecture number two and it continues on the subject of listing the rules of listing the rules of listing consist of good model session simple auditing minimum twoway comm rapid writing rapid writing minimal papershuffling get the goal to fire before you list goal fire list and in addition to all that be alert for free needles on lines and when some line has gone free needle you drop the number of items to be listed on it you still include it in the lineup to make sure that it doesnt till youre absolutely convinced that its going to stay that way and then you can drop it out but thats adventurous you just minimize the number of items you are listing right nowprobably this number will change this number im about to give you will alterforty lines is the current number of lines being listed on goal and those are all listed to free needle and the number of items you write on line is four and you include it in the auditing command you say give four items for the line who or what would want to catch catfish and you take your four items and if the pc forgets the auditing command you can repeat it for him but you omit the give four items you can say the line was who or what would want to catch catfish is the way you repeat it okay now thats total standardization you dont want five you dont want three now after line has gone freeand this is subject to amendation on experienceafter line has gone free you want just one if its sitting there with free needle its been sitting there with free needle you can cut down the number of items listed and you say give an item and you get one item for it that at least keeps the balance otherwise that thing is liable to jam out dont you see who or what would want to catch catfish now this permits you to catch up old lines because some lines have been listed lot longer than others dont you see because somebody has been listed on four lines or sixteen lines and therefore those lines would wind up as being overlisted theyre liable to go clear or free needle before the other lines theres possibility of this happening so this four and one proposition permits those things to catch up now however many lines are listed is not very important and exactly how you handle items after needle has gone free does not invalidate the data im giving you thats susceptible to amendation but the facts are these that you dont want to overlist free needle that is one of the rules dont overlist free needle this person is very very free and you overlist it and youre going to run into the possibility of jamming it all up again because the pc is having to create answers and you have entered in on an area called creative processing and its not permitted these days you see how that would happen all right now pc looks like hes dreaming up the lines and thinking them up and creating themactually not theyre dealt to him like stack of cards hes just dealing out the gpm hes not inventing anything until he gets to free needle and then to have an item hell have to dream up an item unless he repeats an item so you mustnt overlist free needle lines now the next thing is is what is free needle well free needle is best described as free needle somebodythis is alsoyoure going to have happy time with this more power to you i can see you now standing there somewhat overwrought having to answer off the bat three people in coaudit all of whom are asking you but what is does free needle look like and they show you proudly stage four needle you see they saythe other oneanother one is saying is free needle quarter of an inch wide or half an inch wide see is it free needle at sensitivity 16 or sensitivity l is it and the answer to that is the same answer im going to give you when you see one you will know one ive never had anybody fail to look at free needle that didnt recognize it as free needle it suddenly has become unattached to anything the needle apparently is not connected to the meter or the pc or anything its just sitting there floating and it has an odd floating characteristic that has nothing to do with falling or rising it floats up the dial and it floats down the dial the pc will be somewhere in the vicinity of clear read depending on the accuracy of your meter do you know that after youve carefully set up meter during the process of session the discharge of batteries the warmth of it the heating of the cans number of other things can change the position of the clear read did you know that so the way you handle test for whether somebody is sitting at clear is not to take the meter which you tuned up this morning and test the pc with it this afternoon you got that you have to set it up instantly before the test and the meter has to be warm okay if theres any doubt about it at all have an electrician get you five thousand ohms and twelve thousand five hundred ohms and put them on couple of clips theyre resistors and get pair of resistors you hook those between the cans and its very simple you get two resistors and just theyve got little clips on the end of them you just hook one end to one can and one end to the other can keep the cans apart and your meter should come exactly to the clear read female and the clear read male okay should come right on in other words you can tune up meter even if it were repaired by somebody and its calibration thrown out and you could know your meter sat someplace else dont you see but actually the resistors can be changed inside this by the trim knob thats why the mark iv and later designs will be found to be built with variable resistance inside the meter meters can be changed meters can be dropped you can suddenly start using new type of battery or something of the sort in meter and have some other situation set in dont you see something can happen to your meter so that it is longer accurate but as far as exactly reading on the clear read you should know that five thousand ohms and twelve thousand five hundred ohms is standardized only on fifteen people thats the original standardization and that wasnt very good standardization dont you see it was accurate it was accurate and it has held amazingly accurate but what is amazing about it is that it has held accurate do you see that whats amazing about it is that they do go to five thousand ohms for female and twelve thousand five hundred ohms for male i mean thats rather fantastic when you come to think about it how come youd think all thetans were built on the same battery circuits you know actually its just the residual resistance of the body itself and its not so amazing because body is built against certain potentials and actionselectrical potentials and body does not depend for its electrical potentials upon the mass of the body youre going to get this little fourfooteight little girl midget see heres this fourfooteight little girl shes very petite package and heres this girl who has been one of the chorus shes sixfootfour see and the little fourfooteight girl why she weighs upwards to seventy nine pounds wringing wet you see and here is this beautiful chorusiine girl and shes sixfootfour you see and built like an amazon see and she weighs something on the order of two hundred and ten pounds you see but because these are girls theyre both five thousand ohms gets you know in other words this is inserted amongst the same set of anchor points you might say its thisthisanchor points are the similarity not the mass of the body all right thats beside the point how accurate this is to some slight degree remains to be seen see how deadon this is remains to be seen i have to give you that word of warning because i tell you what the calibration was based on see based on only fifteen people all right and on an american 1957 meter something to know isnt it and i tuned up its resistances afterwards and i said thats what they are and the electronics boy scientologist there working in the organization went down immediately and you know it someits something like carrying the measurement on piece of string youve done it yourself youve taken piece of string at one end of the garden you know and carried it over to the other end of the garden to find out if you could get the chair through the gate or something you know youve done things like this well thats thats about the accuracy of it see he took the piece of string you know down to the electronics workbench and measured it actually carried the meter down and measured its ohmage now that was the score on these things now the basic datum on which this is taken is interesting its the united states army meter resistance or electrical resistance of dead body and they claim it is ten thousand ohms approximately with great differences they never noticed see they averaged this amongst men and women corpses get the idea thats the only other known datum on this now if you want to go down to mortuary sometime with volt meter why more power to you and if you do for heavens sakes send the data they got some stiffs down here and so forth there are three white men mexican negro and chinese you know and their ohmage is soandso and soandso and soandso good id be very happy to have the data you see the datas quite scarce very scarce now just with that word of warning put your reliance on the free needle now youre going to get somewhere near on your meter the m for males and the f for females but as long as its in that range dont quibble about it too much but let tell you that if men are reading at 20 with free needle and women are reading at 30 with free needle i dont know whats reading with the free needle but its not the pc see if its within tenth within quarter something like that of male or female read fine see thats fine dont argue with that too much see but whole division or swaparound that way ithats too far out now as far as somebody reading with free needle at 50nup nup nup aint never happened aint never gonna happen when they get up to 50 man there is something wrong when somebodys reading at 45 and 50 constantly and never comes down from 45 and 50 all tone arm motion is somewhere in the vicinity of 50 like 475 to 525 see youve got something wrong that we have learned that is just experiential that is absolutely completely empirical data just by observation somebodys listing and they never move off 50 and one session theyre at 525 and the next session theyre at 475 and next session theyre at 50 and they just 50 and 45 and 55 and 50 and well you better look into that man because thats one of the warning signs thats one of the warning signs thats wrong goal wrong auditor you know now these things are important to you because they are the criteria by which youre making clear it isnt whether or not the pc can spring over the back fence with one leap see or whether he can now do hundred and seventyfive handstands whereby yesterday he could only do one and collapse you see that has nothing to do with it that is spectacular but its not data clear is registered on meter not on pc because boy can you be fooled somebody can go into some tearing manic you know man theyve never been able to lift pianos before and they got one in each hand you know there they are and you say well fine hes clear yeah hes clear till that valence called hercules suddenly slips into another part of the bank you see that was always the trouble with it anyhow it was never there when it was needed long enough its not the conduct of the pc that makes clear see never now the only usethe only thing you use the pc for is to find out if the pc is looking worse now how much worse is worse well i could again see you standing in that lecture room with eighteen standing around you saying well the pc looks worse and they all think how much worse is worse see how much worse is worse is worse worse than worse or is worse worse than worse well worse is how the pc looks when theyre being audited on wrong goals or by the wrong auditor thatsthats what worse is thats how the pc looks frankly it is basically question of how old they look theres another factor which is interesting its glowingness of the skin when person is going wrong way to in goals finding or prepchecking and its all getting very weird and rough and mean or theyre being audited on wrong goal their skin goes dull very dull extremely dull so much so that i can usually tell at glance just about where somebody is in processing and how well the processing is going because its the youthness of the skin and after theyve been audited properly youll find that they glow the skin has glow to it has nothing anything to do with color its just that the skin glows and the skin doesnt glow they are not making good progress skin does glow why theyre making good progress skin was glowing yesterday isnt glowing today well theyre having bad day skin was glowing on monday but on tuesday wednesday thursday friday monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday you in observing them decide that theyre looking older and look less glowy and less glowy there is something wrong you understand theyll get less glowy for period like day or two sessions or something like that and more glowy but consistent unglowiness we dont tolerate got it itsyou might call it the firefly effect but youd be amazed now the funny part of it is is their physiological structure changes in clearing and they look older and they look worse and theytheir bones go worse body mass andcan be measured on scales but these other things arent as measurable as that their body mass will ordinarily lessen on proper auditing on the right goal itll streamline down and it will increase definitely on the wrong goal and will not decrease on bad auditing not decrease on bad auditing wont necessarily increase on bad auditing but it could but not necessarily on wrong goal it increases fantastically zoom youre liable to have him put on two three stonetwentyeight fortytwo pounds to americans i didnt get this stone stuff myself until short time ago they didnt have any weights over here they had to use stones thats anyway weight goes up on wrong goal and doesnt decrease on wrong auditing thats just casual mark not of any vast importance might be of some interest to you this glow principle is very important people run on wrong goals unglow fast the tides of night sweep across the psyche now physiological facial structure can alter too ive seen jaws jawbones decrease in size increase in size faces fill out so on quite common thing is for the face to start sinking under the wrong goal or bad auditing the face gets sinkingit starts sinking in gets flatter and starts to fill out on good auditing and the right goal the shape comes forward all of these are various manifestations and youll get little experienced on this keeping your weather eye peeled and one fine day why you get to the point where you can justactually just look at case and know whether its running right or not you know bang just like that you say well that isnt so good you would ask the auditor which lines is the pc arc broke on and the auditor would say how did you know you know youd say to the pc well are you very dizzy today oh how did you know the room is going round and round and round you see wrong suppressive auditing other things see now if the goal is found but the pc is running wrong in listing you have these items that could be in error it could be one of these one the goal could be wrong you never really trust goal till its been listed bit yeah all the other signs are fine and the wrong goal wont keep on firing and lot of other things but just for your own peace of mind why the goal is found and proven when its been checked out by afound by thean auditor checked out by another auditor and listed bit how much is bit i can see you now in the lecture room why should i dream up figures for these things you see they depend basically on observation and judgment trying to communicate them to you with bunch of invented facts would im afraid serve purpose at all now these are quite correct these six things goal could be wrong 2 lines could be wrong 3 auditor has not cleared goal by in auditing on the goal tiger drilland gotten goal reading see didnt get the goal firingnumber three 4 rudiments are out i think you possibly have heard of rudiments being out in sessions that includes of course missed withholds bulletin may the 3rd 1962 5 pc protesting about listing line or listing lineslisting and lines pcs saying whrawhrawhrane wrai dont need these listsahthawrahthanah something wrong and 6 the consequences of being cleared and that you havent paid enough attention to thats very very interesting one however pcs have been known not to put their goals on list because they were so frightened of becoming cleared what happens to you when you become cleared oooh you turn into solid glass of course and then put on display in the metropolitan museum they know what happens to you if you get clear theyof all of the aberrated balderdash and nonsense you ever want to listen to well get somebody who has beenwho has got nothing confused with having been imprisoned you know they got complete identification remember people get identifications youve heard of aaaa well its never more present than in the vicinity of the goalnever more present and they get some wild identification of some kind or another and they want to be cleared but when you come right down to asking them for their goal youll have person here or there who will suddenlyyou can hear the squeal of the brakes you know you can see the furrows in the roadway as the heels dig in and theyll have various interesting things go wrong odd part of it is this is not the thetan operating see they got valence and its having ball and of course the keynote of any valence is survival that is the common denominator of valences and things that valences do to perpetuate themselves is fantastic and one of the things that they do is resist clearing you see all the time the pc was living that life he was trying to live wasnt he he was trying to survive well this valence is just the leftover shell of that life which go ongoes on operating in the bank like thinking being well there it is and its basic motivation is to survive and all of sudden the person gets the idea that somethings going to happen to valences you know but as valence gets the idea that something is going to happen to valences you got that this is very funny as thetan the person is all the time cooperating with you to get clear see but every once in while in an auditing session or something like that particularly somebody who has goal that is in the direction of good auditing or something like thata person with goal to be good auditoryou know lets say that was the basic purpose of the person which it wouldnt be you seewe get to be good auditor and then you get him shifted and theyre in valence of pc and they arent themselves as pc ever you get the idea something weird like this going on and they set up the awfullest commotion abosometimes about going clear and they stand back and look at themselves and look at this silly mess im making now what it is you know if you ever believe it you almost crack the person up as thetan lf you really pay any real attention to this you know besides clearing it up lf you should say well he doesnt want to get clear and so on man youll see this as we go along the track here on earth youll see this theres somebody bra hes throwing brickbrats bats you know and hes drawing cartoons of us and hes raising hell with us and so forth and hes screaming in an awful fit and if you really want to break his heart just tell him well were not going to clear you maybe the very subject of the cartoons is getting clearthats terrible theyre making supermen theyre doing germans stuff and were going to be invaded again by men from mars and any kind of idiocy see and you just say to the fellow well were not going to clear you hell really go to pieces this is the most fantastic thing you ever wanted to see and if you qanda with this and if you get pc actually in there saying oh ino nothadaiisting lines is terrible and so on just finding trouble see the auditors wrong and the lines are wrong and the goal is wrong and everything is wrong and youre wrong and the room is wrong and everything is wrong and you cant audit and so forth and what did they teach you at saint hill anyhow you know on and on and on and on and on and on and so forth this could be one of the things well you dont condemn the person you simply audit it because if at any moment during all those protests you were to say well all right then i wont you should see their face sag and person will come right out of session doing that who hasnt found his goal yet or something and write down lists for you and give them to you and foree them off on you and everything else you know this is the most fantastic phenomena that you ever wanted to witness when you really see this in high bloom and you never suspect it because the person is quite often quite cooperative while theyve got their heels set covert only their cooperation will be quite real but theyve still got their heels set theres various ways of doing this the simplest one of course is what would be the consequences of my clearing you remember it must be my clearing you or our clearing you it is never whats the consequences of going clear that is wrong auditing command its generally tied up with the persons valence which is opposed to some valence that you are lets say youre male auditor and its female pc and she hates men and the consequences are not that of going clear but of being cleared by man she knows what that means and this is basically what is at the bottom of it see going clear gets associated in peoples minds with being killed and exteriorizing from dead body which of course it isnt see being cl going clear gets reactively associated with the idea of ceasing to exist they very often will give you some of the silliest answers some of the answers you hear coming off of this the person listening to them himself or herself doesnt believe them either they just sound utterly balderdash and its valence proposition is what youre looking at well if the pc is stuck that thoroughly in that valence that valence is oddly enough not going to list out um be the valence the pc doesnt see or the valence the pc sees last is the valence the pc is in most now i call to your attention the old reality scale and some of all of that data see its the last one they see is the one theyre in the most see my god itll kick up an awful fuss and youre having trouble trouble trouble well theres various reasons pcs can get arc breaks in goals finding were not touching on those now although this consequences of being cleared does enter into goals finding but it certainly enters into listing and it enters into listing more than it does goals finding person might have sat there like little wooden soldier and let you find their goal and you start listing it and this is another story because youre asking for valences and the valences restimulate and all of sudden everything is blowing up and going to blooey see yow oh you mean to say as soldier is going to get killed as mother is going to get killed as see is going to get killed i am being wiped out i am being slaughtered so forth well i dont know its exteriorizing them from valence they also restimulate of course death and getting rid of valence may restimulate the idea of exteriorization from body you see these various things how they cross up but theyre just reactive and they have basis in fact and theyre nothing to slow you down and if you dont clean it up you of course have got somebody who is ashamed of being so arc breaky and you just hung the person with shameshame so therefore they suppress this and the next moment youve got sen sen sen in all directions if you let them stack it up stack it up stack it up okay now theas i say the auditing command what iswhat would be the consequences of my clearing you what would be the consequences of our clearing you whichever seems to fit the bill and you run that and how flat do you run it well i can see you now standing in that lecture hall anyhow lets go on actually you never do patchlll give you rule for that you never do patchup jobs longer than is necessary to get done what you were trying to do in the first place now if youd just had that when you were coming up the tracki hate to be criticalbut if youd just thrown that second goal away you see at the time that it ceased to be of any use to you youd that is to say in effecting the first goalsee youre trying to effect the first goal so you get second goal and if you use this second goal longer than is necessary to get the first goal effected why then youve got your start of the bank and auditing can actually approximate that little goofball situation there so dont ever do anything longer than is necessary to get done what you are trying to do youll save more auditing time that way thats nice crude rule of thumb but its awfully good youre running ow and youre still getting needle ticks and actions when on the question but the persons needle is now smooth and you keep on running ow well youre being knucklehead of course similarly any such thing as what would be the consequences of getting clear youd run that long enough to get items on the list smoothly and without trouble because of course its just coming from valence anyhow and this process is not going to get rid of any valences trying to change the mind of machine valence or circuit is underscore thisimpossible you cannot change the mind of valence or machine or circuit its not possible you can submerge it you can suppress it you can wreck it by making it inactive you know hit ityou can hit the steam engine hard enough on the valves and controls and so forth so it apparently wont run but you cant change it into petrol engine you know say run like petrol engine and keep stoking up the boiler wont work you cant change the mind of valence that by the way goes back to the first lecture i was telling you why thought see well actually the thought is encased in mass and you can pull some of it out and you can alter it in the mass but in aggregate the mass exists on and on and on and will continue to encase thought you cantt take the thought out of the mass but you can take the mass off the thought at which moment the thought evaporates ive lectured on that before quite interesting phenomena yet you can list these consequences of being cleared out providing the consequences of being cleared arent causing suppression in the session so you see you can deintensify mind but you cannot change mind so all youre doing with this is deintensifying the objections got that when im saying mind you realize i refer to the mind of valence or the mind of circuit these are little minds that guys have stuck around their own mind the mind majeur and i was referring to the mind mineur all right somebody sooner or later though is going to take that out of context and say well ron says you cant change anybodys mind now thats an easy one and you wouldnt have any real trouble with getting this providing you do it the reason im giving you so much talk on this is it keeps getting lost because the truth is that the pc actually wants to be clear would do anything to get clear that these objections are so much of lie and are so aberrated and the pc knows they are aberrated that you very often ignore them by tacit and common consent so this is one of the things you must do in listing lets find outif were having hard time finding goal and certainly if were having hard time listingfind out what are the consequences of our clearing you or my clearing you what are the consequences of it see the goalfinding auditor actually was just finding something but the listing auditor is clearing somebody see he couldnt do it if he didnt find the goal and the goal is the important part of it but the clearing will not take place unless the listing is done dont you see so the consequences of being clear are very very important to the listing auditor youll see that tremendous number of cases go right down sometimes to the last two days before all lines go free and they just go to pieces man oh theyre up all night and they come in theres circles under their eyes that go clear down to their chin whats the matter oh well hehheh hehheh hehhehhehheh why dont we just knock all this off now and if youve run very bad sessions you dont have the pc at all you have telegram from edinburghtheyre still heading north itll just be some valence thats very very reactive and the pc just going through total dramatization on this silly valence and its deintensify and the pc will come back rather shamefacedly of themselves and you start to list them again the valence goes into full cry and they try to dive out the window see this is the wildest thing you ever heard of it is the entity fighting for survival is what this is and why does it fight for survival because it wants anything its not even sentient it is reflective area which mirrors lifetime in which the pc fought for survival as that thing so therefore restimulation of it restimulates fight for survival thats the wildest thing you ever had anything to do with is battling around with some stupid entity this way the pc just as mild as milk and everything is fine on monday and on tuesday nyahlyahyahwrahrahrahrah you say whats gone wrong well you can take the explosion out of it by pulling the missed withholds and getting the pc insession and that sort of thing and you can also realize that once youve cleared the consequences of clearing sometime down along the line of listing you may have to clear it again got that it isnt an aetion which you only undertake once you may have to undertake it two three times remember as you list this person youre shifting this person into different parts of the bank and you finally get this person into the part of the bank named space operadollbody bin number 8647 now at that particular section of the bank life was tough life was hard one was either the galactic police or one was this pirate commander or one was the rebel or one was the tough spacemans crew or one was and everybody was practically unkillable except that the weapons were very painful and life is hard and youthis pcs been going along just fine and you run into this where survival is spelled with capital s you see and all of sudden the pcs they dont know they dont know about being clear they made mistake they think they better go back to australia or something anyway and there it is youre confronted suddenly with this and you dont usually go back and try to reason it out or say why youd think maybe youd go back andbut you might out of curiosity and interest look at the last items the pc listed heres another little rule in listing or in finding goals or in listing goals the pc tends to dramatize the last goal or item put down pc comes in in the morning and says oh my god i just all night long lay there smelling fish look on their list the last item they wrote in the session the day before was fishmonger disgusted fishmonger is what they put see all night long fish thats odd but the last itemit isnt the next item up that they havent told you yet its the last item down theyll tend to dramatize the last goal ill tellgive you an instance of that i told reg this one time and hesomebody who had just been put to listing goals as therapeutic measure which of course is quite therapeuticthis person in listing goals had been listing them away and all of sudden yowyowyowyowyow and was on the phone and was terrified and everything else and reg remembered this little rule so he made her write few more goals got the last goalsure enough she was dramatizing the last goal she had written down see she hadnt actually stopped writing goals because it was that goal it just was the last goal on the list so then she started dramatizing that goal i dont know what the goal was maybe it was to be terrified but you can count on that and its very funny youll go along on days auditing you take breaktake break sometimeand the person has written down sad chinaman and during the break you look at the pcits quite wonderful youthe mechanisms of the mind are gorgeous indeed you say well all right the fellow regurgitated it hes already got rid of it that is the reason why it is now out there so on well that must not be the ease in other words he doesnt get rid of it all the way apparently items nudge and goals nudge the last one out see you get some weird theories on this it doesnt matter whether you have theory on it or not the fact is you got to get items listed and when theyre listed down why theyre down and very ordinarily the ones higher on the scale are out but the one you just put down isnt and sometimes in listing session your pc will be looking at you suddenly beadily meanly you say must have missed withhold and so forth dont be knucklehead and bust up the whole session actually the less you do in listing session except list why the better off you are because thats auditing so the less you do why the better off youre going to be and the less trouble youre going to get into and the reason the pc was sitting there lookingwell why dont you look at the list which was right in front of you you just got through looking down and youve written down an angry mind reader and there he is the angry mind reader see quite amazing pcs apparentlynot always but sometimespeel these things off by put ting them on their own body first i dont know its like you deal cards backwards you know instead ofyou know you pull them on to the deck see not throw them off of the deck before you throw them out see its like taking dealt cards that are scattered all over the place in the pcs bank and then they put it on themselves and then they throw the valence over their shoulder or something well in actual fact they dont do anything with the valence the valence is evaporating because the alterising thing is the basic purpose see valences and units and items dont go anyplace they vanish they dont go back on the track or out into space or clutter up anything they just vanish because they are built of alteris of the pcs basic purpose you understand you dont have to worry about them now the signs of wrong goal or bad listing is 1 the ta is mostly at 45 or 5 0 it never comes down 2 pc is arc breaky 3 pc is looking bad theres your firefly factor 4 pain doesnt matter how much sen is present as long as theres also pain you understand but painman theres something wrong see 5 all senwhich of course contains painbut all sen nothing but sen nothing but sensation the pc has been weeping for the last four sessions now thats sensation man i had pc tell just moment ago that sensation was coming off and i know the pc was crying in session today see pcs are not reliable judges of this the auditors have to ask you understand you have to ask you have to check up on this dont just sit there forever just ask once in while if the pcs got any pain or if the pc is dizzy or if the pc feels any emotion think of that once in while when youre listing but of course keep it to minimum dont chatter on it because its just for your data is everything going all right pc hurts fine thats dandy now if its all sen this is really going wrong now this is something that you should start worrying about all sennow this is wrong theres something real wrong here now youre getting suppressions and youre getting all kinds of things and it might even go back to wrong goal you see but suppress protest the pcs auditing under protest pc is arc broke pc is suppressing the lines pcusually the commonest cause of pc going all sensation is not wrong goal the commonest cause of it is the pc doesnt understand the listing lines pc dig you say who or what would want to catch catfish and the pc doesnt understand it you see because you the auditor understand the line is test at all of whether the pc understands the line now number 6 is bank beefing up now thats colloquialism but i dont know anythingto express it better if you said the bank is becoming more solid and is pressurizing the pc and this or that and the other thing and sensation is tremendously and oppressively present and there appears to be more bank in the morning than there was in the afternoon previous and theres more and more bank and there are ridges of the bank are getting rather solid and so forththis is what comes under the heading of bank beefing up see in other words its just theres something being fed to this bank its getting solider and it can become as solid as board and if you let pc go that far youll halfkill him see it can really be gruesome now 7 what you can expect after that is the pc is sick and nauseated bank will beef upthats not too badbank beefs up some more its getting kind of solid its got solid fringes on it the pc feels like hes in some kind of an invisible iron suit or something weird is occurring here in other words the engrams and things are getting heavier and more solid and he cant see them he can feel them worse and that sort of thing this kind of thing happening is the result of wrong goal or bad listing thats mostly seen when youre listing wrong goal it can become awful gruesome on wrong goal but it can also proceed from bad listing pcs becoming sick and nauseated thats pretty much wrong goal its seldom that listing drives them that far but wrong goal can drive them that far they can start losing their cookies man their weight going up pc nauseated and dizzy and room going around and mest going out of plumb you know room has eight points at the baseboard and ceiling you see and those will sometimes go completely askew you know eight points longer make box they make twisted space the room looks like that to them you get the idea well motion goes haywire on these people bzzzzzz bum show rough rough on them thats wrong goal overlisted and you shouldve been able to detect it before it got to there now how do you patch up ease thats gone wrong how do you patch them up well you check over and get rid of all earlier found goals than the goal the pc is listing or all other goals than the pc was listing that were found at any time and were said to be the pcs goal you understand well take all excess goals whether they were before the goal or after the goal that is being listed see all excess goals on the pc sometimes several goals have been found on pc and then they find one of the earlier goals is it and then everybody neglects to do anything about the last three goals found that were listed maybe well clean them up clean up those goals pc says theyve been cleaned up already or it appears in an auditing report check them for cleanup just rapid tiger drill on them after all its only four or five goals see theres three minutes worth of work see but check it up these goals charged up in some way or another something going on here all right get rid of them in other words and youll find out sometimes that they have oppressed the right goal so that as the items were listed or something the sessions becoming restimulative arc breaks and that sort of thing have tended to throw one of these other goals into action and its oppressing the right goal and the pc is beginning to wonder if the other one wasnt his goal you got the idea so you get all kinds of oddball things going on so just make sure that goals the pc has supposed been led to suppose in processing were his goal that those goals are out and flat it isnt that theyll charge up again and come back in but just make sure that it is done of course if they arent what you do is give them big tiger drill and get rid of them you see big tiger drill that you were watching last night on tv demonstration is not prepchecking it just adds more buttons and plusandminus buttons and plays it out to get off the maximal amount of sensation and somatic in the minimal amount of time then you prepcheck the goal and the way to prepcheck goalthis might be news to youis give it time duration and name the goal now on auditing or in auditing on the goal to catch catfish see ah well this is all right in auditing on the goal to catch catfish thats pretty good for patchup thats good you can get old goals firing you can do all kinds of things with it but if youre going to prepcheck and youre going to sit back there with repetitive question and do fullblown prepcheck on this goal then youd better use time duration remember in your releases on prepchecking the importance of time span dont worry about listing dont worry about this dont worry about that lets use time span so you get an auditing command something like on the goal to catch catfish and this is one month before the goal was found as far as you can figure it was since january 1961 has anything been suppressed on the goal to catch catfish since january 1961 has anything not been suppressed alternate question back and forth and you will work yourself out quite deal now that seems to be rather large mouthful but you would be surprised how many selfaudits you catch the interest of goal is such that it leads people to selfaudit far beyond any processing ever did they speculate they do it they figure they think after all youre monkeying with their basic purpose so of course it goes into high degree of restim and they wonder about it and they occlude it and they try to prepcheck themselves all kinds of weird things i wonder if ive suppressed my goal well why dont they ask themselves the auditing question and theyre off to the races now it happens to be impossibleimpossible i repeatit happens to be impossible to selfaudit goal now you can list the lines on goal if somebody makes them up for you and says hell beat your head in if you dont write the answers down as long as the thing is tiger drilled in the persons still got an auditor dont you see its an extended session but now watch thisyouve got the opposition terminals which are mostly sen and youve got the terminals of the goal and those sit in the bank to large degree opposite each other got this see theyre opposite each other well say blob one faces blob two well blob one is some kind of mishmash of own terminals that also had the goal and blob two are opposition terminals that never had the goal but always opposed it you got that all right the fellows going to prepcheck his own goal haha now hes sitting there in blob one see very happily so he says i think im prepcheck this goal see on the goal to catch catfish lets see has anything been suppressed and he of course is instantly into blob two facing blob one and blob two has sensation on it and its mess of sensation and he cant feel any pain and one of the first things that alarms him is the fact that hes dizzy and doesnt hurt so he says it cant be my goal it cant be my goal because theres pain on it theres only sensation and i remember ron saying this well he goes down the street few minutes afterwards and he slips accidentally into blob one see that has the goal to track and the pain on it and he says ouch and tends to avoid now blob one he says well that doesnt feel too comfortable and he kind of tends to back out of blob one and theres place to go but blob two so he backs into blob two and hes had it do you see that selfauditing on the goal leads to these very interesting things now selflisting itd be very unlikely that if somebody found your goal and didnt make up your lines and didnt do this for you and didnt do that for you and didnt tiger drill the goal every time that you would ever be able to list it by yourself but given those requirements you probably possibly could sit down and list the goal at somebody elses behestsee with the auditing commands at the top of the sheets in somebody elses handwriting you see that possibility of doing that as matter of fact if you were very powerful and pervasive as far as somebody else was concerned you could actually tell them to go ahead and list the goal by themselves after youd prepared all the sheets and then you tiger drilled them regularly to throw them back into the right valences and lines but even that throws them into the wrong lines see for the wrong questions unless thats been very thoroughly impressed on them but you see there is some possibility of selflisting but theres possibility of selftiger drilling or selfprepchecking wont work i make my point you go flippityflop im sure in this room theres hardly person who hasnt to some slight degree wondered if his goal has been suppressed and thought it over just suppressively i wonder if hes invalidated something today i dont know if youve all been alarmed at this but every once in while you wonder if anything has been invalidated today and you get sensation you see if youre very educated as an auditor and if you didnt know these other points im giving you right now you could become quite worried of course you say has anything been invalidated on the goal to catch catfish and instantly the goal items which youre in are over there and youre in the items with sen in other words you get the pain and sen on wrong lines and everything goes to hell in balloon see when you start doing this you follow this activity now when you tiger drill the goal every session thats an insurance against thea wrong goal see thats good insurance so it actually leaves as the main problem bad listing you have to watch and be very alert on listing sessions and the things youre alert for are high ta45 50 pc arc breaky pc looking bad pain all sen bank beefing up pc sick and nauseated these are all bum things and when you see those things you start worrying and the answers to them is check over those earlier found goals lets find out if anything happened there lets prepcheck the goal with the date line lets tiger drill the goal into good firing condition and so forth if we cant get it that way then just prepcheck harder and youll either get the goal back or it was the wrong goal theres not any trick to listing you dont have to be terribly clever you dont have to be clever at all to list youve got to be very workmanlike very thorough and very competent this is what it takes to run good listing session theres clearing without listing so dont relegate it as an unimportant activity and just toss it off and say that is that listing is good and its as brief as the auditor is good now i havent talked to you anything about listing lines or what happens on lines how you put lines together because let assure you that is another story but the actual conduct of listing session should be very steady very presson lot of confidence on the part of the pc in his auditor slips goofs regular nice smooth keep the pc in session get the middle rudiments in only when the pc looks like theyre completely gone on something and just carry on and do good sound competent session and hell go clear as fast as he has confidence in you as listing auditor and its very tough on pc to change auditors in the middle of listing can be done but only if the second auditor is as good as the first one was good listing auditor is good thing hetheyre not always to be found because auditors will obsessively get in there talk too much try to do too much alteris too much interrupt the pc try to stop the pc from talking qanda on the things question the items write too slowly improperly pronounce and call the auditing commandsall of these things lead to bad listing so that what you want is smooth steady straightforward predictable competence you got that man your pc will go clear and youll see free needle on all those lines in absence of that youll have pc thatll look like he has wrong goal itll just be all sen all arc break all upset and blah you dont want that you want clears so listing to that degree is extremely important thank you very much
