independence and was immediately engaged in war with all of its neighbors armed conflict has marked every decade of israels existence despite its unstable regional environment israel has developed vibrant parliamentary democracy albeit with relatively fragile governments the kadima party placed first in the march 28 2006 knesset parliament election and prime minister ehud olmert formed coalition government corruption charges against olmert led to kadima leadership primary on september 17 2008 foreign minister tzipi livni won and replaced olmert as party leader but she was unable to form new coalition government therefore early national elections will be held in february 2009 olmert remains prime minister until then israel has an advanced industrial market economy with large government role israels foreign policy is focused largely on its region europe and the united states it views iran as an existential threat due to its nuclear ambitions and support for antiisrael terrorists israel concluded peace treaties with egypt in 1979 and jordan in 1994 but not with syria and lebanon israel unilaterally withdrew from southern lebanon in 2000 hezbollah which then took over the south sparked 34day war when it kidnaped two israeli soldiers in july 12 2006 israel negotiated series of agreements with the palestinians in the 1990s but that process ended in 2000 israel

g17g159g142g155g159g146g142g160g561 israel is parliamentary democracy in which the president is head of state and the prime minister is head of government the unicameral parliament the knesset elects president for seven year term the prime minister is the leader of the party with the most seats in parliament the political spectrum is highly fragmented with small parties exercising disproportionate power due to the low vote threshold for entry into parlia ment and the need for their numbers to form coalition governments in the march 2006 election the threshold to enter parliament was raised from 1 to 2an action intended to bar smaller parties from parliament but that spurred some parties to join together simply to overcome the threshold national elections must be held at least every four years but are often held earlier due to difficulties in holding coalitions together the average life span of an israeli government is 22 months the peace process the role of religion in the state and scandals have caused coalitions to break apart or produced early elections israel does not have constitution instead 11 ba sic laws lay down the rules of government and enumerate fundamental rights two new basic laws are under consideration 10 on february 2 2006 the knessets constitution law and justice committee approved draft constitution encompassing existing basic laws and chapter of human rights and basic principles however the coalition agreement for the government that took power that april promised the ultra orthodox shas party that basic laws would not be changed ie transformed into constitution without its approval israel has an independent judi ciary with system of magistrates courts and district courts topped by supreme court there is an active civil society some political pressure groups are especially concerned with the peace process including the council of judea samaria and gaza yesha council which represents local settler councils and opposes any

they questioned its prosecution critics noted that the kidnaped soldiers were not rescued and that hezbollah is rearming and has been strengthened politically the government claimed success in forcing hezbollah from the border in degrading its arms and in pressuring the lebanese government aided by international forces to assert itself in south lebanon the fallout from the war included the

minister olmert th endefense minister peretz and thenchief of staff halutz 15 it criticized olmert for hastily deciding to go to war without comprehensive plan close study or systematic consultation with others especially outside the israeli defense forces idf it accused him of declaring unclear overambitious and infeasible goals and for failing to adapt them once their deficiencies were realized it concluded that these accusations add up to serious failure in exercising judgment responsibility and prudence it faulted peretz for making decisions without systematic consultations despite his lack of knowledge and experience in military matters emphasizing his lack of strategic oversight of the idf it concluded his serving as minister of defense during the war impaired israels ability to respond well to its challenges the committee also severely criticized halutz who had already resigned the final report of the winograd committee was released on january 30 2008 16 it called the war
