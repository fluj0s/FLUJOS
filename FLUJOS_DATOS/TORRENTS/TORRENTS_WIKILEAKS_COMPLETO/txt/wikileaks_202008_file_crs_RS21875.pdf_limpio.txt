events warrant scope of eu enlargement on may 1 2004 after several years of negotiations the european union eu completed the largest expansion of its membership since its inception as the european coal and steel community in 1952 it added 10 countries bringing its total membership to 251 the enlargement increases the total eu population from about 380 million to roughly 450 million people perhaps more significant than the size of the new membership is its composition eight of the 10 new members are former communist states and three of the eight estonia latvia and lithuania were pa rt of the former soviet uni on the eight former communist states have been successfully making the transition from centrallyplanned economichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21875crs2 2 the analysis is based on data contained in the world bank world development indicators 2004 washington p 1416 3 crs report rl30753 agricultural support mechanisms in the european union comparison with the united states by geoffrey beckersystems to marketdriven economic systems although some legacies of the old system remain the 10 new eu members are on average poor er than the previous eu15 poland the largest of the10 new members is substa ntially behind portugal the poorestof the eu15 in terms of per capita gdp measured on purchasing power parity ppp basis slovenia the richestof the former communist states is also among the smallest of the 10 and is slightly above portug in terms of per capita gdp2 thus the addition of the10 countries moves the eu further fro m its original configuration group of relatively rich industrialized west european economies that trend creates challenges for the new members and the other 15 members as they absorb the inevitable adjustment costs of enlargement at the same time accession to the eu affirms the commitment of the former communist states to building market economies in joining the eu the 10 new members accede to range of laws and regulations that affect virtually every aspect of economic lif at the same time eu membership accords its members number of benefits in joining the eu the 10 new members become integrated into large borderless market tariffs are eliminated on trade with the other eu members tariffs on eu trade with the new members were eliminated prior to accession via preaccession associa tion agreements in add ition eu members adhere to common legal and regulatory regimes the same safety health professional qualification and other standards apply in ll 25 countries this means that goods and services can flow freely throughout the eu area the 10 new members also have committed to join the economic and moneta ry union emu that requires close coordination of economic and monetary policies th ey have pegged their national currencies to the euro and are to eventually adopt the euro as their national currency after they have met the economic eligibility criteria an important aspect of the emu is the free flow of capital among members the objective of which is to create stable economic environment and efficient distribution of capital eventually labor from the 10 new members is to be able to move freely thr oughout the eu area enabling worker in one member country to obtain work in another mber country without re strictions other than those that would apply to local worker an important aspect of eu membership is the sometimes controversial common agricultural policy cap the cap is set of laws and practices that are designed to increase the supply of agricultural products at reasonable prices but also provide income support to farmers the cap operates accord ing to three basic principles the free movement of agricultural products within the eu at common prices national trade barriers and harmonized technical regulati ons 2 preference for eu products enforced through protectionist measures and 3 fi nancing of the cap from the eu budget in order to maintain common prices and pr oducer income support the eu employs commodity intervention buy ing produc ts to boost demand and direct payments to farmers3 these programs account for large sh are of the eu budget forcing the eu to consider cap reforms in addition the eus trading partners including the unitedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21875crs3 4 european commission more unity and more diversity the european unions biggest enlargement p7 httpeuropaeuintstates have strongly criticized the cap arguing that it distor ts production patterns creating agricultural surpluses that the eu dumps on the world market at the expense of us producers along with the unified internal market the 10 new members accede to common commercial policy this policy includes common external tariff regime member countries impose the same tariffs on imports from nonmember countries the eu10 members belong to the wto and have been participating in the negotiated reduction in tariffs eu members conduct trade policy as one they negotiate b ilaterally with non member trading partners and within the wto apply trade remedies such as antidumping duties and countervailing duties in tandem and are themse lves subject to similar trade remedy measures imposed by nonmember tr ading partners what is imposed on one is imposed on them all and employ common trade preference programs such as the eu generalized system of preferences g sp program for developing countries while incurring these obligations requires the new members to surrender some national control over their economic policies th ey stand to reap number of benefits for example they receive eu structural f unds to help develop transportation and other infrastructure facilities and to modernize their agricultural sectors to bring them up to the levels of development of other eu memb ers the new members will also receive agricultural support funds as part of the co mmon agricultural policy cap however they are to receive less than the full comple ment of cap funds for the first ten years of their membership but are to receive the full complement thereafter eu membership is expected to encourag economic growth and development of the new member economies the european commission estimates that eu membership will add one percent per year to the gdp growth rates of the new members during the first ten years of their membership4 the economic boost would result from more efficient distribution of resources with the removal of barriers to trade with the other 15 members and from the economies of scale that produ cers in the new member countries would realize by joining the large eu market us economic ties with the eu the united states has strong economic tie s with the eu15 countries that have developed over many years its ties with the 10 new members are not as firm having largely developed since the end of the cold war us ties with the eu15 the united states has been strong advocate for the construction of close economic ties among the west european countries since the end of world war ii during the cold war the european community served us foreign policy and national security interests as force of stability that drew west germany and france closer together and that helped to build we stern europe into an economic bulwark against the soviet bloc httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21875crs4 5 studies on the economic effects of the eu cited in crs

served us economic interests as well by accelerating european economic growth and developm ent which has opened trade and investment opportunities for the unite d states many studi have concluded that the formation of the eu has had net positive economic impact on the world as whole because it has led on balance to more trade creation than diversion of trade from other countries5 the united states and the eu15 have bu ilt strong economic relationship grounded in large flows of trade and investment in both directions that promote economic growth and employment in both regions and rooted in the principles of open market economies in 2003 808 billion flowed between the united states and the eu15 on the current account the most comprehensive measure of us trade flows in addition us residents invested net 717 billion in eu15 countries in direct investments while eu residents invested 370 billion in direct investments in the united states very large part of useu economic ties operate smoothly with little friction or hurdles nevertheless disagreements over g overnment policies and practices have arisen between the two trading powers that have d in some cases to sanctions and created political problems at the highest political levels currently the most visible issue pertains to us compliance with world trade or ganizations wto ruling against the us foreign sale corporation pr ogram fsc and its successor program the extraterritorial income eti program that provides tax incentives for exporting 6 the eu is also party to complaint brought to the wto against the united states regarding the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of 2000 cdsoa that required revenues from antidumping and countervailing duty orders to be redistributed to entities that were parties to the original antidumping and counterva iling duty cases and that fulfilled statutory eligibility criteria at the same time negotiations with the eu over compensation to the united states for the eu ban on imports of hormonetreated beef continue7 the wto ruled that the ban violates the wto sanitary and phytosanitary agreement us ties with the new members us trade with the 10 new members of the eu eu10 has grown substantially in the last decade but nevertheless remains relatively small in 2003 total us exports to the eu 10 totaled 36 billion or about 05 of total us exports to the world us imports from the group totaled 82 billion about 07 of total us imports us imports from the eu10 surged 17 billion or about 26 in 2003 about 46 of the incr ease was accounted for by th increase in imports from slovakia from 261 million 2002 to 1013 million nearly all of which were passenger cars slovakia is the home of new volkswagen production facility hungary is the largest us trading partner among the ten countries in terms of total trade poland is second and the czech republic is close third largely because of the association agreements that provide for mutual preferential trade

increasingly integrated with the rest of the eu with at least half of their total trade taking place with the eu 15 prior to accession eu members have also been the leading source of foreign investment in those economies followed by the united states for estonia latvia lithuania the czech republic slovakia hungary and poland this posture represents significan t reorientation of th eir economies which had been closely tied to the soviet bloc be fore the collapse of the soviet union us exports to the eu10 are led by computers and parts office machinery and electrical machinery primarily integrated circuits us imports from the eu10 are led by cars computers and parts and electrical machinery economic implications of eu largement for the united states us trade with the eu10 has been small dwarfed by the already strong euus trade relationship therefore the impact of enlargement on the overall useu relationship will be minimal however enlargement could change us ec onomic relations with the 10 ne w member countries for example eu accession is expected to result in additiona l economic growth in the eu10 which could translate into some increase in demand for us exports in addition the eu10 countries adoption of the common external tariff changes the tariffs us exporters face in those markets on average eu tariffs are lower than the original national tariffs of the new members for example tariffs on trucks and cars were much higher in central and east eu ropean countries than in the eu8 the lower tariffs should improve the us export oppor tunities in the eu10 markets in some cases tariffs under the common exte rnal tariff are higher one study points out for example that while tariffs in th largest eu10 economies notably poland and hungary were higher than eu tariffs tari ffs in some of the smaller countries for example the czech republic and estonia were lower reducing export opportunities in those markets 9 the united states claims it is entitled to compensation in those cases article xxiv of the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt 1994 states that if the formation of free trade area or cust oms union results in higher tariffs on imports from countries outside the area then the negatively affected countries are entitled to compensation in the form of reductions in tariffs in other areas the eu has begun negotiations with the united states and other affected trading partners regarding compensation the united states submitted list of products th at it believes will be adversely affected by enlargem ent eu officials have argued on the other hand that the benefits that noneu tradin g partners will receive from enlargement will more than outweigh the disadvantages nega ting any need for compensation10 the united states and the eu

aluminum tube and raise quotas on imports of bone less ham poultry and corn gluten12 the united states removed the nine of th 10 countries all but slovenia that were eligible from its generalized system of preferences gsp program because us law prohibits eu states from eligibility therefor their products are longer eligible for dutyfree treatment from the united states the united states negotiated with the new members to ensure that rights us inve stors had previously secured under bilateral investment treaties b its would be preserved afer enlargement keith crane senior economist at rand co rporation has identif ied other potential advantages to the united states coming from eu enlargement13 us exporters will longer have to recertify thei r products for sale in the eu 10 that are already eligible in the eu15 us companies may be able to consolidate their operations in europe since they will be servicing one larger market crane also identifies some possible problem areas eu subsidies under the cap to agricu ltural producers in the new member countries could lead to overcapacity and surplus pr oduction exacerbating us concerns about eu dumping of agricultural products in third country markets at the expense of us exporters the new members will adopt the eu ban on imports of us hormonefed beef costing beef exporters those markets and us companies will longer be able to benefit from investment incentives offered by the governments of some of the new members because the eu has prohibited such programs
