budgetary legi slation have long fueled interest in the idea that the congressional budget process could be better structured in way that eases time constraints the need for consideration of budget matters in the form of concurrent resolutions on the budget reconciliation measures tax measures public debt measures authorizations regular appropriations continuing appropriations and supp lemental appropriations has been criticized as time consuming repetitive and inefficient one longdiscussed reform proposal would attempt to remedy this by changing the budget cycle from one to two years biennial budgeting is concept that may include several variations it may involve multiyear authorizations twoyear budget resolutions or tw oyear appropriations or some combination of the three most proposals incorporate all three factors biennial budgeting has long history at the state level although the trend since world war ii has been for states to convert to an annual budget cycle according to the national conference of state legislatures 21 states currently operate with twoyear cycle and some states operate with mixed cycles that put significant portions of their budgets on twoyear cycle in addition to congressional support biennial budgeting has received support from the reagan george bush clinton and george w bush administrations proponents of biennial b udgeting generally advance three arguments they contend that two year budget cycle will 1 reduce congressional workload by eliminating the need for annual review of routine matters 2 reserve the cond session of each congress for improved congressional oversight and program review and 3 allow better long term planning by the agencies that spend federal funds at the federal state or local level critics of biennial budgeting have countered by asserting that the projected benefits would prove to be illusory projecting revenues and expenditures for twoyear cycle requires forecasting as much as 30 months in advance rather than 18 under an annual budget cycle this would result in less accurate forecasts and could require congress to choose between allowing the president greater latitude for making budgetary adjustments in the offyears or engaging in midcycle corrections to degree that would effectively undercut any reduction in the workload or intended improvements in planning opponents also point out that annual review of appropriations requests is an important part of oversight that would be lost under biennial budget with guarantee that separate oversight session would be effective furthermore they argue that reducing the number of times that congress considers budget matters may only raise the stakes and thereby heighten the possibility for conflict and increased delay this report will be updated to reflect any changes in practice httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30550g4g146g142g151g151g146g138g149g561g4g158g141 g144g142g157g146g151g144g497

congressional concerns about the budget process in recent years has been the amount of time it requires the current process which provides for consideration of various budget questions in the form of concurrent reso lutions on the budget reconciliation measures tax measures public debt measures authorizations re gular appropriations continuing appropriations and supplemental appropriations has been faulted as repetitive and inefficient this in turn has fueled interest in the idea that the congressional budget process could be better structured to promote more efficient use of congresss limited time despite the perceived or actual permanence of much federal spending the process of formulating enacting and executing budgets has remained characteristically annual this annual budget cycle poses dilemma for congress on the one hand annual review of spending legislation can afford congress the opportunity to maximize its influence concerning the operation of various programs and policies on the other hand many members have expressed concern with the high percentage of congressional workload that is devoted to budgetary matters 1 an annual budget cycle however is dependent on the timely enactment of budgetary legislation consideration of individual pieces of budgetary legi slation is often closely linked to consideration of other pieces so that delays in consideration of one measure may have an impact on the timing of consideration of all subsequent budgetary legislation in recent years final action on appropriations measures has occurred an average of 86 days after the start of the fiscal year on october 1 see table 1 the result has been frustration with the budget process and desire to reduce the number or frequency of budget measures that need to be considered the budget process has sometimes been criticized as unnecessarily repetitive as well with some questions being debated in various forms several times each year defense policy for example may be debated in terms of priority within the overall budget in the budget resolution in terms of policy in an authorization measure and in terms of funding levels on an appropriations bill only to have it all repeated the next year rather than promote efficient consideration critics contend this repetition has contributed to the complexity of the budget process as well as to inefficiency and delay t

processes have been advanced at least in part in the hope that they could make the budget process operate in more timely fashion for example advocates of an automatic continuing resolution argue that it could reduce deadline pressures in the appropriations process those in favor of joint budget resolution suggest that it would promote early agreement on budget priorities between congress and the president and some argue that merged authorizationappropriations process could reduce the volume of legislation that needs to be considered in any given session of congress as result some see these and other proposed reforms as offering the potential to make the timely enactment of budget legislation easier and therefore to make better budgetary outcomes more likely another possible approach to addressing this concern is to change the budget cycle from one year to two years by reducing the frequency of budgetary actions and better separating their consideration proponents of such reform contend that congress would be able to undertake each stage with more attention to detail because budgeting for the federal government encompasses number of processes biennial budgeting can have several meanings biennial budgeting can involve twoyear budget resolutions twoyear appropriations and multiyear authorizations typically biennial budgeting proposals include all three aspects although pr oposals embracing only one or two are possible biennial budgeting proposals may focus on enacting b udgetary legislation for twoyear periods or for two oneyear periods in addition biennial budget proposals typically require that executive branch planning and performance reviews be revised so that they be based on twoyear cycle

supporters of biennial budgeting generally advance three arguments they contend that two year budget cycle will 1 reduce congressional workload by eliminating the need for annual consideration of routine or repetitious matters 2 allow congress to reserve time to promote improved oversight and program review and 3 llow better longterm planning by the agencies that spend federal funds at the federal state or local level httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30550g4g146g142g151g151g146g138g149g561g4g158g141 g144g142g157g146g151g144g497

consider budget questions will reduce the percentage of congressional time consumed by the process they assert that this would allow more time for congress to conduct agency and program oversight by effectively dividing each congress into budget year and an authorizationoversight year two year cycle might reduce competition for members time and attention and allow for more effective use of authorizations to establish policy congress would not have to resort to appropriating in the absence of current authoriz ation as often since the authorizations would not be crowded out of the congressional schedule by appropriations questions another anticipated benefit is that executive branch agencies relieved of the need to develop and defend budget proposals as frequently could better manage federal programs one of the chief arguments of proponents of biennial budgeting is that it increases certainty about the level of future funding and thus allows better longrange planning by federal agencies and by state and local governments the reagan george h w bush clinton and george w bush administrations expressed support for biennial budgeting the 1993 report of the national performance review the gore commission noted considerable time could be savedand used more effectivelyin both the executive and legislative branches of government if budgets and appropriations were moved to biennial cycle 2 the clinton administrations final budget submission in 2000 reiterated its support for biennial budgeting3 the george w bush administration has also included support for bienni budgeting as well as other budget process reforms in the presidents annual budget submission to congress the fy2004 budget stated that biennial budget would allow lawmakers to devote more time every other year to ensuring that taxpayers money is spent wisely and efficiently in addition government agencies would receive more stable funding which would facilitate longer range planning and improved fiscal management 4 supporters point to the multiyear nature of th budget summit agreements between congress and the president that have been major part of the budget process for more than decade as evidence of the efficacy of multiyear budgeting and as major factor in recent years for promoting more efficient consideration of budgetary legislation

they suggest may only raise the stakes and thereby heighten the possibility for conflict and increased delay in addition enacting budget resolution and spending legislation every other year could be

revenues and expenditures is always difficult and because twoyear cycle requires forecasting as much as 30 months in advance rather than 18 under an annual budget cycle biennial budgets would be more susceptible to error less accurate forecasting they argue could result in providing either too much or too little money for individual programs and some fear that this would increase the need for supplemental appropriations or other adjustments that would effectively undercut any intended improvements in planning with only limited ability to anticipate future conditions critics argue that twoyear cycle could require congress to choose between allowing the president greater latitude for making budgetary adjustments in the offyears or engaging in mid cycle corrections to degree that would nullify any anticipated time savings or planning advantages furthermore they argue that annual review of appropriations requests is an important part of oversight that would be lost under biennial budget with guarantee that committees would ta ke advantage of separate oversight session or that oversight separate from review of funding decisions would be as effective in addition they contend that the institutional incentives for supporting twoyear budgets can vary based on the expected budgetary outcome budget plan that would lock in an amount for the second year of biennium will draw relatively little support from program advocates in time of increasing budgets because the program might receive more generous funding later and alternately will draw relatively little support from program cutters in times of decreasing budgets because the program would be somewhat insulated from possible later cuts in other words an action to lock in future budgetary resources may draw opposition when some decision makers believe that better decision may be arrived at in the future

hearings on the subject of budget process reform have often included testimony concerning biennial budgeting in addition on several occasions both the house and senate have conducted hearings specifically on the topic of biennial budgeting6 congressional interest in biennial budgeting has also been demonstrated by survey findings7 and by the level of cosponsorship of biennial budgeting

has been shared jointly by the committees on rules and the budget both have considered the issue of biennial budgeting in the 107th congress the committee on rules reported hr 981 providing for biennial budget9 but the legislation was not considered by the house other biennial budget proposal has been reported to the house although in the 106th congress the house considered biennial budgeting as an amendment to comprehensive budget process reform measure in the senate prior to the 109th congress jurisdiction over the budget process was shared jointly by the committees on governmental affairs and th budget under standing order of the senate first agreed to august 4 1977 and discontinued as of january 200510 the order provided that if one committee reported measure the other had 30 days to report or be discharged from further consideration jurisdiction over the budget process is currently in the jurisdiction of the senate budget committee biennial budgeting measures were reported on several occasions in the senate including most recently s 92 in the 106 th congress however biennial budgeting measures have been considered by the full senate biennial budgeting has also been considered by number of federal committees and commissions organized to study possible procedural or structur reforms of congress the budget process or both in addition to the gore commission noted previously the national economic commission11 and the study group on senate practices and procedures also known as the pearsonribicoff commission after former sena tors james pearson and abraham ribicoff recommended form of biennial budgeting th pearsonribicoff commission recommended that congress consider half of the regular appropriations bills each year12 in 1993 both the senate and house members of the joint committee on the organization of congress included proposals for twoyear budget cycle in their recommendations to their respective chambers srept 103215 vol 1 and hrept 103413 vol 1 in the senate these recommendations were subsequently introduced as s 1824 referred to the committee on rules and administration and reported in 1994 srept 103297 it is notable that in contrast to the comprehensive approach to biennial budgeting taken in most biennial budgeting proposals s 1824 as reported included twoyear budget resolutions and multiyear authorizations but not twoyear appropriations in addition to being included in various hearings on the general subject of budget process reform over the years biennial budgeting has been the specific focus of hearings and

requirement for multiyear authorizations twoyear budget resolutions and twoyear appropriations biennial appropriations may refer to all appropriations being enacted for two year period all appropriations being enacted for two succeeding oneyear periods in single measure or even system under which some appropriations are enacted for either twoyear period or two oneyear periods in each year of twoyear cycle these components may be adopted individually or in concert and may be applied under variety of schedules because of this biennial budgeting may have different meanings for different people g15g158g149g157g146g162g142g138g155g561g3g158g157g145g152g155g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 many biennial budgeting proposals require that all authorizations be enacted for periods longer than one fiscal year under current practice many authorizations are already enacted for multiyear periods the chief exceptions to this are the department of defense and intelligence authorizations which are considered annually most proposals also divide action so that authorizations are scheduled to be considered in the second year of each congress separate from consideration of regular appropriations measures one proposed benefit of multiyear authorizations is that the authorizations could be in place before the appropriations process got under way providing for smoother working relationship between authorizers and appropriators 17 13 us congress senate committees on budget and governmental affairs to consider budget process reform hearings 106th cong 1st sess jan 27

unless supported by biennial appropriations they may lack the degree of certainty required to achieve the promised benefits of long range planning although the requirement for multiyear authorizations is often advanced as relatively minor aspect of biennial budgeting such system could have major repercussions with regard to those specific issue areas where it would have impact for example congress has operated under the presumption that the defense and intelligence authorizations are sensitive to myriad foreign policy issues and that these need to be addressed every year an attempt to experiment with twoyear authorizations for the department of defense in the 1980s proved unsuccessful this failure has sometimes been partly attributed to the fact that the experiment was not part of comprehensive move to biennial budgeting and was not supported by twoyear appropriations but another contribut ing factor was that it was overtaken by other budgetary decisions the deficit reduction concerns that led to late 1987 budget summit between congress and president reagan also effectively required the second year of the twoyear authorization to be amended extensively given this experience support for twoyear defense authorizations waned 18 as proposed in s 92 and hr 3586 106th congress biennial budgeting would establish budget year and an authorizationoversight ear for each congress this proposed division could augment the separation of authorizations and appropriations currently embodied in house and senate rules and it could enhance the perceived difference between authorizations and appropriations that some members feel has been weakened in recent decades19 however it is possible that the result could instead be an erosion of the separation between authorizations and appropriations since there might not be any opportunity to consider authorizing legislation in the first year of congress members may feel it necessary to use appropriations bills as legislative vehicles to revise policy questions immediately through appropriations bills rather than have to wait for the second authorizationoversight session the use of appropriations bills to include authorizing language or to bypass separate authorizing language altogether could become significant concern in any circumstances under which it was desirable to consider policy questions in the first year of congress and thus undercut the intent of the proposed bifurcation for example changes in the international climate could require reassessment of priorities for defense or foreign operations spending or changes in the economy could spur the need for reevaluation of domestic policies without respect to whether it was the first or second year of congress the incentive could be especially great when an election signals dramatic shift in national policies and lawmakers want to address those issues as the reagan administration did in 1981 the clinton administration did in 1993

centered around the concurrent resolution on the budget which sets aggregate budget policies and functional priorities for congress the budget resolution is used to coordinate the various budgetary actions that are to be taken over the course of session of congress proposals to convert the budget process to twoyear cycle likewise typically involve process centered around twoyear budget resolution although the budget process is characteristically annual there are number of aspects that encourage congress to look beyond single fiscal year in particular section 301a of the congressional budget act currently requires that the budget resolution include binding figures for the upcoming fiscal year plus planning levels for at least each of the four ensuing fiscal years in recent years budget resolutions have typically included planning levels beyond the minimum number required by the congressional budget act for example the budget resolution for fy2004 hconres 95 108 th congress included planning levels through fy2013 the budget act also provides for the enforcement of the fiveyear totals for revenues and direct spending and allows multiyear reconciliation instructions in addition the senates payasyougo point of order section 505a of hconres 95 108th congress the fy2004 budget resolution prohibits the consideration of revenue or direct spending legislation that would increase or cause an onbudget deficit for the first year covered by the budget resolution the total for the first five years or the total for the second five years 20 proponents of biennial b udget resolutions suggest that both congress and the president would benefit by extending the binding levels to two years adopting the broad outlines of fiscal policy only once each congress as joseph white of the brookings institution stated in testimony before the joint committee on the organization of congress in 1993 annual fights about priorities between the same congress and president do nobody any good 21 additionally congress was unable to adopt budget resolution in 1998 2002 2004 and 2006 and has had to use some other means to coordinate and enforce budgetary actions in those years22 proponents of twoyear budget resolution argue that this recent experience demonstrates that it is not necessary to adopt budget resolution every year and that twoyear budget resolution would better reflect current practice opponents however contend that by providing c ongress with the opportunity to participate in setting fiscal policy budget resolutions have served useful purpose and that the inability to adopt budget resolution has been portent of further budgetary battles throughout the year rather than an indication that congress is still in agreement on the policies that were adopted in the previous year they further contend that while fiscal policy can be set for twoyear periods it is potentially subject to considerable uncertainty and that eliminating an opportunity to either alter or confirm current policy makes the process weaker 20 for more on the paygo point of order see crs report rl31943 budget enforcement procedures senate payas yougo paygo

budget summits in the 1980s and 1990s has demonstrated the effectiveness of establishing multiyear framework for the budget notably the 1987 agreement between congress and the reagan administrati on the 1990 agreement with the bush administration and the 1993 and 1997 agreements with the clinton administration have all been built around the projected future impact of budget plan subsequent budget resolutions and budget implementing legislation have generally adhered to these agreements by institutionalizing this arrangement advocates of biennial budgeting hope to duplicate its perceived success some opponents and some proponents of biennial budgeting as well however argue that the lessons to be learned from successful executivecongressional summits are somewhat narrower opponents suggest that while these occasional summits have proved useful in the context of facilitating the following years budget process it would not be possible to institutionalize the process they suggest that the political and budgetary context that brings congress and the president to the bargaining table is also nece ssary to ensure commitment to implementing the outcome some proponents feel that biennial budg et resolution should only be adopted within the context of an overall move to twoyear cycle without biennial implementation they argue biennial budget resolution would not present sufficient certainty for long term planning significant savings in congressional workload or provide additional time for oversight

most proposals would require all regular appropriations measures to be considered in the first year of each congress eith er for single twoyear fiscal period or for two oneyear periods in both cases congress would not need to act on appropriations during the second year of each congress except for emergency and other supplemental appropriations needs some proposals in the past have opted instead for process that would stretch out the current process so that while the appropriations process could begin in the first session of congress the fiscal biennium would not begin until october 1 of the second year this would give congress and the president period of 20 m onths rather than the current eight months to negotiate appropriations details under such pr oposals congress would still not need to act on appropriations in the off year except for emergency or supplemental appropriations most proponents of biennial budgeting contend that twoyear appropriations are an essential part of any biennial budgeting system in their view it is primarily the annual nature of the current appropriations process that produces the strain on the current system they assert that major benefit of biennial appropriations would be that during the two years for each congress there would be year in which routine appropriati ons actions could be avoided although emergency and other supplemental appropriations actions might be necessary in the off year they believe that the net effect of this change would still be reduction of congressional workload and would free up enough time for congress to conduct more meaningful program reviews for the executive branch as well as for state and local governments biennial appropriations would be beneficial they argue because they would provide sufficient certainty to allow for better long term planning finally proponents also suggest that reducing the number of times in which congress and the president must confront each ot her over budget priorities would allow for better overall comity between the two branches current practice already includes number of the devices proposed as part of biennial budgeting system for example appropriations currently provide for both advance appropriations httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30550g4g146g142g151g151g146g138g149g561g4g158g141 g144g142g157g146g151g144g497

available for periods of longer than single fiscal year for number of programs in the view of opponents however making these practices mandatory for all programs will not result in greater benefits it is not they contend routine appropriations that cause conflict and delays in the budget process so widening these practices to mandate their use for all programs every other year would not result in any significant improvements in the process conflict and delay occur because of lack of consensus on nonroutine matters either within congress or between congress and the president attempting to resolve these issues for two years at time they assert would simply raise the stakes and thereby heighten the possibility for conflict and increased delay in addition they argue that it is the impending start of the fiscal year on october 1 and the anticipation of new budget submission by the president the following february that force action without these deadlines it is possible that it could take the full two years for congress and the president to produce budget making projections of year devoted to oversight less likely critics of twoyear appropriations also point out that budget forecasts are prone to error and that with total budget in excess of 2 trillion even sm all errors in terms or percentage can result in significant errors in terms of dollars of revenues or expenditures projecting revenues and expenditures for twoyear cycle requires forecasting as much as 30 months in advance rather than 18 under an annual budget cycle even if routine appropriations could be considered every other year with only limited ability to anticipate future conditions critics argue that twoyear cycle would inevitably result in incorrect funding decisions whether the result was to provide too much or too little funding for individual programs it could necessitate congress choosing between allowing the president greater latitude for making budgetary adjustments in the off years or themselves engaging in midcycle corrections to degree that would nullify any anticipated time savings or planning advantages

experience at the state level state practices are often cited in deliberations on budget process reform in particular 21 states operate under twoyear budget cycle see table 2 and this experience is cited by many in discussing the applicability of biennial budgeting to the federal government however state experience does not provide any single answer concerning biennial budgeting some states that operate under an annual cycle have significant portions of their budget enacted on twoyear cycle missouri enacts its operating budget on an annual cycle but its capital budget on biennial cycle while kansas budgets for some regulatory agencies two years at time within the overall context of an annual budget conversely some states with biennial cycles do significant portion of their budgeting on an annual basis arizona law requires that most state agencies be funded on biennial cycle but also requires some to be funded annually whereas virginia enacts biennial budget that is routinely amended during the session when the budget is being executed minnesota considers both its operating and capital budgets on twoyear cycles but in different years as result supporting examples can be found both for and against adopting twoyear cycle at the federal level 23 23 ronald k snell annual vs biennial budgeting clear winner spectrum vol 68 winter 1995 p 23

among states has been to shift from biennial to annual budget cycles partic ularly in those states with larger populations this trend opponents suggest demonstrates that biennial budgeting represents way of budgeting less applicable to modern circumstances in support of this they point out that in 1940 only four of 48 states operated with annual budg et cycles most states operated with biennial budget cycles because the state legislatures only t every other year today with the prevalence of annual sessions 29 states use annual cycles including eight of the 10 most populous states24 however the changes have not all been in favor of annual budgeting at least four states hawaii in 1967 nebraska in 1987 connecticut in 1991 and arizona in 1999 have switched to biennial budgeting after extended periods in which they used an annual cycle and several others indiana minnesota and wisconsin returned to biennial cycles after brief experiments with annual budgets one of the chief arguments of opponents is that biennial budgeting would inevitably lead to greater authority for the president again the experience at the state level is inconclusive two year budget cycle can be coupled with varying degrees of executive branch discretion and authority for example arkansas with biennial budget has far stricter limits on the governors authority to transfer funds or cut spending unilaterally than does south carolina with an annual budget 25 the natural tension between the desire for longer planning horizons and the increasing inaccuracy of budget projections when stretched over longer pe riods is not solved at the state level the same basic system of funding stability and incremental budget changes that characterizes federal budgeting operates at the state level few programs are subject to sweeping changes in any given year regardless of the budget cycle suggesting that the need for longer budget cycle to ensure better planning and fears of the inadequacy of assumptions about the future are both overstated 24 california florida georgia michigan new jersey new york and pennsylvania all operate with annual cycles whereas ohio and texas operate with biennial
