2007 012310 0500 august 2 2007 massive ulf blast detected in us bridge collapse catastrophe by sorcha faal and as reported to her western subscribers reports from russias institute of solarterrestrial physics located in irkutsk are reporting today that their siberian solar radio telescope ssrt detected massive ultra low frequency ulf blast emanating from latitude 45 00 north longitude 93 15 west at the exact moment and location of catastrophic collapse of nearly 2000 foot long bridge in minneapolis minnesota to the horrific destruction of the interstate 35w bridge which spanned the mississippi river we can read as reported by the star tribune news service the 1907foot bridge fell into the mississippi river and onto roadways below the span was packed with rush hour traffic and dozens of vehicles fell with the bridge leaving scores of dazed commuters scrambling for their lives nine people were confirmed dead as of 4 am today sixty were taken to hospitals and 20 people were still missing this morning authorities said they expected the death toll to rise russian military reports state that the total collapse of such massive bridge and in the absence of evidence linking its destruction to terrorist activity could only have been accomplished by an acoustic weapon of which the united states military is known to possess these reports further state that one of the united states primary research organizations into acoustic weapons research is augsburg college and which is located in minneapolis minnesota and most importantly less than 1 mile from the interstate 35w bridge collapse to the exact reason of why and what exactly happened in this catastrophe we can only speculate but with what is known about the united states past history of using sophisticated weapons on their own citizens for research purposes it certainly lies in the realm of possibility that this horrific tragedy is rooted in the use of ulf weapons to the past usage of these new types of weapons we can read even back into the 1980s of the united states research into their use as reported by the cnn news service imagine the implications of weapon with visible trace weapon that could knock out tanks ships and planes as fast as the speed of light the same technology with modifications could disorient and even tranquilize military personnel rendering them virtually helpless in the battle zone these are the new weapons of war we will examine in this series for the past 40 years the world has been riveted by the threat of nuclear war and more recently by the prospect of space defenses using lasers and other modern technologies lightning is the most dramatic form of energy to be found in nature scientists have succeeded in creating limited types of artificial lightning and some think that these could be the forerunners of new type of directedenergy weapon part of family of weapons that operate within the radio frequency segment of the electromagnetic spectrum and are thus referred to as radio frequency weapons to the dangers of ulf weapons being used against civilians we can read the warnings of dr rauni leena kilde md the former chief medical officer for lapland northern finland who warned in 1999 when the use of electromagnetic fields extralow elf and ultralow ulf frequencies and microwaves aimed deliberately at certain individuals groups and even the general population to cause diseases disorientation chaos and physical and emotional pain breaks into the awareness of the general population public outcry is inevitable to the exact reason of why the united states would be targeting minneapolis with such massive ulf blast we can find in the exact neighborhoods that surround the interstate 35w bridge and which are home to one of the largest muslim populations in the united states including over 30000 somalis who are outraged by the us sponsored invasion of their home nation by ethiopian forces for the american people as whole this catastrophe provides yet another example of the consequences of their allowing their military forces to gain total control over their economy and lives and which history has long shown leads always towards total
