euets and the us title iv sulfur dioxide so2 program provide insights into regulatory issues that may face any future us carbon market from the initial operations of the euets the 2006 price crash raised questions about th adequacy of market regulation in particular some suspect that information about allocations leak ed before official publication and that certain trad ers profited from this knowledge title ivs longer trading history reveals two important trends 1 an increasing trend toward diverse and nontr aditional participants that is likely to continue under carbon market 2 an increasing use of fi nancial instruments to manage allowance price risk that is likely to expand under carbon market as hedge against price uncertainty indeed carbon market may l ook more like other energy markets such as natural gas and oil than the somewhat sedate so2 allowance market regulation of emissions trading would ve to consider two kinds of fraud and manipulation fraud by traders or intermediari against other investors and sustained price manipulation four agenci could have roles in th regulation of an emissions market each with its own attributes that may contribute to effective regulation the commodities futures trading commission cftc currently oversees the title iv program and its current mission most closely resembles what regulator of future carbon market would do incl uding experience in market surve illance to prevent or detect fraud nd manipulation the major fa iling of the cftc according to some is that it lacks the resources and the statutory mandate to do its job the securities and exchange commission sec is much larger than the cftc and its enforcement programs are considered more effective than the cftcs while the co2 market will resemble commodities markets more closely than securities sec has some appropria regulatory tools applicable to an emissions market the environmental protection agency pa would likely be responsible for the primary market in allowances howe ver epa lacks experience comparable to that of the cftc and sec in regulating tr ading markets although the data it gathered in the primary market could be critical to oversight of the secondary market federal energy regulatory commission ferc was granted oversight authority over bulk electricity and inte rstate natural gas markets in 2005 its experience with market surveillance and enforcement is thus limited in comparison to the sec and cftc and it does not play an active role in overseeing the title iv market it is possible that single regulator w ould have clear jurisdiction as is the case in the title iv program this kind of regulatory fragmentation has not always worked well an umbrella group to monitor ma rkets and provide forum for regulatory coordination

markets introduction number of congressional proposals to advance programs that reduce greenhouse gases have been introduced in the 110th congress proposals receiving particular attention woul d create marketbased greenhouse gas reduction programs along the lines of the trading provisions of the current sulfur dioxide acid rain reduction program establishe d by title iv of the 1990 clean air act amendments1 these capandtrade schemes would im pose ceiling cap on total annual emissions of greenhouse gases and establis h market in pollution rights called allowances between affected entities an allowance would be limited authorization by the government to mit one metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent co2e and could be bought and sold t raded or held banked by participa ting parties these domestic proposals have parallels with the pr ograms being implemented in europe to meet its obligations unde r the kyoto protocol specifically the european union eu has decided to imple ment capandtrade program along with other marketoriented mechanisms permitte d under the kyoto protocol to help it achieve compliance at least cost2 the eus decision to use emission trading to implement the kyoto protocol is at leas t partly based on th successful emissions trading program used by the united states to implement its acid rain control program these two operating capandtrade progra ms the uss acid rain program and the eus climate change program may provide insights for the design of domestic greenhouse ga s reduction scheme3 however while the experiences of the eu system directly relate to the gr eenhouse gas reduction initiative of the domestic legislative proposals it has operated only short time see text box the acid rain control program has longer operating history

sources among the lessons that phase 1 of the european trading system may have for similar us program is that allowance prices are linked to the price of other energy commodities4 analysis of ets allowance prices during phase 1 suggests the most important variables in determining allowance price changes have been oil and natural gas price changes5 for example when natural gas the cleaner fuel becomes more expensive relative to oil industrial users may switch to oil creating increased demand for allowances this suggests that traders will pursue arbitrage strategies involving simultaneous transactions in allowances and oil and gas contracts for example trader anticipating rise in the price of oil might take position in allowances in the expectation that the two prices would move in tandem since there is widespread suspicion that excessive speculation by hedge funds and others has affected energy prices in recent years6 the possibility that the price of allowances could also be subject to distortion or manipulation will be policy concern this report examines the ets and title iv sulfur dioxide capandtrade program with focus on the market activity and the current regulatory

system ets is by far the largest market for greenhouse gas emi ssions allowances trading began in 2005 when allowances were issued by the 27 member states of the european union to about 12000 electric utility and industrial sources of co2 in 2007 allowances for 16 billion metric tons of carbon emissions changed hands with financial value of nearly 41 billion7 secondary market trading involves not onl companies to whom allowances are originally allocated but also range of brokers and intermediaries trading occurs in the form of bilateral agreements nd on overthecounter otc markets both of which are essentially unregulated other than an obligation to report all transactions to the national registry trading also takes place on financial exchanges which are subject to various forms and degrees of re gulation the leading exchange market is the european climate exchange ecx in l ondon which handles about 75 of exchangetraded volume the other exchanges with significant trading volumes are bluenext formerly powernext based in pa ris with about 14 market share nord pool scandinavian electrical power exchange wh ich handles about 8 and the european energy exchange eex in leip zig germany with about 4 of volume8 the basic unit of trading is the eu ropean union allowance eua which permits the holder to emit one metric ton of co2 allowances themselves are bought and sold in the spot market but there are several additiona l forms of emissions trading term contracts call for specified number of deliveries of allowances to take pl ace over period of time forward contracts are sales where delivery is to be made at future date but at todays price futures contracts which are traded only on exchanges give holders the right to buy or sell allowances over the term of the contract at the price that prevailed when the contract was made they gain or lose value as the market price of the underlying allowance fluctuates and they allow financial speculators who do not deal in physical co2 themselves to participate in the market swaps are economically equivalent to futures but are traded over thecounter rather than on an exchange the value of swap is linked to the price of the underlying allowance the twohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34488crs4 9 the eua swap market has been slow to develop for two reasons first there is standard contract documentation several pr ivate trade

are close substitutes trading in cers takes the same forms regulated or unregulated spot markets and forwards futures and other derivative instruments what is regulated implementation of the ets proceeded without formal directive or specification as to secondary trading venues or regulation the legal framework of the ets does not lay down how and where trading in allowances should take place companies and other participants in the market may trade directly with each other or buy and sell via broker exchange or any type of market intermediary that may spring up to take advantage of new market of significant size11 the decision was to let trading be shaped by market forces as result the act of buying and selling allowan ces does not in itself subject one to regulation or make one regulated entity this is not to say however that the eu envisioned completely unregulated market instea d allowance traders come under regulation when they engage in financial practices that are regulated regardless of the nature of the underlying interest or instrument similarly when transactions take place onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34488crs5 12 the exception as always is that trades must be reported to the national registries which are linked electronically to central eu facility an ownership registry is necessary because all firms must surrender at the end of each year quantity of allowances sufficient to cover their emissions or else pa cash to cover the excess pollution 13 the website of the international emissions trading association ieta has brief summaries of polish german

individual counterparty defaults clearing hous are traditional feature of the futures exchanges the guarantees they provide permit rapid trading to occur by eliminating the need for traders to assess

provide clearing services for otc emissions trades beginning on fe bruary 29 2008 see lchclearnet press release february 25 2008regulated markets emissions trading is regulated in the same way as other transactions executed on those markets the degree of regulation depends on two things 1 does the instrument being traded meet the definition of financial instrument or product and 2 is the trade taking place on regulated market although financial regulation has been harmonized in the eu to significant degree there remains some variation in these definitions and in market regulation among eu member states on the first key point what is being traded there appears to be general agreement among national laws the simple sale of an allowance by one party to another does not subject ither party to regulation12 firm may sell its euas the way it sells any other piece of property if however what is being transferred is not an eua itself but rather financial contract that conveys rights to an eua or that is based on future delivery or the future price of an allowance the trade m eets the definition of financial transaction or instrument in many countries and may be regulated person arranging or participating in such transaction may come under the jurisdiction of banking or securities laws and be required to register as an intermediary or broker13 certain forms of trades like futures contracts may be restricted to regulated futures exchanges trades that are otherwise unregulated may come under government oversight if they occur on regulated market several of the european emissions exchanges provide platform for spot ma rket trades as well as fina ncial contracts these spot trades are subject to the same types of market surveillance as the financial contracts some of which could not be legally executed offexchange and the same registration and reporting require ments apply in addition if an unregulated overthe counter otc trade such as swap or fo rward contract is processed and guaranteed by regulated clearing house that trade is also open to the scrutiny of financial regulators14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34488crs6 15 cftc regulation in many aspects is modeled

within the eu the differences however continue to diminish as result of both eu harmonization directives and the globalization of markets which is most visible in the numerous crossborder mergers that continue to occur among securities and futures exchanges many of the differences that remain are matters of terminology rather than substance in general the exchanges where emissions and emissions derivatives are traded are subject to regulatory scheme broadly comparable to the regulation of the futures exchanges in the united states by the commodity futures trading commission cftc15 the exchange itself must satisfy numerous conditions of registration which include market surveillance to ter fraud and manipula tion various reporting requirements including publication of trad and price data and so on exchange rules are generally subject to re gulatory oversight or approval access to the trading mechanisms is generally limited to exchange members others must trade as customers of member intermediary exchange members may be required to register with regulatory agency and in all cases are subject to exchange rules and financial standards apart from their exchange memberships brokerage firms may also be subject to registration and regulation by financial authorities because of the nature of their bus iness some features of the regulatory environments of the four largest eu emi ssions exchanges are set out in an appendix to this report clearing houses may be part of an exchan ge or standalone entities they are also subject to registration requirements generally administered by the exchange regulator in addition because they repres ent concentration of financial risk they may be subject to central ba nk safety and s oundness regulation the fact that given market organization may be international in scope may require it to report to multiple national regulators16 this does not appear to have been barrier to the development of the market or source of market fragmentation as noted above london has become the trad ing center with about threequarters of all secondary derivatives trading in co mmodity markets trading tends to gravitate to the single market providing most liqui dity before the eu drive for single financial market this impul was blocked by laws nd regulations in several european countries intended to preserve monopoly for local

from the ets the fact that the ets was implemented without formal governmentdevised blueprint for secondary trading does not ppear to have caused significant problems in the market according to one study this apparent confidence in market ingenuity has proved wellfounded17 trading volumes are growing rapidly suggesting that investors do not view the market as being rigged against them or subject to manipulation by insiders this does not mean that the first phase of the ets from 2005 through 2007 was an unqualified success in fact many re gard it as disaster the major problem however did not come from the secondary ma rket but rather from the primary market process of allocating and issuing euas when phase one began in 2005 trading commenced before the formal allocations had been made thus prices were initially based on traders expectations of the number of euas that would be issued18 allocations were not made at the eu level but were left to th discretion of individual countries when the allocations were finally made it became apparent that some countri had been very generous and that the total supply of euas was go ing to be much higher than the market anticipated as result the market crashe d in the spring of 2006 the price per eua dropped in few weeks from over 31 to less than 11 and by the end of phase one in 2007 fell below one euro19 the price crash by weakening the financial incentive to reduce pollution undermined the basic rationale for the ets although the problem did not originate in the secondary market it did raise stions bout the adequ acy of market regulation in particular ma ny observers suspect that in formation about the size of allocations leaked before fficial publication and that certain traders profited from this knowledge traders with nonpublic in formation on certified emissions data which gives an indication of future demand for allowances may also have profited unauthorized leaks of verified emi ssion data for 2005 in several countries created information asymmetries and undue opportunities for some businesses market participants this has highlighted the need for strict rules and procedures for handling of pricesensitive informa tion along the lines that is common in more mature financial markets20httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34488crs8 21 see eg robert godby market powe r in laboratory emission permit markets

ahead of the publication of pricesensitive information the putative manipulators fail to trade on such information maintaining an artificially high price in another hypothetical scenario large traders with inside information could prop up the price in the spot market to give them time to take short positions in the derivatives market that would become prof itable when the spot price eventually fella number of theoretical studies have raised the possibility of price manipulation by dominant firm or by few large fi rms acting in collusion while thousands of pollution sources receive euas few large power generators account for disproportionate share21 some observers have raised the possibility that such manipulation may have occu rred during the price crash the fact that knowledge about excess allowances has gradually become known without the market reacting immediately was seen by some analysts as sign that there might have been collusion of the big power companies which in essence are the major buyers and equally benefit by high allowance price through higher power prices22 it is likely however that any undue market power accruing to few large consumers of allowances in the eu or the united states will d iminish as emissions trading becomes global in scope particularly if markets are linked electronically it should be noted that eu regulators have not brought any enforcement actions based on manipulation of emissions prices in public at least on balance the secondary market in emissions allowances that has evolved wit hout central direction and in combination of regulated nd unregulated venues appears to have functioned well for the most part the incentives of market participants and regulators are in alignment both want an efficient and transparent price

sources are capped at specified emission rate times historical average fuel consumption level beginning january 1 2000 so2 emissions from new plants commencing opera tion after enactment must be offset in effect the emissions cap for new sources is zero their allowances come from emissions reductions at existing facilities the program was implemented through twophase process with the final phase beginning in 2000 to implement the so2 reduction program the law creates comprehensive permit and emissions allowance system capandtrade program an allowance is limited authorization to emit ton of so2 during or after specified year issued by epa the allowances are allocated to existing power plant units in accordance with formulas delineated in the w the owner of the facility receives the allowances for given plant regardless of the actual operati on of the plant for example an owner may choose to shut down an existing power plant and use those allowances to offset emissions from two newer cleaner facilities as noted generally power plant that commences operation after enactment receives allowances requiring new units to obtain allowances from those with allowances or purchase them at an epa sponsored auction in order to operate after 2000 an owner may trade allowances nationally as well as bank allowances for future use or sale if an affected unit does not have sufficien t allowances to cover its emissions for given year it is subject to an mission penalty of 2000 1990 i ndexed to inflation per ton of excess so2 and it submits to epa plan for offsetting those excess emissions in the next year or long er if epa approves further epa must deduct allowances equal to the excess tonnage from the sources allocation for the next year another epa responsibility is to provide for allowance auctions for the post 2000 peri od the law sets aside percentage of available allowances for auction anyone may participate in these auctions as buyer or seller and those selling allowances may specify minimum sale price epa may delegate or contract the conduct of the auctions to other agencies ch as to the department of the treasury or even to nongovernmental groups or organi zations two streams of allowances are sold in the auctions the first stream repr esents spot sales of allowances that must either be used in the year they are sold or banked for use in later year the second stream represents advance sales of allowances that must either be used in the seventh year after the year they are first offe red for sale or be ba nked for use in later year for 2000 and thereafter title iv pr ovides that 125000 allowances be setaside annually for spot sales and 125000 for advance saleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34488crs10 24 epa has renamed the ats the allowance ma

auctions key provision of title iv to ensure liquidity in the so2 markets for new entrants is the epa allowance auction as noted above the epa is required to auction 250000 allowances annually in two streams spot and advance the auctions began in 1993 nd are held annually usually on the last monday in march sealed bids entailing the number type nd price along with payment are sent to epa later than three business days before the auctions the auctions sell the allowances according to bid price starting with the highest bid and continuing down until all allowances are sold or there are more bids unlike allowances offered by private holde rs for auction these epa allowances do not have minimum price for the first 13 years the auctions were conducted by the chicago board of trade cbot for

federal economic regulation addresses wholesale transactions and rates for electric power flowing in interstate commerce historically federal regulation followed state regulation and is premised on the need to fill the regulatory vacuum resulting from the constitutional inability of states to regulate interstate commerce in this bifurcation of regulatory jurisdiction federal regu lation is

ventures under puhca to prevent recurrence of th abusive practices of the 1920s eg crosssubsidization selfdealing pyramiding etc this comprehensive costbased appr oached to regulation began to undergo change in the 1970s and 1980s as passage of the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 purpa29 and the fuel use act of 1978 fua30 helped establish independent electricity genera tors electricity producers who sold at wholesale and had exclusive franchise area build ing on the perceived success of these independent generators under purpa the energy policy act of 1992 epact92 created new category of wholesale electric generators called exempt wholesale generators ewgs that are not cons idered utilities and not regulated under puhca31 ewgs also referred to as merchant

regulate transmission for retail sales if utility unbundles transmission from other retail charges in states that have opened their generation market to competition unbundling occurs when customers are charged separately for generati on transmission and distri bution nine states led by new york filed suit arguing that th federal power act gives ferc jurisdiction over wholesale sales and interstate transmissi on and leaves all retail issues up to the state utility commissions enron in an amicus brief argued that ferc clearly has jurisdiction over all transmission and ferc is obligat ed to prevent transmission owners from discriminating against those wishing to use the transmission lines on march 4 2002 the us supreme court ruled in favor of ferc and held that ferc has jurisdiction over transmission including unbundl ed retail transactionsa competitive wholesale electric generation sector epact92 effectively initiated deregulated wholesale generation by creating class of generators that were able to locate beyond typical service territory w ith open access to the existing transmission system epact05 continued this process by adding provisions to address system reliability repeal puhca and modify purpa32 the current status of these initiatives and resulting state responses is mixture of states with traditional comprehensive ror regulation of electricity and those with restructured industry with segmented generation transmission and distribution components over the past 20 years some states have truncated their ror regulation to the extent they have chosen to restru cture their industry in response to federal initiatives in states that have not restructured the system operates as it has since enactment of the federal power act with retail consumers paying one price that includes transmission distribution and ge neration this is referred to as bundled transaction in states that have restructured consumers are billed for separate transmission distribution and generation charges this is referred to as unbundled electricity service in those states retail consumer s are allowed to choose their retail generation supplier however

treatment of allowances 1 regulations tend to require 100 of both expenses and revenues from allowances to be returned to ratepayers with net gains losses incurred used to offset or increase fuel costs 2 few states have allowed utilities to retain some of the profits as an incentive to sell excess allowances 3 state regulations tend to be tailored to states specific circumstance allowance rich states have regulations encouraging sales allowance poor states have regulations encouraging purchases39 the focus of puc decisions has not been to encourage allowance transactions but generally to ensure ratepayers and not sh areholders receive the benefits of the allowances in some cases pucs have also used their authority to encourage utilities to protect highsulfur coal production even if it is not th most costeffective control strategy40 allowance transactions internal transfers when the 1990 clean air act amendments were enacted about 75 of the allowances were allocated to vertically inte grated ror regulated entities today that percentage has shifted with more allowances allocated to independent generating entities as some utilities have divested themselves of their generating assets this diversif ication of ownership is refl ected to some degree in the ats statistics on official transfers and transactions41 as indicated by table 2 in the first two years of trading transfers be tween economically unrelated entities were small percentage of total transfers more recent data suggest that transfers between unrelated entities account for about 50 of to tal transfers however it is clear that internal transfers remain major part of the allowance market even in restructured industry and that the total number of offici transactions occurring is quite modest internal

also considered cash sales55 in terms of allowances the cftcs jurisdiction is confined to trades that take place on those markets it regulates it has jurisdiction over spot trades in allowances full jurisdiction over futures and options trades on regulated exchanges and limited jurisdiction over derivatives trades on certain other markets subject to lighter regulation than the exchanges

emissions markets are volatile and price fluctuates considerably market pa rticipants manage price risk through the use of derivative structures such as fo rwards futures options caps and floors these

account for the remaining 1 data from epa inventory of us greenhouse gas emissi ons and sinks 19902005 april 15 2007 p es14 63 the eu addresses this issue by having th ets cover only 45 of its emissions and noncarbon dioxide emissions as noted earlier still it has 11500 entities to oversee which should counterbalance any disparat effects on financial integrity which might be imposed by the initial lack of trading history and prices61 lessons and observations from title iv program despite the tendency to view the title iv program as model for future greenhouse gas reduction scheme there are several important differences for example the title iv program invol ves up to 3000 new and existing electric generating facilities that contribute twothirds of the countrys so2 and onethird of its nitrogen oxide nox emissions the tw primary precursors of acid rain this concentration of sources makes the logis tics of allowance trading administratively manageable and enforceable with conti nuous emissions monitors cems providing real time data however greenhouse gas missions are not so concentrated in 2005 the electric power industry accounted for about 33 of the countrys ghg emissions while the trans portation section accounted fo r about 28 industrial use about 19 agriculture about 8 commerc ial use about 6 nd residential use about 562 thus small dispersed sources in transportation resi dentialcommercial and agricultural sectors along with industr are far more important in controlling ghg emissions than they are in controlling so2 emissions this diversity multiplies as the global nature of the climate change issue is considered along with the multiple ghgs involved63 thus carbon market is like to involve far greater numbers of affected parties from diverse industrie s than the current title iv program it will also involve far greater numbers of tradeable allowances than the current title iv program under the current program about 9 million allowances are allocated to participating entities annually in contrast domestic greenhouse gas program that capped emissions in the ectric power transportation and industry sectors at their 1990 levels at some point in the future would be allocating about 485 billion allowances annually this is two and half ordersofmagnitude increase over the title iv program and double the ph ase 2 allocations under the ets trading activities under title iv has been increas ing since 2005 however the volumes dont approach those anticipated if gr eenhouse gas capandtrade program were instituted finally the economic value of fu ture carbon market is likely to be substantially greater than the title iv program with epas pending implementation of the clean air interstate rule cair the price of title iv allowance hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34488crs27 64 based on data from cantor fitzgerald october 2007 65 range based on epa estimates for reducing emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 as required under s 280 see epa analysis of the climate stew ardship and innovation act of 2007 july 16 2007 for reference phase 2 ets allowance currently sells for about 2025 euro data from the european climate exchange httpwwwecxeuropecomdefault_flashaspincreased to about 50064 thus the annual allocation of so2 allowances has market value of about 45 billion using estimates of 15 to 25 an allowance the annual allocati on of 485 billion allowances posited above for greenhouse gas program would have market value of 728 billion to 1213 billion 65 unlike the title iv market carbon market may be quite liquid particularly as the market expands globally despite these differences in scope and magnitude there are trends in title iv trading that are likely to continue in carbon market first there is trend toward more di verse nontraditional pa rticipants in the title iv market like th title iv ma rket the ec onomic importance of carbon market will likely draw in entities not directly affected by the reduction requirements such as financial institutions the motivations of these entities may be equally diverse including facilitating projects invol ving the need for allowances portfolio

trend is partly the result of the regulatory uncertainty introduced in the allowance market by cair given the greater economic stakes involved in carbon market this trend toward more sophisticated

the rare oc casions when price manipulation is suspected as discussed belowvolume to gravitate to single market to enhance liquidity69 this suggests that the less successful competitors might be relegated to niche markets that number of trading mechanisms could be linked electroni cally to form single market or that mergers and acquisitions would re duce the number of trading venues it is of little public interest which firm or firms emerges as the market leader what is important however is that th ere be an authoritative source of price information since the price of emissions will guide firm s considering investment in pollution abatement price discovery mechanisms are most efficient in liquid markets where many traders bring information to the pricesetting process by their buying and selling decisions in general the functioning of the price mechanism has not been concern of financial regulators70 the securities and exchange commission sec and the cftc both rely on selfregulation by the ex changes in this area reflecting the fact that the exchanges predate the federal re gulators by decades or centuries both agencies have broad authority to interv ene if they determine that prices do not accurately reflect the underlying forces of supply and demand if patterned after the title iv program and the epa maintained the registry of allowance ownership that agency might play role in price dissemination in future carbon market reports to the epa that trade has occurred could be required to include price information which could be published electronically in practice however the epa might not be the best s ource of price data since the epa would presumably receive only spot market trade data and since most proposals follow the title iv procedure that speci fies that each transaction re port to the epa must include written certification of the transfer signed by responsible official of each party the question arises whether prices generate d by the epa registry would be outdated by the time they were published in prac tice many commodity spot markets look to the futures exchanges for current prices new prices are generated there secondby second recorded and transmitte d almost instantaneously if substantial numbers of spot transactions took place on exchanges as they do in europe current information on spot prices might also be available regulators might have role to play in ensuring that the exchanges did not charge excessive fees for access to real time price data bo th the sec and cftc have grappled with this issue customers tend to view the exchanges as public utilities and prices as common goods but the exchanges naturally look upon price data as their private property to be sold for what the market will bear the availability of price information also depends on the regulatory status of the source market exchanges regulated by th sec or cftc are required to disclosehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34488crs30 71 see crs report rs21401 regulation of energy derivatives by mark jickling for discussion of issues associated with unregulated otc trading 72 the senatepassed version of hr 2419 the farm bill and an unnumbered bill to reauthorize the cftc marked up and approved by the house agriculture committee in december 2007 73 this report does not address fraud outside the secondary markets such as falsification of emissions data the epa would be the appropr iate agency to oversee and verify emissions measurement price and volume data the proprietary issue mentioned above refers only to intra day or realtime prices these rules do not apply with the same force to overthe counter otc markets which are significant presence in financial and energy derivatives markets but which are largely exempt from cftc regulation71 under current law the cftc has very limited authority to require otc markets to disclose trading data legislation before the 110th congress would require such disclosure by exempt markets that were determined by the cftc to play significant role in the price discovery process72 fraud and manipulation regulation of secondary emi ssions trading would have to consider two kinds of fraud and manipulation fraud by traders or intermediaries against other investors and sustained price manipula tion which is harmful not onl to market participants but potentially to consumers and the economy73 investor fraud both cftc and sec have extensive experience with numerous programs designed to prev ent and punish fraud much antifraud regulation takes place in selfregulatory framework regulated exchanges are required to establish and enforce rules to promote fair trading to choose two examples from very long list of investor protection rules securities brokers are bound by duty of best execution they are required to obtain the best terms reasonably available to fill customers order while futures commission merchants are prohibited from trading fo r their own accounts when they have an unfilled customer order in nd many similar protections would apply to trades in emissions allowances or derivatives ex ecuted on regulated exchange whether futures or securities both types of mark ets require professional traders to maintain accurate records of all transactions there is strong reason to think that cftc or sec regulation would be superior in pr otecting small traders either should be adequate in addition to federal statutes and regulations and the rules of selfregulating securities and futures exchanges state laws provide protections against crooked dealings brokers investment advisers and other intermed iaries are regulated at the state level in their transactions with customers to prevent them from taking advantage of public invest ors with less knowledge of current market conditions the degree to which fraud on the unwar could be problem depends on how many and what kinds of traders are attracted to the market in the so2 market it is not significant problem so2 emissions are primarily ge nerated by relatively fewhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34488crs31 74 otc traders must be eligible contract par ticipants defined in the commodity

having to register with the sec 76 for brief overview of the law see crs report rs21127 federal securities law insider trading by michael v seitzingerpower utilities each of which has roughly the same information as the others all see the same weather forecasts and energy price data in such market it is difficult for one party to defraud another the co2 market would be different there w ould be thousands of firms in the market and potentially millions if the program were to cover transportation emissions assuming that significant information asymmetries exist between small firms in the market and large ones the latter are likely to be in position to take advantage of the former either sec or cftc regulation c ould be appropriate depending on whether emissions allowances and derivatives came to be traded on securities or futures exchanges in otc derivatives markets where only sophisticated investors and institutions are allowed to trade74 participants are assumed to have the incentive and capacity to protect themselves from fraud75 this is the general rationale for exempting certain markets from regulation if public customers are not present there is thought to be public interest in providi ng investor protection at the taxpayers expense spot market trades which would not come under regu lation under current securities or commodities law are another area where abuses could arise from information asymmetries between large sophisticated tr aders and smaller firms that rarely use the market the potential for abuse however would be greatly reduced if current price data were easily available to all market participants inside information the european experience suggests that there may be opportunities to trade on insi nonpublic information even sophisticated market participants are vulnerable to this type of fraud the concepts of insider trading however are not the same in securities and futures markets under securities law insider trading involves the use of nonpublic information about single firm corporate insiders in possession of nonpublic information that is material that is that would affect reasonable investors decision to buy or sell are prohibited from buying or selling the companys shares until the information is disclosed to the public all trades by certain executives officers and directors in their own companys shares must be di sclosed within two business days the definition of who is an insider has been expanded by legisla tion and court decisions in recent decades so that under certain circumstances i nvestment bankers journalists and various fiduc iaries may be encompassed76httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34488crs32 77 there is large theoretical literature on both stock and futures markets that argues that any restriction of insider trading is undesi rable because it makes pricing less efficient 78 the tippees are likewise prohibited fro m trading on that information see 17 cfr 159 the definition of material nonpublic information is essentially the same as in securities markets 79 see us senate permanent subcommittee on investigations excessive speculation in the natural gas market staff report june 2007 the argu ment that manipulation has occurred is not universally accepted see written testimony of acting cftc chairman walter lukken and commissioner michael dunn before the permanent subcommittee on investigations senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs july 9 2007 httpwwwcftcgovstellentgroupspublicnewsroomdocumentssp eechandtestimony continuedin futures markets there is equivale nt to inside information about single corporations prospects contracts are based on homogenous commodities that thousands of people produce trade and c onsume certainly some traders large producers or industrial users of commodities have info rmation that others do not have but the price discovery process depends on that in formation being incorporated into the price77 the commodity exchange act and cftc regulations bar exchange employees or governing board or committee members from trading on material nonpublic information obtained through their positions or from tipping others to trade on such information78 this prohibition does not extend to everyone who trades in the market because of the variance between future s and securities concepts of insider trading if hypothetically the ceo of exxonmobil were to buy stock knowing that the discovery of major new oil field would be announced the next day the transaction would be clearly illegal under the securities laws if however in the same circumstances he sold crude oil futures contracts expecting that the announcement would lower the price of oil it would not necessarily be unlawful thus it is not certain that either the cftc or the sec approach to insider trading would be adequate to protect the market from the kind of abuse suspected in europe before the allowance price crashed in 2006 where traders may have used pre publication data regarding missions levels and allowan ce allocations what may be required is hybrid of securities and commodities law imposing disclosure requirements on certain firm s in possession of materi nonpublic information market manipulation investor protection is not the only goal of antifraud regulation even though sophisticated inve stors in unregulated private markets have the incentive and means to protect themselves against fraud by those with superior information these markets may be just as vulnerable to price manipulation as the public markets in recent years there has been widespread concern in congress and elsewhere that excessive speculation in energy derivatives may have caused the prices of oil and natural gas to be higher than the fundamental s of supply and demand would justify79httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34488crs33 79 continued opalukken26pdf visited march 3 2008 80 for an overview of the cftcs antimanipulation tools see

given price movement causes equal but opposite gains and losses to the two sidesallowance price manipulation would resemble the kind of manipulation that the cftc is equipped and accustomed to preven t detect or punish allowance prices would be subject to corners and squeezes to the same extent as any commodity contract assuming that allowances were issued in advance as they are in europe and that the supply could not be expanded befo re the beginning of the next allocation cycle to corner the market manipulator would amass large inventory of allowances while simultaneously taking fu tures or forward positions that required others to make delivery to it when squeeze is successful traders with delivery obligations have choice but to buy from the manipulator at prices it can dictate and then sell those same allowances back to the manipulator at the lower prices specified in the futures and forward contracts to prevent manipulations of this type which can cause prices of the underlying commodity emissions in this case to rise far above fundamental levels for extended periods of time the cftc has number of surveillance programs that apply to both the spot and futures markets first the cftc maintains large trader reporting system anyone controlling more than specified number of contracts must report the position daily this information is not made public but it allows the cftc to observe the accumulation of large positions that could serve as the basis for manipulation cftc is able to aggregat positions held by single trader with various brokerage firms second the cf tc monitors the liverable supply of commodities particularly as the expiration date of the futures contract draws near if unusual shortages in deliverable s upply emerge the cftc can take certain remedial steps80 however the cftc does not have the capacity nor clear statutory mandate for comprehensive mon itoring of spot trading in all the commodities upon which future s contracts are based the futures exchanges and clearing houses have strong incentives to prevent manipulation since futures trading is zerosum game81 victims of manipulated prices will almost certainly include ma ny exchange members clearing houses which guarantee payment on all contracts f ace the risk that squeeze or corner may cause many traders to fault on their obligations to deter manipulation the exchange s impose position size limits on certain contracts but these apply only to specula tors hedgers those who produce or deal in the underlying commodity are generally exempt in the allowance market as noted above concern is that single large emitter or group acting in concert could have enough market power to influe nce prices if concentration in the allowance market is significantly greater than in other commodities system of position limits that applies to hedgers might be usefulhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34488crs34 82 see crs report rs21401 regulation of energy derivatives by mark jicklingsec antimanipulation efforts on the other hand are generally not aimed at manipulations of an entire market but at th schemes to distort the price of single stock or group of stocks many such ma nipulations deal with misuse of inside information or spreading false information there is general equivalent to the cftcs large trader reporting system alt hough buyers of more than 5 of public companys shares must disclose their owne rship and state whethe r the investment is passive or whether control of the company is sought the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 significantly expanded the authority of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc giving the agency new role in regulating energy markets the act expanded the jurisdictional reach of ferc authorizing it to address any manipulative device and any entity participating in or affecting fercs jurisd ictional markets primarily bulk electricity and interstate natural gas ferc also received new civil authority to impose penalties of up to one million dollars per violation per day ferc oversees power markets that involve extensive administr ative adjustments to regional markets through market monitors but not markets that would be characterized as exchanges even before the 2005 act beginning in 2002 ferc had built new analytic capability to examine markets and look for anomalies in response to the enron and california electricity crises ferc established market oversight unit which grew to approximately 50 staff to comply with its new regulatory mission under the 2005 act resources were shifted to emphasize enforcement and audit activities as result the market oversight unit lost sta ff and has continued to shrink to perhaps dozen full time professionals at this time though it is relatively inexperienced as regulator of secondary markets ferc might play key role in coordination with another agency or agencies since the prices of natural gas and wholesale electric ity would be affected by emissions costs and vice versa the possibility of interm arket price manipulation exists without the information available to ferc it will be difficult to obtain comprehensive overview of supply and demand in the emissions market if an otc market for allowance deriva tives were to develop federal agency would have much authority over it or much information about trading volumes prices and market conditions the extent to which existing otc markets in financial and energy markets facilitate manipulation is controversial82 it is clear that the exchange and otc markets are economically linked and that swaps and futures are interchangeable from the traders point of view and that therefore prices in one market affect the other some argue that otc manipulation is unlikely because all participants are sophisticated and because manipulation of exchange market prices which are visible and often used in the spot market is likely to be more profitable others argue that the lesstransparent otc market is where wouldbe manipulator might choose to accumulate market power out of the regulators sight in any case the issue is now squarely before the congress and emissions trading is unlikely to present any strategies for manipulation not already found or suspected in the energy markethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34488crs35 83 this was the case few years ago with nasdaq and instinet trading system used only by nasdaq intermediaries the sec responded by requiring that nasdaq trading screens display price quotes from all electronic marketplaces handling nasdaq sharestransparency versus confidentiality in order for the capandtrade system to work firms must have clear price signals to guide their investment decisions reliable and transparent prices also foster liquid secondary markets which in turn can make pricing more efficient to public investors and customers tran sparency means primarily the availability of timely and affordable price information without such inform ation they are prey to betterinformed market insiders bo th sec and cftc ve wellestablished standards in this area the more difficult issue is how much information the public needs about how prices are set confidence in the market depends on investors believing that prices are determined fairly in response to r eal economic factors and not manipulated providing that assurance is ma jor function of the regulators but there are limits to transparency beyond certain point it becomes very expensive and may harm the market th discussion above about the market impact of large trades is one example of this large traders prefer to trade anonymously in order that other traders not jump in and sell when they are selling or buy when they are buying raising their transactions costs in the stock market number of electronic trading venues have thrived in competition with the major exchanges by offering anonymity to large institutional trad ers the potential danger here however is that fragmented or twotier market may evolve where mark et professionals and large traders deal with each ot her at prices better than t hose they offer to the public83 regulators also want information that traders would prefer to keep private large positions in futures as noted above are reported to the cftc but not made public there have been instances to da of trading abuses involving mishandling of large trader data in the emissions market government agencies would have access to large amounts of pricesensitive data the epa fi rst of all would have full information about the total number of allowa nces to be issued and how they were to be allocated it would also have data on actual meas ured emissions whic h could send important price signals under certain market conditions safeguarding this kind of informati on however need not present any special regulatory problems many federal agencies already generate statistics and forecasts that affect market prices macroeconomic and agricultural

pitfalls facing future us ma rket the 2006 price crash by weakening the financial incentive to reduce pollution under mined the basic rationale for the ets although the problem did not originate in the secondary market it did raise questions about the adequacy of market regulation in particular many observers suspect that information about the size of allocations leaked before offici publication and that certain traders profited from this knowledge traders with nonpublic information on certified emissions data which gives an indicati on of future demand for allowances may so have profited review of title ivs much longer trading history reveals at least two trends that are likely to continue in carbon market and to challenge regulators first there is trend toward more diverse nontraditi onal participants in the title iv market like the title iv market the economic importance of carbon market will likely draw in entities not directly affected by the reduction requirements such as financial institutions these entities motivations may be equally diverse including facilitating projects involving the need for allowances portfolio balancing intermediary fees and trading profits second as noted there is trend in the title iv market towa rd using financial instruments to manage allowance price risk given the greater economic stakes involved in carbon market this trend toward more sophisticated financial instruments is likely to emerge early as hedge against price uncertainty the emergence of entities wellversed in the use of these instruments may reinforce the trend and

fraud by traders or intermediaries against other investors and sustained price manipula tion which is harmful not onl to market participants but potentially to consumers and the economy four federal agencies could have roles in the regulation of secondary market in emissions allowances each has attributes that may contribute to effective regulation the cftc is the agency that currently oversees the title iv program and whose current mission most closely resembles what regulator of the prospective carbon emissions market would do secondary co2 trading in the eu does not appear to differ significantly from other commodities markets cftc is engaged in intermediary regulation has experience in market surveillance to prevent or detect fraud and manipulation and supervises market system

years cftc employme nt and budget have not kept pace the otc derivatives markets represent another major challenge many believe that the cftcs limited jurisdiction over the otc markets constitutes regulatory gap and that excessive unregulated speculation in energy contracts may be partly to blame for high and volatile energy prices the sec is much larger than the cftc and its enforcement programs are widely thought of as more effec tive than the cftcs while the co2 market will resemble commodities markets more closely than securities the sec has number of regulatory tools that might be appropriately applied to the emissions market these include regulation of insider trading and disclosure of ma terial formation by firms in the market it is likely that secregulated investment banks will play significant role in the development of us carbon trading market as they increasingly are doing in the title iv market it is also possible that co2 derivatives contracts or indexes could be listed and traded on securities exchanges if patterned after the title iv progra m epa would be responsible for the primary market in allowances the original allocation andor auction of permits to emitting firms it would maintain the registry of ownership of allowances epa lacks experience comparable to that of the cftc and sec in regulating trading markets but the information it gathers in the primary market could be critical to oversight of the secondary market ferc was granted oversight authority over bulk electricity and interstate natural gas markets in 2005 its expe rience with market surveillance and enforcement is thus limited in comparison to the sec and cftc and it does not play an active role in overseeing the title iv market ferc may have role to play however based on its oversight of commod ity markets with price linkages to co2 emissions but at this time it may be less wellequipped than the cftc or sec to be the primary regulator of secondary trading if development of secondary trading is left to market forces as it was in europe it is possible that single regulator woul d have clear jurisdiction as is the case in the title iv program co2related contracts as well as the allowances themselves could be traded simultaneously on futures and securities exchanges spot markets where epa has some jurisdiction and otc ma rkets that are
