1998 dennis w snook specialist social legislation education and public welfare congressional research service the library of congress abstract this report provides background on veterans preference in federal employment and discusses issues raised during deliberation in the 105th congress of two bills to amend existing law veterans advocates asserted that declining proportion of veterans among federal employees was an indication that the preference policy was not working as congress intended the two bills hr 240 and s 1021 addressed some of these concerns and s 1021 as amended was enacted as p l 105339 this report will be updated for further developments only veterans preferences congress enacts changes summary late in the 105th congress changes to veterans preferences were enacted as pl 105339 the veterans employment opportunities act of 1998 most federal agencies are required by law to grant preferences in federal hiring and retention to veterans with serviceconnected disabilities and certain other veterans whose service encompassed specified periods of time the proportion of veterans as share of the federal workforce declined from 37 in 1984 to 28 in 1995 and some veterans advocates contended that the decline reflected the failure of existing preferences to give veterans the advantages that their preferenceeligible status should entail included among their concerns about existing law veterans were not able to apply for all open jobs some veterans claimed that they were improperly denied appointment some believed that veterans were targeted during reductionsinforce in cases where their rights may have been ignored any appeal was difficult certain agencies were excluded from preference requirements hr 240 which passed the house during the 1st session would have expanded the number of federal jobs open to applications from veterans with at least 3 years active service provided more protections to veterans during reductionsinforce including increasing job transfer opportunities for veterans during rifs and requiring agencies to establish priority placement programs to help workers who lost jobs in rif and expanded preference requirements to some excluded positions in the white house and in the legislative and judicial branches the bill included language to make violating veterans preferences prohibited and punishable personnel practice adding new redress procedures for veterans who believed that their preference rights were not honored s 1021 originally companion to hr 240 was reported by the senate committee on veterans affairs with amendments moderating the language expanding application opportunities and eliminating the rif protections the committee left in the proposed redress procedures and added provisions that would give veterans of the persian gulf war preferences when they seek employment with federal contractors the new law will probably have appreciable effect on the proportion of veterans in the federal workforce which is higher than in the civilian workforce generally while the law will increase opportunities for veterans to be considered for federal jobs it will not change the process by which applicants are appointed in agencies where veterans preferences now apply the new law gives veterans means to challenge personnel actions that they believe are adverse to their interests as veterans while this new redress right will not necessarily alter the basis for personnel decisions many veterans believe that the existence of the right will discourage managers from seeking ways to

disability beginning with the civil war and perhaps from the beginning of the republic on an informal basis disabilities sustained during us military service were regarded as creating an obligation upon the government to help the disabled veterans during their remaining years preferential treatment in federal hiring and retention reflects this obligation to disabled veterans and in some circumstances dependents of disabled or deceased veterans readjustment at the completion of service in the veterans preference act of 1944 congress gave the federal government lead role in addressing problems arising from demobilization of large numbers of troops the act gave veterans competitive advantages for federal openings and for retention as the government began to scale back from its wartime employment levels subsequent amendments to the act gave similar readjustment assistance to veterans of korea vietnam and the persian gulf inducement at enlistment reward for service preferences can also be seen as measure encouraging enlistment andor as reward for service especially during period in which military service seems likely to lead to potential combat although evidence about the number of volunteers who enter military service largely because of enhanced federal employment opportunities would be difficult to develop it is likely that for many recruits preferences are one of several factors contributing to perception that period of enlistment will improve financial security once the service is completed eligibility1 veterans who sustained disability traceable to period of honorable military service are eligible for veterans preference other veterans eligible for veterans preferences must have received an honorable or general discharge and must generally meet other requirements about duration period of time or location of active duty military retirees at the rank of major lieutenant commander or higher are not eligible for veteran preferences unless they have serviceconnected disability nondisabled veterans qualify for preferences if they meet the above and 1 this section discusses eligibility criteria before enactment of pl 105339 crs2 after october 14 1976 they must also have served in war declared by congress or during campaign for which campaign medal was awarded and in addition after september 7 1980 they must have completed 2 years active duty or for the full period for which they were called or ordered to active duty unless they served on active duty during the period beginning on august 2 1990 and ending on january 2 1992 and completed the period for which they were called or ordered nondisabled veterans also qualify if they meet the general requirements and they served anytime during the period december 7 1941 to july 1 1955 or for more than 180 consecutive days any part of which occurred after january 31 1955 and before october 15 1976 in addition spouses and mothers of disabled veterans are also eligible for preferences under certain conditions unmarried surviving spouses of veterans who died of serviceconnected conditions or spouses of veterans who are unable to work because of serviceconnected disabilities and mothers of veterans who died in service or who are totally and permanently disabled from serviceconnected condition qualify for certain preferences provisions in pl 10585 the defense authorization act of 1998 give veterans preference status to veterans of service during the persian gulf war regardless of whether their service was in the gulf finally pl 10585 contains provisions that expand preference eligibility to other veterans who served after november 20 1995 in bosnia and nearby areas affected by that conflict veterans preferences in competitive civil service2 the modern federal civil service originated with passage of the pendleton act in 1883 the act brought together two views about contemporary federal service concern that increasingly complex and essential federal positions were being filled without due regard for the qualifications of the applicants and belief that competitive civil service was necessary to staff federal jobs with professional competent efficient and effective employees who would not be unduly influenced by partisan and personal political loyalties the meritbased civil service envisioned by the pendleton act requires an objective evaluation of applications from officeseekers and hiring decisions that can withstand close scrutiny as to their fairness and suitability for the position filled veterans preferences affect the objective criteria by giving competitive advantage to eligible veterans relative to nonpreference applicants who would otherwise be regarded as having at least equal qualifications when the competitive evaluations result in numerical score preference points are added to that score thereby 2 the body of veterans preference law is found in usc title 5 section 2108 crs3 advancing the veterans above competitors with scores that would otherwise be equal to or slightly above the scores the veterans would have had were they not given the additional preference points points cannot cause score that would otherwise not pass to be changed to passing veterans preferences do not assure every veteran job nor do they reflect goal that all federal vacancies should be filled by qualified veterans the preferences do not govern promotions or generally affect assignments or other inservice decisions while they provide competitive advantages during rifs they do not provide veterans with absolute protections during such reductions application of veterans preferences3 the competitive advantages held by preferenceeligible veterans take several forms including points added to examination scores waiver of physical requirements more liberal use of military service as applicable experience and in some cases direct hiring into positions excepted from the competitive process the present system of preferences originates with the veterans preference act of 1944 which codified existing rules that the examination scores of veterans seeking federal employment be raised by either five points for nondisabled veterans or 10 points for disabled veterans and eligible wives widows and mothers preferenceeligible veterans also have retention advantages during agency layoffs some veterans are also eligible for special preferential consideration by federal contractors preferences in federal hiring competitive civil service presumes that information about open positions will be made available and that applicants will be competitively ranked according to an examination that establishes the relative merits of their qualifications for specific positions the more specific the recruitment requirements such as for entry level clerical the more standardized can be the examination process such as the administration of skills test higher level technical administrative or professional positions have requirements that entail more detailed examination of potential candidates to determine suitability for the position to be filled regardless of its form whether standardized test or detailed examination of applicants pertinent qualifications the examining system must result in numerical rating with passing score of 70 out of possible 100 candidates are then ranked on the basis of their passing scores and the top passing scores are advanced for further consideration by the selecting officials veterans preference eligible applicants have points added to their passing scores veterans at the top of competitive list of applicants are theoretically in the best position to be hired in order for an agency to not hire veteran at the top of the list the agency must justify to the office of personnel management opm its reasons for passing over the higher ranking veteran 3 discussion in this section of the application of veterans preferences does not reflect changes caused by enactment of pl 105339 crs4 preferences during reductionsinforce agencies conducting rif specify the organizational and geographical boundaries within the jurisdiction of the agency that will be subject to the reduction rif is twostage process employees vulnerable to release first compete for retention with other employees in similar jobs competitive level if released they compete with other employees within the boundaries set by the agency the law provides that four factors must be taken under consideration in releasing specific employees tenure or type of appointment such as career or temporary veterans preference length of service and performance ratings during the first rif stage tenure groups are established with permanent career employees in the highest group and the remaining more temporary employees vulnerable to release about 96 of veterans employed by the federal government have preferences and within the career tenure group those preferenceeligible veterans are placed in higher retention subgroup than nonveterans regardless of length of service veterans with disabilities rated at 30 or greater are retained in their positions over disabled veterans with lesser ratings and all disabled veterans have higher retention factors than nondisabled veterans employees unable to hold their positions through the first stage competitive level have the right to bump an employee with lower retention standing or to retreat to position that the employee previously held if that position is presently occupied by an employee with lower retention standing and within the boundaries for the rif developed by the agency while vulnerable employee may bump to position the employee has never held the employee must be qualified for the position and the available position must have pay and grade higher or more than three grades lower than the employees current position additional preference rights physical requirements are waived for preferenceeligible veterans able to perform prospective job safely and efficiently in addition services performed while on active duty can be counted as experience in preservice job or as active duty experience whichever is most beneficial for those veterans in meeting requirements for specific federal civilian jobs finally certain postings are available only to qualified preferenceeligible veterans so long as applicants are available these positions include custodian guard elevator operator and messenger authority for direct hiring of veterans in 1970 congress added authority for agencies to hire veterans of the vietnam era directly rather than fill such jobs through the competitive process4 direct hiring authority for nondisabled vietnam era veterans expired december 31 1995 subsequent amendments provided additional direct hiring authority for nondisabled preferenceeligible veterans whose entire service occurred after the vietnam era all executive branch agencies and instrumentalities including the us postal service are required to have plans for increasing the number of veterans hired through this direct hiring authority which is applicable to federal jobs at gs11 or below 4 veteran of the vietnam era served at least one day between august 5 1964 and may 7 1975 or had some service in vietnam between february 28 1961 and may 7 1975 crs5 special disabled veterans in 1978 congress established direct hiring authority for special disabled veterans special disabled veterans are those with serviceconnected disabilities rated by va at 30 or higher at the discretion of the agency and within its budget and any employment ceilings special disabled veteran can be hired without being subject to the competitive process provided the veteran meets the requirements of the position these excepted jobs are through grade gs11 on the general schedule or its equivalent after 2 years of successful performance in the excepted position the appointment is converted to permanent giving that veteran full competitive standing in the competition for promotions other positions or assignments and other personnel actions decided on competitive basis preferences for veterans seeking nonfederal jobs in addition the 1970 legislation provided that special disabled veterans and veterans of the vietnam era are to be granted preferential treatment by contractors doing business with the federal government contractors whose contracts with the federal government exceed 10000 were required to take affirmative action to employ and advance in employment these vietnam era and disabled veterans the historical perspective the view of the bradley commission in 1956 the presidents commission on veterans pensions the bradley commission5 assessed the status of veterans preferences concluding that they have sound justification and major changes in the program seem desirable this conclusion was based on several observations on hiring the initial preference in competing for federal jobs is justifiable readjustment benefit if limited to reasonable period after discharge from the service as lifetime preference it is self defeating in terms of the readjustment of veterans just leaving service young veteran must compete mainly against the other older veterans who have the same five point preference plus greater experience or seasoning on the job preference for more limited period such as 5 years after discharge would thus do more for the veteran who is most in need of special help on retention rights gained through preferences preference in retention during reductions in force for nondisabled veterans has real relation to readjustment needs and does violence to the basic principles of the federal merit system the goals of open competition and equal treatment for all on the basis of their ability to serve the public as employees cannot be achieved if there is arbitrary discrimination in favor of one group based on factors having nothing to do with their efficiency or with their readjustment needs as veterans 5 president eisenhower established the commission to review veterans benefits and appointed its chairman general omar bradley former commissioner of the veterans administration and favorite of world war ii veterans because of his distinguished command of us army forces in europe crs6 on appeals when veterans preference does not achieve outcomes satisfactory to veteran the special appeals procedure for veterans tends to make traditional and necessary function of management into an elaborate costly and timeconsuming quasijudicial procedure the readjustment needs of the veteran do not require this privilege for more than reasonable period after discharge from the service in spite of the critique offered by the bradley commission of the broad array of veterans preferences action was taken and veterans reentering civilian life after military service have continued to benefit from readjustment opportunities in the federal government there has been criticism of providing preferences to those veterans who sustained injuries or lingering illnesses traceable to their service effect of veterans preferences on federal employment the proportion of federal executive branch jobs held by veterans6 trends in federal hiring policy in recent years the downsizing of the federal workforce has led to fewer employees newly hired from outside the government as employees shift and transfer within agencies to fill jobs vacated through normal attrition from 1984 through 1992 the number of firsttime entrants into federal professional and administrative jobs declined by 40 as the government has gotten smaller it has also decentralized agency administrative authority such as hiring so that more direct link between agency needs and potential applicants could be developed7 as federal hiring needs have changed avenues into federal employment have become more diverse fewer jobs are filled by candidates from certificates list of applicants determined most qualified either developed by the office of personnel management opm from pool of all qualified applicants or at the agency level in its 1994 study the merit systems protection board mspb found that in 1984 onethird of new entrants to federal professional and administrative jobs in the federal executive branch were hired from certificates developed from the central opm register of qualified applicants by 1992 that percentage had fallen to 19 positions filled from certificates developed at the agency level declined from 20 in 1984 to 17 in 1992 6 data is for veterans in the federal executive branch workforce 96 of whom qualify for veterans preferences status of veterans in the federal workforce office of personnel management may 1996 7 entering professional positions in the federal government report to the president and the congress of the united states by the us merit systems protection board march 1994 crs7 thus there are fewer jobs for which preference points are the determining factor in candidate placement on competitive lists and fewer occasions in which veterans would seek entry into federal service from broadspectrum register of applicants8 in effect hiring certificates have been increasingly replaced by other methods positions filled from within agencies rose from 12 in 1984 to 22 by 1992 entrants hired through direct hiring authority including authority that pertains to certain categories of veterans had increased from 22 to 29 over the same period aging of the veteran population veterans advocates point out that as proportion of the federal executive workforce the percentage of veterans has declined from 37 in 1984 to 28 in 19959 however because of the aging of the veteran population relative to the rest of the population of united states decline in the proportion of veterans in both the federal and total civilian workforce can be expected between 1984 and 1996 the median age of all males in the us rose by 1 year while the median age for male veterans had risen by 5 years this difference illustrates the greater relative age of the veteran population and thus the departure of large numbers of veterans from the civilian workforce this is demonstrated by data on labor force participation of veterans at various ages in the age groups of 2039 and 4054 labor force participation for male veterans was 90 and 94 respectively in fy199610 large numbers of veterans however trace their service to world war ii and that cohort of veterans had reached retirement age and largely left the workforce this demographic shift has been reflected in an overall decrease in the percentage of veterans in the workforce in 1992 82 of nonveteran males over age 20 were in the civilian workforce compared to 65 for veterans although in fy1996 nonveteran male workforce participation was largely unchanged 83 the percentage of male veterans in the civilian workforce had declined to slightly under 60 thus as the median age of veterans rises the proportion of veterans in the workforce declines unless an increasing percentage of veterans in the workforce become employed by the federal government decreasing proportion of veterans among federal employees should be expected maintaining the current proportion of veterans among federal workers would prove difficult and perhaps impossible in the future given the current rate of entry into the armed forces by 2010 half of all current veterans will be over age 62 the current average retirement age for the civilian work force11 veterans in federal jobs veterans make up much larger proportion of the federal workforce than they do of the civilian workforce as whole and to some extent that relative share probably reflects the impact of veterans preference laws12 8 mspb entering professional positions in the federal government 9 opm status of veterans in the federal workforce 10 fy1985 fy1992 and fy1996 annual reports of the secretary of veterans affairs 11 fy1996 annual report of the secretary of veterans affairs 12 except where otherwise noted data for this section is from status of veterans in the continued crs8 veterans constituted 276 of the federal workforce in fy1995 compared to 131 of the total civilian workforce the veterans proportion of the federal workforce has been relatively stable since 1992 289 in 1992 276 in 1995 during period when the total federal workforce declined by 10 vietnam era veterans constituted 173 of the federal workforce in fy1995 compared to 57 of the total civilian workforce the percentage of disabled veterans in the federal workforce compares favorably with the total workforce 44 to 09 the special disabled rated 30 or more are much better represented in the federal government than in the total workforce 15 to 02 veterans and federal hiring another measure of the effect of veterans preferences is the number of veterans hired of all employees hired for permanent fulltime federal positions in fy1995 31 were veterans increasing from 17 in 1990 of the 25000 males hired for full time permanent federal jobs in fy1995 477 were veterans13 direct hiring of veterans under special hiring authority increased from 13 to 20 of the total number of veterans hired during the period fy1990fy1995 this increase in the percentage of recent positions claimed by veterans accounts for the relatively stable percentage of veterans in the federal workforce since 1992 and offsets the large number of veterans retiring each year between 1992 and 1995 veterans accounted for over 50 of all retirements from federal jobs bias against veterans at times veterans have asserted that some federal officials are biased against veterans according to testimony by opm officials before the house civil service subcommittee 28 of the federal workforce are veterans and 38 of federal managers are veterans which would suggest that bias against veterans is likely to be more episodic rather than systemic14 notably the annual percentage of all promotions earned by veterans has remained stable at 2123 since 1990 that percentage is below the percentage of veterans in the federal workforce however veterans average grade levels are already higher gs 99 compared to 93 their service is longer 185 years compared to 155 and they are older 49 compared to 44 all factors that reduce opportunities for promotion there are more opportunities for promotions among younger employees who tend to be at lower grades and have shorter service 12 continued federal workforce office of personnel management may 1996 13 testimony of james king then director of the office of personnel management before the subcommittee on civil service of the house committee on government reform and oversight february 26 1997 14 testimony of james king february 26 1997 crs9 some veterans have contended that the percentage of hiring certificates returned without securing an appointment is unacceptably high when veteran is at the top of the register for consideration citing 1992 gao report15 that found that 71 of certificates with veterans at the top were returned unused compared to 51 for certificates headed by nonveterans some veterans advocates have suggested that the gao study confirms the existence of bias against veterans during the appointment process the gao report does not draw that conclusion and suggests several reasons for this disproportionate number of certificates that were returned unused16 subsequent detailed study of federal hiring procedures by the merit systems protection board mspb found similar disparate treatment the mspb study also examined the relationship between veterans preferences and officials hiring decisions and concluded that current practices do not indicate that veterans are discriminated against in federal hiring nor do they cause veterans to be hired when they are not qualified or not suited for the posting the mspb study also concluded that in spite of commonlyvoiced suspicion reported to researchers it did not appear as if more suitable applicants were being passed over simply because veteran had preference advantages after reviewing the methods used for selecting among available candidates and finding that veterans are not encountering systemic difficulties in the hiring process the mspb study concludes that the selection process could be made fairer to veterans and nonveterans alike the study recommends giving greater responsibility to managers to evaluate applicants because the current approach to veterans preference too often produces results that are not in the best interests of managers or job candidates including candidates with veterans preference the complexity of the standard hiring rules has encouraged hiring officials to use alternative procedures available to them matter how cumbersome the steps that must be taken to exercise the hiring discretion that such alternatives provide17 in statements before the house subcommittee on civil service18 some veterans indicated belief that agency officials sometimes design rifs to target specific veterans with the intent of removing them rif conducted at the us geological survey usgs during 1995 has been cited as an example of designer rif gao reviewed the usgs procedures and their effect on preferenceeligible veterans and 15 federal hiring does veterans preference need updating us general accounting office report to congressional requesters march 1992 16 the gao report suggests that many certificates were returned because candidates requested by managers did not appear among the top ranked but when they did the certificates were used 84 of the time and 9 of those hired were veterans in other instances gao found that veterans declined employment or failed to respond to the agency in general gao concluded that managers who are responsible for considering numerous factors relevant to filling federal positions could use several different methods to hire specific persons or persons with specific qualifications and that is the principle factor guiding the use of certificate or return of certificate unused 17 the rule of three in federal hiring boon or bane report to the president and the congress of the united states by the us merit systems protection board december 1995 18 testimony before the subcommittee on civil service april 30 1996 crs10 drew the conclusion that employees with veterans preference consistently fared better in the rif than did employees without such preferences19 one measure of dissatisfaction with practices surrounding the application of veterans preferences could be the number of complaints filed under existing rules during fy1996 48 complaints were filed with the department of labors dol veterans employment and training service vets which has the responsibility to investigate the relatively light caseload does not indicate that veterans widely believe that their preference rights have been so clearly violated that formal complaint is promising remedy20 amending veterans preferences hr 240 s 1021 and pl 105339 addressing perceived problems with veterans preference law proposals to amend veterans preference law arose because of perceptions by some veterans that at best federal officials were ignoring preference rights and at worst were acting to disadvantage veterans precisely because of their veterans status as the issue unfolded these concerns prompted congress to examine the claims of veterans advocates that veterans preferences were not working as congress intended these advocates asserted that veterans did not have sufficient opportunities to apply for all open jobs veterans with preferences were often improperly passed over for appointment veterans were often treated improperly during reductionsinforce in cases where veterans rights were ignored appeals were difficult certain agencies were unnecessarily excluded from preference requirements hr 240 and s 1021 originally companion bill but later amended were developed to address these perceived problems the house bill addressed these concerns in several ways the senate bill as amended retained some of these features and added one the house bill did not contain 19 letter to the chairman of the subcommittee on civil service from the gao associate director of federal management and workforce issues august 1 1996 20 veterans complaint case summary materials to accompany briefing of staff of the senate committee on veterans affairs by espiridion borrego assistant secretary for the veterans employment and training service department of labor crs11 as passed by the house the original legislation hr 240 proposed to increase opportunities for veterans to be considered for federal jobs hr 240 proposed to add to opportunities for veterans to secure federal jobs hr 240 would have increased veterans job opportunities by requiring agencies to accept applications from veterans for all open jobs and by expanding the number of agencies required to grant preferences to veterans as enacted pl 105339 provides some expanded opportunity for veterans to apply for jobs but the new right is restricted to those jobs open to outside applicants expands opportunities to apply for positions under hr 240 the definition of preferenceeligible veteran was to be amended to add for veterans with at least 3 years of active military service the right to apply for positions currently open only to persons already employed within the federal agency posting the position or with status attained as former employee within that agency these veterans might not have campaign medals or wartime service requirement for preferences for most nondisabled veterans under current law before reporting s 1021 the senate committee on veterans affairs eliminated the provisions expanding the class of veterans eligible for veterans preferences for federal employment and the language requiring agencies to accept applications for all open postings in floor action before passage an amendment added modified version of the provision expanding opportunities for veterans completing 3 years active duty but included postings only open to external applications thereby permitting agencies to deny veterans the opportunity to apply for postings restricted to personnel internal to the agency increases access to information about openings under hr 240 agencies would have been required to provide additional information about jobs open to veterans by reporting all vacancies to opm opm would have been required to maintain list of such postings that would become open to applications from veterans positions in the us postal service governed by collective bargaining agreements were exempted from the above provisions of the bill this provision was not included in s 1021 as reported and is not in pl 105339 possible effects of adding application opportunities under the housepassed bill agencies would have been required to list jobs available to veterans and would have been expected to consider the applications of veterans within the pool of all applicants even in common situations where budget constraints encouraged agencies to hire from within their own ranks maintaining these separate lists of postings for which only veterans could apply but not other applicants from outside the agency would have placed some additional administrative burden on agencies the number of veterans actually hired because of advantages given to them by the bill would probably not have been large the federal appointment process involves other considerations besides preference rights of veterans including budget priorities current workforce career opportunities and job specific requirements hr 240 did not propose changes to the essential element within federal hiring policy that leaves appointment decisions to managers who must exercise judgment crs12 in final selections sometimes choosing from among several candidates each of whom has different attributes to be considered to the extent that the legislations provisions encouraged additional applications to be submitted by veterans for positions to which they would have little chance of being appointed the net result of expanding opportunities could be one of marginally increased veteran dissatisfaction with federal hiring policy rather than significantly more veterans within federal employment hr 240 would have added retention protection pl 105339 does not contain these provisions under hr 240 veterans would be given additional protections during rifs the provisions were eliminated by the senate committee and the enacted legislation does not contain these provisions the housepassed bill would have prohibited singleposition competitive levels current law permits an agency to define competitive level as applicable to one position for rif purposes hr 240 would have prohibited agencies from applying this classification to positions occupied by veterans expanded bump and retreat rights preferenceeligibles would have been permitted to displace persons in wider range of positions than is permitted under current law under hr 240 preferenceeligible veteran would have been given the right to any position at the same grade level in the agency in the same commuting area that was currently held by someone who had been in the position less than 6 months or 12 months if the person in the position came from the same competitive level and if reasonable person could conclude that the preference eligible would be able to perform the positions functions successfully within period of 150 days established agency priority placement programs ppps each agency would have been required to establish ppp which would develop rosters of employees with highpriority reemployment rights because of being displaced from an agency job these employees would have been eligible for assignment to open agency jobs within the commuting area in which the rif occurs and before the agency could fill them from outside the agency in addition employees could select other geographic areas in which their reemployment rights under the ppp could apply preference eligible veterans would have been given higher priority for vacancies in the agency than nonveterans possible effects of the proposed rif protections veterans preferences provide some degree of protection but not an absolute shield during rifs the retention order listing the sequence by which workers will be released during rif is mostly an impersonal calculation and each move made in response to it causes recalculation of the positions on the list studies show that preferenceeligible veterans are more often retained than nonveterans with similar retention ratings and this could reflect the advantages conferred by veterans preferences yet this objective rating system does not incorporate all relevant components that determine which employees will ultimately be removed other more subjective factors can legally also be taken into consideration when retention orders are developed hr crs13 240 would not have eliminated these subjective factors even with passage of the proposed provisions rifs would probably still have exposed some veterans to loss of their federal jobs and in spite of efforts to find other suitable federal employment for these veterans some would still have been released both bills expanded appeal rights both bills hr 240 and s 1021 as reported contained the provisions for expanded appeal rights under the house bill the provisions would be extended to the group of preferenceeligible veterans which the bill expands as explained above under the senate bill the rights would be extended only to those veterans currently eligible for preferences the bill as enacted contains the senate provisions pl 105339 expands appeal rights in the following ways expands the role of department of labor in examining veterans appeals under prior law opm advised agencies as to the proper preference rules when veterans filed complaints but compliance was left to agencies the new law requires the veterans employment and training service vets at dol to investigate veterans complaints and enforce compliance where warranted the vets is expected to resolve the complaint if possible but within 60 days the veteran could notify vets of an intention to appeal the agency action in question to the merit systems protection board mspb adds additional appeal opportunities under prior law only employees separated during rif could appeal decision concerning the proper application of veterans preferences to the mspb new law permits veterans to appeal personnel decisions in which they believe their status as veteran or their right to veterans preferences has been improperly considered to mspb and after 120 days but before mspb issues judicially reviewable decision the veteran may terminate the process and appeal the action in an appropriate federal court veterans whose complaints about veterans preference rights are validated could be compensated for loss of wages or benefits and could be reimbursed for attorneys fees possible effects of expanding appeal rights error is possible whenever human judgement is required and some occasions will predictably arise in which veterans rights are not properly considered new redress procedures provided by the new law give veterans additional ways to challenge and appeal actions taken that they believe are improperly adverse to their interests as veterans with earned rights to preferential treatment the changes may be of value to veterans but will not necessarily resolve every dispute to the satisfaction of veterans note that veterans are not appealing decisions in large numbers at the current time the legislated added provisions to improve compliance in addition to being treated as right earned through military service preference rights were made comparable to protected class status rights that must be recognized throughout the personnel system new law establishes denial of veterans preference rights as prohibited personnel practice federal officials are prohibited from denying the preference rights of eligible veterans in the same way in which such officials are prohibited from denying fair treatment to individuals because of race color religion or national origin crs14 establishes penalties for officials who deny veteran rights officials who are found to have intentionally violated veterans preference requirements may be subject to penalties possible effects of provisions to improve compliance officials responsible for properly complying with veterans preference requirements will be made more clearly aware that fostering noncompliance can lead to adverse consequences even before enactment of pl 105339 various penalties could be applied to federal officials who ignored requirements to perform their hiring responsibilities according to federal policy and regulations how much additional notice and penalties will alter officials behavior is difficult to gauge the legislation expands coverage to other agencies the new law expands the application of veterans preferences to include certain jobs in the white house the legislative branch and the judicial branch in addition the legislation extends the rif protections provided by existing veterans preferences to the federal aviation administration which under prior law was required to grant preference rights only with respect to hiring decisions the legislation requires these parts of the government to broadly comply with veterans preference requirements but provides exclusions for political appointments and special appointment requirements pl 105339 leaves interpretation application and compliance up to internal mechanisms for the legislative and judicial branches possible effects of expanding veterans preferences to other agencies positions exempted from veterans preference requirements often have special characteristics that place additional responsibilities on hiring officials to select from among applicants according to those specific characteristics some veterans may be added as result of the legislation but in general these special characteristics will continue to govern when it would be appropriate to apply veterans preferences to open positions there is evidence that veterans were systematically excluded from these positions under existing law or that their numbers were disproportionately lower than in other federal agencies pl 105339 expanded coverage to federal contractors under prior law special disabled veterans as defined in the section application of veterans
