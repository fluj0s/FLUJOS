assistance for workers taa and alternative trade adjustment assistance for older workers ataa by john topoleski and crs report rs22022 disaster unemployment assistance dua by julie whittaker crs2 unemployment compensation the cornerstone of an unemployed workers income security is the joint federal state unemployment compensation uc2 program which may provide income support through the payment of uc benefits the underlying framework of the uc system is contained in the social security act the act title iii of the act authorizes grants to states for the administration of state uc laws title ix authorizes the various components of the federal unemployment trust fund utf and title xii authorizes advances or loans to insolvent state uc programs uc is financed by federal taxes under the federal unemployment tax act futa and by state payroll taxes under the state unemployment tax acts suta the federal government appropriates funds for federal and state uc program administration the federal share of extended benefit eb payments and federal loans to insolvent state uc programs in fy2008 the appropriation is 37 billion the federal government has distributed base funding amounts distributed to states for the administration of their uc programs for fy2008 states should receive an estimated 229 billion3 in fy2007 states spent an estimated 314 billion on uc benefits the uc system pays benefits to covered workers who become involuntarily unemployed for economic reasons and meet stateestablished eligibility rules the uc system generally does not provide uc benefits to the selfemployed to those who are unable to work or to those who do not have recent earnings history states usually disqualify claimants who lost their jobs because of inability to work unavailability for work or labor dispute or who voluntarily quit without good cause who were discharged for jobrelated misconduct or who refused suitable work without good cause to receive uc benefits claimants must have enough recent earnings to meet their states earnings requirements weekly maximums in january 2008 ranged from 210 mississippi to 600 massachusetts and in states that provide dependents allowances up to 900 massachusetts in march 2008 the average weekly benefit was 291 benefits are available for up to 26 weeks more in massachusetts and montana the average regular uc benefit duration in march 2008 was 15 weeks4 in april 2008 approximately 30 million unemployed workers received uc benefits in given week 2 for more information on uc see crs report rs22538 unemployment compensation the cornerstone of income support for unemployed workers by julie m whittaker and crs report rl33362 unemployment insurance available unemployment benefits and legislative activity by julie m whittaker 3 in addition to the base state amounts states may receive extra funds each quarter for actual uc claims workload above the states base 4 federalstate extended benefits eb program offers benefits for an additional 13 to 20 weeks in states with unemployment rates above certain levels the eb program is discussed later in this report crs3 extended benefits the eb program established by pl 91373 26 usc 3304 may extend uc benefits at the state level if certain economic situations within the state exist although the eb program is not currently active in any state it like the uc program is permanently authorized the eb program is triggered when states insured unemployment rate iur5 or total unemployment rate tur6 reaches certain levels all states must pay up to 13 weeks of eb if the iur for the previous 13 weeks is at least 5 and is 120 of the average of the rates for the same 13week period in each of the 2 previous years there are two other optional thresholds that states may choose if the state has chosen the option they would provide the following option 1 an additional 13 weeks of benefits if the states iur is at least 6 regardless of previous years averages option 2 an additional 13 weeks of benefits if the states tur is at least 65 and is at least 110 of the states average tur for the same 13weeks in either of the previous two years an additional 20 weeks of benefits if the tur is at least 8 20 weeks of fulltime insured employment or equivalent in addition to all state requirements for regular uc eligibility the eb program requires claimants to have at least 20 weeks of fulltime insured employment or the equivalent in insured wages in their base period currently the eb program is active in alaska and rhode island emergency unemployment compensation euc08 on june 30 2008 the emergency unemployment compensation euc08 program was created by pl 1102527 this new temporary unemployment insurance program provides up to 13 additional weeks of unemployment benefits to certain workers who have exhausted their rights to regular unemployment compensation uc benefits8 the program began july 6 2008 and will terminate on march 28 2009 euc08 benefit will be paid beyond the week ending july 4 2009 20 weeks of fulltime insured employment or equivalent in addition to all state requirements for regular uc eligibility the euc08 program requires claimants to have at least 20 weeks of fulltime insured employment or the equivalent in insured wages in their base period 5 the iur is the ratio of uc eligible unemployed workers to all uc eligible workers employed and unemployed in the labor force 6 the tur is the ratio of unemployed workers to all workers employed and unemployed without regard to uc eligibility in the labor force 7 for detailed explanation of the euc08 program see crs report rs22915 emergency unemployment compensation euc08 by julie m whittaker 8 for detailed explanation of the euc08 program see crs report rs22915 emergency unemployment compensation euc08 by julie m whittaker crs4 euc08 and eb interactions the euc08 program should not be confused with the similarly named eb program the euc08 program is temporary and applies to all states the eb program is permanently authorized and applies only to certain states on the basis of state economic conditions specified in law the euc08 program allows states to determine which benefit is paid first thus states may choose to pay euc08 before eb or vice versa states balance the decision of which benefit to pay first by examining the potential cost savings to the state with the potential loss of unemployment benefits for unemployed individuals in the state it may be less costly for the state to choose to pay for the euc08 benefit first as the euc08 benefit is 100 federally financed whereas the eb benefit is 50 state financed9 however if the state opts to pay euc08 first individuals in the state might receive less in total unemployment benefits if the eb program triggers off before the individuals exhaust their euc08 benefits alaska has opted to pay eb before euc08 benefits in contrast rhode island has opted to pay euc08 benefits before eb trade readjustment allowance tra unemployment benefit extensions for workers unemployed on account of international trade the trade adjustment act taa10 program established by the trade expansion act of 1962 pl 87794 and now authorized by the trade act of 1974 pl 93618 as amended extends unemployment benefits for workers dislocated by import competition taa eligible workers may also receive job training to gain taa eligibility group of workers or state or firm on behalf of group of workers petitions the department of labor dol and dol investigates whether import competition contributed importantly to their job loss or whether their firm has shifted production of like articles to certain countries the reauthorization of taa by the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 extends eligibility to secondary workers whose job loss results from the loss of business with primary firm the firm that directly lost business or outsourced work as result of trade pl 11089 extends authorization for the taa program through december 31 2007 taa funds are appropriated as an entitlement out of the federal governments general fund not out of the unemployment trust fund to workers who meet the eligibility requirements although training funds are subject to annual funding caps at the federal level taa is administered by and is part of the federal budget for the us department of labor dol claims for taa benefits by individual workers are administered by the state uc agencies under agreements and contracts with dol 9 some recipients may find jobs before becoming eligible for eb in addition the state may trigger off of the eb program before some recipients exhaust euc 10 for more information on taa see crs report rs22718 trade adjustment assistance for workers taa and alternative trade adjustment assistance for older workers ataa by john j topoleski crs5 the income support portion of the taa is trade readjustment allowance tra benefit the tra benefit is identical to the uc benefit the worker would have received under the regular uc program of the workers state the tra benefit is available for 52 weeks less any weeks in which regular uc or eb benefits are received plus an additional 52 weeks for claimants still in approved job training after the basic tra runs out an additional 26week extension is available to those in need of remedial education therefore the total period of unemployment benefit receipt for taa certified unemployed worker including regular and extended uc benefits as well as the tra benefits may last as long as 130 weeks in fy2006 there were 129552 workers covered by taa certifications and approximately 60000 new tra recipients approximately 549 million was spent on tra benefits in fy2006 other benefits an allowance of up to 1250 may be paid to eligible workers who must search for work outside their commuting area another 1250 allowance may be paid for the cost of relocation to another job market job training taa eligible workers may be provided job training through the taa this assistance is discussed in the job training assistance section below older workers and taa an alternative taa ataa for older workers was established by the trade act of 2002 pl 107210 it replaces up to 50 of the difference up to 10000 between the wages in new job and the old job for up to two years for an older worker who has been displaced by import competition the ataa program went into effect on august 6 2003 and is intended to shorten transitions into new occupations or industries without requiring older workers to participate in training programs eligibility is limited to those over age 50 whose incomes are less than 50000 yearly who work full time and who find new jobs within 26 weeks after job separation disaster unemployment assistance dua the disaster unemployment assistance dua program provides monetary assistance to individuals unemployed as direct result of major disaster who are not eligible for regular unemployment compensation uc benefits dua is funded through the federal emergency management agency fema dua is administered by the department of labor dol through each states uc agency first created in1970 through pl 91606 dua benefits are authorized by the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency relief act the stafford act which authorizes the president to issue major disaster declaration after state and local government resources have been overwhelmed by natural catastrophe or regardless of cause any fire flood or explosion in any part of the united states 42 usc 51222 on the basis of the request of the affected states governor the president may declare that major disaster exists the declaration identifies the areas in the state eligible for assistance the declaration of major disaster provides the full range of disaster assistance available under the stafford act including but not limited to the repair replacement or reconstruction of public and nonprofit crs6 facilities cash grants for the personal needs of victims housing and unemployment assistance related to job loss from the disaster in fy2006 373 million was spent on dua benefits this was an atypical outlay and reflects the severity of the hurricane katrina disaster generally the federal budget contains an estimated 40 million in given year for dua benefits health care assistance for unemployed workers two federal laws may aid unemployed workers in the purchase of health insurance the first the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 cobra allows unemployed workers in certain circumstances to purchase continued health insurance coverage the second the health care tax credit hctc allows certain taa and ataa participants to receive an advanceable and refundable tax credit for purchasing health insurance consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 cobra pl 99272 title x of cobra11 requires employers who offer health insurance to continue coverage for their employees under certain circumstances congress approved the legislation to expand access to coverage at group rates to qualified employees and their families who are faced with loss of coverage due to certain events including termination or reduction in hours of employment for reasons other than gross misconduct although the law allows employers to charge 102 of the group plan premium this can be much less expensive than comparable coverage available in the individual insurance market coverage generally lasts 18 months but depending on the circumstances can last for longer periods cobra requirements also apply to selfinsured firms an employer must comply with cobra even if it does not contribute to the health plan it need only maintain such plan to come under the statutes continuation requirements unpublished department of health and human services data from 2004 estimate that approximately 28 million nonelderly adults were enrolled in cobra coverage obtained through their own former employer12 11 for more information on cobra see crs report rl30626 health insurance continuation coverage under cobra by heidi yacker 12 this estimate includes unemployed workers from private industry and state and local governments it does not include former federal workers crs7 health care tax credit workers eligible for trade adjustment assistance or receiving pension paid by the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc may be eligible to receive an advanceable refundable tax credit the health coverage tax credit hctc13 to purchase certain types of insurance the health care tax credit hctc is refundable and advanceable tax credit for 65 of health insurance premiums the hctc is available to taa and ataa eligibles as well as individuals aged 55 and older receiving pbgc pension payment recipients cannot be enrolled in certain other health insurance including medicaid or employmentbased insurance for which the employer pays at least half the cost nor can they be entitled to medicare the hctc equals 65 of the premiums the taxpayer pays for qualifying insurance up to 10 types of coverage are specified in the statute although most require state action to become effective the credit is payable in advance to insurers allowing workers to benefit before they file their tax returns it is also refundable workers can receive the full credit even if they have regular tax liability the congressional budget office cbo estimates 20 million in hctc expenditures for tax year 2006 job search assistance for unemployed workers federal support for americans seeking assistance to obtain retain or change employment is undertaken by national system of local onestop career centers onestops onestops were established by law under the workforce investment act of 1998 wia pl 105220 but had been encouraged by the department of labor dol since it began awarding states onestop development grants in 1993 although onestops bring together employment and training services of approximately 20 required partners the central component of all onestops is labor exchange system that is universally accessible to job seekers and employers this labor exchange system is undertaken by the us employment service first established by the wagnerpeyser act of 1933 wagnerpeyser act of 1933 the wagnerpeyser act established the employment service14 as system jointly operated by dol and the state employment security agencies the central mission of the is to facilitate the match between individuals seeking employment and employers seeking workers services are open to all

came from the unemployment trust fund and approximately 96 was allotted to state employment security agencies for onestop services job training assistance for unemployed workers the nations central job training legislation is the workforce investment act wia of 1998 in addition the act established linkages between wia training activities and three other populations targeted by federal programs workers eligible for taa military veterans and workers over the age of 55 covered under the older americans act of 1965 although not discussed below it should be noted that other federal education and training programs provide support that could assist the unemployed in reaching career goals even though these programs do not explicitly target an unemployed population eg student financial assistance authorized under title iv of the higher education act of 1965 and the lifetime learning credit workforce investment act of 1998 the workforce investment act includes titles that authorize programs for job training adult education and literacy the adult education and family literacy act vocational rehabilitation the rehabilitation act of 1973 and the employment service the wagnerpeyser act of 1933
