of these private plans in order to obtain their drug benefits the program relies on these private plans to provide coverage and to bear some of the financial risk for drug costs federal s ubsidies covering the bulk of the risk is provided to encourage participation unlike other medicare services the be nefits can only be obtained through private plans further while all plans have to meet certain minimum requirements there are significant differe nces among them in terms of benefit design drugs included on plan formularies ie list of c overed drugs and cost sharing applicable for particular drugs major focus of the drug benefit is the enhanced coverage provided to lowincome individuals who enroll in part d lowincome enrollees including persons known as dual elig ibles those

program obtain drug coverage through pdp beneficiaries enrolled in managed car plan through medicare advantage ma organization generally have to obtain drug coverage through their ma organization if the ma enrollee wants to roll in pdp he or she must drop their ma enrollment there is one major exception to this rule while most ma organizations are required to offer map d plan private feeforservice ma plans are not required to do so1 an individual enrolled in plan not offering drug coverage may purchase c overage through pdp plan information different pdp and mapd plans are availa ble in different parts of the country some organizations offer national plans information on plan availability and characteristics can be obtained from number of sources these include the medicare tollfree information number 1800medicare and the website httpwwwmedicaregov other organiza tions may also be able to provide assistance these include state health insurance assistance programs ships and other local organizations beneficiaries must enroll with the organization offering their selected plan they can enroll by mail in person or on the web beneficiaries and persons assisting them can look for plan meeting their needs by going to the medicare drug pl an finder on httpwwwmedicaregov an individual using the web tool should have list of all the medications the beneficiary currently takes together with dosage units the plan finder will then show the beneficiary the five plans in the area with the lowest total annual cost for the package of drugs the individual take s it is important to note that plan with the lowest premium andor deductible may not in fact be the lowest cost plan overall further the lowest cost plan for one member of couple may not be the lowest cost plan for that persons spouse beneficiaries should review their plan choice annually plans can make changes effective january 1 each year by october 31 of the previous year plans are required to provide plan enrollees with summary of the benefits for the following year and an outline of changes made from the current year plans can make number of changes from one year to the next including changing drugs included in the plans formulary andor changing the required costsharing charges for certain drugs therefore enrollees should re view materials provided by th plans to make sure that their chosen plans continue to meet their needshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34280crs3 enrollment periods initial enrollment period in general medicare beneficiaries need to enroll in plan during their initial enrollment period in order to avoid the delayed enrollment penalty persons on the medicare rolls when the drug program began had until may 15 2006 to enroll in part d plan for 2006 persons eligible for medicare at later date have an initial sevenmonth enrollment period beginning three months before the month of medicare eligibility this initial enrollment period is the same as that applicable for medicare part b coverage for these individuals begins on the first day of the first month following the month of enrollment but earlier than the first month they are entitled to medicare annual open enrollment period in general an individual who does not enroll during their initial enrollment period is only able to enroll during the annual open enrollment period which occurs fro m november 15december 31 each year coverage begins the following january 1 creditable coverage persons who fail to enroll during their initial enrollment period are subject to penalty if they decide to enroll in part d at later date however they are not subject to the penalty if they have maintained creditable drug coverage through anothe r public or private source creditable coverage is defined as drug benefits whos actuarial value equals or exceeds that of standard coverage sources of possible creditable coverage are retiree health coverage offered by former employer or union and military coverage including tricare beneficiary who has creditable coverage may wish to enroll in part d plan after the conclusion of their initial enrollment period care must be taken to assure that any noncoverage period between th two events does not exceed 63 days otherwise the beneficiary could be subject to late enrollment penalty for example retiree who is enrolled in plan offered by his former employer decides in july 2008 that he wants to drop the employer coverage and enroll in part d the individual is not able to enroll in part d plan until the annual election period november 15 to december 31 coverage will not begin until the following january 1 he will probably want to keep his em ployer coverage through the end of 2008 special enrollment periods in general individuals can only enroll in part d during their initial enrollment period or during the annual open enrollment period however there are few limited occasions when an i ndividual may have special enrollment period including moving to new geographic area involuntary loss of creditable coverage inadequate informati on provided on creditable coverage status federal error termination of pdp contract and plan failures special enrollment periods also apply for lowincome enrollees deemed eligible for subsidy outside of the initial or annual enro llment periods see lowincome discussion below late enrollment penalty the part d delayed enrollment penalty provision is intended to prevent advers selection adverse selec tion occurs when only those persons who think they need the benefit actually enroll in the program when this happens per capita costs are driven up th ereby causing more persons presumably the healthier and less costly ones to drop out of the program over time as morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34280crs4 persons drop out program costs become prohibitive the intention of the penalty is to encourage all persons who do not have cr editable coverage to enroll those who have creditable coverage are maintaining insurance protection and are not deferring coverage until they will actually need it the late enrollment penalty is assessed on persons who go for 63 days or longer after the close of their initial part d enrollment period without creditable coverage and subsequently enroll in part d the pe nalty is based on the number of months the individual does not have cred itable coverage the pre mium that would otherwise apply is increased for each mont h without creditable coverage the late enrollment penalty is frequently described as being equal to at least 1 of the otherwise applicable premium for each uncovered month the actual calculation is somewhat more complicated the law specifies that the penalty is the greater of 1 the amount cms determines is actuarially sound for each uncovered month or 2 1 of the base beneficiary premium for each uncovered month the base beneficiary premium is national figure it may therefore be different than the premium for the plan selected by the be neficiary for uncove red months occurring during 2006 and 2007 the 1 calculation applies the penalty applies for as long as the individual is enrolled in part d the dollar amount of the each individuals pena lty is expected to increase each year as noted above individuals first eligib for medicare on or before january 31 2006 who failed to enroll by may 15 2006 we re not able to enroll until november 15 2006 with coverage beginning january 1 2007 if these individuals did not have creditable coverage during the period th ey would have seven uncovered months their penalty would therefore be 7 of the base beneficiary premium 191 7 of the base monthly bene ficiary premium of 2735 for 2007 if these same persons waited an additional year their penalt would be 19 of the base monthly beneficiary premium 531 19 of the base beneficiary premium of 2793 for 2008 special rules apply for persons who qua lify for the lowincome subsidy outside of their initial enrollment period or th annual open enrollment period these individuals can enroll in part d plan at any time during the year and not be subject to the late enrollment penalty otherwise applicable to persons who miss the enrollment periods part d benefits qualified coverage pdp sponsors and mapd plans are required to offer minimum set of benefits referred to as qualified coverage qualified coverage is defined as either standard prescrip tion drug coverage or lternative prescription drug coverage with at least actuarially equivalent benefits ie having at least equivalent dollar value in both cases access must be provided to negotiated prices for drugshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34280crs5 defined standa rd coverage standard prescrip tion drug coverage is defined as follows deductible paid by the beneficiary 275 in 2008 75 of costs paid by the progra m and 25 of costs paid by the beneficiary up to the initial coverage limi t 2510 in 2008 in 2008 this represents 83375 in total outof pocket costs paid by beneficiary and 2510 in total spending 100 of costs paid by the beneficiary for drug spending falling in the coverage gap up to the catastrophic threshold between 251001 and 572625 in 2008 in 2008 this represents 4050 in total outof pocket costs paid by the beneficiary and 572625 in total spending all costs paid by program over the catastrophic threshold or trigger 572625 in 2008 except for nominal beneficiary cost sharing nominal costsharing is defined as the greater of 1 copayment of 225 in 2008 for gene ric drug or preferred multiple source drug and 560 in 2008 for other drugs or 2 5 coinsurance each year the dollar amounts are increased by the annual percentage increase in average per capita aggregate expenditures for covered outpatient drugs for medicare beneficiaries for the 12month period endi ng in july of the previous year table 1 shows the standard benefit as well as costs paid by lowincome beneficiaries discussed later in this report true outofpocket troop costs beneficiaries must incur certain level of outofpocket cost s 4050 in 2008 before catas trophic protection begins costs are only considered incurred if they are incurred for the deductible cost sharing or benefits not paid because they fall in the coverage gap sometimes referred to as the doughnut hole incurred costs do not include amounts for which benefits are provided because drug is excluded under particular plans formulary costs are treated as incurre d and thus treated as true outofpocket troop costs only if they are paid by the individual or by another family member on behalf of the individual paid on behalf of lowincome individual under the subsidy provisions or under state pharmaceu tical assistance program any

the size involved therefore the regulations define the family size to include in addition to the applicant and spouse additional persons related to the applicant who live in the same residence and depend on the applicant or spouse for at least onehalf of their financial support the income of these additional persons would not however be used in the determination of eligibility resources mma

amount see following discussion but in case higher than the actual premium amount for basic coverage under the plan selected by the enrollee in addition the premium subsidy amount can not be less than the premium for the lowestcost pdp plan in the region thus all full subsidy elig ible individuals are entitled to full premium subsidy for at leas t one plan in their region however if beneficiary selects plan with premium higher than the benchmark the beneficiary is liable for the additional costs full subsidy eligible individuals but not other subsidy eligible individuals also have premium subsidy for any part d late enrollment penalty equal to 80 for the first 60 months of delayed enrollment and 100 thereafter other subsidy eligible individuals all other subsidy eligible individuals have sliding scale premium subsidy ra nging from 100 of the premium subsidy amount at 135 of poverty to 0 of such va lue at 150 of poverty specifically the subsidy is 75 for persons with inco mes

lowincome benchmark premium the lowincome benchmark premium for region is the weig hted average of the monthly beneficiary premiums for basic prescription drug c overage the lowincome benchmark is defined as the weighted average premium with the weight based on plan enrollment for 2006 the programs first year all pdps were assigned an equal weight mas were enrollment weighted if they had 2005 enrollment beginning in 2007 the bid amounts were to be weighted by plan enrollment in the previous year however since many beneficiaries selected lowcost plans in 2006 using weighted average would have the effect of reducing the regional lowincome benchmark premiu m amounts instead cms decided to transition to the weighting methodology using the secretar ys demonstration au thority medicare demonstration to transition enrollment of lowincome subsidy beneficiaries for 2007 it used the same methodology used for 2006 beginning for 2008 it is implementing transition from the 2006 methodology and the weighted average method based on actual plan enrollments in 2008 50 of the regional benchmark is based on the 2006 averaging methodolog and 50 on the enrollmentweighted average for determining

increased by the annual percentage increase in per capita beneficiary expenditures for part d covered drugs enrollment generally there is twostep process for lowincome persons to gain part d coverage first determination must be made that they qualify for the assistance and second they must enroll or be rolled in specific part d plan special procedures were established to make the process easier the procedures are different for different categories of lowincome enrollees dual eligibles there were more than 6 million dual eligibles who needed to be enrolled in part d plan effective january 1 2006 cms established an auto enrollment process which was intended to assure there was gap in coverage though the program did encounter so problems in the early stages the autoenrollment process was random among plans with premiums at or below the lowincome benchmark premium persons becoming dually eligible after january 2006 are also autoenrolled into part d plan there are number of differences among available plans key differences are drugs included in plan formularies and pharmacies participating in the plan as network pharmacies some dual eligibles may find that they are autoenrolled in plan which may not best meet their needs for this r eason they are able to change enrollment at an time with the new coverage ffective the following month it should be noted that if an enrollee sel ects plan with premium above the low income benchmark he or she is required to pay the difference enrollees in medicare savings programs cms established process labeled facilitated enrollment for enrollees in medicare savings programs msps ssi enrollees and persons who applied for and were approved for lowincome subsidy assistance the basic features applicable to autoenrollment for dual eligibles ie random assign ment to plans with premiums below the lowincome benchmark and assignment of ma enrollees to the lowestcost mapd plan offered by the ma organization were extended to facilitate enrollment beneficiaries eligible fo r facilitated rollment in 2006 were sent notices informing them of the plans they would be enrolled in if they took action if the beneficiary failed to select another plan and did not decline part d enrollment he or she was considered to have enrolled in the assigned plan effective may 1 2006 facilitated enrollment also applies for persons becoming eligible for msp after that date as is the case for dual eligible an msp enrollee can change plan enrollment throughout the yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34280crs13 other lowincome persons mma extended lowincome subsidies to all persons with incomes below 150 of povert and assets below specified levels persons not identified as dual eligibles msp enrollees or ssi recipients may qualify but they need to submit an application the social security administration ssa generally makes eligibility determinations for those who fill out the applications though an individual may request the state medicaid agency to make the determination cms facilitates enrollment in part d plans for persons identified as qualifying for extra help however unless they are dual eligibles or msp enrollees they are only able to switch plans once during the ear with the new coverage effective the following month 2008 enrollment there are several circumstances under which lowincome subsidyeligible person experienced change from 2007 to 2008 these include cases in which an individual 1 was rolled in plan in 2007 whose 2008 premium would longer fall below the lowincome benchmark premium 2 was enrolled in plan that terminated its participation in part d 3 lost automatic eligibility for the lowincome subsidy in 2008 or 4 fell into different subsidy category individuals enrolled in pl ans in 2007 that longer have premiums below the benchmark or in plans that terminate c m s established process for reassigning these beneficiaries to different part d plan beneficiaries that were reassigned had to meet all of the following criteria they were deemed eligible for subsidy in 2007 because they were dual eligibles participants in msp ssi recipients or because they applied and were found eligible for the full subsidy they would continue to be eligible for subsidy in 2008 they were originally autoenrolled or had their enrollment facilitated into pdp they did not elect to roll in different plan their 2007 plan had 2008 premium that was above the minimus amount which is the benc hmark plus 1 or terminated at the end of 2007 beneficiaries meeting all of these criteria were reassigned to different pdp in the region as follows the beneficiaries we re assigned to another plan in the same region offered by the same pdp sponsor if the sponsor had plan with premium at or below the benchmark or if ther was none available plan below the minimus amount if such plan existe d cms randomly assign ed beneficiaries among pdp sponsors with at least one pl an with premium at or below the benchmark cms notified be neficiaries in early november 2007 of their plan assignment they were reassigned to new plan effective january 1 2008 however beneficiaries could voluntarily elect to stay in their existing plan if it was still offered or select different pl an from the one assigned by cmshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34280crs14 beneficiaries who changed plans after they were either autoassigned to plan or had their enrollment facilitated into plan did not have their selection changed by cms however they were informed that their plans premium was rising above the regional lowincome subsidy amount by more than the minimus 1 in 2008 and would therefore be liable for any excess if they stayed with their current plan the beneficiary was free to chan ge his or her selection on october 29 2007 cms announced that it was sending reassignment notices to 16 million persons who would be reassigned to new plan outside of their current organization and an additional 965000 persons who were to be reassigned to new plan within their current organization it also announced that it was sending chooser notices to the 442000 persons who qualifie d for full premium subsidy but the 2007 plan they had selected would have premium in 2008 above the minimus amount individuals losing automatic ligibility for lowincome subsidy persons automatically qualifying for lowincome subsidy are dual eligibles persons enrolled in msp and ssi recipients in september 2007 cms sent letters to those beneficiaries losing their automatic ligibility for lowincome subsidy in 2008 because they longer fell into one of th categories at the same time these beneficiaries were told they still might qualify for assistance and were encouraged to file lowincome subsidy application with ssa the application and postage paid envelope were enclosed with each notice individuals falling into different subsidy category beneficiaries who would experience change in their lowincome subsidy level in 2008 received notice in october 2007 informing them of the change these beneficiaries are subject to different co stsharing requirements interaction with state ph armacy assistance programs number of states have had state pharmaceutical assistance programs spaps in place for number of years these programs were set up to offer prescription drug benefits to lowincome individuals w ho did not have medicaid drug coverage many but not all persons enrolled in spaps are eligible for lowincome subsidies under part d spap payments made on thei r behalf to cover part d costsharing charges count toward the individuals tr ue outofpocket troop costs trigger mma defines an spap as one that provide s assistance to persons in all part d plans and does not discriminate based on the part d plan in which the individual is enrolled cms interpreted the part d language to mean that if an spap offers part d premium assistance or supplemental part d costsharing assistance it must offer equal assistance for all pd p and mapd plans availabl in the region and may not steer beneficiaries to one plan or another through be nefit design or otherwise violation of this nondiscrimin ation rule would violate the spaps status with respect to counting troop the inability to steer beneficiaries to selected plan or plans effectively meant that an spap could not autoenroll its participants in preferred part d plans this proved to be concern for some states who argued they should be able to enroll their beneficiaries in preferred plans if they gave individuals the option to switch to other plans if they wanted tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34280crs15 cms established policies intended to balance the need to adhere to the nondiscrimination require ment with state concerns it generally required spaps to provide wraparound benefits n amely fill in the gaps for their part d beneficiaries regardless of the plan the beneficiary chose to enroll in and permitted spaps when acting as authorized representatives to enro ll their beneficiaries in part d plans using only beneficiaryspecific crite ria to limit the selection of part d plans in its 2008 call letter to plans cms refined the po licy to explicitly permit states to adopt reasonable coordinating criteria spaps with authorized representative status are allowed to facilitate enrollment of their beneficiaries into plans that agree to the state specific coordination criteria such as offering similar formularies and pharmacy network structures such criteria must be of the kind that any part d plan could meet if it chose spaps must continue to permit beneficiaries who wish to enroll in plan not meeting the coordinating criteria to do so they must provide the same wraparound benefits or assistance part d plans pdp regions mma required the secretary to designate pdp regions

on plan characteristics that would provide beneficiaries w ith substantially different options cms has stated that it would not expect that more than two bids from sponsoring organization would provide meaningful variation unless one of the bids is an enhanced alternative plan with coverage in the gap contracts the law and regulations establish requi rements for pdp plan sponsors in general pdp sponsor must be license d under state law as risk bearing entity eligible to offer health insurance or health benefits coverage in each state in which it is offering drug plan alternatively it

appropr iate part d plans that use classification system that is consistent with the usp classification system are deemed to satisfy safe harbor and will be approved by cms cms will review systems of

unless only one drug is available in the cat egory or class or two drugs are available but one drug is clinically superior th two drug requirement must be met through the provision of two chemically distinct drugs plans cannot meet the requirement by including only two dosage forms or stre ngths of the same dr ug or brand name and its generic equivalent however cms does expect plans to include multiple strengths and dosage forms where available six classes of clinical concern cms has required pa rt d to cover all or substantially all of the drugs in the following six drug categories immunosuppressant antidepressant antipsycho tic anticonvulsant antiretroviral and antineoplastic cms instituted this policy to mitigate the risks and complications associated with an interruption of

alternatives within these classes for beneficiaries currently ta king drug for beneficiaries beginning treatment in these categories such ma nagement techniques may be used for categories other than hivaids drugs beginning with plan year 2010 the s ecretary will be required to identify categories and classes of drug s which may be different from the six classes required by cms for which 1 restricted access to the category or class will have major or lifethreatening clinical consequences for individuals who have disease or disorder treated by the drugs in such category or class and 2 there is significant clinical need for such individuals to have access to mu ltiple drugs within category or class due to unique chemical actions and pharmacolo gical effects of the drugs within the category or class such as drugs used in the treatment of cancer prescription drug plan pdp sponsors will be required to in clude all covered pa rt d drugs in the categories and classes identified by the secretary however the secretary may establish formal exceptions process that ensures that any exception is based on scientific evidence and medical standards of practice which for antiretroviral medications must be consistent with hhs guidelines for the use of antiretroviralhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34280crs21 agents in hiv1infected adults and adolescents and includes public notice and comment period cms review cms reviews and pproves drug lists that are consistent with best practice formularies currently in widespread use it reviews formularies for at least one drug in each of the usp formulary key drug types it reviews tier placement to provide assurance that the formulary does not substantially discourage enrollment of certain beneficiaries it analyzes formularies to determine whether appropriate access is afforded to drugs or drug classes addressed in widely accepted treatment guidelines which are indicative of general best practice it also analyzes the availability and tier position of the most commonly prescribed drug classes for the general medicare population and the dua lly eligible population cms also looks to existing best practices to check plans use of utilization management tools such as prior authorization quantity limits and step th erapy where lower cost drug is first tried before higher cost drug may be used for the 2008 contract year cms stated that it was expanding its review of drugs commonly used by the dual eligible popula tion to 200 and incorporating the top 100 drugs used in the medicare drug discount card program the mporary program for the lowincome persons in place in 20042005 it was also expanding the number of treatment guidelines to ensure best practice drugs are included in the formulary finally it would use the presence of usp formulary key drug types as an outlier test to ensure these drugs are strongly represented on all part d formularies specialty tier part d plan is allowed to exempt formulary tier in which it places very high cost and unique items from tiered costsharing exceptions in order to ensure that the plan does not substantially discourage enrollment by specific patient populations cms w ill only approve specialty tiers under the following conditions there is only one specialty tier exempt from costsharing exceptions costsharing is limited to 25 in the initial coverage range or actuarially equivalent for plans w ith decreased or deductible basic alternative design only plans with negotiated prices exceeding threshold may be placed in the tier the level is 500 month in 2007 and 600 month in 2008 formulary changes during plan year mma provided that if plans removed drugs from their formularies during the year or changed their preferred or tiered status they were required to provide notice on timely basis to cms affected enrollees physicians pharmacies and pharmacists observers expressed concerns about the implications of formul ary changes on plan enrollees in response cms emphasized that best practices call for limited changes during the plan year and outlined the following circumstances unde r which such changes can be madehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34280crs22 plans can expand formularies by dding drugs lowering the tier of drug thereby reducing copaymen ts or coinsurance or deleting utilization management requirements plans can not change therapeutic categories and classes during year except to account for new therapeu tic uses and newly approved part d drugs plans can make formulary maintenace changes after march 1 such as replacing brand name drug with new generic drug or modifying formularies as result of new information on safety or effectiveness these changes re quire approval and 60 days notice to appropriate parties plans can only remove drugs from formulary move covered drugs to less preferred tier status or add utilization management requirements in accordance with pproved procedures and after 60 days notice to appropriate parties plans can make such changes only if enrollees currently taking the affected drugs are exempt from the formulary change for the remainder of the plan year plans are not required to obtain cms approva l or give 60 days notice when removing formulary drugs that have been withdrawn from the market by either the fda or product manufacturer transition policies cms has established tran sition standards intended to assure that new plan enrollees do not ab ruptly lose coverage for their drugs specifically plans are required to provide temporary supply fill anytime within the first 90 days of beneficiarys enrollment in plan the supply must be for 30 days unless the prescription is written for less than 30 days for any nonformulary drug the requirement also applies to drugs that are on plans formul ary but that require prior authorization or step therapy in longterm care facilities the transition policy provides for 31day fill with multiple fills as necessary during the first 90 days of beneficiarys enrollment in plan af ter the 90day period the plan must provide 31day emergency supply while an excep tion is being processed cms has specified 31 days because many longterm care pharmacies dispense medications in 31day increments for contract year 2008 sponsors are required to ensure that the transition process information is prominently posted on their website cms has noted that the purpose of the pro cess is not just to provide temporary fill of nonformulary drugs but rather to provide enrollees with sufficient time to work with their health care providers to switch to therapeutically appropriate formulary alternative or to request an exception based on grounds of medical necessity formulary change notice in advance of upcoming year as noted earlier enrollees must receive an annual notice of change anoc by october 31 prior to the next contract year the upco ming years formulary is viewed as new formulary therefore cms does not require plans to identify specific drug changeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34280crs23 impacting enrollees or require 60 days notice of change however enrollees have at least 60 days to review the new formulary and identify any changes cms has outlined two options for providi ng transition for enrollees whose drugs are longer on the formulary th ey may provide transition process for current enrollees consistent with the tr ansition process for new enrollees beginning january 1 of the new contract year alternatively they can effectuate transition for current enrollees prior to january 1 however if plans have not successfully transitioned the affected enrollees to therapeutically equivalent formulary alternative or processed an exceptions request by january 1 they are expected to provide transition supply beginning january 1 until such time as they have effected meaningful transition pharmacy access pdp sponsors are required to establish pharmacy network sufficient to ensure access to covered part d drugs for all enrollees they must demonstrate that they provide 1 convenient access to retail pha rmacies for all enrollees 2 adequate access to home infusion pharmacies for all enrollees 3 convenient access to long term care ltc pharmacies fo r residents of ltc facilitie s and 4 access to indian health service tribes or urban indian programs itu pharmacies operating in the sponsors service area cms can waive the standards in the case of 1 mapd plans that operate their own pharmacies provided they can demons trate convenient access and 2 private feeforservice plans offeri ng part d coverage for drugs purchased from all pharmacies provided they do not charge dditional costsharing for drugs obtained from nonnetwork pharmacies retail pharmacy access mma defined conve nient access to retail pharmacies as being less favorable than those standards specified for the department of defense tricare regiona l pharmacy program as of march 13 2003 the applicable part d standards are as follows in urban areas at least 90 of dicare beneficiaries in the plans service area on average live within 2 miles of retail pharmacy participating in the plans network in suburban areas at least 90 of medicare beneficiaries in the plans service area on average live within 5 miles of retail pharmacy participating in the plans network in rural areas at least 70 of medicare beneficiaries in the plans service area on average live within 15 miles of retail pharmacy participating in the plans network the inclusion of mail order pharmacies in part d plan networks is optional however such plans do not count to ward meeting the retail pharmacy access requirements plans that include mail order pharmacies in their networks must allow enrollees to

announced that it would collect 4 billion from part d drug plan sponsors due to lowerthanexp ected drug costs in 2006 it stated that it would be collecting these funds from plans due to the fact that actual drug costs for almost all part d plans were below expected levels in their 2006 bi ds it cited several factors leading to lower spending includi ng the fact that 2006 marked the first time that plans were bidding on the new part d program and the fact there were higher levels of generic drug utilization in part d than had been anticipated it further noted that plans submitted their bids for the 2006 contracting year in june 2005 the 2006 bids were therefore somewhat uncertain predictions of what would actually happen when the drug benefit began in 2006 cms expects that as experience with part d grows plan bid submissions will more closely reflect actual costs it stated that the 2007 bid submissions were significantly wer than those sub mitted in 2006 and were reflection of the actual 2006 part d drug program experience therefore cms anticipates that amounts collected from or paid to plans in future years as result of final reconciliation and risk adjustment will be lower than that for the 2006 plan year8 beneficiary premiums beneficiaries pay monthly premiums for pa rt d coverage payments vary by the plan selected on average beneficiary premiums are to represent roughly 255 of the cost of basic coveragehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34280crs33 the monthly premium is uniform for all persons enrolled in the plan except for those receiving lowincome subsidies or t hose subject to late enrollment penalty it equals the base beneficiary premium as adjusted to reflect the difference between the plans standardized bid amount and the nationwide average bid base beneficiary premium the base beneficiary premium for part d plan equals the product of the benefici ary premium percenta ge and the national average monthly bid amount see calculation under direct subsidies above the beneficiary premium percentage is qual to 255 divided by 100 minus percentage equal to total reinsurance payments divided by the sum of such reinsurance payments and total payments the secretary estimates will be paid to prescription drug plans in year that are attributable to the standardized bid amount taking into account amounts paid by cms and enrollees the base beneficiary monthly pr emium was 2735 in 2007 and is 2793 in 2008 adjustments once the base beneficiary premium is calculated it is adjusted up or down as appropriate to reflect any difference between the plans standardized bid amount and the nationwide average bid amount thus beneficiaries in plans with higher costs for standard coverage face higher than average premiums for such coverage while enrollees in lower cost plans pay lower than average premiums for such coverage premiums are further increas ed to reflect any supplemen tal benefits or any late enrollment penalty and decreased if the individual is entitled to lowincome subsidy additionally enrollees in map d plans may see decrease if plans use rebates based on parts nd b benefit costs to buy down the part d premium program financing medicare part d is

th at may be provided through supplementary or wrap around benefits this appr oach may have some financial consequences for the employer or union since third party payments do not count toward troop thus if an employer chooses to pay some of the part d costsharing on behalf of its retirees this would have the effect of delaying the point at which the part d catastrophic coverage would begin the

benefits progra m fehb the federal government elected not to take the employer subsidy for th individuals on the grounds that it would be merely subsidizing itself issues in january 2008 part d began its third year of operation while early startup issues have generally been resolved some issues remain the following highlights few of these lowincome individuals major focus of part d is the enha nced coverage provided to lowincome individuals through the lowincome subsidy lis program despite extensive federal state and local outreach efforts not all persons potentially eligible have enrolled in the program as of ja nuary 2008 cms estimated that 26 million persons eligible for lis had neither signed up for part d nor had coverage through another source it is not immediately cl ear why some indivi duals have failed to enroll though several factors including lack of program awareness and the nature of the application process itself play role the assets limitations are viewed by some as being too low thereby precluding otherwise eligible persons from gaining coverage second issue of concern to the low income population is the large number of persons required to change plans each ear because the premium for their current plan longer falls below the lowinco subsidy level some observers have suggested that when making the lowincome subsidy calculation see earlier discussion the mapd enrollment should be removed from the calculation their inclusion in the calculation has the effect of lowering the benchmark thereby forcing higher number of persons enrolled in pdps to change plans if they are to remain in zero premium plans highincome enrollees on average beneficiary premiums account for 255 of expected total part d costs for basic coverage fe deral general revenue s account for most of the remaining costs some persons have suggested that higher income persons should pay higher percentage of their costs except for persons entitled to lowincome subsidies all persons

emiums were announced in october 2007 cms estimated that about 5 of beneficiaries would be affected by the income related premium increase in 2008 it is t hought that slightly lower percentage would be affected by the part d proposal this is because some highincome medicare beneficiaries have alternative sour ces of prescription drug coverage such as through former employer and therefore do not enroll in part d some observers who had also opposed incomerelating the part b premium suggest that this approach would further move medicare from its entitlement nature beneficiary experience when mma was enacted few observers expected beneficiaries to have choice among so many drug plans some argue th at the large number of plans available to beneficiaries may complicate their choices given that enrollment tends to be heavily concentrated in plans offered by limited number of sponsors it is likely that the number of available options will decline over time beneficiaries have tended to enroll in plans with low premiums and zero or low deductibles however in the absence of concrete data it is not clear whether this is always the best choice for the beneficiary most part d enrollees
