resources science and industry division david randall peterman analyst in transportation policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33492amtrak budget and reauthorization summary amtrak was created by congress in 1970 to provide intercity passenger railroad service it operates approximately 44 routes over 22000 miles of track 97 of which is owned by freight rail companies it runs deficit each year and requires federal assistance to cover operating losses and capital i nvestment without yearly federal grant to cover operating losses amtrak would not survive as presently configured the crux of the public polic issue facing congress has been succinctly stated by the department of transportation inspector ge neral dot ig to create new model for intercity passenger rail comprehensive reauthorization that provides new direction and ad equate funding is needed the problem with the current model extends beyond funding th ere are inadequate incentives for amtrak to provide costeffective service stateo fgoodrepair needs are not being adequately addressed and states have insufficient leverage in determining service quality options in part because amtrak receive s federal rail funds not the states during the last three congresses amtrak policy was stalemated and consensus could be reached on what kind of passenger rail system to fund congress failed to endorse amtraks strategy of maintaining its full current network while restoring its infrastructure to state of good repair in the 109th congress the administration and amtrak had pr esented proposals for reform appropriations for fy2009 the president is requesting 900 million for amtrak which is the same amount th administration requested and 455 million less than congress appropria ted last year amtrak is requesting 1671 billion which is 316 million more than cong ress appropriated last year amtraks request does not include 114 million in back pay for some of amtraks union employees one of the recommendations of presidentia l emergency board 242 which was recently appointed to resolve labor dispute senatereported s 3261 provides 1550 billion for amtrak nearly twice the administrations request reauthorization amtraks authorization expired in december 2002 reauthorization issues in the 110th congress include amtraks funding level the size of its network the introducti on of competition for routes and amtrak restructuring as congress once again considers amtrak r eauthorization the range of options for passenger rail include 1 providing higher levels of funding to support an expanded passenger rail system 2 providing f unding for operating and maintaining the current system 3 focusing available re sources on providing service only to those corridors that can be justified on econo mic grounds 4 reducing amtrak funding and eliminating much of the present passe nger rail network 5 eliminating funding for amtrak and reorganizing passenger rail service in the united states various combinations of the above options are also possible the senate passed an amtrak reauthorization bill the pa ssenger rail inves tment and improveme nt act of 2007 s 294 on october 20 2007 house reauthor ization bill hr 6003 was passed on june 11 2008 on september 24 2008 the house via hres 1492 approved an amtrak reauthorization bill attached to railroad safety bill hr 2095 it

officially the national railr oad passenger cor poration is the nations only provider of interc ity passenger rail service amtrak is structured as private company but virtually all its shares are held by the united states department of transportation dot amtrak was cr eated by congress in 1970 to maintain minimum level of intercity passenger rail service while relieving the railroad companies of the financial bur den of providing that moneylosing service although created as forprofit corporation amtra k like intercity passeng er rail operators in other countries has not been able to make profit during the last 35 years federal assistance to amtrak has amount ed to approximately 30 billion1 amtraks approximately 19000 employees operate trains and maintain its infrastructure the company operates approximately 44 r outes over 21000 miles of track most of that track is owned by fre ight rail companies amtrak owns about 625 route miles of track2 the section it owns the northeast corridor nec includes some of the most heavily used gments of track in the nation amtrak is distinctly minority user on certain portions of the nec by far the greatest volume of nec traffic is represented by commuter and freight trains3 amtrak operates corridor routes covering di stances under 400 miles and l ongdistance routes over 400 miles in length some of amtraks corridor routes are supported in part by assistance from the states th ey serve amtrak also operates commuter service under contract with state and local commuter au thorities in various parts of the country although amtraks fy2005fy2009 strategi c plan calls for more than 8 billion in federal assistance over five years congress has thus far declined to provide the requested funding amtraks annua l appropriation has b een 13 billi on since fy2003 enough to keep the system operating but not enough to prevent the deferral of some significant maintenance projects although short of the funding required to accomplish amtraks strategic vision amtrak has resisted reorganizing the system according to the dot ig amtrak would need about 2 billion year to restore the system to stateofgoodrepair and velop corridor service or 14 billion simplyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33492crs2 4 statement of mark dayton dot ig before the senate committee on appropriations subcommittee on transportation treasury the

house committee on transportation and infrastructure s ubcommittee on railroads september 28 2006to keep the system from falling into further disrepair4 more fundamentally the dot ig has stated that new federal intercity passenger rail strategy is needed the current model for providing intercity passenger service continues to produce financial instability and poor service quality despite multiple efforts over the years to change amtraks structure and funding we have system that limps along is never in stateofgoodrepair awash in debt and perpetually on the edge of collapse in the end amtrak has been tasked to be all things to all people but the model under which it operates leaves many unsatisfied5 the presidents fy2006 budget proposal re quested money for amtrak the administration did request 360 million fo r the surface transportation board to support commuter rail services that depe nd on amtrak in the event that amtrak ceased operations during fy2006 with s ubsidies amtrak would quickly enter bankruptcy which would likely lead to the elimination of inefficient operations and the reorganization of the railroad through bankruptcy proceedings6 while the administration had issued veto threats against the fy2006 dot appropriations bills that provided funds for amtrak without sign ificant reforms to amtraks structure and operations the president signed 1315 b illion appropriation for amtrak hr 3058 pl 109115 while the administration requested 900 million for amtrak in fiscal years 2007 2008 and again for 2009 it continues to seek major changes in the organizational structure of in tercity passenger rail service in this country see below on november 3 2005 the gao released report that was highly critical of amtraks management and performance7 on november 9 2005 amtraks president and ceo david gunn was fired by amtrak s board of directors gunn was opposed to some of the more far reaching restruct uring proposals sought by the administration and the amtrak board such as splitting the infrastructure component and the operating component on the northeast corridor nec into two separate entities on september 28 2006 amtraks new ceo alex kummant testified before the house railroads subcommittee that he was commi tted to operating national system of trains and that he believed l ongdistance trains were an im portant part of the nations transportation network8 he also testified that the fastest growing service was in rail corridors between city pairs of 300500 miles and that deve loping these corridors was going to be the driving force of amtraks future amtrak has demonstrated that rail can play significant role in intercity passenger travel in certain corridors slightly more people travel by train than fly be tween new york

new york city and boston9 federal oversight of amtrak congress has included provisions in mtraks recent appropriations beginning in fy2003 pl 1087 117 stat 11 intended to bring greater transparency to amtraks finances and to increase dot s control over amtraks use of its appropriation amtrak is re quired to submit strategic plan to congress updated annually and is prohibited from making expe nditures not programmed in the strategic plan without advance notice to congress amtrak is also required to submit monthly financial statement to congress also congress changed the way amtrak receives its funding the funding longer goes directly to amtrak but is allocated to the secretary of transportation who make s quarterly grants to amtrak amtrak is required to submit grant applications to dot for each route to receive this funding finances amtrak runs deficit of over billi on dollars each year virtually all of amtraks 44 or so routes lose money but the longdistance routes lose the most10 according to the dot ig in 2004 long distance trains cumulatively incurred operating losses of more than 600 million xcluding interest and depreciation11 by his calculation eliminating longdista nce service will reduce operating losses by about 300 million far too little to make mtrak profitable in congressional testimony the dot ig stated that long di stance trains accounted for only 15 of total intercity rail ridership and th at 77 of longdistance train passengers traveled along only portions of the routes not endtoe nd trips trips mostly ranged from 500700 miles slightly longer than corridor trips12 the ig estimated that amtrak could realize annual operating savings of between 75 million and 158 million and an additional 79 million in planned annual capital ex penditures that could be avoided by eliminating the highlysubsidized sleeper class service from its longdistance trains13 sleeper class service includes sleeping room and prepaid meals in the trains diningcar coach

council was created by the amtrak reform and accountability act of 1997 to recommend improvements to amtrak and to draw up new policy for intercity passenger rail service while acknowledging the structural aspects of amtraks deficit both the reform council and the dot ig have also been critical of amtraks management as have the government accountability office and other observers 17 dot ig fourth quarterly report on costsavings accrued by amtrak operational reform october 10 2006 cc2006068 p 10 trips and usually buy food in the trai ns lounge car on october 10 2006 the dot ig reported that amtrak has begun restructuring sleeper class service and expects to save up to 20 million in fy2007 from this restructuring14 in addition to its annual deficit amtrak has majo r liabilities due to deferred maintenance and accumulated debt lacking money to complete all its capital repair and maintenance projects amtr ak has deferred many mainte nance projects this has led the dot ig to observe that amtraks continued deferral of maintenance increases the risk of major failure on its system amtrak has an estimated 6 billion in backlogged capital maintenance needs of which about 4 billion is needed on the nec15 these include replacement of aging bridges signal equipment and catenary the power source for the northeast corridor trains improvements to tunnels and track repair of wrecked equipment and ove rhaul of aging equipment the ig has criticized some of the capital spending choices amtrak has made such as refurbishing sleeper cars instead of replacing aging brid ges the amtrak reform council and the dot ig have both estimated that amtrak requires around 15 2 billion in federal operating and capita l support annually16 this is higher leve l of federal funding than amtrak has ever consistently received in recent years amtrak has stopped borro wing trimmed its workforce and cut its expenses while at the same time achieving increases in ridership however the cuts in expenses have been small relative to amtraks annual defi cit and increases in ridership have been relatively modest as well in this context the dot ig has observed that it is difficult to see how amtrak can achieve further reductions within its federal operating subsidy without ad dressing statesupported routes route restructuring and labor contracts17 amtrak did not gain any flexibility in work rules in its latest labor agreement while mtrak competes with freight and commuter railroads to retain its workforce it competes with the airlines on its corridor routes in terms of bor productivity amtraks internal options for significantly reducing its annual ficit in the short term are limited its two major cost categories are the operating losses of the long distance trains and maintenance costs of the northeast corridor reducing the size of its system could in the long run signif icantly reduce amtraks deficit and the long run cost to the federal government lthough amtrak would still run shortterm deficit even if it eliminated all its longdis tance trains because of severance payments to employees additionally the costs of maintaining the northeast corridor wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33492crs5 18 amtrak monthly financial report september 2006 and september 2005 various tables data in these reports are unaudited 19 fy2009 fra budget justification npremain whatever the fate of longdistance service amtrak interprets 49 usc 24701 to require it to provide service nationwide which it takes to mean service that spans the nation rather than service in differe nt parts of the nation thus amtrak is unlikely to eliminate or restructure longd istance routes without explicit direction from congress many members of congre ss continue to support nationwide amtrak network although amtraks ridership has grown slightly from fy2005 to fy2006 amtraks ontime performance has declined due at least in part to the postponement of maintenance work each year from 741 in fy2003 to 678 in fy2006 amtrak ridership increased by 276000 passengers from 24031 million to 24307 million from fy2005 to fy2006 but dec lined by 747000 passengers between fy2004 when ridership was over 25 million and fy2006 it appears unlikely that amtrak could increase its re venues enough to eliminate its deficits total passenger and nonpassenger revenues increased by 130 million from fy2005 to fy2006 but only increased by 140 million from fy2004 to fy2006 amtrak has narrowed its operating loss by 61 milli on from 1221 billi on in fy2005 to 1160 billion in fy2006 its cash operating loss which exclude s interest and depr eciation narrowed from 584 million to 545 million18 appropriations the consolidated appropriations act 2008 pl 110161 provided 1325 billion in grants to amtrak plus 30 million to the states in new matching grant program for passenger rail related capital impr ovements of the 1325 billion total 475 million was provided for operating gr ants and 850 million was provided in capital and debt service grants for fy2009 the president requests 900 milli on for amtrak which is the same amount the administration requested and 455 million less than congress appropriated last year the 900 million includes 525 million in capital grants 275 in operating efficiency incentive gran ts and 100 million to continue the state matching capital grant program under this program state or st ates could apply for these grants for up to 50 of the total co st of capital project provided that the project is on route that requires operating subsidy or the state or states are willing to provide the operating subsidy the project must also be included in the statewide transportation improvement plan at the time of application the administration also proposes establishing new pilot program to test the feasibility of allowing potential competitors of amtrak to ope rate trains on selected rout the budget request reflects the administrations positi on on amtrak and states19 the administration expects amtrak to be run more like business with the goal of addressing the nations mobility problems in costeffective way the budget proposes to reduce unjustified operating subsidies the administrations positionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33492crs6 20 see report to the president by emergency board 242 washington dc december 30 2007is that the federal government should focus on strategically investing capital rather than allocating scarce resources to operating inefficient trains that fail to solve pressing transportation challenges facing the nation the senate committee on ppropriations provides total of 1550 billion for amtrak see s 3261 and srept 110418 this total includes 1 billion in capital grants of which 285 milli on is reserved for debt service and 550 million in operating grants which includes funds for b ack pay that was part of recent labor agreement s 3261 as reported also includes 100 million for reimbursable state capital matching program for fy2009 amtrak is requesting 1671 billion which is 316 million more than congress appropriated last year this amount includes 525 million in operating subsidies 801 million in capital spending and 345 million for debt service to justify its operating budget re quest amtrak notes increasin g fuel costs increasing health care costs and increases in wage costs as result of recent bargaining agreement reached with some of amtraks unions as per this labor agreement amtraks budget request does not include 114 million in back pay that was recommended by the president emergency board20 amtraks budget request notes continuing problem with cracking of c oncrete ties on the northeast corridor and notes that while the contractor is contractually obligated to replace many of the defective ties it does not cover substantial labor costs associated with replacement the request also notes that the average age of amtraks coach fleet is 24 years and the average age of its locomotive fleet is more than 15 years and thus replacing rolling stock is high priority for the railroad amtrak reauthorization amtraks previous authorization expired in december 2002 the amtrak reform and accountability act of 1997 p l 105134 111 stat 2570 authorized amtrak for the period december 1997 through december 2002 it required that amtrak operate without federal operating assistan ce after 2002 this was not accomplished since then reauthorization of amtrak has been stalled by disagreement over the future of us passe nger rail policy although numerous bills were introduced in the 108th and 109th congresses and various approaches have been advanced congress has thus far been unwillin g either to provide amtrak with the level of funding that it has re quested or to require an amtr ak restructuring that would be consistent with the leve l of funding that it has been willing to provide since 2002 congress has essentially reached stalemate with respect to amtrak during the 108th and 109th congresses it was unable to reauthorize amtrak or to reach consensus on what kind of passenger rail system it woul d be willing to fund it fa iled to endorse amtraks strategy of maintaining its full current network while restoring its infrastructure to state of good repair or to provide the funding that would have allowed that strategy to be executed by amtrak

and related agencies intercity passenger rail and amtrak march 16 2006 cc2006026 pp 910as congress once again considers amtrak reauthorization the range of options for passenger rail include 1 providing higher levels of funding to support an expanded passenger rail syste m 2 providing funding fo r operating and maintaining the current system 3 focusing available resources on providing service only to those corridors that can be justified on economic grounds 4 reducing amtrak funding and eliminating much of the pres ent passenger rail network 5 eliminating funding for amtrak and reorganizing passenger rail serv ice in the united states although various combinations of the above options are possi ble the dot ig has concluded that the status quo option is unsustainable and th at federal funding for amtrak of between 14 billion and 15 billion would be necessary to prevent cuts in service but would not be enough to restore the system to stateofgoodrepair nor permit investment in new corridor development in regard to amtrak reauthorization the dot ig urged congress to consider the following three points 1 without competition amtrak has few incentives other than the threat of budget cuts or elimination for cost control 2 states rather than amtrak should decide wh ere and how intercity passenger rail service is provided and 3 the federal government must be willing to provide adequate funding but not directly to amtrak to bring the infrastructur into stateofgood repair21 in the 110th congress senator frank r laute nberg and then senator trent lott introduced an amtrak reauthorization bill the passenger rail investment and improvement act of 2007 s 294 on janua ry 16 2007 this bill would authorize total of 33 billion in operating grants and 63 billion in capital grants for fiscal years 2007 through 2012 to be administered by the dot to amtrak of the 63 billion in capital grants certain percen tage of this amount ranging from 3 in fy2007 to 33 in fy2012 would be directed to states rather than to amtrak the bill would also allow states to use operators other than amtrak to provide rail service on particular routes thus potentially opening up competition for amtrak the bill creates capital match program for stat or group of states for the purpose of providing new or improved inte rcity rail service the fede ral share of this program would be 80 while the bill repeals the requirement that amtrak become financially selfsufficient it does require amtrak to reduce operating subsidies by 40 over the life of the bill the bill would expand mtraks board of directors to 10 members including the secretary of transportation th president of amtra k and eight members selected by the administration with more than five of these from the same political party and representing the geographic regions that amtrak currently serves to the extent possible s 294 was approved with amendm ents by the committee on commerce science and transportation on april 25 2007 and was passed with amendments by the full senate on october 20 2007 du ring senate floor debate among the amendments rejected was an amendment to limit the

ame ndment expressing the sense of congress of the need to maintain amtrak as national passenger rail system the house version of an amtrak reau thorization bill hr 6003 was introduced on may 8 2008 and ordered to be reported by the house committee on transportation and infrastructure on may 22 2008 it was passed by the house with amendments on june 11 2008 by vote of 311 to 104 for fy2009fy2013 hr 6003 would provide total of 67 billion in capital grants to amtrak of which 25 billion would be provided to states in capital matching program 30 billion in operating grants 17 billion for debt rvice and 11 billion for ada compliance the house bill also would provide 18 b illion over the life of the bill 350 million per fiscal year for the development of up to two highspeed rail corridors one of which would be between washington dc and ne w york city in this instance high speed rail is defined as at least 110 mph and in the case of the washington dc and new york city corridor travel time for express trains between those two cities would have to be under two hours under this provision private companies would bid for the financing design cons truction and operation of thes highspeed rail corridors dot and commission would evaluate and rank the proposals and report their findings to congress the house bill also requires amtrak to submit plan for restoring service between new orleans and sanford florida22 the house bill would restructure amtraks board of directors in the same way as the senate bill both the house and senate bills would involve the surface transportation board stb in resolving disputes between freight railroads and passenger train interests but for different purposes the senate bill s ection 209 would allow amtrak or states subsidizing amtrak service to petition the stb to investigate when amtraks ontime performance falls below certain level if the stb finds that the host freight railroad is at fault it may award damages or provi some other relief the provision would also allow freight railroads to petition the stb if they believe passenger trains are negatively affecting their business on cer tain route the house bill section 401 would require the stb to conduct nonbindi ng mediation between freight railroads and public transit authorities seeking access to freight railroad rightofways for passenger service in circ umstances where the two par ties cannot reach agreement during the 109th congress the bush administration introduced proposal the passenger rail inves tment reform act hr 1713 in the 109th congress that would restructure amtrak splitting it into three functionally independent entities 1 corporate entity that would oversee amtrak restructuring and manage residual responsibilities including specifically mtraks legal right of access to other railroads 2 pure passeng er rail operating company and 3 an infrastructure management company that bill would have provided for the establishment of an interstate compact to operate the northeast corridor members of the proposed compact included all of the states and the district of columbia that constitute the nec the proposal would have also

service and capital improvements it also would have required state matching c ontribution of 50 for capita l projects that qualify under planning and other criteria for federal assistance the bill also would have phased out operating subsidies for longdistance trains opened routes to competition and authorized buyouts for current employees the administration bill called for an annual appropriation of such sums as necessary to accomplish the reforms specified in the bill at february 2007 hearing on amtrak federal ra ilroad administrator joseph h boardman reiterated the administrations plan to restructure amtrak and stated that our overall ssessment of s 294 is that it does not include enough meaningful reforms23 with regard to hr 6003 the administration has stated that the bill provides scant opportunity for competition on existing amtrak routes and that it does not require any meaningful reforms in amtraks governance or operations nor allocates resources based on the demand for passenger rail service24 the statement of administration policy also objects to the bills expansion of the davisbacon act and includes recommended veto of the bill
