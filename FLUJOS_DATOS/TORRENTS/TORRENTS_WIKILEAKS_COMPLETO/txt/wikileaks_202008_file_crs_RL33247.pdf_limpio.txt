sbeth and betsy palmer government and finance division june 2 2006 abstract this report examines the ways in which the senate has handled the 158 supreme court nominations the president has sent to the senate in the past as the purpose of this report is to examine the forms taken by senate proceedings on these 157 nominations it treats each nomination as separate case it is not couched in terms of the smaller number of diﬀerent individuals nominated or the ultimate outcome the conﬁrmation process may have had for each supreme court conﬁrmation debates of course do not occur in vacuum they are product of the president making the choice the state of the senate at the time the nominee and his or her views and the prevailing mood of the country these elements while critical to understanding speciﬁc cases are not considered in this report and discussions of them can be found in other reports on the supreme court this report focuses on answering very basic question what procedures or tools has the senate used during consideration of supreme court nominees how have they changed over time and how those tools have aﬀected the conﬁrmation processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33247g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

submitted to the senate 158 nominations for positions on the supreme court of these nominations 146 received action on the floor of the senate and 122 were confirmed senate floor consideration of the 146 nominees to reach the floor breaks down relatively naturally into five patterns over time first from 1789 through about 1834 the senate considered the nominations on the floor day after they were received from the president the second period 18351867 was distinguished by the beginning of referral of nominations to the committee on the judiciary the third period 18681921 was marked by rule changes that br ought bout more formalization of the process during the fourth period 19221967 the senate began using the calendar call to manage the consideration of supreme court nominations and the final time period 1968 to the present is marked by more roll call votes on confirmation and the use of unanimous consent agreements to structure debate of the 122 votes by which the senate confirmed nom inees 73 took place by voice vote and 49 by roll call but on only 24 of the roll calls did 10 or more senators vote against of the 36 nominations not confirmed the senate rejected 11 outright and 12 others never received floor consideration some because of opposition othe rs were withdrawn the remaining 13 reached the floor but never received final vote usually because some procedural action terminated consideration before vote could occur and the president later withdrew some of these including nominations that received incomplete consideration were rejected or drew more than 10 negative votes just 48 of the 158 experienced opposition that might be called significant of the 146 nominations that reached the floor 100 received one day of consideration while 25 received more than two days including four on which floor action took seven days or more of these 146 nominations optional procedural actions that could have been used to delay or block confirmation vote occurred on 58 of which 26 involved procedural roll calls among wide variety of procedural actions used the more common ones have included motions to postpone recommit and table motions to proceed to consider or other complications in calling up live quorum calls and unanimous consent agreements neither extended consideration the presence of extra procedural actions nor the appearance of significant opposition affords definitive evidence by itself that proceedings were contentious some nominations considered for one day still faced procedural roll calls some considered for three days or more faced optional procedures and some opposed by more than 10 senators were still considered only briefly and without optional procedures of the 146 nominations to reach the floor however 76 were confirmed in single day of action with neither optional procedural actions nor more than scattered opposition this report will be updated to reflect action on additional nominees

of justice to the supreme court of the united states is one of the rare moments when all three branches of the federal government come together the executive branch nominates and the legislative branch considers the nomination deciding whether the nominee will become member of the high court presidents and senators have said that short of declaring war deciding who should be on the supreme court is the most important decision they will make while in office the constitution in article ii section 2 divides the responsibility for selecting and confirming members of the supreme court between the president and the senate it says that the president shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall appoint ambassadors other public ministers and consuls judges of the supreme court and all other officers of the united states whose appointme nts are not herein otherwise provided for the senate has traditionally deferred to the president on nominations to the cabinet but they have shown less deference to presidents choice for the supreme court 1 of the 158 nominations presidents made to the supreme court since 1789 36 were not confirmed of the hundreds of cabinet officials nominated over the same time period just 15 failed of confirmation 2 some nominations to the supreme court have won confirmation with little debate and procedural complications while others have been debated extensively with significant resort to parliamentary procedures during consideration it appears that the senate has never felt strictly bound by past practice in considering these nominations but that it has used procedures and forms of consideration that the body has at the time deemed appropriate to each individual case nothing in senate rules procedures or practice requires that the senate proceed to final vote on nomination for example although in most instances it has done so of the 158 nominations for the supreme court 12 never reached the floor and 13 others never received final vote although they were debated on the floor this report examines the ways in which the senate has handled the 158 supreme court nominations the president has sent to the senate in the past as the purpose of this report is to examine the forms taken by senate proceedings on these 158 nominations it treats each nomination as separate case 3 it is not couched in terms of the smaller number of different individuals nominated or the ultimate outcome the confirmation process may have had for each4 1 michael j gerhardt the federal appointment process constitutional and

vacuum they are product of the president making the choice the state of the senate at the time the nominee and his or her views and the prevailing mood of the country these elements while critical to understanding specific cases are not considered in this report and discussions of them can be found in other reports on the supreme court5 this report focuses on answering very basic question what kinds of actions the senate has taken during consideration of supreme court nominees how they have changed over time and how they have affected the process of confirmation the emphasis of this report is on the 146 nominations on which some form of formal proceedings took place on the senate floor not on the ways in which the nominations might have been handled in committee or other prefloor stages the information presented was drawn from comprehensive search of the executive journals of the senate which are its official record of procedural actions taken in relation to executive business ie nominations and treaties which are the forms of business submitted to the senate by the president for recent congresses for which the journal is not yet available information was taken from the congressional record and the nominations data base of the congressional legislative information system the following discussion first sketches the changing patterns of consideration that have been normal in successive historical periods since 1789 noting their relation to changes in the procedural rules and practice of the senate for each period it not only describes normal and exceptional practice but also provides examples of proceedings that were either typical or notable the report then successively addresses three individual characteristics of floor action on these nominations the dispositions the senate made of them the length of floor consideration and the kinds of procedural action taken during consideration

for the nate in the consideration of nominees to the supreme court it does not include any specific method for doing so the process by which the senate has considered these nominations has typically included several stages from receipt and committee referral through committee consideration and reporting to scheduling for floor action followed by floor debate and final vote within this broad outline the senate has answered the basic questionwhat should the procedure be for consideration of nominationsin different ways at different times review of all supreme court nominations ce 1789 yields two general conclusions about the procedures used first the senate has not felt bound to consider each nomination in exactly the same way that the others before it were considered although some supreme court nominations for example never reached the senate floor and hence did not received vote the senate spent continued either sitting or former justice to be chief justice of the 139 individuals nominated the senate confirmed 116 leaving 23 on whom the senate never took favorable action of the 116 confirmed five never served because they declined the office and one died before assuming it so that 110 people all but two of them men have served as justices of the supreme court see crs report rl33225 supreme court nominations 17892005 actions by the senate the judiciary

those practices has been routine but their use shows how the senate has rese rved to itself the right to take the course of action that it believes best suits consideration of particular nomination this stance becomes even more evident when the senate considers wellknown person for supreme court seat the senate received debated and confirmed the nomination of former president william howard taft to be chief justice on the same day for example second notwithstanding the variations in the confirmation system the senates process has tended to become longer and more formal over time although members of the first supreme court were confirmed just two days after their nominations were received the norm in modern times has tended toward weeks of senate consideration if not months6 early in the senates history it was not typical for supreme court nominations to be referred to committee at all by modern times it was the norm for the senate committee on the judiciary to spend significant time reviewing nominees study of the 158 nominations sent to the senate finds that the senates floor consideration of supreme court nominations breaks down relativel naturally into five patterns over time g4g142g144g146g151g151g146g151g144g561g18g138g157g157g142g155g151g156g496g561g343g349g350g351g556g343g350g345g346g561 during this time the norm for senate consideration of supreme court nomination was that the chamber considered the nomination as matter of course on the second day after the nomination had been received from the president there was routine referral to committee although at least one nominee alexander wolcott was referred to select committee in 1811 his nomination was defeated from the beginning the senate has considered nominations in executive session that portion of the senates business that was established to consider business that comes directly from the president nominations and treaties at this time executive session also meant that the doors were closed only senators and select staff were permitted to be in the chamber and the proceedings were to remain secret 7 the journal which records the senates action on nominations the executive journal listed motion to consider these early nominations just simple note that the senate proceeded to consider the message from the president the message from the president became the facto method of organizing the nominations apparently representing precursor of the calendar call the senate was to employ later of the 31 nominations sent to the senate during this period all 28 nominations that were confirmed were done by voice vote the two rejections were by roll call one nomination was considered by the senate but left unfinished also the normal period of floor consideration during this period was one day for each nomination five nominations were considered for more than one day the three nominations not confirmed wolcott john rutledge 1795 and john j crittenden 1828 and two others

not include any specific provisions for handling nominations in 1806 the senate adopted general revision of its rules which included new provision on nominations this rule required that when nominations shall be made in writing by the president of the united states to the senate future day shall be assigned unless the senate unanimously direct otherwise for taking them into consideration8 despite adoption of this rule however there is indication in the journal that the senate either fixed date for consideration of nominations when they were received or that the senate waived this rule this pattern of consideration is shown in the confirmation of the very first supreme court in the following case study

george washington on september 24 1789 the nominations were not referred to committee these men were personally known to many if not all members of the senate and there was extensive investigation into their background on september 26 the senate proceeded to consider each of the six men and on each on the question to advise and consent thereto it passed in the affirmative9 there is indication of lengthy debate all six nominations were confirmed on the same day in the same way john jay was confirmed as chief justice and john rutledge of south carolina james wilson of pennsylvania william cushing of massachusetts robert h harrison of maryland and john blair of virginia were confirmed as associate justices although the vast majority of nominations during this time was handled in the

senate debated the nomination for nine days in an unusual twist the senate debated resolution on the nomination rather than the nomination itself the resolution said resolved that it is not expedient to act upon the nomination of john i crittenden as justice of the supreme court of the united states until the senate shall have acted finally on the report of the judiciary committee relative to the amendment of the judicial system of the united states 11 lengthy amendment was offered to the above resolution which in essence said that it was the duty of the president to fill vacant slots matter when in the course of the administration they occurred an amendment to the amendment was then offered which stated that the duty of the senate to confirm or reject the nominations of the president is as imperative as his duty to nominate that such has heretofore been the settled practice of the government and that it is not now expedient or proper to alter it12 the senate rejected this amendment to the amendment by voice vote voted 1724 to reject the original amendment and then voted 2317 on february 12 1829 to adopt the original resolution declaring it not expedient to act on the crittenden nomination by this action the early senate declined to endorse the principle that proper practice required it to consider and proceed to final vote on every nomination

1835 when the senate began to refer nominations routinely to the senate committee on the judiciary which had been created in 1816 once the committee reported the nomination to the senate the chamber tended to act upon it immediately in most cases the nomination was reported and then confirmed almost as one action as with the previo us practice most of these confirmations were accomplished by voice vote in some cases senator apparently opposed to particular nomination would move to table the nomination immediately after it was reported from committee the effect of motion to table however was not the same as it is in current senate parliamentary practice where the motion if successful has the same effect as rejection at this point in the development of the senate it appears that the motion to table had an effect more like motion to postpone and was used as way to avoid taking action on the nomination on that day this period lasted roughly through 1867 when the senate considered the nomination of roger b taney to be chief justice in 1835 for example the nomination was immediately tabled after the committee reported it later however the senate voted 2519 to proceed to consider the nomination and he was confirmed the nomination of robert c grier shows the typical features of this time period 11 senate executive journal jan 26 1829 p 626 12 ibid p 638

president judge of the district of allegheny court in pennsylvania the nomination was referred to the judiciary committee which reported it out the next day the senate considered the nomination immediately after it was reported and confirmed grier by voice vote13 g22g162g149g142g155g561g18g155g142g156g146g141g142g151g140g162g496g561g343g350g346g346g556g343g350g346g347g561 the major departure from the normal pattern of consideration for supreme court nominations during this time period took place during the presidency of john tyler he had been elected vice president on the whig ticket with william henry harrison in 1840 harrison died 31 days after taking the oath of office and tyler became president his relations with the whig party were strained and after he vetoed banking bill tylers entire cabinet but for one resigned and tyler was later expelled from the whig party not surprisingly tyler had difficulties winning confirmation of his supreme court nominations from whigdominated senate 14 tyler tried nine times to win senate confirmation of supreme court nomination but he was successful only once with the nomination of samuel nelson in 1845 tyler nominated four other men over the course of more than year to fill vacancies on the court he sent the name of edward king to the senate twice that of john c spencer twice and that of reuben h walworth three times the senate responded with disdain four times the senate voted to table tyler nominations and took further action on them one the 1844 nomination of spencer the senate rejected outright by vote of 2126 the standoff between the president and the senate took on such intensity that in one day june 17 1844 tyler changed his mind about whom to nominate twice at the time the senate had tabled the nomination of walworth to be an associate justice according to the senate executive journal tyler sent the following message to the senate i have learned that the senate has laid on the table the nomination heretofore made of reuben h walworth to be associate justice of the supreme court in place of smith thompson deceased i am informed that large amount of business has accumulated in the second district and that the immediate appointment of judge for that circuit is essential to the administration of justice under those circumstances i feel it is my duty to withdraw the name of mr walworth whose appointment the senate by their action seems not now prepared to confirm in the hopes that another name might be more acceptable the circumstances under which the senate heretofo re declined to advise and consent to the nomination of john c spencer have so far changed as to justify in my again submitting his name to their consideration i therefore nominate john c spencer of new york to be appointed as an associate justice of the supreme court in the place of smith thompson deceased 15 john tyler 13 david g savage ed guide to the us supreme court 4th ed washington cq press 2004 pp 945946 14

rules it contained lengthier and far more specific method for dealing with nominations when nominations shall be made by the president of the united states to the senate they shall unless otherwise ordered by the senate be referred to appropriate committees and the final question on every nomination shall be will the senate advise and consent to this nomination which question shall not be put on the same day on which the nomination is received nor on the day on which it may be reported by committee unless by unanimous consent of the senate nominations neither approved nor rejected by the senate during the session at which they are made shall not be acted upon at any succeeding session without being again made by the president and if the senate shall adjourn or take recess for more than thirty days all nominations pending and not finally acted upon at the time of such adjournment or recess shall be returned to th president and shall not be afterwards acted upon unless again submitted to the senate by the president and all motions pending to reconsider vote upon nomination shall fall on such adjournment or recess and the secretary of the senate shall thereupon make out and furnish to the heads of departments and other officers the list of nominations reject ed or not confirmed as required by law 17 this rule codified what had since 1835 become the practice of the senate at least in regard to supreme court nominations of referring the nomina tion to committee it also called for at least one day layover from the time committee reported on nomination to senate action on that nomination unless the senate decided by unanimous consent to do otherwise despite the rule however the senate did tend to decide otherwise of the 41 nominations in this period nearly half 18 were considered by the senate by unanimous consent on the same day they were reported out of committee nine nominations were considered within two days of the committees report the remaining 10 nominations which saw floor action came up on the floor more than two days after the committee reported sometimes significantly more than two days later in the case of melville w fuller to be chief justice for example the senate took up the nomination 17 days after the committee reported it in change from past practice the senate committee on the judiciary began issuing reports that characterized the committees support for the nomination the committee would usually report 16 ibid p 354 17 riddick history of the committee on rules and administration p 26

simply reported the nomination without such characterizations roll call votes on the confirmation of the pending nomination became more common during this period occurring on 16 of the 41 nominations the senate rejected three nominations decided by roll call votes and confirmed the 13 others the nomination of william b woods illustrates the key patterns of consideration at this time

him woods was born and educated in the north and had been leader in the ohio legislature and subsequently union general after the war however he had settled in alabama and had become circuit court judge on the fifth circuit hayes nominated woods on december 15 1880 the nomination was referred to the judiciary committee which reported it favorably on december 20 the next day the senate considered the nomination and by vote of 398 confirmed it 18 also during this period however confirmation ceased to be virtually automatic for supreme court nominations even when the nominee was

nominated george badger to be an associate justice to replace justice john mckinley who had died although fillmore whig was lame duck president following the fall election of democrat franklin pierce he nevertheless desired to place nominee on the supreme court badger who was an incumbent senator from north carolina and who had served as secretary of the navy under presidents harrison and tyler would seem to have been good choice it was thought that the senate would exercise senatorial courtesy and not reject fellow senator 19 the senate however was controlled by democrats by margin of 38 democrats to 22 whigs and 2 free soilers the senate debated the badger nomination for portions of four days several times the nomination was postponed and the senate voted 2625 to adjourn during one day of debate on the nomination finally on february 11 the senate agreed by vote of 2625 to postpone consideration of the nomination until march 4 the date when the term of the congress would expire and the new president would take office debates on supreme court nominations during these years still took place behind closed doors and senators were supposed to maintain the secrecy of these

by president grant in 1869 republicans then controlled the senate by large margin 6212 and it was thought at first that hoar would have tro uble winning confirmation but as it turned out hoar had badly alienated the senate as attorney general during implementation of the law which created the circuit court system in early 1869 the law created series of new federal judgeships and hoar was responsible for choosing names to recommend to the president for filling these positions hoar undertook the job without consulting senators on those positions according to hoars biography nearly every senator had cand idate of his own for the circuit court but in almost every instance the president took the attorney generals advice the same biography also notes that unhappily the judges manner in discharging his duty was not engaging he had the plain speech and trying sincerity of latitude 42 degrees n in an extreme degree and it proved hard to bear at washington 20 the senate received hoars nomination on december 15 1869 it was referred to the judiciary committee and on december 22 the committee reported it out with an adverse recommendation the senate began debate on the nomination on the same day it was reported motion was offered to adjourn which failed by vote of 2331 as was motion to table the nomination which also failed 2430 but supporters of the nomination evidently saw the writing on the wall and eventually agreed later that same day by voice vote to table the nomination which at that time still meant only to delay its further consideration and not necessarily to kill it in letter to hoar massachusetts senator henry wilson said it had been difficult fight i write simply to say that your friends for more than four hours battled for you that all was said and done that could be when it was clearly seen that majority had determined on vote of rejection we struggled for more than two hours against coming to vote before we secured an adjournment never have i seen such action in the senate another letter from jd cox former house member who was then secretary of the interior said he had met with several senators about the nomination fight he said of those opposed to hoar they were determined to be content with nothing but prompt rejection and did not even consent to motion to table the business after four hours exciting struggle until alexander g cattell senator from new jersey told them he would make dilatory motions all night before he would permit such an outrage the result was the tabling of the question with as the oppositi on claim an understanding that it shall not be again taken up 21 the senate reconvened in 1870 and on february 3 rejected hoars nomination by vote of 24 33

supreme court nomination the senate would instead begin with the first available nomination and work its way through the calendar until reaching the supreme court nomination this practice appears to represent formalization of the process used from 1868 to 1922 twenty of the 30 supreme court nominations during this time period came up when their place on the calendar had been reached for nomination that might have been experiencing difficulty the senate could pass it over when it was reached on the call of the calendar it would come up again the next time the senate took up the calendar the senate also called up several nominations out of order by unanimous consent during this time this procedure was used particularly for those nominations on which there was controversy such as edward t sanford in 1923 and byron white and arthur j goldberg in 1962 another major development as well took place early in this period debate on nominations became public after years of debating the issue in 1929 the senate decided to conduct its executive business consideration of treaties and nominations in open session increasingly in the preceding years although the doors had been clos ed and debate on nominations was supposed to remain secret very often detail of the sessions would leak out to the press in addition the rule of secrecy had been set aside several times so that certain debates such as that on louis d brandeis to be an associate justice in 1916 could be opened to the public the immediate trigger for the rules change was the disclosure by the united press of the roll call vote on the nomination of roy west to be secretary of the interior soon after up also published the vote on the nomination of former senator irvine lenroot to be judge of the customs court of appeals the senate rules committee began an investigation into who leaked the lenroot vote and for variety of reasons it was forced to hold this inquiry in open session the reporter paul mallon refused to disclose who his source had been and the committee came to conclusion on the matter the senate then considered rules change that would have allowed majority to vote to open any executive session an alternative was proposed to make all debates open unless majority voted to close them the senate approved this amendment 695 22 the nomination of william douglas shows how the calendar call

opposition developed senator lynn frazier of north dakota argued douglas had an im proper relationship with the leaders of the new york stock exchange the nomination was passed over twice on the call of the calendar so that there could be full debate about the nomination in particular the first time the nomination was passed over it was because senator frazier could not be in the chamber and he wanted the senate to wait until he was able to be part of the debate three live quorum calls were taken during consideration of the nomination the first of these was demanded at the start of the debate and the second during the middle of senator fraziers speech the third live quorum call was demanded just prior to the final speech of the debate made by senator maloney in favor of the nomination the vote to confirm douglas was 624 with 30 senators not voting 24 g23g151g138g151g146g150g152g158g156g561g5g152g151g156g142g151g157g561g3g144g155g142g142g150

agreements agreements where senators agree to limit their rights to debate and take procedural actions so it should come as surprise that these agreements have also been key elements in the consideration of nominations in this era from about 1968 to the present unanimous consent agreements have been reached that typically provide for when the senate will take up nominations limit and structure the debate and in many instances provide for final confirmation vote these agreements allow the senate leadership to move to consider nomination at time and in way they desire instead of waiting until the nomination is reached on the calendar in fact majority leaders began to ask unanimous consent to go into executive session to consider specific supreme court nomination this proceeding had been used as early as 1959 for the consideration of the nomination of potter stewart and it was the method used for example when majority leader mike mansfield called up harry blackmun for senate floor consideration in 1970 according to later precedent of the senate motion to go into executive session to consider specific nomination is not debatable though the nomination itself is 25 another change also took place roughly around th same time the senate began to decide the question of confirmation by roll call votes routinely since 1967 indeed the senate has evidently come to consider it appropriate always to take roll call votes on supreme court nominations typically nominations during this period have also received longer floor consideration than in any previous period further characteristic of the modern era is the advent of cloture the senate cloture rule which permits supermajority to limit the time for consideration of matter by roll call vote did not exist until 1917 and could not be applied to nominations until 1949 since then supporters have attempted to use the motion to impose limits on the consideration of only three supreme court nominations cloture was successful on one of the three nominations the 1986 nomination of william h rehnquist to chief justice in 1971 rehnquist had been confirmed despite the failure of cloture vote on his nomination in 1968 the senate failed to get cloture on the motion to 24 associate justice of the supreme court of the united states remarks in senate congressional record vol 84 apr 3 and 4 1939 pp

1971 to replace retiring justice john marshall harlan rehnquist had been assistant attorney general for two years and was well known on capitol hill but opponents contended that he had shown insufficient commitment to civil rights and civil liberties 26 the judiciary committee held five days of hearings on the rehnquist nomination and opponents delayed the committee vote on recommending the nomination to the full senate week the committee voted 124 to report the nomination favorably the nomination was debated on the senate floor for five days motion to invoke cloture and limit debate on the nomination failed on the fifth day by vote of 5242 at that time twothirds vote was required to succeed motion that consideration of the nomination be postponed until midjanuary was defeated by vote of 2270 the senate then agreed by unanimous consent to take vote on the nomination at 5 pm that day rehnquist was confirmed by vote of 6826 subsequently in 1986 he was confirmed as chief justice of the united states by senate vote of 6533 after proceedings in which cloture was invoked 27

in terms of wide variety of different characteristics the present study focuses chiefly on three that are readily identifiable and often referred to the kind of vote or other action by which the senate disposed of the nominations the amount of time the senate spent considering them on the floor and the kinds of procedural action that occurred during their consideration each of these represents salient element of the procedural context in which nomination is considered an understanding of the variety of forms that proceedings can take in each of these dimensions may help to illuminate practical concerns about courses of action that might occur on given nomination focus on these three characteristics seems appropriate also because each might afford an indication of the amount of controversy conten tion or opposition that surrounds nomination 26 glen elasser rehnquist assailed as segregationist chicago tribune nov 10 1971 p 5 spencer rich rehnquist civil liberties

after single day of consideration during which procedural actions occur one might reasonably conclude that it involved little opposition or controversy as the following discussion indicates however none of these three characteristics of consideration can simply be equated with the level of controversy g8g152g155g150g156g561g152g143g561g6g146g156g153g152g156g146g157g146g152g151g561

in the broadest terms the senate confirmed 122 and failed to confirm the remaining 36 this breakdown however conflates the 11 nominati ons that the senate affirmatively rejected with the 25 on which final vote occurred further the 25 without final vote include 12 that never received floor consideration at all and 13 that were called up but on which the senate never finished action clarifying the meaning and implications of various forms of disposition requires examining each of these subgroups g16g152g150g146g151g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g5g152g151g143g146g155g150g142g141g561 the 122

38 of confirmations by roll call in earlier periods of american history both voice and roll call votes occurred but as noted in the preceding section in recent decades roll calls have become universal the closest vote by which nomination was confirmed was that of matthews 18812 by 2423 other close votes to confirm include those for thomas 1991 by 5248 lamar 1888 by 32 28 and clifford 1857 by 2623

final vote all 11 of these rejections occurred on roll calls the senate has never rejected nominee by voice vote as with confirmations these 11 rejections occurred at points scattered throughout american history the earliest was rutledge for chief justice in 1795 the most recent bork in 1987 borks was also the nomination rejected by the widest margin 4258 the closest was that of parker 1930 who was rejected by 3941 the median margin of defeat however has been nine votes only in one instance spencer 18442 has president resubmitted nomination the senate had previously rejected and then not

on every supreme court nomination presented to it these 25 nominations fall into two groups 1 13 on which the senate initiated floor action but never completed it and 2 12 that never reached the floor at all for purposes of this report all formal proceedings in the full senate in relation to nomination once it was available for floor consideration were counted as floor action for example nomination was treated as receiving floor action even if the senate never actually proceeded to its consideration but did decline to grant unanimous consent to do so 29 overall accordingly the senate has taken some floor action on 92 of all nominations submitted and proceeded to final vote on 84 g16g152g561g8g149g152g152g155g561g3g140g157g146g152g151g561 the 12 occasions on which the senate has failed to bring nomination to the floor have also been scattered throughout history the circumstances of their occurrence have varied as well five of the 12 were submitted quite late in session so that the senate may simply have lacked time to act six others were withdrawn before floor consideration could commence including instances from paterson in 1793 first nomination to miers in 2005 the last of the 12 stanbery 1866 became moot because congress reduced the size of the court thereby abolishing the vacancy this distribution of conditions for the lack of floor action suggests that the senate has exhibited little tendency to leave supreme court nominations without final vote simply out of reluctance to act or to use inaction as an indirect means of denying confirmation four of the five nominations late in session and two of the six withdrawn were later resubmitted usually at the following session and the senate proceeded to final vote on each of the resubmitted nominations the other four withdrawn nominations were never resubmitted overall as result only two of these 12 nominations continued to be available to the senate and yet never received floor action these included one of the late nominations and the one that became moot these circumstances also indicate that the simple absence of floor consideration cannot be taken to imply that the senate found the nomination less than acceptable of the five nominations in this group that were later resubmitted the senate confirmed four rejecting only one in addition at least some of the withdrawals evidently occurred for reasons unrelated to senate sentiment about the nomination paterson 17931 for example who was among those later resubmitted and confirmed was initially withdrawn only becaus he was constitutionally ineligible to sit on the court at that point as he had previously been elected to senate term that had not yet expired and during which the salary of the justices had been increased the nomination of roberts 20051 was withdrawn because the president decided to nominate him instead for the post of chief justice which became available subsequent to his original submission of the roberts nomination 30 among nominations not resubmitted thornberrys 1968 was withdrawn simply because his vacancy was eliminated by the failure of concurrent nomination of sitting justice to be chief justice the late nomination of micou 1853 presents more ambiguous case but the immediate 29 the use of this inclusive criterion of floor action accounts for certain small differences between the figures presented here

who originally submitted it had left office on other nominations in this group circumstances suggest that the senates inaction did reflect the presence of opposition most clearly the congressional action to abolish stanberys vacancy 1866 appears to reveal emphatic objection to his nomination31 also after hornblowers initial nomination received action late in session 18931 the senate rejected his renomination outright in the case of spencer the senate had already rejected the nomination once before the president later resubmitted and withdrew it on the same day 1844 32 there also appears reason to conclude that the withdrawals of both cushing 1874 and miers 2005 represent responses to expressed opposition33

table 2 summarize the preceding discussion of how the senate has disposed of supreme court nominations showing th at the senate has confirmed more than three quarters of all nominations submitted to it and more than nine of every ten on which it voted indeed as the middle columns show the senate s confirmed almost half of all supreme court nominations ever submitted to it without even requiring roll call vote roll calls on the other hand have by means been uncommon occurring on three of every seven final votes including every one since 1967 neither the type nor the outcome of vote in itself can be taken as affording clear indication of the extent of the opposition nomination may have generated in particular although voice vote may reasonably be viewed as failing to indicate the presence of opposition it could be rash to presume that it demonstrates an absence of opposition 36 conversely although roll call vote may reflect the presence of extensive opposition it may also occur when such level of opposition is present in the years since 1968 eight of the 18 roll calls have registered fewer than four votes more broadly as table 2 shows almost half of all roll call votes on supreme court nominations throughout history have involved fewer than 10 votes in opposition 36 salient example is provided by the confirmation of goldberg in 1962 when one senator explicitly asked to be recorded in opposition even though the senate was acting by voice vote httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33247 g561 g5g20g21g556g343g350g561t able 2 dispositions of supr eme cour t nominations t ypes of v ote

threshold for the presence of significant opposition permits more meaningful judgment of the significance of these data on the disposition of nominations37 by this standard 24 of the 49 roll calls by which nominations were confirmed revealed significant opposition combining these 24 nominations with the 11 that were rejected it may be said that just 35 of the senates 133 votes on confirmation indicated the presence of significant opposition by incorporating nominations that received final vote into this approach unified account may be given of what different outcomes on these nominations mean the earlier discussion of nominations that received floor action but fina l vote suggested that this outcome typically reflected the presence of opposition the discussion of nominations that received floor action on the other hand concluded that this outcome has come about on different occasions both when significant opposition was present and not accordingly this disposition cannot in itself be taken as an indicator of either circumstance the results of these considerations are summarized in the righthand columns of table 2 its figures include the 13 nominations on which floor action failed to result in final vote as cases that indicate significant opposition but treat the 12 that never reached the floor as instances that permit definite conclusion about opposition with these inclusions the classification yields total of 48 nominations with dispositions that imply significant opposition 38 from this perspective accordingly it can be held that just about twothirds of the 146 supreme court nominations reaching the senate floor have met more than scattered opposition g14g142g151g144g157g145g561g152g143g561g8g149g152g152g155g561g3g140g157g146g152g151g561

receive on the floor as with forms of disposition of course length of consideration can be established only for those nominations on which consideration occurs accordingly the data discussed in this section again reflect only the 146 nominations that reached the floor the length of consideration of supreme court nominations is identified in table 3 in terms of the number of calendar days on which action took place on the nomination on the senate floor39 in general each day was counted on which any formal procedural action in relation to nomination occurred even if the nomination itself was not formally under consideration on that day for 37 in early days when the senate was much smaller fewer than 10 negative votes might still have represented significant level of opposition in practice however the rough standard proposed may reasonably be applied to all periods because until 1870 all nominations op posed by fewer than 14 senators were opposed by fewer than five 38 alternatively the 12 nominations without floor action might be incorporated into the classification on the basis of the individual circumstances identified in their earlier discussion the observations offered there suggest that five of the 12 might be taken as representing responses to opposition the addition of these five would result in counting 53 nominations with significant opposition out of total of 158 or 36 result but slightly different from that displayed for only those nominations that reached the floor 39 more detailed measure such as the number of hours consumed would have been impracticable to compile especially for the years before 1929 when the senate typically did all executive business in closed session number of days however could be readily and definitively ascertained from the executive journal

nomination was offered or debated even if the motion was defeated or was not adopted until the following day otherwise for example all senate floor action on the fortas nomination for chief justice 1968 which occurred in its entirety pending motion to proceed to consider the nomination would not be counted on the other hand days were not counted on which senators made individual speeches in relation to nomination but the senate did not formally have it under consideration on the floor as happened extensively for example on the rehnquist nomination for associate justice 1971 the data presented accordingly are more precisely described as presenting the length of floor action than of formal consideration or of debate in compiling these data however few actions were treated as exceptions to the standard just identified especially during the first half of the 19 th century for example the senate commonly referred newly received nominations to committee through action taken on the floor in more recent times the senate has sometimes reached unanimous consent agreement setting terms for consideration of nomination in advance of any actual consideration when either such action was the only one taken in relation to nomination on given day the day was not counted as day of consideration contrary practice would tend to overstate the length of consideration of these nominations relative to others to which the senate actually devoted similar time but on which similar actions occurred on the same day as further steps rather than on preceding day

single day sufficient for floor action on nearly twothirds of all the nominations submitte d although this form of action has ceased to be the norm in the years since 1967 for nominations receiving

more extended consideration given to this relative handful of nominations may rest on variety of causes assessment of their nature is likely to begin from the well understood circumstance that opponents of matter in the senate may engage in extended debate as means of delaying or blocking final action 40 accordingly it might be natural to take the extent of floor action as an indicator of the intensity of opposition to nomination and specifically of the determination with which opponents attempted to delay its confirmation such supposition might be supported by the observation that none of the six nominations receiving more than five days consideration was confirmed other considerations however also may be pertinent it may be significant for example that four of the 15 nominations considered for more than three days were for chief justice it may plausibly be supposed that the senate has generally tended to find these nominations as necessitating more sustained consideration more broadly the senate may well have been likely to devote more time to nominations that were considered particularly important for example to the balance or future course of the court in addition the data in table 3 also suggest trend toward longer consideration in more recent times although extended consideration was not unheard of even in very early years eg wolcott 1811 and crittenden 1828 seven of the 10 nominations receiving more than four days consideration occurred in 1968 or later beginning with the fortas nomination for chief justice this trend may be associated as much with generally observable developments in the way the senate handles its business as with any specific increase in controversy over nominations to the court these considerations suggest that the occurrence of extended consideration on supreme court nominations cannot in itself be taken as reliable indicator of strong opposition not only may extended consideration occur for other reasons but it is also not necessarily the case that even determined opponents have always expressed their position by attempting to protract proceedings on the other hand lengthy consideration may reasonably be viewed as sign of the possibility that opposition may have been present correspondingly although the completion of consideration on single day cannot be taken to demonstrate an absence of opposition it may appropriately be viewed more cautiously as failing to afford evidence that significant opposition was present 40 these possibilities are discussed in more detail in crs report rl30360

distinguishable not only in terms of the means of disposition and the length of time consumed but also by the procedural actions that may occur in the course of consideration as with these other characteristics of floor action procedural actions can be identified only for the 146 nominations that reached the floor table 4 lists various forms of procedural action that have occurred in the course of senate floor consideration on these nominations and how often each has appeared it shows that single procedure was used on more than about one in seven of the supreme court nominations reaching the floor but also that halfdozen different procedures were used at least half that often single procedure either stands out as especially characteristic of proceedings on these nominations or clearly id entifies any distinctive subgroup among them instead floor proceedings on supreme court nominations are more readily categorized in this respect simply in terms of whether or not any procedural actions at all occurred beyond those required in the course of consideration itself throughout history floor action on supreme court nominations has most often remained procedurally simple in this sense proceedings on 78 of the 146 nominations were procedurally simple in the sense of involving optional procedural actions the remaining 68 nominations 47 of the total may be identified in this minimal sense as procedurally complex procedurally complex nominations might be further distinguished in several ways such as by the number of procedural actions that occurred in the course of floor action or the extent to which procedural actions were applied to other proce dural actions eg motion to table motion to postpone more readily applicable criterion for this purpose however is whether any of the procedural actions taken resulted in roll call vote again as table 4 shows procedural roll calls occurred on 26 of the 68 nominations on which any optional procedures were used 18 of the total 146 nominations on which floor action occurred this further distinction affords rough indicator of the intensity with which procedural action was pursued for some kinds of optional procedure used in relation to supreme court nominations the principal effect would have been to expedite rather than delay consideration these included chiefly 1 actions taken either by motion or unanimous consent to proceed to consider nomination on the same day reported and 2 consent agreements assuring final vote either by limiting debate or setting time certain that were reached before consideration began or on its first day in order to examine the potential use of optional procedures as means of pursuing opposition to supreme court nominations it is appropriate to exclude these forms of action from consideration the second column of table 4 presents count of optional procedures that could potentially have been used for purposes of delay or opposition using this criterion 88 of the total 146 nominations reaching the floor 60 may be said to have been subject to optional procedures that could have had the effect of delaying or terminating consideration this percentage is comparable to the 62 of nominations that faced significant opposition and the 68 that received action on only single day as with those other characteristics of consideration it would not be appropriate to take the absence of procedural complexity as demonstrating the absence of opposition it could reasonably be said nevertheless that when nominations involve procedural complexity positive inference may be drawn from the procedural features of consideration that opposition or contention was present

procedural roll calls cannot be regarded as sufficient in itself to demonstrate the presence of opposition or contention but may reasonably be taken as cause to think that such opposition may have been present the occurrence of optional procedural actions is also related to the occasions previously detailed in table 1 on which nominations reached the floor but failed to reach final vote on confirmation in 12 of the 13 cases of incomplete consideration listed in table 1 some optional procedural action was the last one that occurred and had the effect of terminating consideration in order

cases by the procedural context in which the action is undertaken and in particular on whether it is integral to or divergent from the routine practice of the time procedural context changes from case to case normal practice also has changed over the course of senate history and in some cases the prescribed effect of procedural actions has changed as well accordingly the potential significance of optional procedural actions may be clarified by reference to some of the points initially developed in the section on historical trends for this purpose it is useful to look separately at actions that affect how the senate has taken up nominations and those that can occur in the course of consideration g5g138g149g149g146g151g144g561g23g153g561g16g152g150g146g151g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 the senate has always taken up nominations under procedures governing action in executive session separate from those regulating legislative action although occasionally by unanimous consent it has considered nomination as in ex ecutive session without actually going into an executive session it appears that for most of its history from 1789 through 1967 the normal practice of the senate was to take up each nomination automatically when it was reached in the consideration of executive business in order to be eligible for consideration under this procedure nomination apparently had to have become available for floor action at least one day previously initially nominations became available when received from the president after 1835 when nominations to the supreme court began routinely to be referred to committee they normally became available for consideration when reported after about 1922 it appears this proceeding was formalized as call of the calendar of nominations sometimes however by unanimous consent the senate has taken up nomination on the same day reported or submitted as previously noted in fact this proceeding was used for nearly half of all nominations reaching the floor 18 of 41 from 1868 to 1922 departure from these routine forms of proceeding occurred before 1835 when the nominations of taney and barbour though eligible for the normal procedures were called up instead by roll call vote on motion to proceed to consider complications of similar kind were faced by badger in 1853 when the senate was unable to reach vote on motion to proceed and by black in 1861 when the senate defeated motion to proceed on roll call vote during roughly this same perio d however 18441874 motions to proceed to consider were also offered on seven other nominations that were eligible for normal consideration but the senate adopted these motions in short order and by voice vote

attempted to bring the nomination to the floor through special order providing that it proceed to consideration on specified later day the senate ultimately adopted special order of this kind for badger by voice vote but never accepted one for black on five supreme court nominations thereafter through 1930 the senate used unanimous consent to establish special orders of this kind these special orders represent forerunners of the contemporary practice of reaching agreements in advance by unanimous consent to take matter up in these earlier times however special orders seem to have been used for these nominations only in unusual circumstances to overcome difficulties in bringing matter to the floor and their effect was to put off its consideration until after the point at which it would normally have come up another form of action that indicated an attempt to delay consideration appeared on four scattered occasions before 1967 when an attempt to call nomination up on the same day it was reported or submitted was prevented by objection more definite though still only temporary form of delay was imposed on five nominations during this period all after 1880 each of which was passed over for consideration at least once upon demand of senator when reached in its normal order from 1968 on the call of the calendar of nominations fell into disuse for the consideration of supreme court nominations and different set of practices for initiating floor action on these nominations has become standard all but one of the 18 nominations that have reached the floor since that time did so pursuant to request for unanimous consent that the senate proceed to consider it for nine nominations this consent agreement provided for immediate consideration for the remaining eight it provided like the earlier special orders for consideration to begin at some future date in addition some of these consent agreements provided for the senate not only to take up the nomination but to go into executive session for the purpose and some also limited debate or set time certain for final vote whether or not they included these additional provisions however these agreements represent routine proceeding for taking up the nomination and fail to suggest any potential diff iculties in bringing it to the floor the only nomination in this recent period to experience difficulty at the point of calling up has been that of fortas in 1968 on which motion to proceed to co nsider was found necessary and could not be brought to vote

procedures for the consideration of nominations and of legislation to the same extent that they do for calling up business of the two kinds the most evident differences between the two forms of proceedings may be that nominations of course cannot be amended otherwise most of the same procedural mechanisms used for legislative business are also available on nominations g343g349g350g351g556g343g350g345g347g561 the use of optional procedures of any kind during consideration was initially rare occurring on only five of the 31 nominations reaching the floor before 1835 motions to postpone temporarily however were used as early as 1795 motions to commit with instructions by 1811 and motions to table by 1826 sometimes again as already noted motion to postpone or table was offered at the point when the senate was just proceeding to consider nomination so that they might in these instances have been treated as part of the proceedings for calling up nominations in order to treat each motion in consistent way however the present discussion views all of them as

occasionally as well action with effect similar to one of these motions also was proposed by resolution for example the senate several times entertained resolution that it postpone or table nomination until enactment of legislation reorganizing the circuit courts which could have the effect of eliminating the nominees vacancy or one that directed committee to investigate nominee further but did not formally recommit the nomination table 4 includes these proceedings in the count of corresponding motions in most instances during this period when motions to postpone commit or table were offered the senate adopted them by voice vote at that time adoption of motion to table evidently did not have the effect of final negative dispositi on as it does today but only of putting off action for the time being the normal effect of adopting any of these motions accordingly was only to delay further action by taking the nomination off the floor temporarily the only exception to this pattern occurred in 1828 when adoption by roll call of resolution postponing the crittenden nomination until after circuit court reorganization effectively terminated consideration of the nomination g343g350g345g347g556g343g350g346g347g561 during the decade between 1835 and 1845 by contrast with earlier years only five of the 16 supreme court nominations that reached the floo r were considered without the intervention of optional procedures the procedures used continued to include only motions to postpone commit and table but the consequences of their use became more varied some of these motions continued to be adopted by voice vote but others were either adopted or rejected on roll call votes adoption by voice vote may most likely suggest that supporters of the nomination may have been using the motion either to gain time or for routine purposes of agenda management rejection by roll call suggests that the motions may have been offered by opponents seeking to bring about delays in consideration either of these results however normally permitted consideration to continue especially when one of these motions was adopted by roll call on the other hand it often had the effect of terminating consideration before an upordown vote could occur in 1835 the senate tabled resolution to postpone the taney nomination until circuit court reorganization then adopted motion to postpone it indefinitely in 1844 the senate tabled president tylers nominations of walworth and king by roll call nd in the following year it did the same to their renominations by voice vote the motion to postpone indefinitely has the explicit purpose of terminating consideration but under the practice of the time similar consequence followed from adopting the motions to table only because the senate did not choose to resume their consideration it appears highly likely that in taking these actions the senate understood that leaving consideration unfinished was their proponents intent and would be their practical effect g343g350g346g347g556g343g350g351g342g561 in the decades after 1845 political circumstances varied widely but the overall incidence of procedural complexity on supreme court nominati ons declined although not to early levels solid majority of the nominations reaching the floor between 1845 and 1890 20 of 31 experienced optional procedural action at all after being called up this figure however includes the five nominations confirmed during the civil war when any substantial opposition to the administration was absent from the senate

used on supreme court nominations except that because initial committee referral had become routine the motion to recommit largely replaced the motion to commit these three motions also continued to have similar range of consequences in 1870 however resolution was offered to lay two supreme court nominations on the table until congress completed circuit court reorganization and this proved to be the last occasion on which an attempt was made in the senate to table such nomination the senate accordingly has never attempted to use this motion on supreme court nominations during the era when it would have the effect of final negative disposition the motions to postpone and recommit on the other hand continued to be used through 1890 in ways similar to those appearing previously beginning in 1853 as well the senate also started to use motions to adjourn with the effect or apparent intent of putting off consideration of supreme court nomination 41 on the badger nomination in 1853 the motion was adopted by roll call vote thereafter such motion was offered on six other nominations through 1889 on one occasion it was adopted by voice vote but otherwise roll call always rejected it after 1890 this form of optional procedure fell out of use except for one occasion on hughes for chief justice in 1930 when roll call rejected motion to recess for brief period beginning in 1870 motions to reconsider vote to confirm also appeared the first such motion on strong in 1870 was withdrawn after three days debate and the failure of motion to postpone it the second on harlan in 1877 never reached vote the last on woods in 1880 was tabled by roll call after quorum failed on an initial roll call on the motion itself after this third unsuccessful attempt the senate abandoned use of this motion in this context as well neither of the motions newly coming into use in this period was ever used with the effect of terminating consideration the three motions that had continued to appear since earlier times on the other hand were still occasionally used with this effect the bradford nomination was tabled in 1852 and received further action and the badger nomination in the following year was postponed until date after congress was to adjourn in 1873 the williams nomination became the only one on which recommittal ever terminated consideration on only one subsequent occasion fortas 1968 see below has the senate ever again resorted to optional procedural actions to terminate action on supreme court nomination short of an upor down vote with this one exception accordingly such terminations came about only in the half century from 1828 through 1873 this period included not only the nine nominations on which floor action was terminated before vote through optional procedures during consideration but also the two on which this effect followed from senate action on motion to proceed to consider 42 as already suggested in the case of the tabled tyler nominations it appears likely that in these instances even when the procedures used did not in themselves definitively terminate consideration the senate understood in using them that this would be their practical effect 41 routine adjournments and recesses by voice vote or unanimous consent most of which occurred outside executive session in any case were not taken into account for this purpose 42 it also included the single case in which consideration lapsed without vote in the absence of any procedural action read 1845 see table 1

frequency of optional procedural action during consideration declined further from then through 1967 such action appeared on just 14 of the 50 nominations that reached the floor additional shifts also occurred in the forms of procedural action used these shifts amounted principally to substantial decline in the use of motions that required vote of the senate and an increasing resort instead to live quorum calls which can be demanded by single senator and unanimous consent agreements which require the absence of objection by any single senator although the votable motions could potentially be used in ways that would have the effect of terminating consideration such result was not likely from either of the procedures newly coming into use in this context early in this period the senate continued to adopt motions to recommit and to postpone by voice vote and to reject them by roll call after 1930 however these motions became more unusual and the motion to adjourn ceased to be used at all in this context motion to recommit or postpone has been offered on just four nominations since 1930 most recently in 1971 on rehnquist for associate justice and all have been rejected on roll calls the motions to reconsider and to adjourn as noted above had already become disused on these matters the former perhaps because the senate now routinely tables the motion immediately after every successful action beginning with the stone nomination for associ ate justice in 1925 live quorum calls came to be used with some regularity during consideration although single such call had already occurred once previously on the woods nomination of 1880 at least 10 such calls each were demanded on the hughes and parker nominations in 1930 this procedure can be used to incur certain amount of delay even if it succeeds in producing quorum although only once in the consideration of parker did such call ever result in the actual failure of quorum after 1930 live quorum calls occurred on seven more nominations most recently in 1971 but more than three times on any single nomination the unanimous consent agreements that are to be taken into account in this connection include only those that assured the ability of the senate to reach final vote on nomination usually by setting either time certain for the vote or an overall limit on the time for debate 43 such an agreement was first reached for brewer 1889 but appeared on just three other nominations between then and 1967 three of these four agreements were reached either in advance of consideration or on its first day and accordingly appear likely to represent consensual arrangements to facilitate consideration the fourth agreement by contrast on parker in 1930 was not reached until the seventh day of consideration and so appears more likely to represent response to attempts to delay or extend consideration g343g351g348g350g556g18g155g142g156g142g151g157g561 from 1968 onward however consent agreements became the standard means of regulating consideration of supreme court nominations as they increasingly did for other major matters such agreements appeared on 15 of the 19 nominations to reach the floor after that date and six 43 consent agreements providing that the senate proceed to consider nomination at subsequent point were addressed in the previous section on calling up nominations agreements that involved both features are counted in both groups and considered separately under both heads

consideration many of these agreements on the other hand may have represented collegial arrangements rather than attempts to overcome any difficulties in consideration especially inasmuch as on 10 of the 15 nominations in question the consent agreement was the only optional procedural action taken overall indeed consideration of 14 of the 19 nominations reaching the floor since 1968 involved optional procedural actions other than the consent agreement on the remaining five of these 19 recent nominations the only optional procedures used were to postpone once to recommit once and for cloture the motion for cloture which allows supermajority to limit the time for consideration of matter started to be used on supreme court nominations at about the same time as consent agreements became routine as explained in the section on historical trends in floor considera tion this motion did not become available for use on nominations until 1949 it was not used on any nomination however until 1968 when the senate rejected cloture on motion to proceed to consider the fortas nomination for chief justice and thereafter abandoned action on the nomination this action represented the only time since 1873 when the senate terminated floor action on supreme court nomination short of an upor down vote subsequently cloture was moved also on the two rehnquist nominations as shown in the case study presented above on the 1971 nomination for associate justice the motion failed but consent agreement was subsequently reached that permitted the senate to reach vote on confirmation on the 1986 nomination for chief justice the senate invoked cloture the first time it had done so on supreme court nomination cloture was invoked also on the fourth supreme court nomination on which it was moved

disposition and length of consideration the significance of procedural complexity is more difficult to ascertain than is its occurrence the preceding discussion shows that on some occasions optional procedures may have been used routinely with the apparent purpose of managing the flow of business and with potential effect only of expediting action on other occasions optional procedures may have been used as means of delaying consideration or even placing obstacles in the way of final disposition in cases when the occurrence of optional procedural action resulted in consideration being terminated before final vote for example it might reasonably be conjectured that the procedural action in question could have been undertaken with the intent of brin ging about this result it is equally reasonable to suppose that similar actions undertaken on other nominations may at least sometimes have reflected similar intentions even if the results did not successfully fulfill those intentions definitive conclusions of course might be drawn about the purpose of optional procedural actions in any specific case in the absence of information about the intentions of senators undertaking them even to offer inferences about specific occasions on which such intentions were present would require examination of the political and historical circumstances surrounding each nomination task beyond both the scope and the purpose of this report the preceding discussion nevertheless permits some assessment about which optional procedures may have afforded the possibility of delaying consideration or forestalling final vote and accordingly which of them might in principle have been used in some instances for such purpose as with the level of opposition manifested in the final vote and the length of floor action it is plausible to consider the occurrence of procedural actions or procedural roll calls as an indication that contention or controversy may have been present but it is insufficient to demonstrate that substantial contentiousness actually was present at most it may be appropriate

three indicators examined in this part of the report may be taken as definitive demonstration of the presence or absence of controversy is substantiated by the observation that these three criteria do not always identify the same nominations as possibly controversial on the other hand substantial overlap does exist among the nominations picked out by each indicator this circumstance suggests that more reliable and comprehensive measure of the level of controversy on each nomination might be derived from simultaneous consideration of all three indicators together such an analysis however is
