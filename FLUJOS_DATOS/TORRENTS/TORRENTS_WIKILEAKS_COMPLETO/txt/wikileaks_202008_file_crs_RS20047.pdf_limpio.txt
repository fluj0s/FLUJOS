consumers crs report 97697 by pauline smale background the electronic funds transfer eft initiative is part of the debt collection improvement act of 1996 that law pl 104134 was enacted on april 26 1996 the act is part of an ongoing effort to reduce the cost of government the eft initiative requires all federal payments excluding irs tax refunds to be made electro nically by january 1999 this requirement is commonly referred to as eft99 the law provided the treasury with the authority to define exception categories and grant hardship waivers the implementation of eft99 will have significant impact on companies that do business with the government consumers federal agencies and financial institutions the focus of this report is on the development of the waiver provisions for individu recipients the federal governments chief disburser is the financial management service fms bureau of the treasury department the fms issues over 850 million payments each year totaling more than 1 trillion payments are disbursed under variety of federal programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20047crs2 including social security department of vetera ns affairs compensation and pension civil service retirement and disabilit federal wages and salaries supplemental security income railroad retirement board and black lung disability payments eft99 requires the treasury to develop implementing regulations the treasury does have the authority to delay implementation if an acceptable program is not in place by january 1999 in addition the department was provided with the authority to grant waivers based on recipient hardship or where otherwise necessary striking balance between taxpayer cost savin gs from electronic payments and protecting the payment recipient from disruption or hardship has proven difficult challenge to the treasury the focus of this report is on the development of the final waiver provisions that are included in eft99 regulations the treasury and federal agencies have been working for years to educate and convince consumers to accept and use electronic direct deposit for federal payments direct deposit as method of payment increases transaction security reduces opportunities for crime improves payment timeframes and saves the treasury and therefore the taxpayer money the treasury estimates the average cost of issuing paper check at 43 cents while the average eft payment costs less than 2 cents the fms estimates that electronic payment could save the federal government as much as 100 million year in processing and postage costs for many individual recipients of federal payments eft99 will require little if any adjustment as of october 1998 74 of social security payments and 72 of all fms disbursements were being made electronically the acceptance and use of electronic technology in banking and retailing has grown rapidly over the last decade future recipients are thought likely to be familiar with direct deposit as well as other eft systems and consequently will readily accept electronic deposit of their federal payments major challenge to the treasury department came from trying to accommodate two segments of the consumer recipient population those having special needs that could be disadvantaged by the transition to electronic payments and the unbanked individuals without relationship with depository financial institution an estimated 18 percent of all federal benefit recipients 10 million individuals are unbanked those qualifying as special needs recipients could include the elderly individuals with physical mental educational or language barriers lowincome individuals homeless veterans and those living in remote or rural communities the unbanked and special needs populations overlap prior to rulemaking the fms actively sought input from consumer groups and organizations on potential parameters for waiver policy in developing waiver policy the treasury worked closely with the federal agencies operating benefit programs to address key policy questions comments were also solicited from payment recipients the fms gained insight on waiver concerns from the interim rule issued in july 1996 as required by phase one of eft99 the interim rule required new recipients eligible for federal payments after july 25 1996 to receive the payment by electronic fund transfer the requirement could be waived if the individual recipient certifies in writing that he or she does not have an account at financial institution during the following year approximately 85 of all new social security annuitants had signed up for direct deposithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20047crs3 waiver policy provisions of eft99 require the treasury department to implement the law in two phases phase one began on july 26 1996 with the interim rule covering new payment recipients phase two requires all federal payments other than tax refunds to be made electronically by january 1 1999 the treasury does have the authority to delay implementation if an acceptable eft program is not in place the stated goal of the governments chief disburser is to issue payments by method that will provide the best service to recipients the lowest possible cost to taxpayers and the greatest degree of security the treasury actively solicited input on all aspects of potential eft99 regulation from individuals consumer organizations government agencies financial institutions and nonbank financial service providers establishing the scope of waiver guidelines involved difficult policy questions and concerns in september 1997 the treasury issued proposed regulations and opened 90day comment period the proposed rule did contain waiver provisions but did not contain new account options for the unbanked the treasury announced it was still working on the development of lowcost account in addition the treasury stated that the new accounts would be called etas electronic transfer accounts and that the etas would be offered through financial institutions the january 1999 deadline for full compliance was extended until the etas are available or january 2000 whichever is earlier the fms issued fact sheet on the proposed rulemaking which outlined the waiver provisions first individual recipients who began receiving federal payments before july 26 1996 could request waiver if they certify that payment by eft will impose hardship due to physical disability or geographic barrier second individual recipients who certified that they do not have an account with financial institution and that payment by eft would impose hardship due to physical disabilit geographic barrier or financial hardship could request waiver finally electronic payments would not be required in cases such as military deployment threats to national security or certain situations where eft is impractical during the 90 day comment period the treasury received over 200 letters many of them critical of the waiver provisions congressional concerns were expressed during oversight hearings held in september 25 1997 before the full house banking committee and on march 4 1998 before the subcommittee on financial institutions and consumer credit the treasury department received additional feedback when it held series of hearings in four cities dallas new york baltimore and angeles in general critics of the waiver provisions stated the criteria should be broader and more flexible specifically they argued that waiver guidelines should include mental disabilities literacy problems and language barriers concern was expressed for elderly recipients who might not be comfortable with the technology involved with an electronic transfer program and the possibility of having to access funds through atms automated teller machines in addition various spokesmen felt the financial hardship waiver should apply to all recipients not just the unbanked consumer advocates have acknowledged that electronic delivery is safer and more reliable means of payment at the same time they state that aggressive education programs and the structure of the electronic transfer accounts will be crucial to the success of eft99 particularly for lowincome elderlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20047crs4 1 us congress house committee on banking and financial services review of proposed regulations to implement eft 99 hearing 105th congress 1st session sept 25 1997 washington gpo 1997 316 p 2 information on the proposed features of the eta can be found on the treasurys eft web site httpwwwfmstreasgoveftand unbanked recipients in the meantime they argued that broad waiver policy would aid in the transition to more fully implemented electronic initiative1 on september 25 1998 the treasury published final rule implementing provisions of eft99 the regulation establishes broad waiver policy emphasizing consumer choice waivers are available for individuals who receive federal payments recipient is eligible for waiver based on financial hardship if the cost of receiving an electronic payment is more than receiving paper check in addition any recipient with physical or mental disability or geographic language or literacy barrier is eligible for waiver the final rule lists other circumstances where electronic payments will not be required included on the list are reasons such as military deployment threats to national security or certain situations where electronic payment is impractical finally any unbanked recipient will receive an automatic waiver until the treasury establishes the lowcost etas when the account becomes available these individuals can choose between that option and continuing to receive paper check the final rule makes the lowcost eta available to all individual recipients of federal payments regardless of whether they have an account at financial institution the eft99 regulati on makes waivers solely self certifying individual payment recipients will make decision to choose direct deposit and if they do not sign for electronic payments they will continue to receive pape r check federal agencies must notify all check recipients and newly eligible recipients of their options on november 23 1998 the treasury published for comment the proposed characteristi cs of the lowcost eta2 the public comment period on the proposed features closed on january 7 1999 the treasury has issued variety
