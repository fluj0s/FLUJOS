requires epa to set healthbased standards for ambient air quality sets deadlines for the achievement of those standards by state and local governments and requires epa to set national emission standards for large or ubiquit ous sources of air pollution including motor vehicles power plants and other industrial sources in addition the act mandates emission c ontrols for sources of 188 haza

epa derive primarily from dozen majo r environmental statutes this report provides concise summary of one of those statutes the cl ean air act it provides very brief history of fe deral involvement in air qua lity regulation and of the provisions added by legislation in 1970 1977 and 1990 it explains major authorities contained in the act it defines key terms and it lists references for more detailed information on the act and its implementation while this report attempts to present th essence of the act it is necessarily incomplete many details nd secondary provisions are mitted in additi on the report describes the statute rgely without discussing its implementation statutory deadlines to control emissions and achie ve particular mandates have often been missed as result of delayed standardsetting by epa delayed action on implementation by states and local governme nts or law suits brought by interested parties other crs products including crs report rl33776 clean air act issues in the 110th congress implementation and oversight and more than dozen crs reports discuss implementation concerns and current issues readers interested in more comprehensive discussion of the hist ory of the act are re ferred to crs report 8334 enr environmental protection an histor ical review of the legislation and programs of the environmental protection agency available from james mccarthy overview the clean air act codified as 42 usc 7401 et seq seeks to protect human health and the environment from emissions th at pollute ambient or outdoor air it requires the environmental protection agency to establish minimum national standards for air quality and assigns primary responsibility to the states to assure compliance with the standards areas not meeting the standards referred to as nonattainment areas are required to implement speci fied air pollution control measures the act establishes federal sta ndards for mobile sources of air pollution and their fuels for sources of 188 hazardous air pollutants and for the emissions that cause acid rain it establishes comprehensive permit system for all major sources of air pollution it also addresses the prev ention of pollution in areas with clean air and protection of the st ratospheric ozone layerhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30853crs2 table 1 clean air act and amendments codified generally as 42 usc 74017671 year

protection agency federal efforts to control air po llution have gone th rough several phases beginning with information collection re search and technical assistance before being strengthened to establish federa l standards and enforcement federal legislation addressing air pollution was first passed in 1955 prior to which air pollution was the exclusive responsibility of state and local levels of government the federal role was strengthened in subsequent amendments notably the clean air act amendments of 1970 1977 and 1990 the 1970 amendments established the procedures under which epa sets nati onal standards for air quality required 90 reduction in emissions from new auto mobiles by 1975 established program to require the best available control tec hnology at major new sources of air pollution established program to regulate air to xics and greatly strengthened federal enforcement authority the 1977 amendments adjusted the auto emission standards extended deadlines for the attainment of air quality standards and added the prevention of significant dete rioration program to protect air cleaner than national standardshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30853crs3 1 unlike the other naaqs pollu tants ozone is not directly emitted but rather is formed in the atmosphere by the interaction of volatile organic compounds vocs and nitrogen oxides nox in the presence of sunlight th control of ozone is thus based on regulating emissions of vocs and noxchanges to the act in 1990 included provisions to 1 classify most nonattainment areas according to the extent to which they exceed the standard tailoring deadlines planning and controls to each areas status 2 tighten auto and other mobile source emission standards 3 require reformulated and alternative fuels in the most polluted areas 4 revise th air toxics section establishing new program of technologybase d standards and addressing the problem of sudden catastrophic releases of toxics 5 establis h an acid rain control program with marketable allowance scheme to provide flexibility in implementation 6 require staterun permit program for the operation of major sources of air pollutants 7 implement the montreal prot ocol to phase out most oz onedepleting chemicals and 8 update the enforcement provisions so th at they parallel those in other pollution control acts including authority for epa to assess administrative penalties the 1990 amendments also authorized appropriations for clean air programs through fy1998 the act has not been reaut horized since then house rules require enactment of an authorization before an appropriation bill can be considered but this requirement can be waived and frequently has been thus while authorization of appropriations in the clean air act and most other environmental statutes have expired programs have tinued and have been funde d the acts other legal authorities to issue and enforce regulations are for the most part permanent and are not affected by the lack of authorization the remainder of this repor t describes major programs required by the act with an emphasis on the changes established by the 1990 amendments national ambient air quality standards in section 109 the act requires epa to establish national ambient air quality standards naaqs for air pollutants that enda nger public health or welfare in the administrators judgment and whose pres ence in ambient air results from numerous or diverse sources the naaqs must be designed to protect public health and welfare with an adequate margin of safety using this authority epa has promulgated naaqs for six air po llutants sulfur dioxide so2 particulate matter pm25 and pm10 nitrogen dioxide no2 carbon monoxide co ozone1 and lead the act requires epa to review the scie ntific data upon which the standards are based and revise the st andards if necessary every five years more often than not however epa has taken more than five years in reviewing and revising the standards originally the act required that the naaqs be attained by 1977 at the latest but the states experienced widespread diffi culty in complying with these deadlines as result the deadlines have been extended several time s under the 1990 amendments most areas not in attainment with naaqs must meet special compliance schedules staggered according to the severity of an areas air pollutionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30853crs4 2 epa modified the ozone standard specified in the statute as 012 parts per million ppm averaged over 1hour period to 008 ppm averaged over an 8hour period through regulations promulgated in july 1997 in april 2004 the agency promulgated an implementation rule for the new 8hour standar d under this rule the 1hour standard was revoked as of june 15 2005 and areas that had not yet attained it were converted to new continuedproblem the amendments also established specific requirements for each nonattainment category as described below state implementation plans while the act authorizes the epa to t naaqs the states are responsible for establishing procedures to attain and maintain the sta ndards under section 110 of the act the states adopt plans known as state implementation plans sips and submit them to epa to ensure that they are adequate to meet statutory requirements sips are based on emission inventories and computer models to determine whether air quality violations will occur if these data show that standards would be exceeded the state imposes additional cont rols on existing sources to ensure that emissions do not cause exceed ances of the standards proposed new and modified sources must obtain state construction permits in which the applicant shows how the anticipated emissions will not exceed llowable limits in nonattainment areas emissions from new or modified sources must also be offset by reductions in emissions from existing sources the 1990 amendments require epa to im pose sanctions in areas which fail to submit sip fail to submit an adequate sip or fail to implement sip unless the state corrects such failures 2to1 emi ssions offset for the construction of new polluting sources is imposed 18 months afte r notification to the state and ban on most new federal highway grants is imposed six months later an additional ban on air quality grants is discretionary ultimately federal implementation plan may be imposed if the state fails to submit or implement an adequate sip the amendments also require that in nonattainment areas federal permits or financial assistance may be granted for activities that do not conform to state implementation plan this requirement can cause temporary suspension in funding for most new highway and transit projects if an area fails to demonstrate that the emissions caused by such projects are cons istent with attainment and maintenance of ambient air quality standards demons trating conformity of transportation plans and sips is required in nonattainment areas whenever new plans are submitted nonattainment requirements in major departure from the prior law the 1990 clean air act amendments grouped most nonattainment areas into classifications base d on the extent to which the naaqs was exceeded and established sp ecific pollution controls and attainment dates for each classification these requirements are desc ribed here as spelled out in sections 181193 of the act2 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30853crs5 2 continued classifications depending on th eir 8hour concentration of ozone as result of court challenges the ramifications of this conver sion to the 8hour standard are still unfolding but in general the former 1hour nonattainment ar eas remain subject to the controls specified for their 1hour category new nonattainment ar eas that did not exceed the 1hour standard but do violate the 8hour standard in general are subject to more flexible controls under subpart 1 sections 171179b of the act th standard was revised again in march 2008 to 0075 ppm averaged over 8 hours nona ttainment areas for the 2008 revision are expected to be designated in 2010 nonattainment areas are classified on the basis of design value which is derived from the pollutant concentration in parts per million or micrograms per cubic meter recorded by air quality monitoring devices the design value for the 1 hour ozone standard was the fourth highes t hourly reading measured during the most recent threeyear period using these design values the act created five classes of ozone nonattainment as shown in table 2 only angeles fell into the extreme class but 97 other areas were classified in one of the other four ozone categories simpler classification system establishe d moderate and seri ous nonattainment areas for carbon monoxide and particulate matter with correspondingly more stringent control requirements for th more polluted class table 2 ozone nonattainment classifications class marginal moderate s

with 1988 design value between 0190 and 0280 ppm have 17 years to attain others have 15 years number of areas in each category as of the date of enactment as shown in the table the deadlines for attainment fo r ozone nonattainment areas stretched from 1993 to 2010 depending on the severity of the problem under the 8hour ozone standar d which replaced the 1hour standard in 2004 these deadlines are changed to 2007 to 2021 for carbon monoxide the attainment date for moderate areas was december 31 1995 and for serious areas december 31 2000 for particulate matter the dead line for areas designated moderate nonattainment as of 1990 was d ecember 31 1994 for those areas subsequently designated as moderate the deadline is six years after designation for serious areas the respective deadlines are december 31 2001 or 10 years after designation requirements for ozone nonattainment areas although areas with more severe air pollution problems have longer time to meet the standards more stringent control requirements are impos ed in areas with worse pollution ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30853crs6 summary of the primary ozone control re quirements for each nonattainment category

ontrol measures bacm reduce definition of major source of pm10 from 100 tons per year to 70 tons per year in july 1997 epa promulgated new sta ndards for fine particulates pm25 the pm25 standards were also subject to court challenges the absence of monitoring network capable of measuring the pollutant delayed implementation as well nonattainment areas for pm25 were designated on april 14 2005 states had three years subsequent to designation to submit state implementation plans revisions to the naaqs promulgated in october 2006 strengthened the pm25 standard emission standards for mobile sources title ii of the clean air act has required emission standards for automobiles since 1968 the 1990 amendments significantly tightened these standards for cars the hydrocarbon standard was reduced by 40 and the nitrogen oxides noxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30853crs9 standard by 50 the standa rds referred to as tier 1 standards were phased in over the 19941996 model years the amendments envisioned further set of reductions tier 2 standards but not before model year 2004 for tier 2 sta ndards to be promulgated the agency was first required to report to congress concerning the need for further emission reductions the availability of technology to achieve such reductions and the cost effectiveness of such controls compared to other means of attaining air quality standards epa submitted this report to congress in august 1998 concluding that further emission reductions were needed and that technology to achieve such reductions was available and costeffective tier 2 standards requiring emission reductions of 77 to 95 from cars and light trucks were prom ulgated in february 2000 and were phased in over the 20042009 model years to facilitate the use of more effective emission controls the st andards also require more than 90 reduction in the sulfur content of gasoline beginning in 2004 the 1990 amendments also required that oxygenated gasoline designed to reduce emissions of carbon monoxide be so ld in the worst co nonattainment areas and that reformulated gasoline rfg designed to reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds and toxic air pollutants be sold in the nine worst ozone nonattainment areas angeles sa n diego houston baltimore philadelphia new york hartford chicago and milwa ukee metropolitan washington dc and four areas in california we re added to the mandatory list later other ozone nonattainment areas can opt in to the rf g program as of 2006 additional areas in 11 states had done so the fuels provisions were modified by the energy policy act of 2005 epact removing the requirement that rfg cont ain oxygenates in stead epact required the use of increasing amounts of renewable fu most likely to be ethanol in motor fuels beginning in 2006 the energy inde pendence and security act of 2007 further strengthened the renewa ble fuel requirements use of alternative fuels and development of cleaner engines was also to be stimulated by the cleanfuel fleet program in all of the most seriously polluted ozone and co nonattainment ar eas centrally fueled fleets of 10 or more passenger cars and lightduty trucks must purchase at least 30 cleanfuel vehicles when they add new vehicles to existing fleets startin g in 1999 the act or iginally required the program to begin in 1998 but the start was layed by year the percentage rose to 50

reformulated gasoline reformulated diesel meth anol ethanol natural gas liquefied petroleum gas hydrogen or electricity in addition to the above program ca lifornias zero emission vehicle zev program also is intended to promote the development of alternative fuels and vehicles section 209b of the clean ai r act grants california the authority to develop its own vehicle emissions standards if those standards are at least as stringent as the federal standards in addition to setting more stringent standards for all vehicles california used this authority to establish program requiring autohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30853crs10 3 this section of the report was written by lindajo schierow specialist in environmental policy 4 the 1990 amendments specified 189 pollutants but public law 102187 enacted on december 4 1991 deleted hydrogen sulfide from the list of toxic pollutants leaving only 188manufacturers to sell zevs electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in the state beginning in 2003 this program has been substantially modified since it was enacted and now allows credit for hybrid nd partial zev vehicles in addition to true zevs but it has served as an incubato r for lower emission technologies since its adoption section 177 of the act allows ot her states to adopt californias stricter standards at least ten states connectic ut maine massachusetts new jersey new york oregon pennsylvania rhode island vermont and washington have already adopted them or are in the process of doing so the 1990 amendments also imposed tight er requirements on certification an autos useful life is defined as 100000 miles instead of the earlier 50000 miles on emissions allowed during refueling on low temperature co emissions on inuse performance over time and on warranties for the most expensive emission control components 8 years80000 miles for the catalytic converter electronic emissions control unit and onboard emissions diagnostic unit regulations were also extended to include nonroad fuels and engines standards for trucks and buses using diesel engines were also strengthened the 1990 amendments required new urban bus to reduce emissions of diesel particulates 92 by 1996 and all other heav yduty diesel engines to achieve an 83 reduction by the same year nox emissions must also be reduced 33 by 1998 authority to further strengthen these st andards led to promulgation in january 2001 of new emission standards requiring further 9095 reduction in emissions phased in over the 20072010 model years nd reduction of 97 in the allowable amount of sulfur in highway diesel fuel these regulations were followed in may 2004 by similar requirements for nonroad dies equipment whic h will be phased in between 2007 and 2015 hazardous air pollutants3 completely rewritten by the clean ai r act amendments of 1990 section 112 of the act establishes programs for prot ecting public health and the environment from exposure to toxic air pollutants as revised by the 1990 amendments the section contains four major provisions maximum achievable control technology mact requirements healthbased sta ndards standards for stationary area sources small but numerous sources such as gas stations or dry cleaners that collectively emit significant quantities of hazardous pollutants and requirements for the prevention of catastrophic releases first epa is to establish technolog ybased emission sta ndards called mact standards for sources of 188 pollutants listed in the legislation and to specify categories of sources subject to the emission standards4 p i s t r v i s t h ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30853crs11 standards periodically at least every eight years epa can on its initiative or in response to petition add or delete substances or sour ce categories from the lists section 112 establishes presumption in favor of regulation for the designated chemicals it requires regulation of designated pollutant unless epa or petitioner is able to show that there is adequate data on the health and environmental effects of the substance to determine that emissions ambient concentrations bioaccumulation or deposition of the substa nce may not reasonably be anticipated to cause any adverse effects to human health or adverse environmental effects epa is required to set standards for sources of the listed pollutants that achieve the maximum degree of reduc tion in emissions taking into account cost and other nonairquality factors these mact sta ndards for new sources shall not be less stringent than the most stringent emissions level that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source the standards for existing sources may be less stringent than those for new sources but mu st be less stringent than the emission limitations achieved by either the best performing 12 of existing sources if there are more than 30 such sources in the category or subcategory or the best performing 5 similar sources if there are fewer than 30 existing sources are given three years following promulgation of standards to ach ieve compliance with possible oneyear extension additional extensi ons may be available for special circumstances or for certain categories of sources existing sources that achieve voluntary early emissions reductions will receive sixyear ex tension for compliance with mact the second major provision of section 112 directs epa to set healthbased standards to address situations in which significant residual risk of adverse health effects or threat of adverse environm ental effects remains after installation of mact this provision requires that epa after consultation with the surgeon general of the united states submit report to congress on the public health significance of residual risks and recomme nd legislation regarding such risks if congress does not legislate in response to epas recommendations then epa is required to issue standards for categories of sources of hazardous air pollutants as necessary to protect the public health with an ample margin of safety or to prevent an adverse environmental eff ect residual risk standard is required for any source emitting cancercausing pollutant that poses an added risk to the most exposed person of more than oneinamillion resi dual risk standards are due eight years after promulgation of mact for the affect ed source category existing sources have 90 days to comply with residual risk st andard with possible twoyear extension in general residual risk standa rds do not apply to area sources the law directed epa to contract with the national academy of sciences nas for study of risk assessment thodology and created risk assessment and management commission to investigat and report on policy implications and appropriate uses of risk assessment and risk mana gement in 1994 nas published its report science and judgment in risk assessment the commission study framework for environmental health risk management was released in 1997 third in addition to the technologybase d and healthbased programs for major sources of hazardous air pollution epa is to establish standards for stationary area sources determined to present threat of adverse effects to human health or thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30853crs12 5 this section of the report was written by larry b parker specialist in energy and environmental policyenvironment the provision requires epa to regulate the stationary area sources responsible for 90 of the emissions of th 30 hazardous air pollutants that present the greatest risk to public health in the largest number of urban areas in setting the standard epa can impose less stringent g enerally available control technologies rather than mact finally section 112 addresse s prevention of sudden catas trophic releases of air toxics by establishing an independent ch emical safety and hazard investigation board the board is responsible for inve stigating accidents involving releases of hazardous substances conducting studies and preparing reports on the handling of toxic materials and measures to reduce the risk of accidents epa is also directed to issue prevention detection and correction requirements for catastrophic releases of air toxics by major sources section 112r requires owners and operators to prepare risk management plans including hazard assessments measures to prevent re leases and response program new source performance standards5 section 111 of the act requires epa to establish nationally uniform technologybased standards called new source performance standards or nsps for categories of new indus trial facilities these st andards accomplish two goals first they establish consistent baseline for pollution control that competing firms must meet and thereby remove any incentive for states or communities to weaken air pollution standards in order to attract polluting industry and second they preserve clean air to accommodate future growth as well as for its own benefits nsps establish maximum emission levels for new major stationary sources powerplants steel mills and smelters for example with the emission levels determined by the best ad equately demonstrated c ontinuous control technology available taking costs in to account epa must regula rly revise and update nsps applicable to designated sources as new technology becomes available since the goal is to prevent new pollution problems from veloping and to force the installation of new control technology the standards also apply to modifications of existing facilities through process called new source review nsr the laws ambiguity regarding what constitutes modification subj ect to nsr as opposed to routine maintenance of facility has led to litigation with epa proposing in recent years to modify its interpretation of the requi rements of this section solid waste incinerators prior to 1990 solid waste incinerators which emit wide range of pollutants were subject to varying degrees of stat and federal regulati on depending on their size age and the type of waste burne d in new section 129 the 1990 amendmentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30853crs13 6 this section of the report was written by larry b parker specialist in energy and environmental policy and james mccarthy specialist in environmental policyestablished more consistent federal requirements specifying that emissions of 10 categories of pollutants be regulated at new and ex isting incinerators burning municipal solid waste medical waste nd commercial and indus trial waste the amendments also established emissi ons monitoring and operator training requirements prevention of significant deterioration regional haze6 sections 160169 of the act establis h requirements for the prevention of significant deterioration of air quality psd the psd program reflects the principle that areas where air quality is better than that required by naaqs should be protected from significant new air polluti on even if naaqs would not be violated the act divides clean air areas into three classes and specifies the increments of so2 and particulate pollution allowed in eac h class i areas include international and national parks wilderne ss and other pristine areas allowable increments of new pollution are very small class ii areas include all attainment and not classifiable areas not designated as class i allowable increments of new pollution are modest class iii represents selected areas that states may designate for development allowable increments of new polluti on are large but not exceeding naaqs through an elaborate hearing and review process state can have regions redesignated from class ii to class iii alt hough none have yet been so redesignated while the 1977 amendments only stipulat ed psd standards for two pollutants so2 and particulates epa is supposed to establish standards for other criteria pollutants thus far only one of the other four no2 has been addressed the agency promulgated standards for no2 in 1988 newly constructed polluting sources in psd areas must install best available control technology bact that may be more strict than that required by nsps the justifications of the policy are that it protects air quality provides an added margin of health protection preserves clean air fo r future development and prevents firms from gaining competitive edge by shopping for clean air to pollute in sections 169a and b the act also sets national goal of preventing and remedying impairment of visibility in national parks and wilderness areas and requires epa to promulgate regulations to assure reasonable progress toward that goal in the 1990 amendments congress st rengthened these provisions which had not been implemented the amendments required epa to establish grand canyon visibility transport commission composed of governors from each state in the affected region an epa designee and representative of each of th national parks or wilderness areas in the region other visibility transport co mmissions can be established upon epas discretion or upon petition from at least two states within 18 months of receiving report from one of these commissions epa is required to prom ulgate regulationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30853crs14 7 this section of the report was written by larry b parker specialist in energy and environmental policyto assure reasonable progress toward the visibility goal including requirements that states update their state implementation plans to contain emission limits schedules of compliance and other measures n ecessary to make reasonable progress specifically mentioned is requirement that states impose best available retrofit technology on existing sources of emissions impairing visibility the grand canyon commission delivered set of recommendations to epa in june 1996 and the agency subsequently promulgated regional haze program applicable to all 50 states under this authority acid deposition control7 the clean air act amendments of 1990 added an acid deposition control program title iv to the act it sets goals for the year 2000 of reducing annual so2 emissions by 10 million tons from 1980 levels and re ducing annual nox emissions by 2 million tons also from 1980 levels the so2 reductions are imposed in two step s under phase 1 ownersoperators of 111 electric generating facilities listed in the law that are larger than 100 megawatts had to meet tonnage emission limitations by january 1 1995 this would reduce so2 emission by about 35 million tons phase 2 included facilities larger than 75 megawatts with deadline of ja nuary 1 2000 so far compliance has been 100 to introduce some flexibility in the distribution and timing of reductions the act creates comprehensive permit and emissions allowance system an allowance is limited authorization to emit ton of so2 issued by epa the allowances would be allocated to phase 1 and phase 2 units in accordance with baseline emissions estimates powerplants which commence operation af ter november 15 1990 would not receive any allowances these new units would have to obtain allowances offsets from holders of existing allowances allowances may be traded nationally during either phase the law also permits industrial sour ces and powerplants to sell allowances to utility systems under regulations to be developed by epa allowances may be banked by utility for future use or sale the act provided for two types of sales to improve the liquidity of the allowance system and to ensure the availability of allowances for utilities and independent power producers who need them first special reserve fund consisting of 28 of phase 1 and phase 2 allowance allocations has been set aside for sale allowances from this fund 25000 nnually from 19931999 and 50000 thereafter are sold at fixed price of 1500 an allo wance independent power producers have guaranteed rights to these allowances under certain conditions second an annual open auction sold allowances 150000 from 19931995 and 250000 from 1996 1999 with minimum price utilities w ith excess allowances may have them auctioned off at this auction nd any person may buy allowances httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30853crs15 8 this section of the report was written by claudia copeland specialist in environmental policythe act essentially caps so2 emissions at individual existing sources through tonnage limitation and at future plants through the allowance system first emissions from most existing sources are capped at specified emission rate times an historic baseline level second for plants commenc ing operation after november 15 1990 emissions must be completely offset with additional reductions at existing facilities beginning after phas 2 compliance however as noted above the law provides some allowances to future powerplants which meet certain criteria the utility so2 emission cap is set at 89 million tons with some exceptions the act provides that if an affected it does not have sufficient allowances to cover its emissions it is subject to an excess emission penalty of 2000 per ton of so2 and required to reduce an additional ton of so2 the next year for each ton of excess pollutant emitted the act also requires epa to inve ntory industrial emissions of so2 and to report every five years beginning in 1995 if th inventory shows that industrial emissions may reach levels above 560 milli on tons per year then epa is to take action under the act to ensure that the 560 million ton cap is not exceeded the act requires epa to set specific nox emission rate limitations 045 lb per million btu for tangentiallyfired boile rs and 050 lb per million btu for wall fired boilers unless those rate s can not be achieved by lownox burner technology tangentially and wallfired boilers affected by phase 1 so2 controls must also meet nox requirements epa was to set emission limitations for other types of boilers by 1997 based on lownox burner costs which epa did in addition epa was to propose and promulgate revised ne w source performance standard for nox from fossil fuel steam generating units which epa also did in 1998 permits8 the clean air act amendments of 1990 added title v to the act which requires states to administer comprehensive permit program for the operation of sources emitting air pollutants these requirements are modeled after similar provisions in the clean water act previously the clean air act contained limited provision for permits requiring only new or modified major stationary sources to obtain construction permits unde r section 165 of the act sources subject to the permit requirements generally include major sources that emit or have the potential to emit 100 tons per year of any regulated pollutant plus stationary and area sources that emit or have potential to emit lesser specified amounts of hazardous air pollutants ho wever in nonattainment areas the permit requirements also include sources which emit as little as 50 25 or 10 tons per year of vocs depending on the severity of the regions nona ttainment status serious severe or extreme httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30853crs16 states were required to develop permit programs and to submit those programs for epa approval by november 15 1993 epa had one year to approve or disapprove states submission in whole or in part after the effective date of state plan sources had 12 months to submit an actual permit application states are to collect annual fees from s ources sufficient to cover the reasonable costs of administering the permit program with revenues to be used to support the agencys air pollution control program the fee must be at least 25 per ton of regulated pollutants excluding carbon monoxide permittin g authorities have discretion not to collect fees on emissions in excess of 4000 tons per year and may collect other fee amounts if appropriate the permit states how much of which air pollutants source is allowed to emit as part of the permit process source must prepare compliance plan and certify compliance the term of permits is limited to more than five years sources are required to renew permits at that time state permit authorities must notify contiguous states of permit pplications that may affect them the application and any comments of contiguous states must be fo rwarded to epa for review epa can veto permit however this authority is essentially limited to major permit changes epa review need not include permits which simply codify elements of states overall clean air plan and epa has discretion to not review permits for small sources holding permit to some extent shields source from enforcement actions the act provides that source cannot be held in violation if it is complying with explicit requirements addressed in permit or if the state finds that certain provisions do not apply to that source enforcement section 113 of the act which was also strengthened by the 1990 amendments covers enforcement the section establishe s federal authority to issue agency and court orders requiring compliance and to impose penalties for violations of act requirements section 114 au thorizes epa to require sources to submit reports monitor emissions and certify compliance with the acts requirements and authorizes epa personnel to conduct inspections like most federal environmental statutes the clean air act is enforced primarily by states or local government s they issue most permits monitor compliance and conduct the majority of inspections the federal government functions as backstop with authority to review state actions the agency may act independently or may file its own enfor cement action in cases where it concludes that states response was inadequate the act also provides for citizen suits both against persons including corporations or government agencies alle ged to have violated emissions standards or permit requirements and against epa in cases where the administrator has failed to perform an action that is not discre tionary under the act citizen groups have often used the latter provision to compel the administrator to promulgate regulations required by the statutehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30853crs17 9 this section of the report was written by larry b parker specialist in energy and environmental policythe 1990 amendments elevated penaltie s for some knowing violations from misdemeanors to felonies removed the ability of source to avoid an enforcement order or civil penalty by ceasing violation within 60 days of notice gave authority to epa to assess administr ative penalties and author ized 10000 awards to persons supplying information leading to convictions under the act stratospheric ozone protection9 title vi of the 1990 clean air act ame ndments represents the united states primary response on the domestic front to the ozone depletion issue it also implements the us intern ational responsibilities under th montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer and its amendments indeed section 606a3 provides that the environmental protection agency shall adjust phaseout schedules for ozonedepleting substances in accordance with any future changes in montreal protocol schedules as result the phaseout schedules contained in title vi for various ozonedepleting compounds ve now been superseded by subsequent amendments to the montreal protocol since passage of title vi depleting substances such as cfcs methyl chloroform carbon tetrachloride and halons referred to as class 1 substances have been phased out by industrial countries including the united states new uses of hydrochlorofluorocarbons h cfcs called class 2 subs tances under title vi are banned beginning january 1 2015 unless th hcfcs are recycled used as feedstock or used as refri gerant for appliances manufactured prior to january 1 2020 production of hcfcs is to be fro zen january 1 2015 and phased out by january 1 2030 exemptions consistent w ith the montreal protocol are allowed the epa is required to add any substa nce with an ozone depletion potential odp of 02 or greater to the list of cla ss 1 substances and t phaseout schedule of more than seven years for example methyl bromide odp estimated by epa at 07 was added to the list in decembe r 1993 requiring its phaseout by january 1 2001 this decision was altered by cong ress in 1998 to harmonize the us methyl bromide phaseout schedule with the 2005 dead line set by the parties to the montreal protocol in 1997 also epa is required to add any substance that is known or may be reasonably anticipated to harm the stratosphere to the list of class 2 substances and set phaseout schedule of more than ten years title vi contains several implementing strategies to avoid releases of ozone depleting chemicals to the atmosphere incl uding 1 for class 1 substances used as refrigerant lowest achieva ble level of use and emissi ons maximum recycling and safe disposal required by july 1 1992 2 for servicing or disposing refrigeration equipment containing class 1 and 2 substa nces venting banned as of july 1 1992 3 for motor vehicle air cond itioners containing class 1 or 2 substances recycling required by january 1 1992 smaller shops by january 1 1993 4 sale of
