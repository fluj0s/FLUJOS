companies have faced series of accounting and financial problems some of the federal home loan banks fhlbs which are congressionally chartered memberowned companies have also had financial problems collectively these problems led many in congress to conclude that fannie mae freddie mac and the fhlbs need stronger regulator pl 110289 creates the federal housing finance agency fhfa to be the new regulator for the housing gses replacing the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo and the federal housing finance board fhfb the task of setting mission goals is moved to fhfa from the department of housing and urban development hud 3 pl 110289 gives fhfa broad authority to regulate the housing gses fhfa is given the responsibility to review and to approve new type s of mortgages fhfa was granted the authority to take over and reorganize an insolvent fannie mae or freddie mac and this authority was used on september 7 when the fhfa placed fannie mae and freddie mac under

gives the secretary of the treasury the authority to lend or invest as much money as necessary to the regulated entities and to set the terms of the loan this authority expires december 31 2009 the congressional budget office cbo has estimated the expected federal budgetary costs at 25 billion based on less than 50 probability of treasury having to use this authority before the authority expires at the end of december 20095 since treasury has invoked this authority cbo estimate implies an expected cost of 50 billion or more cbo estima ted that there was almost 5 chance that the losses would total more than 100 billion the act authorizes the federal reserve and treasury to consult with fhfa on safety and soundness issues including use of the loan authority

made it difficult to take legal action against those who allegedly violated various state and federal laws moreover it has made it difficult for mortgage originators to investigate fully the background of individuals that they are considering hiring the act seeks to create uniformity in mortgage originator licensing and registration it will result in the creation of national database of mortgage originators the act encourages states to develop system to license and register anyone who originates home mortgage 8 hud is to create backup system which would apply in states that fail to
