division congressional research service the library of congress federal tax benefits for families k12 education expenses in the context of school choice summary some believe that comprehensive reform of elementary and secondary k12 schools and districts is needed to improve the quality of education provided to the nations children proponents of reform have called for among other things policies to encourage parents to select the public or private schools they deem most appropriate for their children with federal assistance provided through school vouchers or education tax subsidies for some the authorization of tax benefits for k12 education expenses beyond those already included in the federal tax code eg coverdell education savings accounts and the deduction for contributions to charitable organizations including schools and scholarshipgranting organizations would be way of expanding school choice while minimizing some of the concerns that have inhibited the expansion of vouchers eg churchstate entanglement and regulation of private schools some proponents have further argued that new k12 education tax benefit would be more effective than previously tried school reforms at providing students with better educational opportunities and at reducing existing inequities some opponents of expanded k12 education tax benefits and of unregulated school choice have argued that if enacted such policies might undermine the current state of public education and might exacerbate existing inequities in the quality of education available to children of different segments of society legislation was introduced in recent congresses to provide nonrefundable and refundable credits for families k12 education expenses the latter approach would allow eligible families with schoolage children to receive tax benefit even if its value exceeded their income tax liability the difference being provided to the family via tax refund bills also have been introduced to offer nonrefundable credits to those who make contributions to school tuition organizations stos which in turn use the funds to award k12 education scholarships tax credit available to families incurring k12 education expenses or credit dedicated to funding stos potentially would provide families with an incentive to send their children to private schools including those who might have done so anyway in order to target the tax benefit to families who might otherwise not have been able to exercise school choice some bills have included an income ceiling for claimants or restricted the credit to families with children assigned to failing public schools while such bills likely would encourage school choice because tuition would be among the many qualified education expenses they also could make k12 education in general more affordable for families by broadly defining qualified expenses to include such things as computer hardware and software academic tutoring and educational supplies this report

benefit afforded by federal state and local governments to families with children attending elementary or secondary school is free education which with few exceptions in modern times has been an education provided at public school through the latter half of the 20th century and into the 21st the quality of the education being provided to the nations children from kindergarten through 12th grade k12 has been highpriority issue of public policy much of the policy debate has centered on proposals to remedy some of the many disparities evident across regions and locales and between students of different backgrounds in the resources provided for k12 education and the resultant outcomes some have questioned whether the current system of publicly funded k12 education is optimal and have called for range of reforms including policies that seek to equalize available resources across schools and local educational agencies leas policies that provide additional funding for the education of more costly to educate students and marketoriented policies that would encourage parents to select the school they deem most appropriate for their children with funding to fully or partially offset the costs of tuition and fees provided through vouchers or reimbursed through the tax system in the past decade congress increasingly has turned to the tax code to provide subsidies beyond traditional grants and loans to persons attending public and private postsecondary institutions in 2001 after several failed attempts the 107th congress extended one of these higher education tax benefits coverdell education savings accounts to apply to qualified elementary and secondary education expenses ie tuition at religious and secular private schools and certain costs associated with enrollment in public schools several bills have been introduced since then that would support school choice through the creation of direct or indirect tax subsidies for families expenses associated with enrolling their children in private or public schools this report focuses on proposals offered to amend the federal income tax code to subsidize the expenses of families with children enrolled in the k12 school of their choice it begins with discussion of k12 education reform efforts to provide context for the proposed tax subsidies next it reviews existing federal tax provisions that could help families pay for the cost of their childrens k12 crs2 schooling1 the report then analyzes the kind of proposals that have been introduced to expand existing federal tax benefits or to authorize new ones for families incurring k12 education expenses background on k12 education reform efforts over the past several decades wide array of elementary and secondary education reform efforts have been proposed with many of them having been implemented either nationwide or within selected states efforts at reform have included courtordered school desegregation plans federally funded education programs aimed at serving disadvantaged children in distressed communities the restructuring of state education finance systems and various forms of school choice recently policymakers have focused their attention on number of school choice proposals as one means of effecting k12 education reform2 while many school choice reform proposals have garnered broadbased support and several have been enacted and implemented by various states or the federal government others have languished amid controversy public school choice reforms that have been implemented successfully in majority of the states include open enrollment policies either intradistrict or interdistrict magnet schools and charter schools only few states have adopted policies supportive of private or comprehensive school choice such as tuition vouchers and tax subsidies3 the federal government currently assists families who opt to send their children to private schools through favorable tax treatment of scholarships among other provisions in the internal revenue code irc which are discussed later in this report the federal government also supports public school choice nationwide through number of programs authorized under the elementary and secondary education act esea as amended by the child left behind act nclba pl 107110 these include components of the title ia program which funds educational services for the disadvantaged the following title v programs charter schools innovative programs voluntary public school choice and magnet 1 the report excludes the exemption of private schools from taxation and the individual income tax deductions of statelocal income sales and property taxes and of home mortgage interest that subsidize families who choose to reside in desirable school districts or attendance areas which often have higher property values and hence greater amounts of deductible taxes or home mortgage interest 2 for more indepth review of school choice issues see crs issue brief ib98035 school choice current legislation by david p smole 3 currently publicly funded school choice programs using vouchers operate in florida ohio utah and milwaukee wisconsin recently however the florida supreme court ruled that floridas opportunity scholarship program is in violation of the florida constitution the program will cease operating at the end of the 20052006 school year voucher programs also have operated in the states of maine and vermont for many years in areas without public schools the states of arizona florida illinois iowa minnesota and pennsylvania currently support school choice through some form of tax subsidy to individuals or corporations crs3 schools and the requirement that states ensure that public school choice is made available to students attending persistently dangerous schools or who have been victim of violent crime on school property federal funding to support the enrollment of students in nonpublic schools currently is provided through two targeted programs in the district of columbia school choice is supported through federally funded voucher program the dc school choice incentive act under which scholarships of up to 7500 per year are awarded to students for attendance at private schools located within the district of columbia4 also during the 20052006 school year federal funding is being provided under the temporary emergency impact aid for displaced students program to help offset the costs of educating elementary and secondary students who were displaced by hurricanes katrina and rita irrespective of whether the students are enrolled in public or nonpublic schools the program is temporary emergency aid program in which up to 6000 in funding is made available to schools on per student basis up to 7500 is available for students with disabilities under the program the secretary of education makes grants to seas which in turn award funds to leas and bureau of indian affairs biafunded schools on perstudent basis to provide for the education of students enrolled in nonpublic schools leas must deposit funds into student accounts and nonpublic schools must waive or reimburse students tuition to access funds5 during the 107th congresss deliberations over reauthorization of the esea the house and senate considered numerous proposals to expand federal support of parental choice and access to privately provided educational services proposals were made to do so through school vouchers and tax subsidies although voucher proposals were debated on the floors of the house and senate none of the amendments proposed were adopted by either chamber the nclba did however authorize supplemental educational services6 supplemental educational services as provided for in the esea are tutoring and other academic activities that are beyond instruction provided during the regular school day and are designed to increase students achievement on state academic assessments and their proficiency in meeting state academic achievement standards the esea requires leas to offer supplemental educational services to lowincome students who attend title ia schools

for additional information on supplemental educational services see crs report rl31329 supplemental educational services for children from lowincome families under esea title ia by david p smole crs4 cumulative years as part of series of requirements in support of school improvement supplemental educational services are significant in that they offer parents the opportunity to select public or private entity to provide publicly funded educational services to their children among the issues that make choicebased education reforms controversial are the locus of control over education policy decisions and the separation of church and state many people are suspicious of school choice proposals that would limit leas or state educational agencies seas autonomy over education governance issues such as the establishment of curriculum requirements and criteria for enrollment including the boundaries of attendance areas the authorizing or chartering of schools and the control of locally generated revenue others are concerned about the possibility of states and localities either being permitted or required to allow the use of public funds to pay for the cost of students attendance at private or religiously affiliated school still others are concerned about the potential for increased government oversight of private schools and home schools while churchstate entanglement issues are complex and have comprised much of the debate over public funding of private school choice the supreme court added degree of clarity to this debate in its ruling on zelman v simmonsharris in zelman the court ruled that the constitution allows publicly funded school vouchers to be used to support the attendance of children at religiously affiliated schools in instances where parents have the opportunity to select from options that also include public and private secular schools7 the ruling permits rather than requires public funding of religiously affiliated schools such as through vouchers despite the courts ruling all but three state constitutions contain either blaine amendments andor compelled support clauses that generally prohibit the provision of public funds to religiously affiliated institutions such as schools8 debate thus remains over the desirability and feasibility of expanding private school choice programs including those that might involve religiously affiliated schools supporters of public funding for religious schools continue to offer arguments that mirror those espoused by proponents of providing public funding to private schools in general these include the prospect of such schools being more 7 for additional information see crs report rl30165 education vouchers constitutional issues and cases by angie welborn and crs report rs21254 education vouchers an overview of the supreme courts decision in zelman v simmonsharris by christopher jennings 8 richard komer and clint bolick school choice the next step the state constitutional challenge institute for justice july 1 2002 according to the institute for justice 36 state constitutions contain blaine amendments with most adopted during the latter half of the 19th century they were designed primarily to prohibit state aid to catholic schools constitutions of 29 states contain compelled support clauses which forbid the practice common during colonial times of the government collecting money to support churches state constitutions differ in how strictly they limit public funding of religiously affiliated schools crs5 effective than public schools9 the idea that competition between public and private schools in attracting students might make both types of schools better and the idea that parents who send their children to private schools should not have to pay both taxes to support public education and the cost of their own childrens private school education they also note that public funding for religiously affiliated schools has been upheld under the us constitution some opponents still object to allowing public funds to be directed to religiously affiliated schools and are loathe to support such policies others who support religiously affiliated schools often object to the prospect of government funding out of concern that too many strings might be attached for instance the government might attempt to regulate such things as hiring practices criteria for enrollment and curriculum requirements some believe that the authorization of additional tax subsidies for k12 education expenses would avoid some of the issues that have inhibited the expansion of school vouchers and that such new tax benefits would prove more effective than previously tried school reforms at providing better educational opportunities for the nations school children others oppose further expansion of k12 education tax subsidies out of concern that they could work against current education reforms federal tax benefits that help families pay k12 education expenses the federal tax code currently has few provisions that may help families pay for their childrens elementary secondary or postsecondary school expenses the following discussion focuses on elements of these tax benefits that apply both to k 12 and postsecondary school attendance or only to k12 school attendance scholarships and tuition reduction scholarships amounts paid to assist students in the pursuit of their studies are tax free to students and their families if the awards are used toward tuition and fees required for enrollment in an educational institution or toward fees books supplies and equipment required for courses at the institutions grants that specify their use for other educational expenses eg room and board or that prohibit their use for tuition or courserelated expenses are taxable educational institutions at which scholarships are used must maintain regular teaching staff and curriculum as well as regularly enrolled student body that attends classes where the school carries out its educational activities 9 for example recently released data from the national assessment of education progress naep show that 4th 8th and 12th grade students in private schools had higher average scores in reading mathematics science and writing than their counterparts in public schools however these data do not necessarily indicate that private schools are more effective in educating students than public schools us department of education national center for education statistics student achievement in private schools results from naep 2000 2005 nces 2006459 2005 at httpncesedgovnationsreportcard pdfstudies2006459pdf visited jan 26 2006 crs6 according to the thomas b fordham foundation there were about 100 privately funded scholarship programs that reportedly enabled between 75000 and 100000 lowincome children to attend private k12 schools in 2001 typically the scholarships go to elementary and secondary school students in families with incomes below specified levels who live in certain geographic areas the programs generally provide partial tuition assistance families typically are selected either through lotteries or on firstcome firstserved basis10 the childrens scholarship fund csf is the largest source of private school scholarships offered on nationwide basis to lowincome families11 proponents of school choice sometimes use the terms scholarships and vouchers interchangeably as they both are intended to help families pay for their childrens education costs others sometimes make distinction between the two based on the funding source with vouchers being associated with public funding and scholarships being associated with private funding tuition reduction educational institutions may reduce the tuition of dependent children of current employees or of former employees who retired or left due to disability and the benefit is not taxable to the child or employee12 the tuition reduction can occur at school other than where the employee works but the subsidy must be remitted by that school rather than the employees school eg school provides reduced tuition to the nine year old of secretary employed at school b information on the prevalence of tuition reductions offered by private k12 schools is scant and difficult to interpret the us department of education collects data on the share of private schools by affiliation that allow reduction in tuition in its schools and staffing survey sass however schools reporting tuition reductions could be providing discounts for reasons other than student being dependent of school employee eg based on familys financial need or its enrollment of multiple children at the same institution charitable contributions individual taxpayers who itemize their deductions ie who do not take the standard deduction may claim deduction for charitable contributions made to qualified taxexempt organizations including political subdivision of state eg public schools which generally are organized into leas and nonprofit groups that are religious charitable scientific literary or educational in purpose these are commonly known as section 501c3 organizations

daughter or stepdaughter of an employee or former employee who is claimed as dependent or whose parents are deceased crs7 federal tax code and include organizations that provide scholarships for k12 education as mentioned above donations to nonprofit educational organizations are not deductible if they substitute for tuition or other enrollment fees however deductions for charitable contributions cannot exceed 50 of taxpayers adjusted gross income agi excess contributions may be carried forward for five years the total of certain itemized deductions including the deduction for charitable giving is limited if the taxpayers agi is above threshold that is adjusted for inflation each year consequently highincome taxpayers may be unable to claim the full amount of their deduction for charitable contributions corporations also may make taxdeductible contributions to qualified organizations the deduction is limited to 10 of taxable income13 excess contributions may be carried forward for five years according to the american association of fund raising counsel the largest category to receive charitable donations generally is religion 355 in 200414 the next largest category which lags far behind is education 136 in 200415 coverdell education savings accounts coverdell are trusts or custodial accounts that initially were dedicated to paying only the qualified higher education expenses of designated beneficiaries in the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 pl 10716 congress expanded the savings accounts purpose to allow distributions to be used for certain expenses incurred after december 31 2001 in connection with attending public or private k12 schools either secular or religiously affiliated the authorization of to cover k12 education expenses will lapse after december 31 2010 unless extended by the congress the basic provisions anyone below specified income levels may make nondeductible contributions to the of beneficiary who is under age 18 provided that total contributions per child do not exceed 2000 annually16 taxpayers may make deposits to if their modified agi is below 110000 for single filers and below 220000 for married filers the annual contribution limit which is not indexed for inflation phases out for single filers with incomes of more than 95000 but less than 110000 and for married filers with incomes of more than 190000 but less than 220000 however corporations taxexempt 13 the rule for scorporations is different since they are not taxable entities 14 giving usa foundation giving usa 2005 15 the education sector includes all levels of educational institutions libraries tutoring programs scholarship funds vocational and technical schools and parent teacher student and alumni associations 16 deposits may be made to the of special needs beneficiaries regardless of their age special needs beneficiaries include persons who due to physical mental or emotional condition including learning disabilities require longer period for the completion of their education crs8 organizations eg foundation charity or union or lower income individuals could contribute the maximum amount to accounts of children in families whose incomes fall within the phaseout range childrens assets perhaps obtained through gifts could be deposited in of which they are the beneficiaries for example earnings on contributions generally grow on taxdeferred basis the deferral confers greater benefits on more affluent families because of their higher marginal tax rates if for example two families pay 2000 annually into an investment for 15 years that earns 6 per annum the balance would have increased to 46552 if earnings accumulated taxfree by about the time their children begin secondary school17 if the families instead had to pay federal income tax on the earnings each year the family in the 28 federal tax bracket would have amassed 41013 while the family in the 15 tax bracket would have amassed 43483 thus the tax deferral in this example is worth noticeably more in additional earnings to the family in the higher tax bracket than it is to the family in the lower tax bracket if states follow the federal law the tax deferral benefit is even greater when funds are disbursed from the accounts those applied toward qualified expenses are not subject to federal income tax earnings withdrawn for other purposes count as taxable income to the beneficiary with some exceptions see tax consequences of transferring funds below nonqualified distributions that exceed qualified expenses also are subject to 10 penalty unless they are made due to the beneficiarys death or disability or to receipt of nontaxable scholarship or educational allowance qualified elementary secondary and postsecondary expenses include tuition fees books supplies and equipment costs incurred by special needs beneficiaries for special needs services are included as well qualified expenses for beneficiaries attending or enrolled in public k12 school or private secular or nonsecular k12 school also include academic tutoring computer software hardware or services such as internet access if used by the beneficiary and the beneficiarys family during the years in which the beneficiary is in school18 and room and board uniforms transportation and supplementary items or services eg extended day programs that are required or provided by the school school is defined as any institution that provides k12 education as determined by state law although expenses associated with homeschooling are not explicitly mentioned some states consider homeschools to be private schools eg 17 the preferential tax treatment accorded was worth 5539 in additional earnings to the family with 28 marginal tax rate and 3069 in additional earnings to the family with 15 marginal tax rate the calculation assumes that the entire 2000 contribution is deposited into the at the end of each year starting in the year the child is born through the year the child reaches age 14 18 expenses for computer software designed for sports games or hobbies are not covered unless it is mainly educational in nature crs9 alabama california delaware illinois indiana kansas kentucky louisiana michigan nebraska north carolina tennessee and texas19 tax consequences of transferring funds an amount withdrawn from one in 12month period and rolled over to another on behalf of the same beneficiary or certain of their family members is not taxable20 rollovers are useful for number of other reasons by making samebeneficiary rollover the type of investment can be changed in addition amounts transferred between accounts are excluded from the annual contribution limit the transfer of account funds to younger family member extends the period during which deposits can be made and taxdeferred earnings can accumulate thus while the original beneficiarys account balance might be too low to offset much private school tuition room and board etc the transferred funds could immediately bolster the account balance and thereby be of greater use to other family members eg the original beneficiarys younger sibling balances remaining in when beneficiaries reach age 30 or die whichever is earlier generally must be distributed and the earnings included in the beneficiarys or the estates income21 if however account balances of beneficiaries under age 30 are rolled into accounts of other family members or if account balances are transferred to other family members upon the original beneficiaries death there are tax consequences rather than transferring funds between of the same beneficiary or to other family members the beneficiary of an may be changed the particular trust or custodial account must permit this action to be taken as in the case of rollovers the new beneficiary must be member of the original beneficiarys family interaction with qualified tuition plans qtps starting after december 31 2001 contributions can be made to an and to qtp on behalf of the same beneficiary qtp allows contributions to grow taxdeferred and funds to be withdrawn taxfree if used to pay qualified higher education expenses22 thus funds may now accumulate simultaneously in an and qtp with family perhaps using the former for k12 expenses and the latter for higher education expenses if funds from an are used to pay k12 expenses and the beneficiary 19 colorado florida maine virginia west virginia and utah consider groups of homeschools to be private schools but individual homeschools in these states are not deemed private schools according to the home school legal defense association 20 one rollover is allowed per during the 12month period ending on the date of the payment or withdrawal family members are the original beneficiarys spouse children grandchildren and stepchildren brothers sisters stepbrothers stepsisters parents stepparents and grandparents aunts and uncles nieces and nephews sonsinlaw daughtersinlaw fathersinlaw mothersinlaw brothersinlaw and sistersinlaw spouses of the aforementioned individuals and first cousins of the original beneficiary 21 the age limit does not apply to special needs beneficiaries 22 for more information see crs report rl31214 saving for college through qualified tuition section 529 programs by linda levine crs10 goes to college any balance remaining in the account could be used toward the beneficiarys higher education expenses or transferred to the beneficiarys qtp some have suggested that rather than drawing upon collegebound students to pay k12 expenses the account should be allowed to continue to grow about the time child starts elementary school for example 2000 contribution made each year for six years to an that earned 6 per year would have grown to just 13951 with the great majority of the balance accounted for by contributions the preferential tax treatment accorded would produce only 313 in additional interest for family in the 15 tax bracket and only 578 in additional interest for family in the 25 tax bracket23 thus the expansion of the tax deferral to saving for k12 expenses generally and elementary school expenses particularly appears to be of limited immediate value to families observations because the preferential tax treatment of is worth more to higher income families they may be more likely to establish them than lower income families higher income families also may be more likely to set up because they have greater propensity to save than do lower income families the 220000 income ceiling on contributions by joint tax filers suggests that very affluent families would not be subsidized however as previously noted others may contribute the full 2000 annually to the of dependent children in families whose income is in the phaseout range in contrast the tax provision is of benefit to families with such low incomes that they are unable to save or b do not pay tax on savings because their incomes are completely offset by the standard deduction and personaldependent exemptions it thus appears that expansion of to k12 school expenses will be of more assistance to higher than to lower income families although the taxdeferred savings accounts will enable families to accumulate more money for k12 education expenses than they otherwise would have the amount of the tax benefit is probably too small to affect familys decision about whether to send their children to public or private school the influence of the on familys choice of school will be even less significant if the account is drawn upon for elementary school expenses and if less than the maximum is contributed each year in terms of school choice then the main outcome of extending the to pay for k12 education expenses may be to slightly subsidize higher income families who might have sent their children to private school anyway review of proposals for k12 education tax subsidies several tax proposals have been offered in recent congresses to further help families offset some of the costs associated with enrolling their children in the k12 23 with taxfree treatment the investment would have grown by 1951 if family with 15 marginal tax rate instead had to pay tax annually on the investment the gain would have totaled 1638 for family with 28 tax rate 1373 the calculation assumes that the entire 2000 contribution is deposited into the at the end of each year starting in the year the child is born through the year the child reaches age 5 crs11 school of their choice some bills would have created nonrefundable tax credit and others refundable tax credit in general refundable credit is not limited by the taxpayers regular tax liability the taxpayer may receive the full value of the credit for given income even if it exceeds hisher liability24 for example if family had regular tax liability of 1000 and 1400 refundable credit the credit would eliminate the liability and the internal revenue service irs would send the taxpayer check for the remaining 400 in contrast nonrefundable credit is generally limited by the taxpayers regular tax liability thus if family had regular tax liability of 1000 and single nonrefundable credit of 1400 the credit would eliminate the liability but the taxpayer would not receive the outstanding balance if the taxpayer had several nonrefundable credits the regular tax liability limitation would apply to all of them taken together25 proposals to amend existing tax benefits mirroring the coverdell legislative history some bills would extend already existing tax benefits to k12 education expenses the provisions that would be expanded are the hope scholarship credit and the higher education deducation the hope scholarship credit currently applies to the qualified tuition and related higher education expenses of each eligible student in the taxpayers family26 the nonrefundable credit may be claimed for 100 of the first 1000 of qualified expenses and for 50 of the next 1000 indexed for inflation eligible students are defined as those enrolled on at least halftime basis in higher education program leading to degree certificate or credential eligible students cannot have completed their first two years of undergraduate education and the credit can only be claimed for the first two years of postsecondary school eligibility to claim the credit is phased out for individuals with modified agis in 2005 between 43000 and 53000 between 87000 and 107000 for joint filers legislation has been introduced to expand the hope credits definition of qualified tuition and related expenses to include k12 school expenses as defined for it also would make explicit that homeschools are to be considered schools for purposes of the credit additionally it would define qualified k12 education expenses to include contributions or gifts to the school other than the homeschool that the taxpayers dependent attends 24 regular tax liability is determined by multiplying taxable income by the appropriate tax rate taxable income is derived by subtracting abovetheline deductions or adjustments to determine adjusted gross income and then subtracting from adjusted gross income the greater of the standard or itemized deductions and personaldependency exemptions 25 unused portions of certain nonrefundable personal credits may be carried forward to subsequent years 26 for information on the hope scholarship credit see crs report rl31129 higher education tax credits and deduction an overview of the benefits and their relationship to traditional student aid by adam stoll and linda levine hereafter cited as crs report rl31129 higher education tax credits and deduction crs12 similarly another proposal would build on the higher education deduction which is the abovetheline deduction for college tuition and fees27 an abovethe line deduction may be taken by taxpayers whether or not they itemize deductions this approach would allow individuals with modified agis not exceeding 20000 40000 if filing jointly to deduct qualified k12 expenses of up to 3000 per return qualified expenses are defined as those of except that the k12 deduction would exclude room and board and would explicitly include expenses incurred in connection with enrollment or attendance at homeschool as determined under state law proposals to authorize new tax benefits credits for families that incur k12 education expenses third bill would authorize refundable credit of up to 2500 for qualified elementary school educational expenses and up to 3500 for secondary school educational expenses for each qualifying child28 attending an elementary or secondary school as defined under the elementary and secondary education act or any private parochial or religious school organized to provide elementary andor secondary education educational expenses would include tuition and fees computers educational software computer support services and books required for instruction academic tutoring special needs services fees charged for transportation provided by private schools and academic testing services qualified expenses would be reduced by any payments toward them made from an fees for nonacademic purposes eg uniforms and nonacademic afterschool activities would not be treated as qualified expenses the value of the credit would phase out for single filers whose modified agis exceeded 75000 150000 in the case of joint filers in its fy2003 and fy2004 budget requests the administration also included authorization of refundable tax credit of 50 of the first 5000 of qualifying educational expenses ie up to 2500 per child for certain costs associated with attendance at schools of choice for children assigned to public schools that have not made adequate yearly progress ayp29 similar legislation was introduced to allow an individual to claim refundable credit of 50 of the first 5000 ie up to 2500 per dependent enrolled in private school or another public k12 school because child otherwise would have been assigned to public school identified for improvement under esea title ia eligible schools would have included any 27 for tax year 2005 individuals with modified agis of up to 65000 130000 for joint filers can deduct maximum of 4000 per return in higher education expenses higher income individuals with modified agis that exceed 65000 but are below 80000 130000 and 160000 respectively for joint filers can deduct up to 2000 per return for 2005 this temporary provision expired on dec

scholarship organizations the exact form of proposals to allow nonrefundable credits to taxpayers who make contributions to organizations that award scholarships to k12 students has differed from one congress to the next some bills have been more generous than others in the amount of the credit that could be claimed some would allow corporations in addition to individuals to claim the credit many proposals have specified that the groups awarding grants variously called school tuition organizations scholarship granting organizations and educational investment organizations must operate as section 501c3 organizations which were discussed earlier in this reports section on charitable contributions typically the bills have not limited scholarship eligibility to k12 students based upon family income30 some would allow the organizations to make grants not only to students but also to public and private schools including in some instances homeschools while some proposals have maintained the existing definition of taxfree scholarships others would extend use of the awards to some or all esaqualified expenses see the earlier discussion in this report on scholarships and one bill would authorize federal tax credit of up to 100 for single filers 200 for joint filers for contributions to education investment organizations made by taxpayers in states that authorize the

cndlunchaboutlunchnslpfactsheetpdf visited jan 26 2006 crs14 analysis of proposals for tax subsidies to expand school choice those who would use the federal tax code to give more families the opportunity to exercise school choice face several interrelated issues first they might want to design the tax benefit to enable families who would not otherwise have done so to send their children to public school alternatives as previously noted concern about the education savings approach embodied in the coverdell is that families with limited resources have to use much of their current earnings for consumption rather than putting aside money for their childrens future education second the value of the subsidy would need to be large enough to make private schools truly affordable for families on tight budgets but not so large that the provisions cost to taxpayers is prohibitive and third the question arises as to whether creating new tax benefit to encourage school choice activates the same concerns that have hampered other initiatives to authorize federally funded voucher program equity windfalls and the affordability of private schools equity refundable tax credit would take the incidence of income tax liability out of the equation in determining which families may claim the benefit all families with qualified k12 expenses would be entitled to claim the full amount of the credit regardless of how much or how little income tax they owe the government the government would forgo revenue from families whose tax liabilities equal or exceed qualified k12 school expenses it would draw upon the us treasury to pay families the amount by which their eligible education expenses exceeds their income tax liabilities the refundability feature thus provides lowincome families the same opportunity as other families to make use of k12 education credit nonrefundable credit might not be of much help to lowincome families because one must have an income tax liability against which to apply eligible expenses as nonrefundable credit could enable all taxpayers regardless of their marginal tax rates to get the same tax savings from the same amount of qualified expenses it might be considered more equitable than deduction31 the overall limitation on nonrefundable credits in the tax code could reduce the usefulness of nonrefundable k12 education credit for those families with small tax bills and large competing credits however if the total of such nonrefundable credits eg the hope scholarship and lifetime learning credits meets or exceeds familys income tax liability the family would be unable to make use of k12 education credit32 31 deduction reduces the amount of income against which tax is imposed and therefore its value ie how much it lowers income tax liability depends on taxpayers marginal tax rate as in the case of nonrefundable credit taxpayers without income tax liabilities could not claim deduction either abovetheline or itemized among those taxpayers with liabilities generally the higher the individuals marginal tax rate ie the higher their agi the larger the tax savings conferred by deduction 32 an abovetheline k12 education deduction also could eliminate or reduce tax liability against which to apply existing nonrefundable credits crs15 the other bills that offer nonrefundable credits for contributions to stos or education investment organizations would confer tax benefits on individuals who make contributions benefitting other peoples children in some instances portion of the scholarship funds would target children in lowincome families recent proposal would specifically prohibit contributors from designating the beneficiaries of scholarships funded by their contributions leaving that responsibility to the section 501c3 organizations that operate the scholarship programs33 targeting tax benefits to certain families depending upon its design k12 education tax benefit could be made available to all families that incur qualified expenses or primarily to those families who would otherwise have had difficulty enrolling their children in the schools of their choice some of the proposals for tax benefits would limit windfalls ie subsidizing individuals for actions they would have undertaken anyway by limiting eligibility to individuals with incomes below specified amount to individuals with children otherwise eligible for particular means tested government programs or to individuals with children currently or recently enrolled in certain types of public schools to target the tax benefit on families that would encounter financial difficulties if they were to send their children to private schools some proposals would limit eligibility to claim the benefit or to receive scholarships funded by the benefit to families with incomes below threshold amount or whose children receive or are eligible to receive free or reducedprice school meals the income limits for eligibility to receive free or reducedprice meals generally are lower than the income limits contained in many tax credit proposals that directly include an income criterion one proposal for example would have focused eligibility on families whose children in the previous year attended title ia school that has been identified for improvement under esea title ia and who would be assigned to the same or another school so identified for the current academic year the credit thus would have been available only to those families whose children were assigned to schools not meeting specific educational accountability requirements some view this targeting mechanism as proxy for income based on the assumption that few higher income families will be eligible for the credit because they may be less likely than poorer families to have children in title ia schools especially those that fail to meet esea title ia accountability requirements others suggest that as implementation of the esea title ia accountability requirements proceeds increasing numbers of title ia schools will be identified for improvement and such tax credit proposal could have somewhat broader focus than relatively low income families 33 according to federal regulation an organization is not operated solely for charitable purposes if it benefits private interests such as designated persons or the organizations founder andor family members this is referred to as the inurement of benefit test crs16 the affordability of private schools as discussed earlier qualified expenses for which families could claim k12 education credit generally have been broadly defined to include costs in addition to tuition still if tax benefit were to be claimed for the costs of sending child to school of choice the greatest expense to family likely would be tuition data on private school tuition suggest that in many instances tuition alone would exceed the maximum amounts of many proposed k12 education tax credits which often have been for between 2500 and 3500 per child also if the average reported csf scholarship of 1246 were to be viewed as indicative of the value of scholarships that initially might be funded through credit for charitable contributions to stos then such scholarship might fall short of typical private school tuition34 however the value of scholarships awarded by stos cannot be estimated from the amount contributed because stos presumably would have the flexibility to balance the value of scholarships against the number granted among private schools catholic schools often have comparatively lower tuition levels data for the 20042005 school year show that the average tuition at catholic elementary school was 2432 and at catholic high school 587035 other private schools particularly independent private schools typically have much higher tuition levels tuition data for independent day schools show that for the 20042005 school year median tuition for grades 1 and 3 was 12783 for grades 6 and 8 14475 and for grades 9 and 12 1602536 with the addition of other education expenses commonly associated with private school attendance eg fees for uniforms transportation and other purposes even tax benefit of as high as 3500 in many instances would fall short of familys total annual cost however subsidizing portion of k12 education expenses could be sufficient for families on the margin of affording private school education to decide to transfer their children from public to private schools or to retain their children in private schools also some believe that having families pay portion of private school costs might have the advantageous effect of increasing parents involvement in their childrens education37 the prospect of partial coverage of education costs might not only limit tax benefits utility to lower income families but also likely would affect the type of 34 according to csf the typical family contribution above the scholarship amount is

example under the cleveland scholarship and tutoring program the voucher covers either 90 or 75 of tuition up to 3450 depending on family income parents must pay the difference between the scholarship amount and actual school tuition and this payment may be made either in cash or in the form of inkind contributions crs17 schools families select catholic and other religiously affiliated schools generally charge lower tuition than other private schools religiously affiliated schools often are able to do so because many of their operating and facilities costs are subsidized by charitable contributions and because some staff may work for comparatively lower wages out of devotion to serve the faith or may have portion of their salaries paid by the church rather than by the school for example the national catholic educational association ncea reports that average catholic school tuition represented only 61 of actual perpupil costs of 3998 at elementary schools in school year 20042005 whereas average freshmen secondary school tuition represented 82 of perpupil costs of 720038 other private schools also subsidize tuition with funds provided from endowments although typically to lesser extent than catholic schools for example in 20042005 median tuition at independent day schools represented 92 of total expenses39 nonetheless the typically lower tuition of religiously affiliated schools might make them more attractive to families compared with either nonsectarian private schools or outofboundary public schools which also usually charge comparatively high tuition while some of the proposals for k12 education tax credits have called for reimbursing families for their educational expenses on dollarfordollar basis up to specified limit others call for offsetting share of expenses incurred under some proposals for example family would need to have incurred 5000 in expenses to claim the maximum benefit of 2500 per child given the requirement that families absorb large share of education costs proposals of this design likely would benefit families with higher incomes who have greater ability to make substantial up front expenditures more so than lower income families the cost to the federal government the administrations proposal is the only k12 education tax benefit for which budget effects have been developed for qualified expenses incurred beginning with the 20032004 school year and extending through the 20072008 school year the treasury department estimated that the credit could have receipt and outlay effects of 33 billion over the same period40 joint committee on taxation jct estimated that the presidents proposal would cost 372 million through fy2008 in the form of revenue forgone and refunds41 the marked difference

the government is expected to be in refunds to families with little or income tax liability which reflects the expectation that substantial share of lowincome families will be financially able to pay up to 5000 in qualified expenses in order to later get back up to 2500 the jct appears less persuaded that very many families with children in failing schools possess the financial resources that would enable them to incur educational expenses for which they would only be partially reimbursed sometime later the other proposals would condition eligibility for k12 education credit on the school that child initially attended that is to say families with children in public and private schools including in some cases homeschools also would have been eligible for tax benefit if they purchased computers or employed the services of academic tutors among other things the sheer number of eligible families could result in much larger tax expenditure on the part of the government the bills that would not have conditioned eligibility for k12 education credit on the type of k12 school attended could nonetheless encourage school choice because their definitions of qualified expenses include tuition the bills very broad definitions also could have made k12 education more affordable for families with children between about 5 and 18 years old in addition they could promote greater educational equity among those families whose children are enrolled in public schools for example as result of the tax benefit more lowincome families of public school students might be able to afford computer for their children to use at home however the availability of tax benefit with many types of qualified expenses beyond tuition might prompt some higher income families to buy faster computer with more memory larger monitor and better speakers than their children actually need for educational purposes this unintended behavior and the heightened cost to government that would accompany it could be greater in the case of credit or deduction than in the case of the coverdell where people are largely spending the money they contributed to the savings vehicle new k12 education tax benefit could well impose costs that extend beyond the federal budget it might place an added burden on the irs including the drafting of new or amended tax forms and the issuance of regulations the design in some bills could be more onerous than others if administered properly for example the administrations proposal would limit use of the credit to students in failing schools presumably the irs would have to verify that schools fit the definition to ensure that only legitimate claims were paid similarly some proposals would target students eligible for free and reducedprice school meals for scholarships here the educational investment organizations and the irs might have to determine for themselves from the income figures on families tax returns whether their children are eligible for the taxfree scholarships or require that leas provide families with documentation of their childrens eligibility for submission to stos and inclusion with their tax forms not all leas currently provide documentation k12 education tax benefit also could impose costs on eligible families to the extent the abovedescribed proposals define terms differently from their current definition in the irc it could cause confusion among tax filers overlapping definitions of qualified expenses between the and new k12 education tax crs19 benefit also could make it difficult for families to decide when to use funds from their accounts and when to claim credit the complexity of tax filing could increase as well due to the typical requirement that the use of tax subsidies be coordinated ie double benefit in addition recordkeeping burdens would increase as taxpayers would have to substantiate qualified expenses under those bills that cover tutoring for example parents who want to claim tax benefit might switch from employing an older fulltime student to employing someone more able to provide them with whatever documentation the irs requires42 voucher issues revisited tax benefit for k12 school expenses is viewed by its proponents as way to avoid some of the controversies associated with vouchers including federal funding and regulation of private sectarian and nonsectarian schools whether tax credit has these advantages over voucher could depend upon whether it is refundable or nonrefundable from an economic perspective both refundable credit and voucher redistribute public funds either through tax expenditures or appropriations to lowincome families thus some might assert that the federal government could use the issuance of refund checks drawn on revenue collected from all taxpayers as justification for expanding its oversight of elementary and secondary education to private schools the government might for example take steps to ensure that lowincome and minority children are afforded adequate access to private schools it also might impose on private schools accountability requirements similar to those recently required of all public schools under the esea and of private school students served under title ia proponents of nonrefundable k12 education tax credit argue that it should be regarded as taxpayers retaining their own money because claim is made on someone elses wallet it allegedly would not provide the government an opportunity for further regulation of elementary and secondary education43 similar logic often is applied to nonrefundable credits and churchstate separation because nonrefundable credit allows taxpayers to keep some of their own income the money does not enter the public coffer and thus does not reflect government support of religion44 others do not support this interpretation of tax expenditures the impact on public and private k12 education some contend that authorization of k12 education tax benefit would foster competition among schools to attract student and their families leading to improved school quality for private and public schools alike and greater equity in access to private schools for students of different socioeconomic backgrounds however not everyone shares the notion that competition would positively affect overall school 42 joint committee on taxation description of revenue provisions

some also are concerned that k12 education tax benefit especially one that would not cover the full cost of tuition and expenses might keep private schools beyond the reach of lower income students marketoriented competition it is argued that providing families with tax benefit that allows them to enroll their children in the school of their choice will stimulate competition among public and private schools that will lead to improvement in overall quality45 for example schools that prove attractive to parents because they offer higher quality education per dollar of spending would be expected to draw students away from less productive schools as result either lower achieving schools would close their doors replaced by the more efficient schools or they would succeed by increasing their productivity and maintaining their student bodies either way the reasoning goes school choice could improve the quality of k12 education for all students whether enrolled in public or private schools46 to degree competition and choice already exist in the k12 education marketplace some metropolitan areas are served by multiple school districts and private schools exist along side regular public schools wealthier families and those who place premium on education thus can determine which are the best schools for their children and send them there either by residing in the attendance area of the selected public school or by paying tuition to enroll their children in private school those with fewer financial resources are less likely to be able to locate in district with highquality public schools or to send their children to alternatives to regular public schools some proponents of marketbased reforms believe that providing new tax benefit for educational expenses will create more level playing field among families others dispute the idea that market competition would lead to more equitable k12 education markets47 some assert that tax credit or deduction that is not well targeted for instance on lowincome families could induce additional middle and upper income families to enroll their children in private schools this in turn could shut out lower income students access to the available spaces especially if the tax benefit does not cover educational expenses in full children from lowincome 45 for review of range of studies investigating the effects of

classmates with relatively more children from middle and upper income families attending nonpublic schools those who hold this viewpoint argue support for the funding of public schools could waver and the quality of public education could deteriorate especially in areas with high proportion of lowincome children while critics of new tax benefit thus believe it would exacerbate rather than ameliorate inequities in the quality of education available to children of different segments of society others suggest that education markets operating under voucher program could lead to decreased residential segregation and ultimately to increased equity48 not only do students compete for schools but schools also compete for students at present nonpublic schools may selectively admit students giving preference for example to those who score well on admissions exams whose siblings currently are enrolled in the schools or who are members of particular religious denomination many private schools do not offer costly programs that serve special needs students nor are they required to private schools also can dismiss students for unruly behavior more easily than can public schools different types of schools vary in their admissions policies member schools of the nais for example currently accept approximately 53 of all applicants49 conversely nearly all catholic schools are open admissions though many are oversubscribed small number of public schools admit students on competitive basis the increased competition that new tax benefit could foster might according to some observers lead to sorting among schools based on the characteristics of the students they serve if it were more efficient for schools to tailor their academic programs to fairly homogeneous student body eg with like abilities or interests they might limit the programs offered with different schools targeting different students for example some schools might offer international baccalaureate and advanced placement programs while others might focus on basic skills or vocational programs private schools might opt to admit the easiest to educate students ie skim and defer to public schools the obligation to serve those who are more costly or difficult to educate eg disadvantaged students students with disabilities and students with behavioral problems others suggest however that private schools would accept diverse student bodies out of service to the community some of these potential market effects likely would vary according to the characteristics of the new k12 education tax benefit for example if credit or deduction were large enough to cover nearly all the costs of attending private school and if eligibility were limited to lowincome students certain effects described

limiting eligible schools to those that do not discriminate among students in admissions and by requiring that students be admitted on the basis of lottery when schools are oversubscribed while the imposition of additional statutory limitations on the eligibility of families might buffer some of the potential negative consequences of market competition it also might impede some of its anticipated benefits50 supply and demand effects as noted earlier new k12 education tax benefit would allow families to apply portion of their income toward educational expenses that they otherwise would have applied toward taxes consequently the demand for private school education could increase in the shortrun and produce an increase in the supply of private school education in the longrun private schools could accommodate the immediate demand shock fairly easily in areas with excess capacity as happened with the voucher programs in cleveland and milwaukee in those areas in which the initial spike in demand surpasses the currently available supply families potentially could face waiting lists sustained demand for private school education eventually could be expected to lead to the opening of more private schools51 tuition in new private schools might be somewhat higher than currently charged because as previously noted many private schools use charitable contributions and endowments to set tuition substantially below the cost of the education they provide if more private schools opened however they could dilute these funds and consequently raise tuition to some degree
