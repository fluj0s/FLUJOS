important component of future global tsunami warning capability in january 2005 president bush proposed to expand us tsunami detection and early warning coverage implementing that plan was expected to cost almost 30 million dollars to build the infrastructure for detection and warning and maintain operations over the longterm some us lawmakers argued that the benefits far outweighed the costs however others questioned whether the risks of tsunamis outside the pacific basin justified the investment in july 2005 president bush released plan to expand the us network from its currently operating six deep ocean assessment and reporting of tsuna dart buoys to planned 39 for monitoring the pacific and atlantic oceans gulf of mexico and caribbean sea congress passed emergenc appropriations for fy 2005 and approved funding through fy2007 to procure and deploy comprehensive detection and warning network amounts allocated for fy2006 abled the national weather service to begin expansion of the network and pr ovided for longerterm operations and maintenance for fy2008 the president re quested funding to complete the us network also the 109th congress passed the tsunami warning and education act pl 109424 addressing tsuna mirelated social issues some developed countries around the indian ocean were operating tsunami warning systems when the 2004 disaster occu rred but they guarde d only their pacific shores disaster management experts contend that any warning system is most useful where there are expansive regional or localbased emergency management capabilities some areas devastated by the tsunami lacked local communication infrastructure to disseminate tsunami warnings leaving officials incapable of rapidly alerting populations to evacuate or to take appropriate safety pr ecautions experts assert that emergency planning is not only about issuing warnings but also educating indigenous people and visitors about ts unami dangers communicating evacuation options clearly and adapting to potential ri sks this report will not be updated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32739contents introduction 1 g l b l t s u n m i r l w r n i n g s s t m 3 c h l l

monitoring detection and early warning systems introduction on december 26 2004 tsunami disaster was triggered by an underwater earthquake off the west coast of northern sumatra in indonesia1 based on physical evidence of displacement of the sea floor us seismologists determined the earthquake to have been mw 922 the ensuing tsunami devastated many coastal areas around the northern indian ocean and with the earthquake caused economic upheaval in many areas international disaster agencies estimated that more than 220000 people may have lost their lives as direct result of the tsunami3 the disaster prompted some members of the 109th congress to raise questions about 1 the possibility of tsunamis occurring in us coastal areas 2 the extent to which these areas are currently monitored 3 how tsunamis might be detected and 4 whether there is national capacity to issue evacuation warnings for tsunamis on january 5 2005 the house science committee the house coastal caucus and the house

to warn populations locally some nations affected by the tsunami in cluding australia and indonesia did have tsunami early warning systems but they m onitored only their p acific shores where they perceived the greatest threat5 due to the geographic proximity of many human settlements to where the tsunami was ge nerated and without ability to receive tsunami warnings rapidly postdisaster assessments indicate that for indonesias indian ocean coastal populations emer gency communications would have been useless in many cases other findings show that many indigenous people and tourists were not educated about the dangers of tsunamis or aware of the physical warning signs of an onset of tsunami also for some communities backup procedure to issue evacuation alerts was included in local or regional emergency plans if lifelines such as electric utilities and telecommunications were disrupted6 on january 29 2005 the house committee on science and on february 2 2005 the senate

newfoundland killing 51 people it wa s the third lethal tsunami for canadas atlantic coast within 150 years8 global tsunami early warning system in the wake of the 2004 tsunami disaster in the indian ocean many international agencies expected that there would be technical financial and political challenges to overcome before multinational tsunami early warning network could be established for the indian ocean or othe r international earthqua keprone areas such as the black sea in some ways those veloped nations that had the resources and capability to establish their own regional emergency management networks for disaster warning and those who had execute d comprehensive disaster plans were able to avoid some of the challenges challenges after the indian ocean tsunami disaster international science agencies called for an inventory of existing capacity for tsunami monitoring detection and warning systems that would be conducted under the auspices of the united nations that inventory would provide baseline from which outstanding requirements for such network would be determin ed government policy anal ysts raised technological and national security issues as conseque nce of building and sharing truly global tsunami early warning network technolog ical issues included international standards for tsunami warning instrument ation data collecti on and communications protocols required of systems that would r eceive data and relay warnings national security issues included proposed open access to and sabotage of international telecommunication networks also us intelligence experts were concerned that certain data collected could be consider ed sensitive and might reveal methodologies that could compromise us and other nations intelligencegathering operations development of truly global tsunami early warning system with capability for issuing regional and local warnings has required involvement of many nations with widely varying technological cap abilities and financial resources reports indicate that international political leaders expected th at most of the responsibility for paying for such system would fall on the wealthiest nations resources to procure stateoftheart m onitoring and detection tec hnology including scientific instruments platforms and communications networks to sustain international cost sharing and to provide longterm operations and maintenance of such systems appear to be the most critical obstacle toward achieving collaborative international effort for tsunami detection and early warning at january 2005

approved 81 million for the usgs national earthquake information center neic in golden co to upgrade the global seismic network gsn and to increase the number of gsn instruments capable of relaying realtime seismic data funding was also included to hire additional staff for the neic to interpret gsn data around the clock at that time only 80 of the 127 instruments in the gsn had realtime telemetry capability conferees noted that gsn seismic data are critical for nws tsunami warning centers in making determination whether there is potential for tsunami to be generated tsunamigenesis
