on dod intelligence agencies updated february 11 2005 richard best jr specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress intelligence community reorganization potential effects on dod intelligence agencies summary although the central intelligence agency cia is the best known member of the intelligence community the bulk of the nations intelligence effort is undertaken by the intelligence agencies of the department of defense dod in particular the national security agency nsa the national reconnaissance office nro and the national geospatialintelligence agency nga formerly known as the national imagery and mapping agency nima are major collectors of information for dod and nondod consumers and absorb large percentage of the annual intelligence budget the defense intelligence agency dia albeit large and important component of the intelligence community is more directly focused on dod requirements some members of congress and independent commissions most recently the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission have argued that lack of coordination among intelligence agencies contributed to the failure to provide warning of the terrorist attacks of september 2001 in response in december 2004 congress passed intelligence reform legislation pl 108458 that modifies the existing organization of the intelligence community and establishes more centralized leadership under newly created director of national intelligence dni as the legislation was being debated in the fall of 2004 attention focused on the extent of the budgetary and administrative authorities to be assigned to the dni significant concerns were expressed by dod officials some members of congress and various outside observers that providing the dni with greater authority and control of intelligence agencies in dod could jeopardize the increasingly close relationship between these agencies and the operating military forces the conference committee on intelligence reform legislation s 2845 addressed these concerns with language that gave the dni substantial authorities over intelligence budgets but not operational control over their activities the final version of the legislation also provided that the details of budgetary authorities to be exercised by the dni and other cabinet officers be worked out in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the president after the dni is appointed this report will be updated as circumstances warrant contents intelligence

community reorganization potential effects on dod intelligence agencies although the central intelligence agency cia is the best known component of the us intelligence community the intelligence agencies of the department of defense dod account for the bulk of intelligence spending and intelligence personnel the national security agency nsa the national reconnaissance office nro the national geospatialintelligence agency nga the defense intelligence agency dia and the intelligence elements of the four military services work around the world to collect and analyze information for consumers in the white house federal agencies the congress and dod itself including military units down to tactical levels collectively their budgets are far larger than that of cia because they are major collectors of electronic intelligence that relies on multiple intercept sites and reconnaissance satellites they employ many more personnel military and civilian and at least in terms of quantity produce far more intelligence reports and analyses than the cia1 until the passage of recent legislation the director of central intelligence dci has had the statutory authority to establish priorities for collection and analysis for all national intelligence agencies and to forward an annual intelligence budget to the president but he has not had control of the execution of budgets beyond that of the cia nor could he transfer funds or personnel from one agency to another over the objection of cabinet officers for some years there were proposals to give the dci greater authority to manage the activities of all intelligence agencies including those in dod many observers suggested that earlier proposals were not enacted because of concerns by dod and some members of the armed services committees that such an initiative would weaken the ability of the secretary of defense to manage resources considered essential to carrying out dods statutory missions in the wake of the september 11 2001 attacks and flawed estimates about weapons of mass destruction wmd in iraq there were renewed calls for intelligence reform or reorganization to remedy perceived shortcomings in the performance of intelligence agencies some members of congress argued that there was need to establish director of national intelligence dni or national intelligence director nid or to enhance the authorities of the dci with the goal of 1 the intelligence efforts of the state commerce homeland security and energy departments and the federal bureau of investigation fbi are much smaller and focused on analysis they do not acquire or operate extensive and expensive technical collection systems crs2 ensuring better coordination similar recommendations were strongly urged by the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission president bush announced his support for creating the position of national intelligence director on august 2 2004 after lengthy consideration the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 hereafter the intelligence reform act pl 108458 was signed on december 17 2004 the act abolished the position of dci establishing in its stead the dni and separate director of the cia this report will briefly describe the intelligence agencies of the defense department address their roles in the intelligence community and within dod and note the role of the recently established position of under secretary of defense for intelligence usdi it will look at current approaches to intelligence reorganization and discuss the possible implications of adopting them intelligence agencies of the department of defense defense intelligence agency established in 1961 dia manages the defense attache system and other human intelligence humint collection efforts in addition dia is responsible for the analysis of information from all sources in response to requirements established by the dni by the office of the secretary of defense osd and other dod officials dia provides analytical support to senior defense officials to the joint chiefs of staff combatant commanders and joint task forces worldwide the national reconnaissance office established in 1960 the nro designs builds and operates the reconnaissance satellites that collect images of the earths surface and signals information while the nro is dod agency it is staffed by both dod and cia personnel the national security agency established in 1952 nsa has two primary missions developing codes to protect the security of official us communications and providing signals intelligence sigint nsa collects processes and analyzes foreign signals in order to support national policymakers and the operational forces the national geospatialintelligence agency the nga established in 1996 and originally known as the national imagery and mapping agency nima provides geospatial intelligence imagery imagery intelligence and geospatial data and information to dod users and other officials responsible for national security geospatial information includes topographic hydrographic and other data referenced to precise locations on the earths surface crs3 intelligence elements of the military services the army navy air force and marine corps have their own intelligence components that are in general not intelligence collection agencies but process and analyze data and disseminate intelligence to their respective operating forces national intelligence missions of defense agencies the role of the dci three of these agencies the nro nsa and the nga have significant responsibilities for collecting intelligence of concern to agencies outside dod these three agencies more directly support nationallevel decisionmakers than do the intelligence organizations of the four military services and even dia their efforts are described as national as opposed to departmental or tactical senior policymakers often have significantly different intelligence needs than military consumers although there is considerable overlap for instance national policymakers are directly concerned with implications of nuclear test programs in countries that are of immediate concern to military commanders whereas the latter could be focused on tactical threats to operations long underway that are not the focus of highlevel policymakers national intelligence is the term used for intelligence that is of concern to more than one department or agency and provides the basis for national security policymaking beginning in the 1960s generation of arms control agreements between the us and the soviet union was based on satellite imagery that allowed us policymakers to be confident of their estimates of soviet military capabilities more recently national systems have permitted policymakers to monitor such crucial developments as transfers of wmds ethnic cleansing in various countries and indications of narcotics traffic inasmuch as national systems are expensive and therefore not available in unlimited quantities procedures have been developed to sort out priorities for coverage the dci had statutory authority to develop collection and analysis priorities in response to national security council nsc guidance generally priorities have been sorted out by interagency committees working through the dcis community management staff of the intelligence community and the assistant dci for collection to be implemented by nationallevel agencies including nsa the nro and the nga2 the efforts of nsa the nro and the nga have been funded as parts of the national foreign intelligence program nfip3 the annual budget for which the dci 2 50 usc 4034d 3 nfip is defined at 50 usc401a6 funding for cia and dia is also provided through the nfip by pl 108458 section 1074 the nfip becomes the national intelligence program nip crs4 annually develops and presents to the president4 the dci also has had authority to transfer funds and for periods up to year personnel among nfip programs with the approval of the director of the office of management and budget and affected agency heads the secretary of defense was required to obtain the concurrence of the dci before recommending individuals for appointment as head of the nro nsa and the nga if the dci did not concur the secretary of defense might still recommend an individual to the president but he had to include in the recommendation statement that the dci did not concur5 the 2004 intelligence reform act provides that the dni will be responsible for developing and determining the nip budget and gives himher authority to manage appropriations by directing the allotment or allocation of such funds with prior notice to agency heads the dni also has authority to reprogram funds under certain conditions and if the transfer out of any one department or agency is less than 150 million in single year and is less than 5 percent of the amounts available to the agency or department the dni will also have certain limited authorities to transfer intelligence personnel from one agency to another national intelligence missions of defense agencies the role of the secretary of defense in addition to responding to tasking in support of national policymakers all defense agencies are closely involved in directly supporting operating military forces the secretary of defense has statutory responsibilities for the effective functioning of national intelligence agencies in dod6 in addition statutes require that the agencies be prepared to participate in joint training exercises and establish uniform reporting systems to strengthen their readiness to support operating forces with respect to war or threat to national security7 the defense departments view of the central role of intelligence is evident in its most recent planning document joint vision 2020 the evolution of information technology will increasingly permit us to integrate the traditional forms of information operations with sophisticated allsource intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance in fully synchronized information campaign the development of concept labeled the global information grid will provide the networkcentric environment required to achieve this goal the grid will be the globally interconnected endtoend set of

warfighters policy makers and support personnel8 national intelligence is now an essential part of dods planning and operational capabilities and since the persian gulf war has become thoroughly integrated into combat operations one media account of the role of nationallevel agencies during recent hostilities in iraq concluded as with imagery and earlywarning satellite constellations spacebased signals intelligence was far more responsive to tactical users in operation iraqi freedom than in earlier campaigns national security agency teams and related air force cryptologic units were forwarddeployed to the theater of operations to assist tactical commanders in accessing and interpreting signals intelligence from orbital and airbreathing sources the need to integrate intelligence resources has also become more important inasmuch as the distinction between strategic and tactical isr intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance systems gradually has melted away as military requirements shifted from the nuclear and conventional threat posed by russia to more diverse dangers arising from rogue states and terrorists9 propelled largely by the need for precise locating data to target precisionguided munitions pgms intelligence from national sources has been woven into military operations at all echelons senior dod officials and military leaders emphasize their reliance on this stream of information and argue that the national agencies need to be more responsive to their direction some observers have long argued that the focus on support to military operations by national agencies has led to reduced support for nationallevel policymakers at the state department and the nsc for instance it has been suggested that this emphasis on supporting the military was contributing factor in the intelligence communitys failure to provide advance notice of the indian nuclear test in may1998 at time when us reconnaissance satellites were primarily tasked with the support of us military forces operating in the persian gulf region10 in recent years dods intelligence effort was coordinated loosely according to some observers by the assistant secretary of defense for command control communications and intelligence asd c3i in 2002 secretary of defense donald rumsfeld sought congressional authorization to establish more senior position that of under secretary of defense for intelligence usdi provision was included to that effect in the defense authorization act for fy2003 pl 107314 section 901 8 department of defense joint chiefs of staff joint

jeremiah news conference cia press release june 2 1998 crs6 in march 2003 stephen cambone who had previously served as deputy undersecretary of defense for policy was appointed to the position and his appointment was confirmed by the senate his responsibilities include coordinating dod intelligence and intelligencerelated policy plans programs requirements and resource allocations he is to exercise authority direction and control over dia nga the nro nsa and other agencies11 he had served as single point of contact between dod and the dci on intelligence resource and policy issues12 significant responsibility of the secretary of defense is ensuring that the national intelligence programs of the nip and the joint military and tactical intelligence programs known as the joint military intelligence program jmip and tactical intelligence and related activities tiara are mutually supportive and not duplicative13 in recent years the various sets of programs have been brought into closer alignment to support national policymakers concerned with details of tactical intelligence and military commanders who need information from national systems such as satellites impetus for reform in the aftermath of the attacks of september 11 2001 number of observers as well as the joint inquiry of the two congressional intelligence committees and the 911 commission concluded that the organization and management of the intelligence community was inadequate and that as result the dci was unable to ensure that crucial information about the 911 plot was shared with analysts who might have been able to identify the threat in advance the 911 commission took note of some of the limitations of the dcis authority over the direction and priorities of the intelligence community especially its elements within the department of defense the dci has to direct agencies without controlling them he does not receive an appropriation for their activities and therefore does not control their purse strings he has little insight into how they spend their resources congress attempted to strengthen the dcis authority in 1996 by creating the positions of deputy dci for community management and assistant dcis for collection analysis and production and administration but the authority of these positions is limited and the vision of central management clearly has not been realized14 11 paul wolfowitz deputy secretary of defense memorandum for secretaries of the military departments et implementation guidance on restructuring defense intelligence and related matters may 8 2003 12 the office of the undersecretary of defense for intelligence consisting of some 120 officials has analytical role within the intelligence community all source analysis within dod is the responsibility of dia and the intelligence organizations of the military services 13 for background on this issue see crs report rl32508 intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr programs congressional oversight issues 14 911 commission report p 357 crs7 the joint inquiry of the two intelligence committees concluded that the dci was unable to establish comprehensive intelligence effort against qaeda even when the extent of the threat had become evident to the dci at least by 1998 it reported following the august 1998 bombings of two us embassies the dci placed bin ladins terrorist network among the intelligence communitys highest priorities the dci raised the status of the threat further still when he announced to cia senior managers in december 1998 we are at war with bin ladin i want resources or people spared in this effort either inside the cia or the intelligence community these were strong words rather than having galvanizing effect however the joint inquiry record suggests that the intelligence community continued to be fragmented without comprehensive strategy for combating bin ladin the joint inquiry concluded that the dci was either unable or unwilling to enforce consistent priorities and marshal resources across the community15 simply put the joint inquiry argued that although dci george tenet put the intelligence community on war footing against qaeda his writ did not run beyond the cia to other parts of the intelligence community including the major pentagon agencies accordingly the joint inquiry and the 911 commission as well as others have urged that there should be single senior official having the title director of national intelligence or national intelligence director responsible for managing the entire intelligence community including nsa the nro and the nga along with the cia and other intelligence entities management and budgetary authority has been seen as needed to control national intelligence agencies of the community the joint inquiry recommended the creation of statutory director of national intelligence with the full range of management budgetary and personnel responsibilities needed to make the entire us intelligence community operate as coherent whole these responsibilities would include establishment and enforcement of consistent priorities for the collection analysis and dissemination of intelligence throughout the intelligence community the dni would have responsibilities for the review approval modification and primary management and oversight of the execution of intelligence community budgets 16 the 911 commission recommended that national intelligence director manage the national intelligence program and oversee the agencies that contribute to it the nid would 15 us

the funds to the appropriate agencies in line with that budget and with authority to reprogram funds among the national intelligence agencies to meet any new priority as counterterrorism was in the 1990s the national intelligence director should approve and submit nominations to the president of the individuals who would lead the cia dia fbi intelligence office nsa nga nro information analysis and infrastructure protection directorate of the department of homeland security and other national intelligence capabilities17 number of bills were introduced designed create to single director of the intelligence community18 in some approaches this individual would have operational control of all intelligence agencies including those in dod other approaches envision the person filling the usdi position simultaneously serving as deputy of the dninid other versions do not precisely define the extent of the dnis authorities on august 2 2004 president bush announced his intention to seek changes in the national security act to establish national intelligence director appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate who will oversee and coordinate the foreign and domestic activities of the intelligence community19 the president indicated that the cia will be managed by separate director the administration plan apparently did not envision the nid having the authority to control the budgets of the various agencies nor would the nid singlehandedly submit nominations for agency head positions to the president20 subsequently congressional attention focused on two bills dealing with intelligence reorganization hr 10 introduced by representative hastert and s 2845 sponsored by senators collins and lieberman after extensive floor consideration and amendments s 2845 was passed by the senate on october 6th hr 10 was passed by the house on october 8th both bills would have established nid with authorities more extensive than those assigned to the dci by current legislation but there were significant differences in the area of budgetary authority as well as in regard to other issues21 as is noted below recent developments it proved difficult for the resulting conference committee to reach agreement on the language adopted by the two chambers 17 911 commission report pp 411 412 the report added that dods military intelligence programs jmip

administration proposal hr 10 current law crs9 concerns about reorganization proposals whereas there appears to be question that failure to fully correlate information in the possession of intelligence and law enforcement agencies hindered the effort to uncover the 911 plot before it occurred some observers argue that the main obstacle prior to 911 was the regulatory framework that created wall between foreign intelligence and law enforcement analysts and not organizational arrangements per from their perspective the problem in large measure involved the cia and the fbi and among dod agencies primarily nsa which had to work within the constraints of the wall in regard to surveillance of us persons the 911 commission criticized nsas almost obsessive protection of sources and methods and its focus on foreign intelligence and its avoidance of anything domestic22 it is noteworthy nevertheless that the 911 commissions list of ten missed opportunities for stopping the plot does not cite misstep by nsa or any other dod agency23 criticisms of proposals to establish dninid centered on the possibility or likelihood that they would undermine the authority of the secretary of defense over agencies that are closely integrated into the operational capabilities of the military services writing in june 2004 former dci robert gates argued that more than 80 percent of foreign intelligence dollars are spent by agencies under the control of the secretary of defense virtually all of those agencies have tactical combatrelated tasks to perform for the pentagon and the military services in addition to the roles they play under the guidance of the director of central intelligence in the real world of washington bureaucratic and congressional politics there is way the secretary of defense or the armed services committees of congress are simply going to hand those agencies over to an intelligence czar sitting in the white house indeed for the last decade intelligence authority has been quietly leaching from the cia and to the pentagon not the other way around24 bruce berkowitz who has worked with the hoover institution and the rand corporation and is currently serving as dod consultant has written proposals to yank intelligence organizations out of the defense department also overlook the role they play in combat operations today the ability to feed electronic data to units on the battlefield through digital pipelines is essential for the kind of networkstyle warfare that has proved so effective in iraq and afghanistan combat forces use more of this data than anyone else it seems odd that anyone would want to drag several intelligence organizations out of the defense department simply to create new megaorganization whose main mission would be supporting the defense department25 22 911 commission report p 88 23 ibid pp 355356 24 robert m gates racing to ruin the cia new york times june 8 2004 p 25 25 bruce berkowitz intelligence reform less is more hoover digest spring 2004 crs10 another longtime observers of us intelligence agencies richard betts of columbia university wrote in mid2004 trying to wrest the national security agency and like agencies from the defense department would leave capitol hill and pennsylvania avenue awash in blood the military services will never accept dependence on other departments for performance of their core functions which include tactical intelligence collection and politicians will not override military protests that their combat effectiveness is being put at risk26 such views were undoubtedly shared by some current and former dod officials in april 2004 months prior to the presidents august 2nd announcement usdi cambone testified that we early concluded that the relationship between intelligence and operations was growing closer so close in fact that it was beginning to become increasingly difficult to separate the two expressing skepticism about plans to increase the role of the dci or create dni cambone argued that absent the current deep and abiding relationship between the dci and the secretary of defense it is easy to see the ways in which seams would begin to grow up between organizations and in which the department of defense would not be benefitted and in fact the intelligence community as whole be hurt by that split so sustaining the existing relationship we think is essential27 cambones testimony echoed testimony offered in 1996 by john p white then the deputy secretary of defense in the clinton administration in regard to earlier legislation to reorganize the intelligence community confusing the clear lines of authority that currently exist would make it more difficult for dod intelligence elements to perform their most important mission support to the warfighter in the drive to create strong intelligence community we must not damage the integration of military intelligence within the defense community28 concerns within dod persisted on october 21 2004 general richard myers the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff wrote to the representative hunter chairman of the house armed services committee maintaining that the budgets of the combat support agencies including nsa nro and nga should come up from the agencies through the secretary of defense to the national intelligence director ensuring that required warfighting capabilities are accommodated and rationalized and ensuring that the secretary meets his obligations for appropriations it is likewise important that the appropriations are passed from the national intelligence director through the defense department to the combat support agencies 26 richard k betts the new politics of intelligence will reforms work this time foreign

approaches consideration of legislation to establish dninid focused on the extent of this officials authorities to coordinate all intelligence agencies but some observers asserted that separate from organizational issues more significant steps had already been taken to improve sharing of information implying that organizational issues were not necessarily the key factor they assert that the intelligence communitys failure to connect the dots before the 911 attacks resulted in large measure from barriers to communications between foreign intelligence agencies such as the cia and law enforcement agencies especially the fbi29 these barriers were in many cases purposefully erected in regulations in order to ensure that foreign intelligence agencies would not be used to target us persons as had occurred on earlier occasions when intelligence agencies zealously investigated groups and individuals opposed to the vietnam war after 911 congress adjusted these barriers through provisions in the usa patriot act of 2001 pl 10756 and other legislation the usa patriot act authorized the sharing of law enforcement and foreign intelligence information in addition the homeland security act pl 107296 provided that the intelligence analysis and infrastructure protection component of the department of homeland security dhs would receive and analyze foreign intelligence and law enforcement information relating to terrorist threats to the us subsequently the bush administration established the terrorist threat integration center ttic to perform integrative analytical functions30 such initiatives have arguably torn down or at least significantly lowered the wall between foreign intelligence and law enforcement that may have contributed to the failure to detect the 911 plot in advance these developments according to some observers affect the need for enhancing the powers of proposed dninid ongoing technological innovations are also according to some observers working to remove longestablished barriers the phenomenon of stovepiping whereby imagery humint or sigint would be collected by separate agencies in the field and forwarded to respective washingtonarea headquarters to be processed and analyzed before being made available to users has received much criticism stovepiping in essence means the control of information by collection agencies inevitably processing transmission and forwarding lead to delays and impede the effort to bring all available data to bear on the intelligence needs of all levels of government the dangers of stovepiping are now widely recognized dia director lowell jacoby testified to the two intelligence committees joint inquiry 29 see for instance statement of mary jo white former united states attorney for the southern district of new york before the joint intelligence committees october 8 2002 joint inquiry report pp 363368 911 commission report pp 7880 30 see crs report rs21283 homeland security intelligence support updated february 23 2004 crs12 the more widely information is shared the more likely its hidden meaning will be revealed information considered irrelevant noise by one set of analysts may provide critical clues or reveal significant relationships when subjected to analytic scrutiny by another this process is critical for the terrorism issue where evidence is particularly scant often separated by space and time31 well before 911 the defense department was taking advantage of new technologies to provide intelligence support to its forces realtime intelligence has been especially important in the use of precision munitions allowing targeting of specific targets while minimizing casualties defense intelligence agencies are acquiring capabilities to collect comprehensive data to provide instantaneous transmission data storage and immediate retrieval at all echelons in many cases processing and analysis is undertaken at sites within the us even washingtonarea headquarters process known as reachback and can be directly accessed by military units around the world to support ongoing tactical operations observers such as berkowitz have suggested that rather than undertaking revision of complex statutes efforts should be focused on generating the political will needed to make all intelligence organizations implement truly common set of security standards that balance the importance of keeping secrets with the importance of sharing information32 berkowitz notes that executive order 12333 which serves charter document for the intelligence community is over 20 years old and needs revision an effort that in his view would be faster more effective vehicle for intelligence reform than commission report or legislation such an order could also resolve the security barriers and other hurdles that currently keep intelligence agencies from working together more effectively in october 2002 testimony before the joint inquiry dia director jacoby argued that crucial need is to create new paradigm wherein ownership of information belongs with the analysts and not the collectors jacoby argued that the government should follow industrys practice in adopting standard for data storage that permit retrieval from multiple users at different agencies if we are to achieve an end state characterized by the ability to rapidly share and integrate information we must move toward common data framework and set of standards that will allow interoperability at the data not system level and the sooner the better not just for limited group of intelligence producers and subsets of data it shouldnt be an elective option interoperability at the data level is an absolutely necessary attribute of transformed intelligence environment because it enables horizontal integration of information from all sources not just intelligence at all levels of classification33 many observers believe that stovepiping can be gradually overcome because of the availability of technology for rapid dissemination of operational data and the press of operational requirements as occurred during operation iraqi freedom 31 rear admiral lowell jacoby usn statement for the record for the joint 911 inquiry 1 october 2002 p 4 32 berkowitz intelligence reform 33 jacoby p 8 crs13 outside observers argue that technological capabilities now permit increasing information sharing with reliable security protection34 the effort to promote wider sharing of information is widely supported but there remain obstacles singling out nsa the senate intelligence community warned in 2003 of continuing resistance to such innovations the committee has become increasingly concerned in recent years about bureaucratic and cultural obstacles to effective information and data sharing cuttingedge analytical tools many of which are already in use in the private sector increasingly involve largescale multidatabase analysis and pattern recognition using such approaches within the intelligence community however cannot proceed far without significant revision of current orthodoxy as to information ownership and control35 the intelligence authorization act for fy2004 pl 108177 section 317 established pilot program to assess the feasibility of permitting analysts throughout the intelligence community to access and analyze intelligence from the databases of other elements of the community in particular the provision was intended to permit analysts in cia and dia to access sigint contained in nsa databases but not published in formal nsa reports the 911 commission taking note of this ongoing process urged that it be accelerated it recommended that the president lead governmentwide effort to bring the major national security institutions into the information revolution36 the commission indicated role for the nid and the secretary of homeland security backed by the office of management and budget to set common standards for information in the intelligence community other public agencies and relevant parts of the private sector the commission did not specifically address the issue within dod provisions were however ultimately included in pl 108458 directing the dni to establish uniform security standards common information technology standards and policies and procedures to resolve conflicts between the need to share intelligence and the need to protect intelligence sources and methods pl 108458 the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 the role of the niddni

september 29 the senate voted to table an amendment 3706 that would give the nid authority to supervise direct and control the operations of the major dod intelligence agencies as well as the cia but ultimately the senate bill sought to create stronger niddni than was reflected in the house bill37 the ensuing conference reportedly had difficulty in reaching agreement on the issue but many of the media accounts of discussions did not provide precise treatments of the arguments after further consideration the conference version of s 2845 was passed by the house on december 7and by the senate the following day the legislation was approved by the president on december 17 2004 in the signing the bill president bush stated it will be the dnis responsibility to determine the annual budgets for all national intelligence agencies and offices and to direct how these funds are spent these authorities vested in single official who reports directly to will make all our intelligence efforts better coordinated more efficient and more effective the new law will preserve the existing chain of command and leave all our intelligence agencies organizations and offices in their current departments our military commanders will continue to have quick access to the intelligence they need to achieve victory on the battlefield provisions regarding the budgetary authorities of the dni and other senior officials were complex and reflected the fact that significantly different views remain the conference report for s 2845 authorized the dni to provide guidance for national intelligence program budget to heads of departments containing intelligence organizations develop and determine an annual consolidated national intelligence program budget present national intelligence program budget to the president for approval together with dissenting comments from heads of departments containing intelligence organizations participate in the development by the secretary of defense of the annual budgets for dodwide and tactical military intelligence programs ensure the effective execution of annual intelligence budgets 37 as passed by the senate s 2845 provided that the nid would manage and oversee appropriations for the national intelligence program section 112 this would encompass execution of funds reprogramming of funds and the transfer of funds and personnel the senate bill also contained extensive acquisition and fiscal authorities for the nid to develop and implement program management plans for major intelligence systems section 162 the version of s 2845 as passed by the house would assign the nid the responsibility to facilitate the management and execution of funds appropriated for the national intelligence program section 102a crs15 direct the allotment or allocation of appropriations through the heads of departments containing intelligence agencies or organization provide exclusive direction to the office of management and budget omb regarding apportionment and subsequent allocations of appropriated funds transfer or reprogram funds from one program in the national intelligence program to another with omb approval and subject to other restrictions transfer personnel from one intelligence agency to another for up to two years under certain conditions38 taken together these authorities will provide the dni with significantly greater budgetary authorities than possessed by the dci in particular provisions authorizing the dni to direct allocations and allotments of appropriated funds gives the dni significant leverage in the acquisition and program management efforts of intelligence agencies in dod39 some members believed that this leverage would amount to degree of control inconsistent with the secretary of defenses responsibilities for managing intelligence agencies in dod that also support the combat forces although the proposed language clearly establishes extensive budgetary authorities for the dni other factors such as the role of the personalities of the respective officials the priorities of the incumbent administration and the influence of congressional guidance will also have significant influences moreover the final version of the legislation includes provision section 1018 that requires the president to issue guidelines to ensure the effective implementation of authorities granted to the dni the director of the omb and cabinet heads in manner that maintains consistent with the provisions of this act the statutory responsibilities of the head of the departments of the united states government with respect to such departments the guidelines are to be issued within 120 days of the appointment of the first dni some observers suggest that this provision provides an opportunity for renewed consideration of the issues that made passage of pl 108458 difficult40 media accounts indicate that another key issue was daytoday operational control of the collection assets of intelligence agencies in dod some observers suggest however that this issue is not clearcut the legislation gives the dni authority to apportion funds and the apportionment process affects the timing and rate of the flow of funds nevertheless the authority to apportion and allocate 38 s 2845 version of november 20 2004 published by congressional quarterly 39 appropriated funds are not available to agencies until they are apportioned by the office of management and budget omb to government agencies in response to an agency request an apportionment may be further subdivided by an agency into allotments suballotments and allocations see office of management and budget circular a11 section 203 heretofore omb has apportioned funds to dod intelligence agencies at the request of the secretary of defense the draft legislation now under consideration provides that such requests would be initiated by the dni 40 see the separate comments of representatives hunter and hoekstra congressional record december 20 2004 pp e2207e2210 crs16 appropriated funds does not automatically translate into the authority to direct dayto day operations there are already wellestablished distinctions between responsibilities for acquisition programs on the one hand and responsibilities for operational command on the other the military departments the departments of the army navy and air force have major responsibilities for the acquisition of systems to be used by the operating forces but ongoing operations are controlled by the unified commands eg central command european command pacific command at the direction of the secretary of defense and the president analogously the dni would have responsibilities for acquisition of systems that are part of the national intelligence program the heads of defense intelligence agencies would be responsible to the secretary of defense for operating the systems daytoday tasking of the national systems operated by intelligence agencies in dod has been coordinated among consumers from throughout the government including dod the state department the while house etc the dci has long had authority to coordinate such tasking in response to nsc guidance41 for geospatial imagery for example the source operations and management directorate of nga routinely meets with representatives of agencies outside dod to coordinate production priorities nga acknowledges that authority to establish priorities derives from the authorities of the dci rather than solely from those of the defense department42 similar arrangements exist in regard to other intelligence disciplines such as signals intelligence the intelligence reform act also established joint intelligence community council jicc composed of the secretaries of state and defense and other senior officials to advise the dni on establishing requirements developing budgets financial management and monitoring and evaluating the performance of intelligence agencies the statute also provides for the submission of advice or opinion of individual members of the jicc to the president along with the recommendations of the dni43 past relationships among defense agencies the office of the secretary of defense and the intelligence community management staff have been complex the new legislation establishes dni with stronger budgetary authorities than possessed by the dci nevertheless the requirement for close coordination between the dni and dod agencies will remain given the need for agencies to meet different needs of different parts of the government observers believe that this new relationship will also be complicated and that considerable time will be required to develop coordinative procedures 41 derived from
