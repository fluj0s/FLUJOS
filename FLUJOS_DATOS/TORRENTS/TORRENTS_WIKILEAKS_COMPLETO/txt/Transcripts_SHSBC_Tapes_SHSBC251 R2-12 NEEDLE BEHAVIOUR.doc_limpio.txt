r212 data needle behavior lecture given on 13 december 1962 well another evening whatwhats the date audience thirteenth thirteen dee ad 12 have you been lucky today audience yes yeah saint hill special briefing course lecture number one this is lecture on 212 needle behavior nomenclature clean needle what is meant by clean needle what is meant by cleaning needle well not what you think we want free flowing needle we want needle which when it comes up the line doesnt go ticktock not when we say anything now let get this point across here ill be calm the auditor is saying nothing do you understand the pc is sitting there the auditor is not doing thing you got that hes not even reading the meter probably and under those circumstances there is faintest trace of irregular or reacting motion on the needle i knew i could get this one across i just saw couple of cognitions now youve been thinking that cleaning needle had to do with when you said something it went bop and then when you said something again it didnt go bop and thats not cleaning needle i make my point audience yes that is just taking read off the needle you can clean read off the needle but that doesnt give you clean needle if you will watch needle on preclear at some time or another in the sourcein the progress of processingat some time or another in processing probably during listingyou will have finished list and will not yet have qedandaed see and at that moment you will see needle undergoing slow pleasant rise and less usually slow fall it would be flowing thats all it will be doinga flow you can see that needle flow this is particularly true of mark v i mark iv doesnt even begin to express it like mark v but mark iv will also express it and theres that needle and its justyou cant even begin to approximate it with your finger on the tone arm because that is too irregular rise you understand it is total uniform speed there is not the faintest tick in it there is not the famousfaintest speedup there is nothing it is just like molasses pouring out of the barrel and there it is and thats clean needle and thats how i want you to get your needles before you start nulling and you wont have any more trouble and ill bet you right now theres several amongst you who dont think its possible well i can tell you that it isnt possible to null with needle any other way if you put your big mid ruds in your needle will look like that unless you clean clean or miss read absolutely faultless mid rudiments will give you that needle and if it doesnt give you that needle youve missed one or cleaned clean youve goofed there isnt pc that youve been auditing lately that i couldnt have clean needle on in the course of fifteen or twenty minutes matter what theyve been up to with just the weapons youre usingbig mid ruds just that nothing else look please youre in over your heads on 212 trying to figure out what you do on 212 and your trouble isnt with 212 see 212 actually is very simple theres various things about 212 you always oppose rock slamming item opposing is senior to representing if you dont get an item which is unmistakably it you extend the list i mean these thingsthese things are easy these things are easy the trouble auditors have trouble with is the fundamentals of auditing the fundamentals of auditing and let tell you you start goofing up with your trs you start goofing up with your meter and you now have process that somebody looks down your throat and knows you have been if theres anything wrong with 212 it is so positive in its gain that anybody can tell youve been goofing in other words 212 starts showing up any fault you have with your trs your model session and meter before these could be submerged into the upsets and vagaries of the pc youd say well hes having hard time but hell come through it theres only one period during 212 when needle looks some other way or when session looks awry and thats when youre about third or halfway through list youre getting up toward the end its hot the pc doesnt want to confront that next string of rock slamming items he starts throwing little brakes on little protests and that sort of thing and you clean it up and it goes dirty and you clean it up and he goes dirty or when you areas you inevitably will as any auditor doestry to null an incomplete list list which is almost nullable it hasnt got the item on it but its got enough charge off of it so it looks like it can be nulled if you keep your mid ruds in when you get yourself into that situation yeah your needle will look rough but you smooth it out and then it looks rough and then you smooth it out and it looks rough and you smooth it out you should make up your mind sooner or later that that list is incomplete but the point is yeah there are periods during 212 when somebody is snarling see and when the needle is this way because after all the pc is undoubtedly going to get misemotional undoubtedly the pc is going to develop some somatics and say undoubtedly some great big crashing rock slam is just over the horizon the pc sits there and he says well thatsthats complete that was the lastthe last item i put on was it yeah fuddyduddies thats the last one thats athats it i know its on the list now sell sell sell sell you look at the needlelooks all right nothing wrong with it make few tests one way or the otherlooks all fine you go back and try to null the thing and now its dirty and its this and its that and its the other thing and youre in trouble all the way you decide to extend the list and find out three more items later he had dialwide rock slam that was what he was trying to get complete before he reached oh yes there are periods during 212 when the meter looks awfully awfully gammy and messy but when youve got the list complete and when you put in those mid rudiments to test that list for completenesswhich test by the way is only conditional test now youve got to make full test the way i gave you in the first place to really find out is it complete are there any more items have you thought of anything else that should have gone on the list could there possibly be anything else on the listany of those questions produces reaction the list is incomplete just stating the question itself which i gave you to try to help you out wasmade it too easy for you because it doesnt deliver the goods were talking about now clean needlea clean needle and clean needle looks like molasses being poured out of bucket by statue theres just slightest vestige of anything on it so theres another meter characteristic theres another meter characteristic that has not been stressed because one has talked about it and it has apparently been so obvious but theres lack of communication here and i realized last night that there was lack of communication im not blaming you for this lack of communication i mean im not blaming you for not havingits not having gotten across uniformly and universally not blaming you much of course you dont know what the hells the matter with you but its all right im being calm about the whole thingwithin reason theres this thing called clean needle and the definition of clean needle is something which flows at uniform rate of speed at period when the auditor is doing and saying nothing thats clean needle and dats da way they ought to look now you should realize that theres reverse to this its something called needle pattern well needle pattern isnt exactly good statement of affairs pc comes in and hes always going tick before he goes tock and the needles going up and it goes tick and then it goes tock and then it goes pitpit and then it goes tick and it goes tock and then it goes pitpit and so forth and he always does this well thats whats meant by needle pattern it is chronic and constant needle behavior on particular pc when the auditor is saying and doing nothing we have to add that its not needle response its needle appearance when the auditor is saying and doing nothing now needle with reaction on it is dirty needle and thats why we dont need to requalify the definition needle pattern stage four needle is just big needle pattern and people will have these chronic patterns but thats not really what were talking about were talking about dirty needle what is dirty needle you think its needle thats going bzz bzz bzz its needle which doesnt look like molasses being poured out of bucket by statueany tick any roughness any slight speedups as it goes its strictly cadillac with an automatic shift moving off on perfectly billiardtableflat highway driven by an old lady dirty needle is any needle which departs from the appearance of clean needle and weve got dirty read and it goes bzzt and bzzt and it goesits little tiny thing and so forth and actually dirty needle is not just dirty read magnified now dirty needle has nothing to do with the auditor the auditor is not doing anything the auditor is not doing thing all these needle patterns and responses and behaviors and everything else im talking about is with the auditor sitting there totally japanesed withholding his foul breath from the pcs face you understand auditor doing absolutely nothing of course you get dirty needle when the auditor does absolutely nothing but thats beside the point now add this into your auditing take that meterpc is on ittake that meter and just hold your breath for count of five and watch that meter you havent put any question to the pc all cycles of auditing are complete all cycles of auditing are complete and just watch that needle and if that needle is doing anything but flowing at perfect uniform rate or could be still but the probabilities of that are very very faintif its doing anything that has any irregularity in it of any kind whatsoever that is dirty needle and your middle rudiments are out you got it and you want to develop this practice of just sitting there for count of five and watching the pcs needle it tells you libraryful and that is the state of the needle you observe the state of the needle and the state of the needle is not where the tone arm is its not how sticky the needle is its not how unsticky it is it is whether or not it has any ticks or tocks on it and if its got any ticks or tocks and halts and zzppps and anything else and you understand those are to microscopic degree you underthis is very extreme statement im giving you see anything beyond perfect unchanging uniform action is observablethat is dirty needle and that means your mid ruds are out now if youve audited 1865 hours on pc with the rudiments out the whole way itll probably take you 25 minutes to put the rudiments in you understand it not only can be done it is what i expect you to do and if it isnt done its what i would consider goof now that assigns some very difficult problems to you at various times in auditing you get this rawmeat pc or somebody who has been audited by oh frank sullivan and you get this character and whaaaa man thatyou cant even tell which way the needle is going because its going both up and down at the same time it is mess goes bzzzt and tick tick zzzp tock ticktock pawk as you sit there and watch it see daaah thats going to maybe be little bit rough now and then until you get your first reliable item on such needle of extreme filthinesson such needleyou actually cant expect too much till you get your first ri you get groovedin list going and you will see that needle go bzzrpzzpclean just the list is going and youve got the list about threequarters complete and youll start to see this needle come clean marvelous i must remark on that because that is the easiest way to clean needle that is the easiest way but it offers this slight difficulty you have to assessyou have to assess before you can list it and of course the needle is so filthy that the accessmentassessment is almost impossible see so its that period when youre doing that first assessment on this case that is rough rough rough seethat is probably your most critical time in auditing and that period on any pc you will do lasts only the length of time it takes you to get an accurate first assessment it shouldnt last any longer than that in other words in the total time of auditing the pc the tendency of the needle to be or become filthy should not last longer than the hour or so necessary for you to find the takeoff point you know not per session not every assessment going to have this pc for fifty hours its one of those fifty hours and its the first hour and you hit it right on the button and you dont miss with that assessmentthat assessment is dead centerand as you go down listing that list youll all of sudden notice that needle and itsbe cleaning up and by the time youve got the item youre going to find eventually on the list ifs rock slamming item and youve got that item on the list and so forth that needlewhen you go back through for the nulling ifs just nothing you say what happened to the dirty needle now sometimes youll be unlucky and youll hit dead horse and then youll hit another dead horse and youll hit another dead horsesomething like that well every one of those first assessments is ghastly because the dead horse is doing minimal to change the needle from filthy to clean see its doing little but hardly anything about it when you find your first hot item on this pcjust in the process of listing even before you null it outyoure all of sudden going to see the needle go hhhha all the tension come out of there that doesnt mean the next time you go up the line that its not going to charge up but after that you find its very easy to get the needle clean by putting your middle rudiments in and before that time thats the only case that i would thinki wouldnt make any brag of getting it in in fifteen minutes see during the first hour i would make brag about it at all nor would i spend any time on it id decide if anybodys needle was that dirty and hed been around auditors that long he probably rock slammed on list one id be much more likely just to read off list one bang bang bang bang bang looking for thelooking for the slam and then it slams and i might or might not even finish the list id just find the slam and id say it few more times and id pull suppress or two and id make it slam and id say thats good enough for old redhead we going right in right here and right now and we gonna oppose the living daylights out of this and id have my item see i wouldnt waste any time on this you start doing picky and by the way those two facts go together the odds are very much in favor of this pc rock slamming on list one if that needle is that filthy and that hard to clean up so youre kind of saved by the bell on that one arent you all right now we go into this situation of what is clean needle and let say this there is nothing which will substitute for pure observation needle characteristics have tendency to become misinterpreted one of those needle characteristics is this rock slam and you want to ask how in the name of god can anybody misinterpret rock slam but it has happened people have looked at rock slam and said that isnt rock slam well rock slam is simply slashing agitation of the needle thats all dirty read is buzzing agitation of the needle rock slams always got slash in it and the dirty needles always got izzzzp in it but theres slightest substitute for observation of one now theres rocket read well i can describe rocket read very well figured it out it takes offit always goes to the rightit takes off with very fast spurt and does rapid decay like bullet fired into water its very fast it goes psswww it looks like its got all of its motive power from its first instant of impulse with additional motive power being imparted to it by anything its kicked off and it has further kick so it just rapidly dies out how wide is it thats silly question ive seen them from sixtyfourth of an inch to dial see theyre any width now rock slam can have its first slash mistaken for rocket read if the auditor has never seen rocket read because that first slash looks like very rapid hectic motion and they say that must be rocket read but actually it doesnt take off with spurt its of uniform speed and it has power put to it the whole distance of its slash in other words theres motor driving that one it doesnt kick off and do rapid decay its uniform speed and it stops suddenly it doesnt decay it just goes bahstops suddenly that first slash is more commonly to the left not to the right and youll hear people talking about inverse rocket reads well theyre seeing the first stroke of rock slam there is reverse rocket read if you tiger drilled it up little bit you would see the second third and fourth stroke occur immediately after that first stroke i was quite interested they didnt know whether somebody was rock slammer or not because all they could get was the first slash going to the left thats good enough man thats rock slam its not rocket read now were into types of needle characteristics not covered in emeter essentials and these characteristics of the meter have all emerged in the past year not the rock slam we have known it for years and years and years but the importance of the rock slamoh weve known something about that but that rock slam could be as small as it can get and be rock slamwell im afraid we didnt know that it can be awfully tiny see you can forget your inches of measurement tells us howwhether its rock slam or not rock slam is definitely itself ive been studying them lately and theyre definitely themselves the other day i saw one that was asomething on the order of about sixteenth of an inch was its first stroke and then it went into dirty needledirty read sixteenthofaninch rock slam stroke and then the remainder of about fifth of an inch or something like that was dirty read i saw the two crossed right there in the same read i was quite interested inwhen i drilled these things up and did little something or other to themto find out that it held goodthat that was what that was gives us terribly interesting point should we have opposed that item then or represented it well were representing it and its delivering rock slams but i dont know but what that shouldnt have been opposed time would tell so there is point there which you will strike almost never where your adjudication can become confused about it was it dirty read or was it rock slam and the only thing thats confusing about it is that dirty read is quite different than rock slam it looks like an electric buzzer going and it doesnt look like anything slashing and rock slam always slashes its the difference between tickling somebody on the sole of his foot with feather and chopping his head off with saber i mean the two things are quite different and theres this business ofthis business of the rocket read that should never be confused with even onestroke rock slam because of its fast decay now thiswe add to these data here the data of clean needle and that takesthat takes somethingis something new that has been defined it was one of these everybody knew things up until this timeand its not one of these i mean nobody evidently understood this thing because otherwise some people keep saying clean up that needle the instructors around here have been saying clean up the needle clean up the needle and the auditor in many cases i am sure has been saying well yeah anything been suppressed yeah there was suppress on that and pull the suppress and get the needlegets few things from the pc and say well ive cleaned off several reads so therefore it must now be clean needle he didnt realize that the shirt on the line was not being worn or used at the time it was clean see i mean there it was it was either plastered with mud or it was snowydaz tidewater white see see it was it was the needle when nobody was doing anything that we were talking about nobodys doing thing just sitting there looking at the needle and thats what determines whether it is clean or not all those little ticks and tocks and so forth come under the heading of your big mid ruds pluswhich also includes missed withholdplus perhaps very very heavy shakedown of well case might be so anxious the case might be so this and might be so that you couldnt get these things in but nevertheless those are the buttons which make it dirty theyre the buttons contained in the big mid ruds thats why they are those buttons now there are couplethree other buttons that have influence on this but actually if you clean up the main buttons you get the others too theres the matter of shifted attention this is not button that you would use im giving you an example you could have 135 buttons and all that big mid ruds dont you see and itd all be very complex but the truth of the matter is there are none necessary this is one of them this is verya very nice one this is very nice one thisll lead you astray any day of the week in this session has your attention been shifted see well thatthats almost valid its almost good enough to be part of the big mid ruds because youve get somebody whose attention was yanked off his list or yanked off the auditor or the auditor did something unexpected you get all the points of surprise out of session see surprise is simply shift of attention ive known that for long time and you can clean couple of little ticks and couple of little reads off the thing and that sort of thing but in actual fact it isnt good enough over broad usage to be employed as big mid rud it isnt good enough there are lot of others this way now every pc has favorite button they have favorite you learn this faster prepchecking than otherwise you do an eighteenbutton prepcheck and youll find out that every pc youevery pc you do an eighteen button prepcheck on has different favorite out of those eighteen buttons see this guy runs hotter than pistol on decided and that bird runs hotter than the devil on suggested and they tend to have favorites now youre getting up toward doing prehav assessment just to get your mid ruds in when you expand beyond very small number of rudiments you go beyond eight or nine buttons to get in mid ruds in session and you are being ridiculous because if youre going to go any further than that to get big tiger or big mid ruds you see well why dont you do prehav assessment why dont you get the prehav scale out and do full rollyourown and thatll deliver the case right into your lap actually the needle will straighten right out because youve got the exact button now that is causing the needle to be anything only the difference is is youreyoure longer doing 212 youre doing routine 2 that was the earliest ancestor of 212 see oh yeah you can do routine 2 you do prehav assessment and run this thing repetitively on the pc in fior in fiveway bracket marvelous lot of cases gone right straight up the graph and everything its niceits nice process its pointless but its nice process you can change somebodys graph all over the place if you just wanted to be an hgc d of p and be able to shake paper in front of the pcs face the pcll be very excited about it too and you just want to shake paper in front of his face and you want to know what gains youve got well good good see you went from the bottom to the top see pc feels good and everything is fine probably be back at the bottom again next week but thats all right point im making is you really didnt do very much in the way of shifting mass or anything else for the pc that had any lastingness it was lack of lastingness that sealed the fate of routine 2 it didnt last you have to actually find items you have to find items and those have to have some mass to them for case to get any kind of shift in the first place this ease has got item one bucked into item two and the reason item one is held in suspense in time is because it is exactly balanced against item two which is held in suspense in time and actually even do routine 212 badly you have still upset that balance youre not going to murder anybody with this and the case could get an enormously better gain but sooner or later that balance is going togoing to shift itll stay out in other words its likeits like the fellows leaning on the wall and he could lean on the wall and the wall lean on him you see for quite while but you take the fellow away from the wall or the wall away from the fellow and you havent got the status quo anymore this situation is longer this kind of status quo well in view of the fact that it isnt quite the fellow leaning against the wall but wall leaning against wall you take either wall away the other wall will fall down thats more the architectural pattern of the two dumbbells of package so you can unsettle that status quo and you can unsettle it in variety of ways and its never the same again it doesnt recharge but if you wanted to get the full benefit and never have anything hanging in your way at all youd of course neatly pick up the package and the benefit there is ten fifty times more than just softening up one side of it you soften up one side of the package and the other one tends to be unbalanced and not be as effective and hang around and aberrating the pc but its still there and you leave too many of those things and the pc starts getting confused he doesnt know what hes leaning against now and he doesnt feel hes had much of gain and if you want to knowif the pc wants to know hes got gain you actually got to find both of them youll run into 212 some guy that you list the whole thing out you think and then you dont find an item and then youyou found an item and then you oppose it and list the whole thing out but dont find an item you dont find anything to lean against the first item and youll find the casethe case tends to feel funny well the case will say oh yeah lots of gains lots of gains and two days later hell say what gain see hes not in the know that hes had much of gain he might have gained you see the two noses that he ordinarily wearsone of them might have disappeared you see there might have been quite change in the guy but he wont know it in other words this doesnt affect the knowingness to the degree that finding both sides of the package does now youve got to go ahead and find both sides of the package in order to do that if you kept on doing that finding just one side and finding one side and never finding the other one and one side you go up the line about sixthissix unfound bypassed items in 212you think youve found them but you havent you know they didntnothing rock slammed on the other side you seeyoull find your pc starting to be nattery starting to look kind of seedy you go back then and complete those lists and find the rock slamming item in each case and this pc takes off and you wonder how the hell you ever considered that youd ever seen pc gain before because the gain now that hethat he gets out of just extending that list bit and finding that real item there is phenomenal he now knows hes gained and the gain is terrific in other words you could make little old gain that compares to processing of years past everybodys satisfied with this gain theyre happy with this gain and so forth but its not skyrocket gain therell be lot of people around as time goes on theyll betheyll be further out on the fringes of scientology you see youll hear this receding as statement wellwell 212 is all right its as good as oh its probably better than lot of processes weve had in the past youll hear that kind of statement see actually that statement will get more and more further out away from where people know how to do it you see because if you do it right and you get both sides of each package and so forth there isnt any doubt left in your mind whatsoever about the power of 212 compared to old processes you see its tremendous but you know when you are looking at somebody making that remark youre looking at somebody who never completes list he justhe just confessed he just signed sealed and delivered confession that he stops lists when the pc tells him to and that he never finds the final item and that hes perfectly willing to say well they both dirtyneedled so it must have been package i told the pc it was packagedidnt have much to say i told him though i was very satisfied with the intensive myself but he was having wife trouble at the time at home i suppose and therefore he didnt think he got much gains out of it but i could tell that he got gain any remark made like 212you know about 212 like thatthats simply saying auditor didnt complete the list or always made habit of representing that which rock slammed itoh nonono i beg your pardon i beg your pardon thats another breed of cat if an auditor goes on representing what rock slams hell have this idea of 212get little better reality here oh that process i dont see what you people see in it you know i dont know what you see i was running it on pc i was running it on pc and as matter of fact she didnt look too bad she just had sciatica and when i finally finished up she looked about ninety and had lumbosis so i dont see what you see in that process well thats the direct result of doing one of two things of representing rock slamming itemsthing rock slams like crazy so you represent it you do that very often and particularly on list one items and your pc just about goes around the bend or you didnt finish the cycle of action you see before you got an item on action you got tired and started in on action b and before you got an item on action b why you started action c hoping somehow or another it would all come out all right now somebodyll have to come along sooner or later and complete action and it will all come out all right long as action is completed thats failure to complete cycle of action will produce an adverse result particularly if the pc is very interested in the cycle of action and you didnt even vaguely complete it thats the best if you really want to cave somebody in with 212 thats my strongest recommendation theyre going there pocketapocketapocketapocketapocketapocketa pocketa and youyoure sitting there and youre watching the needle and you dont know what rock slam is thatd be good one you think its pc body motion or something and say well its dead horse the pcs saying waterbuck tiger and you say wait minute wait minute this whole things dead horse were going to do reassessment on some other list pches just left in sort of stunned state from there on actually he will remain in that state until somebody comes back and says well who or what would oppose an ink pot whatever it was see and at that moment hell take right off again oh you want them waterbuck tiger clang clang clang clang clang now this idea of requiring clean needle before you nullive got to get it across to you because the beauty of mark v is that it expresses clean needle much better than mark iv and when youve really got the thing cleaned up you can see needle characteristic that is to say its type of needle on the mark v it is visibly type of needle and youll get spoiled by mark v youll see this thing and its just like turning on the light and turning it off you know and youll see this needle and its just beautiful its just flowing its lovely there isnt ripple in the thing of any kind whatsoever and this meter expresses that gorgeously and boy you know those rudiments are in itll spoil you the next time youll take look at the needle on the pc and youllit hasnt got that characteristic and although the needle isnt reacting in any way youll start chewing on the pc trying to put it that way youll be absolutely right there will be somethingsomething that the pc has there that is making it some other way in other words the mark v oddly enough expresses rudimentsin pc it is way it looks and that description is just the ne plus exclamation point ultra of the definition of clean needle it really looksit looks quite different youll see that needleyoull see that needle one day on mark v and say what do you know actually the pc is sitting there without thought in his skull hes just perfectly happy for you to go on and not go on its quite interesting that the mark v expresses clean needle now if theres just the slightest suppress or just the slightest withhold or the slightest anything on the caseit isnt in needle pattern it doesnt go so far as to make ticketytock and slickity slock on the thingit just doesnt look clean it is still flowing but it doesnt look clean it is very interesting thing im calling your attention to that on mark v because sooner or later you willif i call your attention to it youll watch for it and youll suddenly say hey what do you know this thing does it tells you one more thing one more thing than the mark iv tells you it tells you how clean the rudiments are just by the fact that the needle is moving and there it is you want to look for that one now you can harass pc in trying to clean up needle until it looks like game of battledore and shuttlecock well you say you see little tick on it you see and its going tick and tock and so on well what are you thinking about this is one of those broad wideopen door questions that doesnt focus the pcs attention in any direction he doesnt know what hes thinking about if he knew what he was thinking about it wouldnt tick what are you thinking about you say yes well you must be thinking about something and hell try tohell think madly to find out what he is thinking about you know and he gets completely lost he doesnt know whether hes coming or going so youll see the needle now instead of going tick and tock is going tickutock tickuhctock and youll say well i dont know i really cant get on with this list and ive just made up my mind that we will just sit right here until you tell what you are thinking about and hell say oh my god what am i thinking about i must be thinking about something must be pretty powerful if he notices it on the needle this particular way by thisthis needle now is going tickhic tickhic tickhic and eventually break down and ask him just the mid rudiment questions one right after the other and hell find out what he was thinking about its much better to put in the mid ruds than it is to give them supergeneralized questions now theres one exception to this when youre going down list youre nulling away down list and all of sudden the rudiments go bzzzt out from underyou know more the heavily charged the list is you know the more pcs think reacts on the meter see the pcs think associated with charged list reacts more heavily than pcs think on nocharged list and as matter of fact on nocharged anything pcs think wouldnt register at all so on heavily charged listyoure going down this list and ifs going to have dialwide rock slam when you finally find the item and you hope its complete youre not sure youre going on down the lineyoull notice the needle is getting less and less flowing nothing has happened to the needle yet its not doing anything peculiar it just is less flowing you see what i mean its just less it hasnt done anything yet but its less right than it was all of sudden it goes all wrong and starts hiccupping well you cant do anything at this point now if you put in the mid ruds every time you did that you would rapidly get into great deal of trouble with the pc because the pc just starts screaming its noauditing dont you see well now the pc cant see that that needles so dirty you cant null with it pc is unaware of this fact so very good stunt is not throw at the pc and not push rapidly at the pcnever push anything rapidly at pcbut just twist your paper around and ask the pc which of these he has had any thoughts on and let him go down the list now show him as much of the list as the needle has been getting worse on and hell say oh well i didntusual responseno i didnt have any thoughts i didnt have any thoughts on that one or that one oh wait minute gladiator i thought isnt that hell of silly thing to have on this listwho orwho would cook well see who or what would cook well gladiator i thought that was silly thing on the list i dont know whats the matter with putting that on the list that couldnt have been it so thats all and you start to lean backoh yes oh yes heh yes thisthis other itemthis other itemi thought by golly you know thatthats it thats it you see cook i said thatthatthat is it and then i thought oh that couldnt be it yeah and thats all ive done except this last one that you just asked on thisthis last one down here this last one down hereuhi didnt understand what you said and you say all right thank you very much pull the thing back and just continue nulling from where you were youll find out that is very interesting little trick now pc develops another allergy to that by the way the pc knows youre going to do that when heyouhe sees an in an in an in an in he knows that papers going to turn around and come his way but actually that does far less harm than knowing hes going to spend the next halfhour battling with the auditor about mid ruds its all in the speed of auditing the rudiment that goes out on checkingand particularly goals checking the rudiment that goes out is this anxious about and thats really why its in there youre going to see rebalancing of these rudiments very shortly into very proper better order but it doesnt change your small rudiments and it doesnt change your small tiger drill those things arecompare one with the other but getting needle cleangetting needle clean is an operation which takes all needle pattern all jerks and all ticks off when the auditor is doing nothing see theit has these things without the auditor doing anything and it doesnt have these things with the auditor doing nothing and then you see these characterthis characteristic of clean needle and thats what needle ought to look like before you start nulling anything thats what gives you in in in in in in in in in in in and you say the list is incomplete the list isnt complete incomplete youre trying to null with dirty needle see maybe the list is incomplete too but even if you had complete list if your rudiments are out and your needle is dirty you say waterbuck and itsjust the auditor speaking makes the needle tick see the pc in essence has withhold from the auditor and thus is peculiarly vulervulnerable to the auditors actions hes justeven though hes just invalidated something you see the auditor doesnt know that he has it isnt enough to make the pc critical of the auditor but it is enough to make the pc think extra thoughts all the time see it individuates the pc so hes not so well under auditors control and youve got an individuated pc and the pc thinks there pocketapocketa pocketapocketapocketapocketapocketa thinkthinkthinkthinkthink every one of these things will have to be picked up and the more theyre out the more the pc individuates the more the pc thinks so it just is dwindling spiral now you start to do list that is complete with pc with missed withhold the pc is individuated the pcs going to think some crashing thought every fiveevery five items you say and so of course these things are now going to react and stay in and so on now the mark v will be cursed by pcs who believe that the thing at 128 is unfair in actual fact the mark v is not one bit more sensitive than mark iv in spite of the guts of the thing the guts are much more complicated in mark v than mark iv but in spite of this it actually doesnt register any more than mark iv doesif youve got flys eyes all it does is take what the mark iv is registering and amplifies it and whereas its almost undetectably tiny on mark ivyou dont know whether it twitched or not on markyou see it did register on the mark ivon the mark v when you turn it up to 128 why that confounded tick was one to two divisions wide see thats what it does all it does is amplify the read the mark iv always read it providing you had flys eyes see this is nothing more sensitione meter is not more sensitive than the other but the tiny manifestations that would be microscopically small on mark iv are visible on mark v and thats all the mark v is more visible meter not more sensitive meter thats very important to an auditor by the time you put magnifying glass up on top of mark v man have you got it made you can read anything now at that level you pick up all the analytical thoughts of the pc you pick them all up and the pc who has been audited on mark iv and has been getting away with blue murder because the auditor didnt have flys eyes gets into mark v and he feels like hes going into buzz saw and hes liable to start cussing the mark v yeah he thinks well i hope that doesnt read and the auditor says what was that but let tell you if you never clean clean and you pick up every read and you clean thosein other words you always clean up the needle and dont erroneously clean it upa pcs protest against mid ruds starts going out on the subject of the mark v it starts getting less because the pc of course has less missed withholds from the auditor and eventually they die out and stop yapping about it but at first when you shift pc over from being audited on mark iv to mark v you can expect little bit of trouble because the pcs days of liberty are at end the day when he could think all those nasty thoughts about the auditor and get away with it are over because the auditor can see them but the mark v does give you this flowing manifestation the mark iv does too but the mark v it becomes very very visible and you know that thing boy you say thats the cleanest set of rudiments ive seen in many day theres only one other way to get the same manifestation and thats just arc break the living daylights out of pc and youll get the same manifestation it has to be very severe thing you say you know that withhold that ithat you told last week about betsy jo annwell itoday i was on the phone to her parents and they said see something like this you know multiply that by five or ten more and you will get very nice flowing needle i dont recommend that you do that i recommend instead that you audit the pc thank you very much
