defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans defined benefit db plans pay pensions that are usually based on each workers years of service and average pay db pensions must offer participants the option to receive an annuity series of monthly payments guaranteed for life some db plans also offer participants the option of taking their accrued benefits as lump sums when they separate from the employer defined contribution dc plans are individual accounts established by the employer for each participant in dc plan the participants benefit is equal to his or her account balance which is the sum of employer and employee contributions plus interest dividends and investment gains or losses employers usually pay these benefits as lump sums to the participants when they quit or retire they are not required to offer participants the option of taking an annuity in defined benefit plan participants accrued benefit usually is defined as an annuity beginning at the plans normal retirement age which typically is age 65 if the plan allows lump sum distributions the lump sum must be equal to the present value of the future annuity to which the participant is entitled to calculate the present value of an annuity the plan must apply an interest rate and estimate the participants life expectancy to protect the value of each participants pension benefit the internal revenue code irc prescribes the interest rate and mortality table that the plan must use to determine the minimum lumpsum value of the annuity that each participant has earned plan may pay larger lump sum but it may not pay less than this minimum the ppa modified both the mortality assumptions and interest rate prescribed by the irc beginning in 2008 plans must use new mortality table that reflects recent increases in life expectancy the new mortality estimates by themselves would increase the value of lump sums by 1 to 2 depending on the age of the participant under prior law db plans were required to use the current interest rate on 30year us treasury bonds to determine the minimum lumpsum value of an annuity 1 the ppa requires plans to use corporate bond interest rate for this calculation the present value of an annuity is inversely related to the interest rate used to convert the annuity to its present value the higher the interest rate the smaller the lumpsum and vice versa the interest rate on treasury bonds has historically been lower than the interest rate on corporate bonds of the same maturity because bond markets price treasury securities as having risk of default replacing the lower treasury bond interest rate with higher corporate bond interest rate will tend to reduce lump sums the ppa requires the corporate bond interest rate to be phased in from 2008 to 2012 g6g142g157g142g155g150g146g151g146g151g144g561g157g145g142g561g15g146g151g146g150g158g150g561g24g138g149g158g142g561g152g143g561g138g561g14g158g150g153g561g21g158g150g561 irc 417e prescribes the interest rate and mortality table that plans must use to determine the minimum present value of an annuity and thus the minimum value of lumpsum distribution that participant who elects to take lump sum is entitled to receive from the plan section 302 of the ppa amended irc 417e to replace the 30year treasury bond interest rate with corporate bond interest rate as the rate to be used in this calculation 2 the ppa requires plans to 1 767 retirement protection act of 1994 pl 103465 december 8 1994 2 the specific interest rate that plan uses to calculate lump sum depends on the plans stability period and lookback month the stability period can be month quarte r or year the lookback month can be any of the five calendar months preceding the stability period if the plan year is calendar year and the plan uses oneyear stability continued

curve of investmentgrade corporate bonds to determine the minimum lumpsum value of an annuity3 the corporate bond interest rate that plans will use to determine the minimum lump sum value of an annuity will be based on the date at which the annuity otherwise would be payable to the participant the present value of the portion of th annuity that is payable within five years will be valued using shortterm corporate interest rate ie the first segment of the yield curve the portion of the annuity that is payable in six to 20 years will be valued using mediumterm interest rate the second segment and the portion of the annuity that is payable in more than 20 years will be valued using longterm interest rate the third segment as result when section 302 of the ppa takes effect in 2008 the minimum value of lumpsum will be calculated using up to three different interest rates in general older plan participants will experience smaller reductions in their lump sums than younger participants because part of their annuities will be converted to lump sum using shortterm interest rates which usually are lower than longterm interest rates for example worker who retires at age 65 and is eligible for an immediate annuity would have the first five years of his or her annuity converted to lumpsum using the rate for the first segment of the interest rate yield curve the sixth through twentieth years of the annuity would be converted to lumpsum using the rate for the second segment of the yield curve and the remainder of the annuity would be converted to lumpsum using the rate for the third segment of the yield curve in contrast worker in plan with normal retirement age of 65 who separates from the employer at age 45 and elects to take his or her accrued benefit as lump sum would have the entire annuity converted to lump sum using the third segment of the yield curve the ppa does not require plan sponsors to use the corporate bond yield curve to calculate the lumpsum value of an annuity it merely prohibits plans from paying lump sums that are less than the amounts that would result from using the corporate bond yield curve and the new mortality table plan sponsor may elect to use lower interest rate which would result in larger lump sums however in such case the ppa requires the plan sponsor to take this higher cost into account when calculating its liabilities and funding requirements under the ppa these higher lump sums are considered to be subsidy to the plans participants and they must be treated as cost to the plan plan sponsors that elect to pay lump sums that are greater than those that would result from using the corporate bond yield curve will have to make additional contributions to their plans privatesector actuarial firm has estimated that if plan sponsor chooses to continue using the treasury bond interest rate to determine minimum lumpsum values it would experience onetime increase in plan liabilities of about 5 4 continued period with october as the lookback month lumpsum distributions in 2007 would be calculated using the 30year treasury bond interest rate for october 2006 see 26 cfr 1417e1d5 3 yield curve is graph that shows interest rates plotted on the vertical axis and time plotted on the horizontal axis longterm rates usually are higher than shortterm rates because the risks posed by inflation and the possible default of the borrower rise with the length of time over which credit is extended therefore most of the time the yield curve slopes upward from left to right 4 jpmorgan compensation and

table mandated by the ppa will go into effect in january 2008 as noted above it will tend to increase lump sums by 1 to 2 depending on the age of the recipient at the same time however the new interest rate mandated by the ppa will begin to take effect historically interest rates on corporate bonds have been higher than the interest rates on us treasury bonds of similar maturities because the present value of an annuity is inversely related to the interest rate used to calculate it replacing the treasury bond interest rate with corporate bond interest rate will tend to reduce lump sums how the ppa will affect the value of any given individuals lump sum will depend on the participants age whether he or she is eligible for an immediate annuity or deferred annuity and the difference between the treasury bond interest rate and the corporate bond interest rate in each segment of the yield curve 5 the effect of the change from the treasury bond interest rate to corporate bond interest rate will be mitigated in the years from 2008 through 2011 by the phasein schedule mandated by the ppa in 2008 through 2011 the interest rate under irc 417e will be weighted average of the treasury bond rate and the corporate bond rate in 2008 the treasury bond interest rate will be weighted at 80 and the corporate bond interest rate will be weighted at 20 the corporate bond interest rate will be weighted at 40 in 2009 60 in 2010 80 in 2011 and 100 in 2012 to illustrate the effect on lump sums of the new mortality table and interest rates mandated by the ppa the congressional research service estimated the minimum permissible lump sums under irc 417e using the preppa mortality table and the treasury bond interest rate we then calculated the lump sums that would result from using the new mortality table and the interest rates for the three segments of the corporate bond yield curve published by the irs table 2 shows the lumpsum value of an immediate annuity of 12000 per

planscalled hybrid plans have characteristics of both db and dc plans the most popular of these hybrids has been the cash balance plan cash balance plan looks like dc plan in that the accrued benefit is defined in terms of an account balance unlike dc plan however cash balance plan must pay benefit at retirement that is less than the amount the employer has contributed to the plan plus the interest that has been credited to those contributions legally therefore cash balance plan is defined benefit plan prior to enactment of the ppa there were some circumstances in which employers were required to pay departing employees amounts that exceeded the nominal values of their cash balance accounts this could occur if the interest rate credited to the cash balance plan was higher than the interest rate required for calculating minimum lumpsum values under irc 417e section 701 of the ppa allows lumpsum distributions from cash balance plans to be equal to the employees accrued benefit expressed as his or her account balance this provision was effective on the date of enactment of the ppa
