date address four kinds of measures 1 restrictions on land uses that might adversely affect species listed as endangered or threatened 2 reductions in water delivery or allowable water diversion to preserve lake levels or instream flows needed by listed fish currently the most active area of takings litigation 3 restrictions on the defensive measures property owner may take to protect hisher property from listed animals and 4 restrictions on commercial dealings in members of listed species to date only one of the 16 esabased takings cases disclosed by research tulare lake basin water

endangered species act esa1 along with its state counterparts has long been major flash point in the property rights debate in the context the debate has had at least two parts first to what extent should and to what extent does the restrict the use of privately owned land second given that restrict ions on land uses and other propertyrelated activities are imposed under the to what extent does the takings clause of the fifth amendment2 demand compensation of the property owner this second questionthe takings implications of the esais our subject here much has been written about which if any imp acts on property owners by wildlife protection laws such as the must be compensated as fifth amendment takings3 in 1993 crs provided comprehensive analytic review of how the taki ngs issue had played out under the and other federal and state wildlife laws4 this newer report simply reviews the takings court decisions involving the these decisions illustrate the types of private property impacts that occur under the and how takings law regards them note that this review is not reliable indicator of the aggregate private property impacts of the program almost certainly many landowners who are restricted in some way under the act do not bother to sue of the filed suits crs has systematic way of discovering those that were resolved without published decision as by settleme nt or voluntary dismissal and finally court decisions under the takings clause do not exhaust the universe of decisions stemming from the private property impactsother legal theories may be invoked 5 sections i and ii of the report give basic background the features pertinent to its impact on private property and esarelevant principles of takings law respectively sections iii through vi are the heart of the report reviews of takings decisions grouped by type of property impact involved the decisions herein comprise all those of which crs is aware reported and 1 16 usc 15311544 2 nor shall

prope rty impacts begins when the secretary of the interior through the fish and wildlife service fws lists species as endangered or threatened9 the secretary of commerce through the national marine fisheries service nmfs popularly called noaa fisheries administers the for marine species important here listing is to be done solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available to the pertinent secretary10 without reference to economic costs or private property impacts in sharp contrast such costs and impacts may be considered in devising agency responses to the determination of endangered or threatened status for example at the time of listing the secretary is required when prudent and determinable to designate the critical habitat of the speciesareas essential to its conservation 11 critical habitat designation is to be based both on scientific data and economic impact and any other relevant impact12 presumably allowing impacts on private property to be weighed this distinction between listing and subsequent agency responses such as critical habitat designation was made by congress quite deliberately13

designation trigger the provisions that may interfere with private property use chief among these is section 9 prohibiting certain acts in connection with endangered animals and plants 14 section 9s prohibitions apply to both private and public land and apply regardless of whether critical habitat has been designated for endangered animals 6 an exception is concerned shrimpers of america inc v mosbacher ca c9039 sd tex mar 8 1990 omitted because crs has been unable to obtain copy of the unpublished decision this case reportedly was taking challenge to an agency requirement under the that

selling or transporting an animal obtained by an unlawful take c transporting an animal interstate in the course of commercial activity and d selling an animal interstate or importingexporting same for endangered plants the list is narrowerwe do not describe it here since there appear to be fifth amendment takings decisions involving listed plants the term take is key concept not to be confused with fifth amendment takings it is expansively defined by the statute to include almost any act adversely affecting species memberincluding to harass harm pursue hunt capture or collect listed animal15 central to the s impact on private land owners the fws defines harm to include indirect harm to listed species members through certain significant habitat modifications16 this agency definition has been upheld by the supreme court as reasonable interpretation of the statute17 by general rule the fws has extended almost all of the endangered species prohibitions just discussed to threatened animals and plants18 special rules withdrawing particular threatened species from aspects of the general regime have been promulgated for those species with atypical management needs19 the nmfs on the other hand adopts section 9s endangered species prohibitions for threatened species only on casebycase basis experimental populations of listed species generally are treated as threatened species20 to minimize its constraints on economic growth the in section 10 allows muchused exemption from section 9s taking prohibitions the exemption authorizes the appropriate secretary to permit any taking incidental to and not the purpose of otherwise lawful activity21 allowing some projects to proceed even if they harm individuals of listed species such incidental taking permits itps may be issued to nonfederal entities after the landowner submits habitat conservation plan hcp including proposed mitigation measures and the considered but rejected alternatives to the proposed action the purpose of the hcp is to ensure that the proposed action does not appreciably reduce the survival and recovery prospects of the species in an enforcement action for violating the the statute allows an affirmative defense for offenses committed in the good faith belief that the defendant was acting to protect persons from bodily harm 22 the makes mention however of similar defense for acts to protect property the absence of propertyprotection defe nse in the itself has been largely offset as to threatened species and experimental populations but not endangered speciesby administrative

724 this section comes into play only when project has federal nexusas when nonfederal project requires federal permit or is being federally funded or the federal agency itself is carrying out the project section 7s mandate is that each federal agency consult with the fws or nmfs depending on the listed species involved to ensure that its actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of designated critical habitat 25 note the focus on the species in contrast with section 9s focus on individual members of the species once consulted fws or nmfs must if listed species might be affected prepare biological opinion to determine the actual impact of the proposed action26 if jeopardy of species or destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat see preceding quote is found the fws or nmfs must suggest reasonable and prudent alte rnatives to the proposed activity that would not violate the section 7 mandate if the agency agrees to these or other reasonable and prudent alternatives consistent with the section 7 mandate and approved by fws or nmfsand if further any incidental takes satisfy that mandate and other conditions are metthen the fws or nmfs issues an incidental take statement and the activity may go forward consistent with its terms27 the incidental take analysis under section 7 is the same as for section 10 itps and compliance with the mitigating measures in the biological opinion confers the same exemption from section 9 prohibitions as an itp does on nonfederal entities federal action may be exempted from the section 7 mandate despite the possibility of extinction by an endangered species committee of highranking federal officials popularly called the god squad28 the committee must find among other things that there are reasonable and prudent alternatives to the agency action and that the actions benefits clearly outweigh the benefits of alternatives that would conserve the species or its critical habitat the endangered species committee exemption process is generally considered burdensome and is rarely used

restrictions to benefit species covered by the hcp with minor exceptions30 federal managers also attempted where consistent with the facts to tilt toward threatened rather than endangered designations to allow use of the more flexible provisions governing threatened species31 use of threatened status has allowed the fws through special rules to authorize takes of members of specified species causing depredations of private property livestock domestic animals crops 32 usually such takes of problem animals must be carried out by government officials rather than the aggrieved property owner fws regulations governing private property depredations by members of experimental populations more often allow takes by both government agents and private landowners33 despite these impactsoftening

substantive must be surmounted procedurally taking claim against the united states the likely defendant if suing because of the must be filed in the us court of federal claims if plaintiff seeks more than 1000034 it must also under that courts statute of limitations be filed within six years of the date of the alleged taking35 most daunting of all the procedural hurdles the taking claim must be ripethat is the dispute must have reached sufficient maturity to be suitable for judicial resolution in cases against the united states this means chiefly that the property owner must have obtained final decision from the government agency in question as to the nature and extent of the restrictions on the property36 final decision is muchlitigated term of art to get final decision it may be necessary for the property owner after hisher initial development proposal is rejected to reapply with scaleddown or reconfigured proposals in the context the final decision requirement has been held to mean that the taking claim is not ripe until an itp has been applied for and usually denied denial of the itp is not necessary for ripeness where further negotiations with the federal agency are not needed to indicate what degree of development the government will allow on the parcel where further negotiations would otherwise be pointless futility exception or where plaintiff is claiming that an agencys delay in granting or denying the itp is extraordinary but as yet court has been willing to excuse plaintiffs failure to even apply for an itp an agencys determination simply that the property owners proposal requires an itp application cannot itself be taking the reason is clear that determination leaves open the possibility that the permit if applied for will be granted 37 most important of the substantive threshold hurdles is the takings clause demand that the thing alleged to have been taken is property as used in the clause almost all common interests in landfee simple absolutes leases easements etcare indisputably property as are water rights making this threshold an easily surmounted one in takings cases however takings law is cognizant of only direct impacts on the property for example the denial of an itp for residential subdivision may in proper circumstances take the tract for which the permit is sought however taking claim will not be entertained as to the nearby commercially zoned parcel whose value is greatly reduced because residential subdivision hence potential customers will come to the itpdenied lot

property merely by restricting its use the idea of the regulatory taki ng concept is that even in the absence of an obvious government taking of propertyas by ap propriation of title or physical occupationuse restrictions may be sufficiently severe to amount to the same thing regulatory takings claims break down into two subcategories depending on whether the regulation is alleged to have caused total elimination of the lands use or value called total taking claim or lessthan total elimination called partial regulatory taking claim the first category total elimination of use or value is held to be per taking with at least one big exception if the government restriction was implicit in background principles of property or nuisance law existing when the property was acquired there is taking39 the rationale for this exception is that the government has not taken away any right the property owner ever had there is limited caselaw support for the argument that the states historic ownership of wildlife and responsibility for wildlife protection as trust obligation to the public constitute background principle that forecloses takings claim based on such protections however this defense has yet to be addressed in an esabased takings decision claims in the second category lessthantotal losses are far more common and are evaluated quite differently instead of per test courts use factintensive casebycase approach applying the penn central balancing test under this approach the government action is assessed for its economic impact the degree of interference with investmentbacked expectations and its character40 these vague factors have been explicated only minimally by the supreme court leading many commentators to complain that the test is muddled and easily manipulated still it is at least clear that the impact on the property owner must be severe with the result that the large majority of regulatory takings claims tested under penn central are rejected this governmentfriendly pattern has been replicated in the esatakings cases raising penn central claims even though takings courts have not acco rded the speciespreservation goal of the any special status at least explicitly in the takings calculus41 with either total or partial regulatory takings claims the court must define the parcel as whole aka relevant parcel as to which the impact of the government action will be measured the relevant parcel notion is needed because takings law looks at the economic impact and interference with expectations factors in relative rather than absolute sense as to economic impact for example what counts in the takings analysis is not that the plaintiffs land lost x dollars in value due to government restriction but rather that the loss constituted high percentage of the prerestriction value of the parcel as whole the relevant parcel generally is defined to include the entire contiguous lot in the same ownership with noncontiguous lots held by the same owner thrown in if part of an integrated development importantly the relevant parcel cannot be limited to the portion of the property continued 38 lingle v chevron usa inc 544 us 528 2005 39

that basis thus regulation that severely reduces use or value on only portion of tract is unlikely to be taking for this reason it is almost certain that the relevant pa rcel factor has held down the number of esabased takings claims many property owners restricted on portion of their land still have economic use of the remainder beyond the regulatednonregulated rule however the supreme court has left unresolved many issues that arise in defining the relevant parcel also for both total and partial takings claims the supreme court recently rejected the absolute version of the notice rule under which lower courts once held that restrictions imposed under laws existing when the property was acquired cannot be taking42 the preacquisition existence of the law in question carries some weight in the takings analysis but does not bar the taking claim outright43 this easing of the notice rule is highly significant for the which was enacted so long ago 1973 that most landowne rs today by virtue of having bought since enactment might be barred from claiming takings under the former absolute rule finally regulatory takings claims are treated differently depending on whether the restriction giving rise to the alleged taking was initially deemed to be permanent of indefinite duration or temporary if an initially permanent government restriction is ultimately withdrawn or judicially invalidated the analysis of whether it worked taking while on the books is unaffected the termination of the restriction nominally changes the permanent taking claim to temporary one but its only real effect is to limit the amount of compensation few cases present this scenario land use restrictions were lifted once listed birds were found longer present in an area by contrast the very same land use restriction may not cause taking if initially designated as temporary such as development moratorium because of the likelihood that the restriction will be lifted after defined period 44 physical taking claim asserts that the government has taken property by causing or authorizing physical invasion such claims come in two types permanent physical occupations and temporary physical invasions permanent physical occupations are almost invariably held to be takings45 because they infringe upon one of the most essential attributes of property ownership the right to exclude others thus in assessing physical occupation claims the courts will not inquire into the extent of the occupation the magnitude of the economic impact or the importance of the underlying public purposekey ingredients of regulatory takings analysis indeed even the parcel as whole rule does not apply so that an occupation of only minuscule portion of tract is taking not surprisingly takings plaintiffs always try to bring physical occupation claim among others if the facts permit temporary physical invasions the lesser degree of interference are regarded quite differently they are tested under the penn central balancing test and generally are held nontakings physical takings claims are common in casesthe property owner pointing to the listed animals whose physical presence on hisher land must be tolerated or the consumption of livestock by listed predators because the livestock owner was barred by the from taking stronger measures eg shooting against the marauding animals or the temporary presence on 42 palazzolo v rhode island 533 us 606 2001 43 tahoesierra preservation council inc v tahoe regional planning agency 535 us 302 2002 44 id 45 loretto v teleprompter manhattan catv corp 458

was found in the absence of any physical invasion based on the appropriation perceived by the court of water right the exaction taking claim asserts taking on the basis of an exaction demanded by land regulatory agency as condition of approving development proposal in order not to be taking the exaction condition must meet two criteria first there must be an essential nexus between the condition and an underlying purpose of the permit or other approval to which the condition is attached46 second the burden imposed on the property owner by the exaction must be greater than roughly proportional to the impact of the proposed development on the community 47 moreover the burden of proving rough proportionality is on the government this twoprong test places greater burden on the government defendant than the test for regulatory takings and is referred to as heightened scrutiny the supreme court has clarified that not any condition attached to development permit can ground an exaction taking claim rather the court particularly has in mind conditions requiring that the permit applicant dedicate land to specific purposeas by recorded easement lower courts have split on whether an exaction taking claim can be based in addition on monetary exactionwhen government requires payment as condition for development approval at least potentially the conditions that landowners opt for in their submitted hcps could be subject to exaction taking challenge such conditions have at times included dedications of acreage on the itp applicants land or commitment by the applicant to purchase mitigation credits if the itp applicant realistically had choice but to adopt one of these options to meet the statutory criteria for itp issuance and the condition lacks an essential nexus or rough proportionality an exaction taking claim becomes possible we have information on how often this happens in practice but can note that even after three decades of implementation there appear to be

is not ripe because taking is not unconstitutional unless it is uncompensated and plaintiff has not sought compensation the citys motion to dismiss is also granted plaintiff has satisfied the ripeness requirement that to assert taking claim in federal court plaintiff first must obtain final decision from the government agency but plaintiff has not satisfied the second ripeness requirement for

seeking an injunctive rather than compensation remedy comment even had the plaintiff sought monetary compensation and satisfied all ripeness requirements the taking claim against the fws if for more

lumber to build on another lot they own they allege that owing to state and county landuse restrictions harvesting timber is the lots only economic use in 2001 the nmfs told plaintiffs the harvest would violate the by harming listed salmon in the river bordering the lot the nmfs later said they could apply for an itp requiring them to prepare hcp however plaintiffs research led them to believe that the cost of applying for an itp and preparing hcp would be greater than the modest value of their trees and property hence they did neither and instead filed taking claim held claim is not ripe plaintiffs challenge the cost of the administrative process rather than any use restrictions that may result from it but there has been final agency decision that has sufficiently fixed the cost of the application and the agency has discretion to assist plaintiffs with their application indeed nmfs handbook instructs field offices to assist itp applicants because the court has way to predict what influence the wielding of that discretion will have on plaintiffs costs this case cannot be ripe therefore the court will not reach plaintiffs novel theory that taking can result from the cost of complying with valid regulatory process where the government has never actually restricted the use of the property comment this decision is but one manifestation of the longstanding judicial insistence that to ripen taking claim based on federal permit requirement the landowner must at least begin the permit application and negotiation process various takingslaw ripeness doctrines may indeed excuse the plaintiffs failure to pu rsue the process all the way to formal permit denialthe general minimum prerequisite for ripe taking claimbut to demonstrate their applicability the process

states 364 f3d 1356 fed cir 2004 plaintiffs owned 200acre tract almost all mberlands in 1994 oregon designated 40 acres of the tract as spotted owl nesting habitat by state law this designation barred timber harvesting on the 40 acres unless plaintiffs obtained an itp under the federal the united states had designated the spotted owl threatened species the fws found plaintiffs itp application inadequate but said it was willing to work with them the plaintiffs rejected this offer and in 2000 the application was denied the denial letter indicated however that several approvable alternatives including selective harvesting were available to plaintiffs plaintiffs simply applied for reconsideration of the denial which was deni ed in 2001 oregon informed the plaintiffs that it longer opposed timbering because the owls had moved away and in 2002 the fws found that an itp was longer needed for the same reason the plaintiffs seek compensation for temporary taking from 2000 to 2002 held claim is ripe but taking for purposes of this decision the court assumes that the federal barred logging during the period of the alleged taking without which there can be federal taking the taking claim was ripe even though the fws identified approvable alternatives that the plaintiffs declined to pursue the fws did not say it lacked enough information to grant or deny the permit rather it formally denied the permit and did not allow further reconsideration on the merits there was physical taking by the presence of the owls nor was there regulatory taking the government action did not deprive the relevant parcel whether defined as the 200acre parcel or solely the trees on the 200acre parcel of all economic value and indeed plaintiffs made showing of any economic injury caused by the temporary taking further there was regulatory taking by the alternative test failure to substantially advance legitimate government interest comment this case puts in high relief the ubiquitous takingslaw issue of how to define the relevant parcelthat is the precise property interest that the court will look at in assessing the impact of the governments action on the plaintiff it does so in two ways first it requires that the 40 acres be evaluated together with the remaining 160 acres on the parcel this was noncontroversialsquarely in line with precedent second the court raised but did not resolve the issue whether the timber on the 200 acres could be regarded separately prior to harvesting from the land on which it grew restrictions on commercial timber harvesting boise cascade corp v united states 296 f3d 1339 fed cir 2002 the fws determined that allowing boise cascade to log its 65acre oldgrowth tract in oregon might harm spotted owls that would otherwise nest there subsequently in october 1998 district court permanently enjoined the logging until boise obtained an itp while boises itp application was pending however an owl living on the tract was found dead and surveys found other owls in the area so the fws said an itp was longer required accordingly the district court in august 1999 lifted the injunction boise seeks compensation for the temporary taking of its merchantable timber which it was prevented from logging during the court injunction held taking the fws never denied boises itp the company was enjoined only from logging without permit the mere imposition of permit requirement by regulatory agency does not by itself effect regulatory taking nor is there per physical taking by the owls the government is only regulating the use of the tract due to the incidental location of the owls there

further told him that he could apply for an itp which would allow the house construction to proceed however when the plaintiff applied the fws insisted he agree to all the required mitigation before it would process the application plaintiff declined believing the demanded mitigation to be overly restrictive held claim is ripe but total taking in an unpublished prior decision the court held that despite the absence of formal denial of the permit application the fwss insistent position ripened the taking claim in the decision here the court holds that there is total taking because the development restrictions do not deprive plaintiffs property of all economic value the parties must present additional evidence however before the court can determine whether partial regulatory taking

coast steelhead trout as endangered in response the water district operator of the bureau of reclamations ventura river project requested the bureau to initiate section 7 consultation with the nmfs the result was revised operating criteria for the project to augment river flow for the endangered fish under these new criteria the water district had to forego exercising its appropriative water right to up to 3200 acrefeet of water per year from the river for irrigation purposes in the compliance option chosen by the district or by nmfs the facts are unclear on this water already diverted from the river by project dam and canal was rediverted to fish passage facility that returned the water back to the river held to be analyzed as physical not regulatory taking three supreme court opinions 1931 to 1963 hold that when the us physically diverts water away from plaintiffs property or causes the water to be so diverted physical taking occurs the government says these cases are distinguishable since all that is involved with casitas is restriction on the use of water appropriately analyzed as regulatory taking this position must be rejected the government did not merely require some water to remain in the stream but instead caused the physical diversion of water away from the canal to the fish ladder reducing casitass water supply the governments position that in contrast to the supreme court trilogy the us did not divert the water for its own use or for use by third party must also be rejected preservation of endangered species habitat is for government and third party the public use finally the sharp distinction made in tahoesierra preservation council inc v tahoe regional planning agency 535 us 302 2002 between regulatory and physical takings is not relevant here that case did not involve physical taking claim comment the decision does not actually find physical taking but rather remands to the trial court for further proceedings on physical taking theory nonetheless under physical taking theory the plaintiff is almost sure to wi n unless the us can convince the trial court that water rights in california are so conditional eg due to the states public trust or reasonable use doctrines that the water diversio n took right the plaintiff ever had nor may the case get back to the trial court if the us is successful in its petition filed december 10 2008 to have the case reheard by the banc federal circuit the rules governing which government actions are to be analyzed as physical takings and which as regulatory takings are recurring issue the issue is pivotal since taking plaintiff is much more likely to win under physical theory in casitas the trial court judge had to decide whether his earlier characterization in tulare lake see below of an esamandated reduction in water delivery as physical taking governed here as well he held that it did not owing to the supreme courts intervening decision in tahoesierra noted above and concluded that casitas was to be analyzed on regulatory taking theory this led the federal circuit in the casitas appeal to address tahoesierra at some lengthconcluding as noted above that tahoesierra in way undercut the supreme courts physical diversion trilogy and its characterization of such diversions as physical takings but because tulare lake was prevention of water use case rather than

taking there was taking of plaintiffs water rights plaintiffs interests in klamath project water fall into two broad categories as to those based on water delivery contracts with the bureau of reclamation the traditional reasons for favoring breach of contract approach over takings approach applythe united states acted in its proprietary not sovereign capacity in entering into the contracts and the plaintiffs retain the full panoply of remedies to vindicate their contract rights because the individualirrigator plaintiffs are thirdparty beneficiaries of the contracts with the water districts their claims too sound in contract not takings while not resolving the contract claims in this decision the court suggested reasons why they were unlikely to succeed the remaining water rights asserted by plaintiffs are based on patent deeds from the united states for federal land in oregon and state water permits from oregon however these rights assuming they exist were established well after the 1905 appropriation of the klamath waters by the united states the united states is thus the senior right holder under the prior appropriation doctrine used in oregon allowing it to insist that junior right holders such as the plaintiffs curtail their use as necessary for the united states to satisfy its senior rights comment in later decision in the case 75 fed cl 677 fed cl

water projectwhich project in turn reduced the water delivered to two of the plaintiffs who had waterdelivery contracts with the state other plaintiffs in the case received less water under their waterdelivery contracts with these two plaintiffs held taking there was taking of the plaintiffs right to use the water in the amount of the reduction the plaintiffs contracts with the state conferred right to the exclusive use of prescribed quantities of water thus mere restriction on use as to the water not delivered completely eviscerates the right to that amount of water and constitutes

moreover at the time it was decided it was the only court decision involving any circumstance that found taking second the courts rationale included some controversial conclusionseg that regulatory restriction effected physical taking and that the plaintiffs acquired greater rights against the us under their contracts with the state than they had against the state third and related to the second
