protection the copyright act2 offers legal protection to creator s of original works of authorship that are fixed in tangible medium of expression3 such original works4 must be captured in some form that is sufficiently permanent or stable for it to be perceived reproduced or otherwise communicated for pe riod beyond transitory duration5 the types of creative works that are potentially eligible for copyright protection fall into several categories including literary works musical works dramatic works pantomimes and choreographic works pictorial graphic and sculptural works moti on pictures and otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22801crs2 6 17 usc 102a 7 17 usc 103 compilation is work formed by the collection and assembling of preexisting materials or of data that are selected coordinated or arranged in such way that the resulting work as whole constitutes an original work of authorship derivative work is work based upon one or more preexisting works such as translati on musical arrangement dramatization fictionalization motion pictur version sound recording art reproduction abridgment condensation or any other form in which work may be recast transformed or adapted 17 usc 101 definition of compilation and derivative work 8 baker v selden 101 us 99 1879 17 usc 102b 9 17 usc 105 the copyright act defines w ork of the united states government to mean work prepared by an officer or employee of the united states government as part of that persons official duties 17 usc 101 10 17 usc 10615 11 the us copyright act frequently uses many t erms of art throughout its provisions these terms often have meanings that differ from ordinary usage in everyday language for example copy is material object other than phonor ecord that embodies fixation of an original work of authorship phonorecord is materi object in which sounds are fixed and from which the sounds can be perceived reproduced or otherwise communicated di rectly or with the aid of machine or device these defin itions and others are found in 17 usc 101audiovisual works sound recordings and architectural works6 in addition copyright protects compilations and derivative works7 however copyright protection does not extend to any underlying abstract idea pro cedure process syst em method of operation concept principle or discovery but rath er it only protects the manner in which those ideas are expressed8 works of the federal government are statut orily excluded from the scope of copyright protection9 this includes the written opinions of federal courts fe deral reports and documents administrative regulations and public laws these materials are considered to be in the public domain works in the pub lic domain are available for anyone to use without concern of infringement exclusive rights of copyright owner the grant of copyright bestows several ri ghts upon the creator of work or the individual having legal interest in the work that permit the copyright holder to control the use of the protected material these stat utory rights allow copyright holder to do or to authorize the following10 the reproduction of the copyrighted work the preparation of derivative work s based on the copyrighted work the distribution of copies or phonorecords11 of the copyrighted work the public performance of the copyrighted work and the public display of the copyrigh ted work including the individual images of motion picturehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22801crs3 12 17 usc 109a 13 for example when person purchases copyrigh ted works such as books cds or dvds the purchaser becomes the owner of those particul ar material objects that embody the underlying artistic and literary works but he gains authority to exercise the exclusive copyright rights of the creator of those works such as reproducti on or public performance with the exception of further distribution through sale rental or other transfer of ownership which is right provided by the first sale doctrine to the purchaser of those material objects however there are two express statutory exceptions to the firs t sale doctrine for sound recordings that embody musical works and for computer programs th record rental amendment act of 1984 pl 98450 1984 and the computer software rental amendment act of 1990 pl 101650 1990 prevent owners of phonorecords em bodying musical works or persons possessing copies of computer programs from renting leasing or nding those material objects for the purposes of direct or indirect commercial ad vantage without the authoriza tion of the copyright owners of those works 17 usc 109b1a 14 17 usc 108 15 17 usc 1103 16 17 usc 1104 17 17 usc 107 18 idthe copyright act contains several st atutory limitations on the copyright monopoly these include the first sale doctrine12 that limits the copyright owners exclusive control over distribution of the materi objects in which work is expressed the first sale doctrine permits the owner of particular copy of copyrighted work to sell or dispose of that copy without the copyright owners permission13 other limitations involve allowing certain reproductions by libraries and archives14 limited performances and displays for educational purposes or in the course of services at place of worship15 and certain performances for nonprofit charitable causes16 the doctrine of fair use in copyright law recognizes the right of the public to make reasonable use of copyrighted material unde r particular circumstances without the copyright holders consent for example teacher may be able to use reasonable excerpts of copyrighted works in preparing scholarly lecture or commentary without obtaining permission to do so the copyrigh t act mentions fair use for purposes such as criticism comment news reporting teaching scholarship or research17 however determination of fair use by court considers four factors the purpose and character of the use including whether such use is of commercial nature or is fo r nonprofit educational purposes the nature of the copyrighted work the amount and subs tantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as whole and the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of thecopyrighted work 18 because the language of the fair use statut is illustrative deter mining what constitutes fair use of copyrighted work is often difficult to make in advance according to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22801crs4 19 campbell v acuffrose music inc 510 us 569 577 1994 20 the dmca added new chapter 12 to the copyright act entitled copyright protection and

negotiated fee 27 the copyright act provides several compulsory licenses for certain uses of music in which the third party need not seek the authorization of the copyrighted holder but rather simply pays statutorily prescribed royalty rate for the privile ge of using the work in particular limited ways for example 17 usc 115 allows user to pa statutory fee to songwriter for the right to reproduce
