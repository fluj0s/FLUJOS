information exchange the final and most important element of nhii is electronic connectivity via the internet and other networks enabling health care providers to exchange patient health information networks that pe rmit electronic communication among providers must be secure in order to safeguard the information from unauthorized access use and disclosure they also require the velopment of data

fully integrated into general medical practice3 barriers to the adoption of health it the us health care industry which re presents about 15 of gdp lags far behind other sectors of the economy in its i nvestment in it despite growing evidence that electronic information systems can play critical role in addressing many of the challenges the industry faces there are significant obstacles to the doption of ehrs and the creation of nhii some of which are brie fly discussed below standards enormous amounts of data needed for c linical care patient safety and quality improvement currently reside on computer s however ehrs and communitybased health information networks have been slow to develop because of lack of interoperability standa rds to support electronic data ex change physicians and other providers are hesitant to invest in it syst ems fearing that they might not be able to exchange patient information with local pharmacies hospitals or even other physicians common standards for organi zing representing and encoding health information permit the efficient exchange of clinical and patient safety data they also support the assimilation of external da ta sources into decision support tools for providers eg alerts for po ssible drugdrug interactions the federal government is playing leading role in encouraging the development and adoption of interoperability standards for

httpwwwhl7orgehrsupport president bushs management agenda the goal of the chi initiative is to establish federal health information interoperability standards both to promote information sharing across the three federal departments that deliver health care services and to serve as model for the private sector to date the agencies have adopted 20 sets of standards developed by privatesector standards development organizations sdos they include ssaging standards standards for the electronic exchange of clinical lab results standards for retail pharmacy transactions and standards for the retrie val and transfer of image s and associated diagnostic information hhs has also signed an agreement to license systematized nomenclature of medicine clinical terms snomed ct standardized medical vocabulary developed by the college of american pathologists and available for free to users in the united states s nomed ct which is now available through the national library of medicine4 is the most comprehensive clinical vocabulary available and covers most aspects of clinical medicine it will help structure and computerize the medical record and reduce variability in the way the data are captured encoded and used for clinical car of patients and for medical research in may 2003 hhs requested that the io m provide guidance to the agency on set of basic functionalities that an ehr should possess that is the types of information that should be available to providers when making clinical decisions eg diagnoses allergies lab results and the types of decisionsupport capabilities that should be present eg alerts to poten tial drugdrug interactions the iom did not address specific data standards eg terminolog messaging standards diagnostic codes health level seve n hl7 leading sdo working on the development of an ehr standard has taken the core functionalities identified by the iom and incorporated them into its draf t standard which has been approved and is undergoing twoyear trial before it becomes an official standard5 coordinating the care patient recei ves from multiple providers does not require the transmission of the entire ehr with each referral in most cases the physician to whom patient is referred needs only the most relevant and timely facts about the patients condition astm inte rnational in collaboration with the massachusetts medical society the health information management and systems society and the american academy of family physicians is developing the continuity of care record ccr to meet that need the ccr is intended to be national standard for all rele vant information necessary for continuity of care it consists of minimum data set that includes provider information insurance information patients health status g allergies medi

s ecretary to issue electronic format and data standards for several routine administrative transactions between health care providers and health plans eg reimbursement claims and adopt security standards to safeguard electronic patient in formation against unauthorized access use or disclosure developing secure platform to protect confidential health data is central to the growth of an nhii under hipaa hhs has also issued health privacy standards that give individuals the right of access to their medical information and prohibit plans and providers from using or disclosing such information without the patients author ization except for routine health care operations and other specified purposes th growing use and exchange of electronic health data raises serious privacy cerns among the public and some lawmakers who question whether the privacy standards are sufficiently broad in scope to protect confidential patient information financial challenges there are two key financial obstacles to the adoption of ehr and the development of an nhii investment cost s and the misalignment between costs and benefits investment in it is expensive and must compete with other priorities including new buildings as well as other t echnologies with more direct application to clinical care and greater certainty for increased revenues full clinical it system that includes cpoe and an ehr coupled with clinical decision support functions can cost tens of millions of dollars for large hospital and that does not include the costs of training and systems support the startup and maintenance costs of it systems may be especially burdensome for small physician practices while t hose costs vary tremendously depending on the nature of the practice and the applica tions involved the average cost of an ehr can range from 16000 to 36000 the complexity of the technology the time to complete implementation nd the changes in office workflow patterns create additional barriers to adopting it systems but perhaps the most critical issue for physicians is the perception that the itrela ted benefits of impr oved efficiency and quality of care accrue largely to the payers and patients not to the providers who bear most of the implementation costs rather than reward quality most physician reimbursement systems emphasize volume of services physicians are paid for each procedure or service they provide regardless of its quality this approach encourages providers to see as many patients as possible and to emphasize the provision of billable service such as an mri over technology that might improve the quality of many services physician group that invests in clinical it system to improve the way it manages the care of patients with chronic conditions can reduce

r is to adopt payforperformance scheme that rewards clinicians who deliver the best quality of car according to standardized measures as opposed to th highest volume of care legal barriers health it experts have identified several federal laws that may unintentionally impede the development of electronic connectivity in health care because these laws do not directly address health it health care providers are uncertain about what would constitute violation or create the risk of litigation the medicare physician selfreferral stark law 42 usc 1395nn and the antikickback law 42 usc 1320a7bb which covers all federal health care prog rams are of chief concern both are intended to counter fraud and abuse7 the stark law prohibits physicians from referring patients to any entity for certain health services if the physician has financial relationship with the entity and prohibits entities from billing for any services resulting from such referrals unless an exception applies the law discourages physicians from accepting it resources eg hardware and software from hospital or other health care entity out of concern that they would be in violation if they subsequently re ferred patients to that entity the antikickback law like the lfreferral law also impedes arrangements between health care entities that promote the adoption of health it it prohibits an individual or entity from knowingly or willf ully offering or accepting remuneration of any kind to induce patient referral for or purchase of an item or service covered by any federal health care program on march 26 2004 the centers for medi care and medicaid services cms published final interim ru creating several new exceptions under the physician selfreferral law including one for it items and services furnished to physicians to enable them to participate in communitywide health information systems8 experts have questioned whether this term is sufficiently inclusive to cover all thevarious health it arrangements they have also criticized the lack of parallel exception under the antikickback law national framework for strategic action on april 27 2004 president bush calle d for the widespread adoption of

health info rmation technology delivering consumercentric and informationrich health care9 although the federal government has taken the lead in setting the health it agenda the framework sets out bottomup approach in which the role of hhs is to promote and encourage the private sector to build communitylev networks adopting interoperability standards will over time permit these local networks to connect with one another to form an nhii the framework identified four major goals with strategic action areas for each inform clinical practice this goal focuses on bringing ehrs into clinical practice by providing incentives for eh r adoption reducing the risk of ehr investment and promoting ehr diffusi on in rural and dically underserved areas interconnect physicians this goal centers on building an interoperable health information infrastructure so that ehrs follow the patient and clinicians have access to critical health information when treatment decisions are being made the strategies for realizing this goal involve fostering communitybased health information exchange projects devel oping national health information network and coordina ting federal health information systems personalize health care this goal involves using health it to help individuals manage their own wellness and become more involved in personal health decisions improve population health the final goal requires the timely collection analysis and dissemination of clinical information to improve the evaluation of health care delivery public health monitoring and biosurveillance it also helps accelerate research and the translation of research findings into clinical products and practice the framework identifies several potential policy options for providing incentives for ehr adoption they include regional grants and contracts to stimulate ehrs and community information exchange systems improving the availability of wrate loans for ehr adoption updating federal rules on
