number of states have taken actions that directly address greenhouse gas ghg emissions st ates efforts cover wide range of policies although much of the early activity was largely symbolic the more recent state actions have been more aggressive twentythree states have joined one of the three regional partnerships that would require ghg or just carbon dioxide emission reductions set to take effect in 2009 the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi is partnership of 10 northeast and midatlantic states that creates capand trade system aimed at limiting carbon dioxide emis sions from power plants seven western states and four canadian provinces have formed the western climate initiative which set an economywide ghg emissions target of 15 below 2005 levels by 2020 in additi on six states and one canadian province signed the midwestern greenhouse gas reduction accord which aims to establish multisector ghg capandtrade program in the midwest the latter two programs are still in the early development stages rggi is on schedule for 2009 and participating states have already held one emission allowance auction california has addressed ghg emissions on several fronts to complement its statewide emissions reduction regime california established ghg performance standards that would effectively limit the use of coalgenerated electricity in california in 2004 california issued regulations to reduce greenhouse gases from motor vehicles at least 16 other states have indicated they intend to follow californias new vehicle requirements in addition the state has also taken action to reduce the carbon intensity in its transportation fuels predicting the precise consequences of the stateled climate change actions is difficult some actions particularly the mandatory emission reductions may create economic effects especially in the automotive manufacturing and electricitygenerating sectors industry stakeholders are especially concerned that the states will create patchwork of climate change regulations across the nation this prospect is causing some industry leaders to call for federal climate change program if congress seeks to establish federal program the experiences and lessons learned in the states may be instructive although some states are taking aggressive action their possible emission reductions may be offset by increased emissions in states without mandatory reduction requirements this is perhaps the central limitation of state climate change programs in actually affecting total greenhouse gas emissions legal challenges represent another obstacle for state programs particularly for the more aggressive mandatory programs

century particularly in recent decades scientists have documented increases in global temperature and sea levels decreases of sea ice in the arctic and melting of continental ice sheets and mountain glaciers there is increasing evidence that human activities are at least partially responsible for some of these effects1 this is based upon the combination of two conclusions first global temperature increases are linked in some manner to the measurable increases of greenhouse gas ghg concentrations in the atmosphere 2 second human activities eg fossil fuel combustion industrial processes and deforestation have contributed to the increased concentration of ghg emissions in the earths atmosphere the link between ghg emissions and climate change has motivated efforts to achieve reductions of emissions in 1992 the united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc which called on industrialized countries to initiate ghg reduction 3 however in early 2001 president george w bush rejected the unfccc 1997 kyoto protocol which called for legally binding commitments by developed countries to reduce their ghg emissions over the past decade the federal government s promulgated or proposed variety of voluntary and regulatory actions that while not specifically seeking to reduce ghg emissions may have yielded emission reductions as byproduct4 in the 110th congress members introduced multiple bills to address climate change issues in some fashion and enacted several pieces of legislation that contained climate change provisions5 in recent years there has been some congressional support for mandatory reduction program for example the senate version of the energy policy act of 2005 included sense of the senate resolution6 stating it is the sense of the senate that congress should enact comprehensive and effective national program of mandatory marketbased limits and incentives on emissions of greenhouse gases that slow stop and reverse the growth of such emissions at rate and in manner that 1 will not significantly harm the us economy and 2 will encourage other action and key contributors to global emissions members in the 110th congress introduced multiple bills that would have established some type of mandatory emissions reductions program one of these proposalsthe liebermanwarner 1 this report does not address the debates associated with the climate change science nor the role of human activity for more information see crs report rl34266 climate change science update 2007 by jane leggett 2 for example carbon dioxide the primary ghg has risen worldwide from 280 parts per million ppm to over 380 ppm over the past 150 years 3 the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc defines ghgs to include carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride 4 for example federal programs that promote energy efficiency or the use of renewable energy sources have the potential to reduce ghg emissions 5 for more details regarding this gislation see crs report rl34067 climate change legislation in the 110th congress by jonathan l ramseur and brent d yacobucci 6 senate amendment 866 to hr 6 passed by voice vote june 22 2005 motion to table the amendment was rejected by roll call vote 44 53

environment and public works committee december 2007 and debated in the senate in june 20087 in the absence of action by the federal government to establish national program that directly addresses ghg emi ssions number of states and local governments whose activities are not covered in this report8 have taken action in this arena states efforts cover wide spectrum from developing climate action plans to setting mandatory ghg emission standards arguably early state actions were largely symbolic in the late 1980s vermont9 and oregon10 were the first states to set ghg reductions goals but during the subsequent decade 19902001 both states increased their ghg emissions vermont by 18 and oregon by 3011 however majority of states have more recently begun to develop their own climate change strategies or policies with an increasing number of states adopting or proposing more significant provisions in cluding mandatory ghg reductions the motivating factors for the various states actions may be as diverse as the actions themselves some actions are motivated by projections of climatic changes such as sea level rise or agricultural impacts some states view their ghg policies as economic opportunities states want to position themselves for lesscarbonized future 12 by promoting for example alternative energy supplies particularly sources available instate other states champion ghg reduction policies because of the possible cobenefits improved air quality reduced traffic congestion and less reliance on foreign energy supplies another motivating factor for state action is the possibility of catalyzing federal legislation this report covers state actions that directly and explicitly address ghg emissions see the text box below first the report describes the different types of state actions both individual and cooperative efforts that are either proposed or under way and highlights several of the more significant developments second the report examines state actions from federal policymaking perspective including both the potential effects of stateled actions and their limitations 7 for more information on the progress and details re garding this legislation see crs report rl33846 greenhouse gas reduction capandtrade bills in the 110th congress by larry parker brent d yacobucci and jonathan l ramseur 8 number of local governments are pursuing activities that may directly or indirectly reduce ghg emissions for example numerous local governments cities counties in at least 35 states have joined the cities for climate protection ccp participating entities commit to reduce local emissions that contribute to global warming for more information on this program see httpwwwicleiorgindexphpid1118 9 vermont executive order 79 october 23 1989 called for 15 reduction

require ghg reductions represent the most aggressive end of the state action spectrum as with state actions overall these programs can vary significantly in scope stringency and design mandatory programs are generating considerable interest and some controversy this section discusses the different types of mandatory programs and highlights the regional initiatives and individual state actions that are currently in effect or under development g20g142g144g146g152g151g138g149g561g3g140g157g146g159g146g157g146g142g156g561 arguably the most significant action on the state level in recent years has involved the development of regional agreements to address ghg emissions as of the date of this report 23 states have joinedmore states are acting as observersone of the 3 regional partnerships that would require ghg or only co 2 emission reductions figure 1 except for the partnership between 10 northeastern states the regional activities are still in their developmental phases moreover the western and midwestern regional partnerships were initiated by state governors and may not be approved andor implemented by the relevant state legislatures in addition the regional agreements may raise legal issues particularly constitutional concerns article i section 10 clause 3 of the us constitution states that state shall without the consent of congress enter into any agreement or compact with another state or with foreign power in particular two of the regional agreements include canadian provinces however it is uncertain whether this clause the compact clause will create legal hurdles for any of the agreements httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33812g5g149g146g150g138g157g142g561g5g145g138g151g144g142g497g561g3g140g157g146g152g151g561g139g162g561g21g157

state level is the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi pronounced reggie rggi has been under development since 2003 when states from the northeast and midatlantic regions began to discuss setting up cooperative effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions subsequent meetings and workshops culminated in memorandum of understanding mou that was signed in december 2005 rggi is marketbased effort by 10 statesconnecticut delaware maine maryland 13 massachusetts14 new hampshire new jersey new york rhode island and vermontto reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants r ggi would set up the nations first mandatory capandtrade program for carbon dioxide15 the initial objective of rggi is to stabilize current carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in rggi states starting in january 2009 fo llowed by 10 reduction by 2019 primary strategy of rggi is to create program with fl exibility so that in the future other emission sourcessectors ghgs or states could be included 13 maryland governor omalley signed rggis memorandum of understanding on april 20 2007 making maryland the first state that was not an original rggi participant to join the regional initiative 14 massachusetts and rhode island were involved in rggis development from the beginning however both states governors declined to sign the memorandum of understanding in 2005 citing costs as their primary rationale for not participating massachusetts and rhode island joined rggi as participants in january 2007 15 in capandtrade system regulators set cap or limit on the overall emissions of given gas from specified group of sources such as power plants the emissions allowed under the new cap are then allocated in the form of credits or permits to individual sources sources that emit more than their allowance must buy credits from those who emit less than their allowance thus creating financial in centive for sources to reduce their own emissions for more information on capandtrade systems see

capandtrade program and thus several of rggis design elements are generating interest and debate for example one specific featurethe emission allocation schemeis drawing both praise and criticism in both rggis memorandum of understanding and its model rule states agreed that at least 25 of emission allowances will be allocated for consumer benefit or strategic energy purpose16 since then all of the states have indicatedeither through legislation or rulemakingsthat they intend to allocate more than 25 of their states emissions allowances for various purposes related to those two overarching objectives 17 this allocation strategy requires power plants to purchase the allowances through an auction instead of receiving them at charge18 on september 25 2008 rggi participants held the first emission allowance auction related to climate change mitigation six rggi statesconnecticut maine maryland massachusetts rhode island and vermontsold allowances for the first rggi compliance period 20092011 19 by many accounts the auction was successful the clearing price as 307ton 60 higher than the reserve price compliance entities received about 80 of the allowances and states received nearly 40 million in revenues20 although rggi is one of the more aggressive state programs addressing climate change the program has received some criticism and may face upcoming challenges for example recent emissions data indicate that the rggi cap188 mill ion short tons of carbon dioxidewill most likely be higher than actual emissions when rggi goes into effect in 2009 the cap was set slightly above about 4 the average emission levels observed between 2000 and 2002 rggi designers anticipated that emissions would grad ually increase so that actual levels would approximately match the cap in 2009 although emissions increased in 2007 from their relatively dramatic decline of 2006 emissions data from the first half of 2008 are similar to 2006 figures suggesting that 2008 emission are unlikely to increase further 21 another estimate projects that 2008 emissions may go as low as 150 mtco 2 approximately 20 below the 2009 cap22 16 see rggi model rule issued august 15 2006 p 42 and

nv ironment nort heast note t hat nvironment northea st gene rated its data from epas clean air mar kets da ta at httpwwwepagovairmarkets if actual emissions are below the cap when it goes into effect the effectiveness of the rggi program may be impacted the allowance price might drop to such low level that facilities would have financial incentive to make reductions beyond their required allocation 23 this potential problem may be alleviated by the opportunity for affected sources to bank emission reductions for future use when the cap will likely be lower than expected emissions the rggi program allows unlimited banking the ability to bank reductions effectively spreads the costs of emission reduction over time banking emissions would reduce compliance costs in the future but also increase the value of current allowances because they can be sold later the incentive to make additional reductions would remain the recent auction sales data support this notion as the clearing price was above the reserve price in addition to allocation concerns critical design detailelectricity imports from nonrggi statesis arguably unresolved this is often described as the leakage problem leakage can occur when an emissions reduction program does not include all sources contributing to the environmental problem for example if rggi state lowers its emissions by importing more power from nonrggi state the emissions reducti ons in the rggi state may be offset by an emission increase in the exporting state rggi working group issued final report on leakage march 2008 among the four recommendations the working group concluded that states should monitor for emissions leakage and evaluate whether more aggressive measureseg carbon adders procurement emissions rates or loadbased capsshould be considered at later date24 23 this problem occurred during the first phase of the european unions emission trading system for more discussion see crs report rl34150 climate change and

initiative wci wci got off the ground in february 2007 when the governors of six western states25 arizona california oregon new mexico utah and washingtonagreed to reduce ghg emissions in their region26 montana and the four canadian provincesbritish columbia manitoba quebec and ontariojoined at later dates27 the states and provinces set regional economywide target to reduce ghg emissions to15 below 2005 levels by 2020 in order to implement this target the participants agreed to develop marketbased program such as loadbased cap and trade program in september 2008 the wci developers issued design recommendations for meeting the emission reduction goals the recommendations include capandtrade system that would cover emissions from electricity generation and large industrial and commercial sources in 2012 in 2015 the program would cover emissions from the transportation sector and fuel consumption from residential commercial and industrial uses not otherwise covered 28 the recommendations also include flexible design elements such as unlimited emission banking threeyear compliance periods and offsets which may satisfy up to 49 of the emission reductions although this number may appear relatively high compared to federal capandtrade proposals limiting offsets by percentage of reductions is different from limiting offsets as percentage of allowance submissions as many federal proposals would do as comparison that may provide additional context rggi participants agreed to similar principle at least half of the reductions should come from covered sources thus allowing offsets to cover up to 50 of reductions to apply this principle rggi designers allow offsets to satisfy up to 33 of compliance submission 29 in contrast most federal proposals would allow domestic offsets to satisfy at least 15 international offsets often add further percentage of covered sources allowance submission although the wci is still in early development there are several issues that may hinder its implementation as noted the wci is an agreement between the states governors to implement the program the states legislatures would need to enact laws to carry out the initiatives objectives this may present an obstacle if states legislative branch finds fault with the reduction program developed by states executive branch officials

the accord potentially raising the same legal issues discussed above the accord does not establish discrete ghg emissions targets but directs the participating states and their relevant state agencies to set their own ghg emission reduction targets in order to meet these ghg emission targets the accord calls for the participants to develop capandtrade program and model rule by november 2008 although draft recommendations were made available november 2008 the time line was amended by the participants draft model rule is now scheduled for september 2009 31 the participants agreed that full implementa tion of the accord will be completed by may 2010 although not full participants in the accord the governors of indiana ohio and south dakota signed on as observers agreeing to participate in the formation of the regional capandtrade system

state efforts that seek to reduce ghg emissions cover range of activities outside of regional agreements several states currently require power plants to make ghg emission reductions or submit offsets other states are developing economywide32 ghg emission reduction programs multiple states are planning to adopt californias motor vehicle standards for ghg emissions in addition states are working on other mechanisms that would require ghg emission reductions these state efforts are discussed below

determining critical details concerning the framework and applicability of the program for example the law does not specifically require the use of marketbased system such as capandtrade program to reduce ghg emissions instead ab 32 authorizes carb to develop regulations to achieve the maximum technologically feasible and costeffective ghg emission reductions moreover the statute does not include list of regulated emission sources or categories34 but instructs carb to determine which sources are necessary to meet the statewide target35 the statute does dictate schedule for various agency deadlines the following dates highlight significant milestones of the mandatory schedule june 30 2007 identify the early reduction options which can be implemented prior to the mandatory program and for which facility will receive emissions credit in october 2007 carb submitted its final report of early actions which are to be implemented via regulation and enforceable by january 1

reduction program and washington has statewide emissions reduction target both states are participants in regional emissions reduction program wci the implementation of californias emissions reduction program and the wci is several years away irrespective of legal challenges the performance standards act as stopgap measure preventing further utility investment in carbonintensive fuels while the states develop broader reduction regimes once the new performance standards are applicable and previous commitments expire they will effectively prohibit california and washington consumers from using

of carbon dioxide using current technologies coalfired generators would fail to meet the new emissions standards67 from 2002 through 2005 approximately 20 of californias electricity was generated from coal68 approximately 10 of washingtons electricity came from coal generation facilities over the same period69 as the laws take effect california and washington will likely need to reduceconserve comparable amount of energy or replace the coalgenerated electricity with alternative sources of power the new emissions standards will impact not only california and washington but also other states in the west for example californias electricity imports generally comprise between 22 and 32 of the states total electricity consumption but its imports are responsible for 39 to 57 of the total ghg emissions linked with electricity 70 this is due to the fact that most of californias instate electricity is produced from sources other than coal while most of the states imported electricity is generated through coal combustion once the standard takes effect the coalfired plants in neighboring states which previously provided electricity to california will need to look elsewhere for customers the same goes for coalfired power plants still in development in western states which may have been designed at least in part to serve california consumers71 arguably the ghg performance standards dispropor tionately affect the neighboring states that have historically exported coalgenerated electricity to california and washington consumers this possible consequence may raise legal

approval of coalfired electric generating units unless minimum of 50 of the co 2 generated by the facility would be captured and sequestered the psc promulgated regulations to implement this standard

one public utilitynorthwestern energyin the 67 as technology advances coalfired plants might be able to reduce ghg emissions through carbon capture and sequestration ccs however there is relatively

january 18 2007 establishing low carbon fuel standard lcfs the lcfs aims to reduce the carbon intensity of californias transportation fuels by 10 by 2020 california currently relies on petroleumbased fuels for 96 of its transportation needs 75 achieving the carbon intensity reduction is expected to replace 20 of the states gasoline consumption with less carbonintensive fuels76 the lcfs would apply to all refiners blenders producers and importers of transport fuels the order states that transportation fuels shall be measured on full fuel cycle basis thus regulators must factor in all of the energy used and potent ial ghgs emitted during the fuels development extraction or production delivery via vehicle or pipeline and final use combustion cornbased ethanol for example is expected to play role in meeting californias lcfs to comply with the full fuel cycle assessm ent regulators must consider the energy needed to produce fertilizers operate farm equipment transport corn convert corn to ethanol and distribute the final product for more information on these issues see crs report rl33290 fuel ethanol background and public policy issues by brent d yacobucci the lcfs executive order enhances alternative fuel legislation ab 1007 that california passed in 2005 77 ab 1007 requires the california energy commission cec in partnership with other agencies including carb to develop and adopt state alternative fuels plan cec adopted such plan october 31 2007 the executive order directs cec to supplement this plan with compliance schedule for meeting the 2020 lcfs target the state alternative fuels plan states that cec will work with carb over the ne xt year to develop compliance schedule 78 as of the date of this report the compliance schedule remains under development

in achieving ghg emissions reduction by themselves state emissions targets do not directly reduce ghg emissions the targets are often established by the executive branch of state government eg through an executive order and may not have the support of the states legislative branch however target signals that state officials at least from one branch of the government consider climate change an important issue twenty states have established statewide targets for ghg emissions see table 1 83 three of the state targetscalifornia hawaii and new jerseyare mandatory discussed above compared to the ghg limits and targets set on the international stage in past years the state targets are less stringent 84 the new england states targets are similar if not identical because they are part of

emissions in 1990 with emissions from the most recent years of available data87 the emissions data show the reductions states would need to make to meet their established targets although some of the states appear within reach of their 2010 targets the most recent data from many of these states suggest that emissions are not decreasing but at best are leveling off in some stateseg arizona and floridaemissions have increased substantially in recent years more years of data are needed to evaluate progress primarily because many of the states issued their ghg ta rgets after 2003 moreover the

accompanying reduction requirement for example if companies ghg emissions were made publiclyavailable and thus comparable the companies might have an incentive to reduce emissions voluntarily 90

in order to gain additional allowances once reduction program is established91 few states already require and others are in the process of developing ghg emissions reporting to complement an emissions reduction program some states require reporting of ghg emissions that are not included in reduction programs for example some of the rggi states mandate reporting of nonco2 ghg emissions in addition other states currently have mandatory reporting program that is not linked with an emissions reduction requirement both of these types of reporting activities are listed below in the order of when the program started or is scheduled to start wisconsin in 1993 the state established mandatory reporting program that includes carbon dioxide reporting for facilities generating over 100000 tons annually 92 new jersey certain facilities in new jersey that report air pollutant emissions must also submit emission data for carbon dioxide and methane this requirement went into effect in 2003 93 new jersey is developing mandatory reduction program discussed above that will entail more comprehensive reporting regime maine facilities in maine that emit any criteria pollutant over specific reporting threshold must also report ghg emissions this provision went into effect july 200494 connecticut starting in 2006 facilities subject to federal reporting under title v of the clean air act must submit ghg emissions data on an annual basis95 california see the above discussion regarding the implementation of ab 32 which includes mandatory ghg emission reporting north carolina facilities with title v

registries are voluntary programs that allow facilities to submit and officially record emissions data the states voluntary registry programs encourage participation through incentives perhaps the primary incentive is the opportunity for participants to create an official record of emissions reductions which th parties hope will count as emissions credits in future mandatory reduction programs at minimum participants typically receive some public recognition for their efforts which may help promote companys environmental stewardship profile five states have passed legislation to establish ghg registries of which three are now under way 100 new hampshire the new hampshire ghg registry went into effect in 2001 the registry is intended to record emissions reductions in state database that can be used in addressing possible future requirements california the california climate action registry began operations in 2002 this state registry is arguably the most comprehensive as participants register all of their ghg emissions for operations in california other state and federal registries cover only emission reductions the registry has over 100 participants wisconsin the wisconsin v oluntary emission reduction registry registry of voluntary reductions of ghg emissions went online in 2003 numerous states are joining forces to establish national registry which may link with

methane in general states create their inventories by following guidelines developed by the environmental protection agency epa that are based on internationally recognized standards inventories are often used to obtain an overall assessment of states emissions levels and sources and are perhaps best suited for monitoring trends andor developing comprehe nsive strategies although some states have

example there has been some debate regarding how capandtrade program might work on national level although the federal acid rain program which involves sulfur dioxide emissions trading is generally considered success emissions trading programs for other purposes have encountered problems during implementation104state and regional programs offer the opportunity to iron out logistical details that are crucial in capandtrade system how high to set the emissions cap which sources to regulate how to allocate emissions allowances whether to allow the use of offsets as compliance alternatives whether to include safety valve and if so how high to set it state programs can inform federal policymakers in other ways the political process by which states create climate change policy can be enlightening and perhaps adaptable on the federal level for instance by examining the development and passage of state legislation federal policymakers may better understand the motivations of different stakeholders and learn how best to frame the issues g18g152g156g156g146g139g149g142g561g7g140g152g151g152g150g146g140g561g7g143g143g142g140g157g156g561 emission reduction programs will likely have economic effects on consumers businesses and manufacturers and possibly interstate commerce105the most immediate effects of the emissions programs at least the ones furthest along in development will be on the automotive manufacturing and electricity generation sectors for automotive manufacturers the california motor vehicle regulationswhich at least 16 states have indicated they plan to implement if epa approves the waiver discussed abovewill likely have the effect of dividing the market potentially requiring the manufacture of different class of cars to meet the new standards scheduled to apply in 2009 for automotive companies this raises the issues of the technical means of mee ting the standard marketing ensuring compliance and pricing depending on how the emission limits ar to be met they may also influence fueling infrastructure state governments will need resources to enforce the standards consumers in regulated states may face higher prices for vehicles regarding the electric power industry the mandatory reduction requirements will likely promote generation from low carbonintensive fuels while curtailing generation from high carbon intensive fuels such as coal the ghg performance standards in california and washington will reach into neighboring states as well effectively barring electricity imports generated by 104 for example the southern californias regional clean air incentives market reclaim which was implemented in 1994 to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides nox and sulfur dioxide so2 saw 50fold increase in nox allowance prices during the 20002001 california energy crisis the european unions ghg trading system has also experienced drastic swings in allowance prices during its startup years making planning and decisionmaking difficult for participating entities for additional informa tion on the eu trading system see crs report rl33581 climate change the european unions emissions trading system euets by

to produce lowercost electricity the result of these requirements may be to increase electricity prices within the states that limit emissions and possibly lower prices in states without such emission standards if the ghg limitations lead to energy price increases in the regulated states businesses and manufacturers may factor this cost into location decisions there is some concern that regulated industries will have financial incentive to move and thus transfer jobs to states or nations that do not limit ghg emissions 106 others fear that emission limits will raise the cost of living and doing business within those states although in theory such effects can be at least partially addressed through the design of the emissions reduction program107

programs in lieu of federal program will create patchwork of regulations across the nation patchwork system of standards may hinder companys efficiency and possibly create economic burdens for firms that operate in multiple states the prospect of regulations that vary from state to state is driving some companies to support federal climate change program with comparable requirements across the entire united states g14g146g150g146g157g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g152g143g561g21g157g138g157g142g561g3g140g157g146g152g151g156g561 climate change has been described as the ultimate global commons problem108 the global warming and climate impacts associated with increased ghg emissions in the atmosphere cannot be linked with specific emission sources unlike localized reductions in other air pollutants eg sulfur dioxide particulate matter when an emissions source reduces its carbon dioxide emissions it does not generate corresponding local climate change benefit unless there are similar widespread reductions globally or at least in wide areas from practical standpoint the actions of one or group of states or nations cannot by themselves reduce the global accumulation of ghg emissions in the atmosphere however as discussed above actions now under way by many states in the united states may create examples andor models that will prove instructive in more widespread applications moreover when business and industry have confronted growing patchwork of state requirements these sectors have historically begun to favor national policyas has begun to happen in the case of statelevel actions on climate change however the lack of national program or truly global approach to ghg emissions reductions does limit what individual states can accomplish in actually reducing ghg emissions and accumulations legal challenges may further limit the effectiveness of state action the possibility of legal challenges creates considerable uncertainty regarding the future of state climate change actions 106 this is also central argument against having federal emission limits without cooperation with other large economies eg china and india 107 capandtrade program with an auction system as discussed above for instance would generate revenues that could be funneled to parties who bear an unfair percentage of the programs costs see for example national commission on

lawsuits against state actions that seek to regulate ghg emissions from motor vehicles109 as discussed above the april 2007 supreme court decision massachusetts v ep did not specifically address all of the plaintiffs arguments so uncertainty remains as to the resolution of these cases further litigation confronting other types of state action is anticipated however many expected rggi to face legal challenge when the first states rule was officially issued but that did not occur regardless there is some question as to whether californias recently enacted ghg performance standards are constitutional 110 arguably the standards disproportionately impact the neighboring states that have historically exported coalgenerated electricity to california consumers the legal arguments in these cases are beyond the scope of this report but many observers conclude that it is difficult to pred ict how the courts will interpret and decide upon these issues for more indepth analysis of va
