2004 jasper womach specialist in agricultural policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress average farm subsidy payments by state 2002 summary the us department of agriculture makes direct subsidy payments through the commodity credit corporation to farmers for commodity price and income support certain conservation and environmental activities and some disaster losses in 2002 these direct farm subsidy payments amounted to 12151 billion this report examines the distribution of these payments among states calculates the average size of payments going to recipient farms in each state and distinguishes between payments received by farm operators and landlords this information is intended to aid in policy debates about subsidizing some farms but not others changing perperson payment limits and the altering eligibility rules for landlords to receive payments more money went to texas 12 billion than any other state texas along with the next 10 leading states received 56 of total farm subsidy payments these states were largely concentrated in the nations central farm belt where much of the subsidized corn soybeans wheat cotton and rice are produced also ranking high were california due to cotton and rice and georgia due to peanuts the subsidy payments were made to the operators and landlords of 707596 farms onethird of all farms in the nation however in some states much higher proportion of the farms were subsidized eg north dakota 78 and iowa 70 on average the payments amounted to 17172 per subsidized farm the range was from low of 3401 per subsidized farm in west virginia to high of 90214 per subsidized farm in california farm operators received an average of 9251 each and landlords received an average of 5617 each data on state averages obscure the high concentrations of payments to relatively small proportion of the farms receiving subsidies while there were total of 1705514 separate persons that received payments in 2002 50 of the subsidy payments went to 85358 persons or just 5 of the recipients this report is intended as reference and informational resource and is not

number of recipients but most of the money goes to few 27 average farm subsidy payments by state 2002 most federal farm subsidies are made as mandatory direct payments to producers from the us department of agricultures usdas commodity credit corporation ccc1 these include commodity price and income support programs certain conservation programs and select disaster assistance programs ccc direct payments to farmers in 2002 are examined in this report2 the primary data sources are the 2002 census of agriculture available at httpwwwnassusdagovcensus and the environmental working groups ewgs farm subsidy database available at httpewgorgfarmhomephp the ewg database is compilation from ccc payment information supplied by usdas farm service agency fsa fsas national network of county offices administers the subsidy programs and writes the ccc checks to the subsidy recipients3 these two data sets facilitate stateby state examination of payments and the division of payments between farm operators and landlords there is unpredictability about the timing and size of market price movements as well as natural disasters consequently the size of farm subsidies varies from year to year figure 1 shows that from 1995 through 2002 annual farm subsidy payments ranged from low of 72 billion to high of 235 billion averaging 145 billion annually over the eightyear period4 commodity price and income support accounts 1 the term mandatory means that the payments are not dependent on annual congressional appropriations payment obligations to farmers meeting the rules of the various subsidy programs are covered by the ccc the ccc uses its borrowing authority to obtain needed funds from the us treasury later congress appropriates monies to reimburse the ccc so it can repay the treasury 2 the usda does administer other farm subsidy programs that are not financed through the ccc and are not examined in this report among these are crop insurance costing about 2 billion annually in premium subsidies and farm ownership and operating loans for limited resource farmers costing nearly 200 million annually in loan subsidies 3 the data obtained by ewg are developed in fsa county offices and pertain to the farm in the county and not the address of the recipient recipients are unduplicated but may receive multiple payments from multiple programs throughout the year generally data pertain to the calendar year of payment but there may be exceptions 4 the data reported by ewg for 2002 may include combination of calendar year and crop year data but are characterized by ewg as calendar year payments the ewg data shown in figure 1 differ only slightly from calendar year direct payment data published by usdas economic research service the ers payment numbers for 1995 through 2002 are 73 billion 73 billion 75 billion 124 billion 215 billion 229 billion 207 billion 110 billion the ccc maintains its most detailed accounts by fiscal year but these continued crs2 for most farm subsidy payments as shown in figure 2 commodity payments amounted to 73 of cccs total farm subsidy payments in 2002 the year 2002 with total farm subsidy payments of 12151 billion was selected for examination in this report because of data availability at the same time it is fairly close to annual average total payments from 1995 through 2002 however 2002 is unique in that peanut producers received onetime quota buyout payments of about 1 billion nearly half the peanut quota buyout payments were concentrated in georgia 483 million with the remainder divided largely among texas 153 million alabama 150 million north carolina 107 million virginia 67 million oklahoma 62 million and florida 48 million5 figure 1 total farm subsidy payments 19962002 4 continued records do report payments at the state or recipient level data from the 2002 census of agriculture are for calendar year 2002 5 full description of the peanut marketing quota buyout program is available in crs report rl30924 peanut program policy issues crs3 figure 2 farm subsidy payments by major category 2002 crs4 farm subsidy programs most commodity support program payments are linked to market prices6 when market prices decline commodity support payments increase in order to support the income of producers whose revenue otherwise would decline conservation payments are made to encourage farmers to remedy environmental problems disaster assistance is provided when crop and livestock production is substantially damaged or destroyed by natural disasters such as drought flood and disease thereby reducing revenue andor increasing the expenses of producers7 table 1 presents programbyprogram list of payments in 2002 some of the payments and refunds shown in table 1 were authorized by the 1996 farm bill which originally covered the 1996 through 2002 crops the 2002 farm bill pl 107 171 the farm security and rural investment act of 2002 was enacted on may 13 2002 and was made immediately applicable to 2002 crops so 2002 was year of transition from the previous production flexibility contract payments to the new direct and countercyclical payments also countercyclical payments became the permanent replacement for ad hoc market loss payments 6 production flexibility contract payments and decoupled direct payments for grain and cotton producers are exceptions these payments were based on historical production of each of the grain and cotton crops only recipients of these payments were able to change their mix of crops or even produce nothing 7 eligibility requirements for payments are specified in the law for each program the payment triggers and size of commodity support payments are based upon specified price levels an indirect income test or physical damage levels for disaster assistance loss test crs5 table 1 farm subsidy payments by program 2002 subsidy number of payment per program category payments recipients recipient total farm subsidies 12150563185

recipients of loan deficiency payments also were recipients of production flexibility contract payments similarly many of the recipients of conservation reserve program payments also were recipients of production flexibility contract payments on average each individual recipient of farm subsidies received payments related to 171 separate programs negative numbers represent reimbursements from farmers for excessive or disqualified payments crs6 it often is more helpful to examine commodity support payments by commodity rather than program farmers individually tend to specialize in certain commodities and this relates to the climate and soil conditions favored by the different commodities in the absence of irrigation corn and soybeans grow especially well in iowa illinois and surrounding states irrigation has made texas and california leading cotton states but production remains large in mississippi georgia and arkansas rice also is southern crop with arkansas the leading producer while irrigation has moved california into second place wheat tolerates low rainfall and low humidity and so is produced primarily in north dakota kansas montana oklahoma and washington

billion in total subsidy payments predictably the farm states in the agricultural heartland of the country from the canadian border to the gulf of mexico received most of the subsidy payments the state receiving the largest amount was texas with nearly 1209 billion followed by iowa georgia arkansas california illinois and nebraska each receiving over 500 million there were 2129 million farms in the united states in 2002 according to the 2002 census of agriculture which defines farm as producing and selling 1000 or more in agricultural products the state with the largest number of farms was texas about 229000 followed by missouri about 107000 not all farms in the nation received subsidy payments eligibility is linked to the production of certain commodities or to the adoption of certain conservation practices commodities that received mandatory federal price and income support payments included wheat corn sorghum barley oats rice cotton soybeans sunflower seed rapeseed canola safflower flaxseed mustard seed crambe sesame seed peanuts dry peas lentils small chickpeas milk sugar wool mohair honey and tobacco major categories of commodities are not supported including fruits vegetables tree nuts livestock meat greenhouse and nursery crops and and forage crops farm cash receipts from sales of supported commodities amounted to about 53 billion in 2002 or 28 of the 193

farm however the average by state ranges from 90214 per farm in california to 3401 in west virginia see figure 5 and table 5 generally the states with the largest perfarm payments are those that produce rice and cotton other states receiving the larger perfarm payments in 2002 benefitted from peanut quota buyout payments disaster payments and apple market loss assistance payments while each farm has an operator there may be other individuals associated with the farm who are eligible to receive subsidy payments generally individuals must be actively engaged in the farming operation to receive subsidy payments actively engaged means providing significant contribution of capital land or equipment as well as significant contribution of personal labor or active personal management to the operation this personal contribution of labor or management must be in proportion to the share of the farms profits and losses and it must be at risk landlord receiving crop share rent is likely considered actively engaged while landlord receiving cash rent is not actively engaged9 9 the interpretation and application of the legal requirement concerning the phrase actively engaged was

of agriculture data on total subsidy payments are from the environmental working group farm subsidy database crs19 subsidy payments to farm operators and landlords there were 1705514 separate recipients of farm subsidy payments in 2002 associated with 707596 farms in nearly all cases the recipients were individual farm operators and nonoperator landlords however in some cases the recipients were legal business entities such as partnerships corporations cooperatives and trusts involving more than one individual in the terminology of the law each of the farm operators landlords or other legal entities is called person and is subject to limits on the size of payments from subsidy programs10 simplifying assumption is made for purposes of this analysis that each of the 707596 farms receiving subsidy payments has single operator it is further assumed the difference between the 707596 farm operators and the 1705514 total subsidy recipients equaling 997918 are farm landlords11 for the most part these 997918 landlords are the owners of farmland that is rented to operators often the landlords are relatives of farm operators and neighboring landowners who have left farming it is typical for farmland to be owned collectively by the children of former farm family none of whom remains in farming but who continue to retain ownership of their former family farm given the aforementioned assumption figure 6 and table 6 show the proportion of landlords to farm operators in each state on average there were 141 landlords receiving subsidy payments for every farm operator who received payments however there was range among states from 405 landlords per operator in arizona down to 044 in alaska differences between states in the ratio of farm operators to landlords reflect differing commodity specializations regional approaches to farm consolidation and regional attitudes toward farmland ownership also annual perperson payment limits create an incentive to add actively engaged landlords rather than expand the acreage owned by the farm operator the national average farm subsidy payment to each farm operator in 2002 was 9251 and the average subsidy to each nonoperator recipient was 5617 since there were 141 offfarm landlords for each farm the average subsidy per farm to off farm landlords was 7921 86 of the amount paid to each operator table 7 shows the distribution payments to farm operators and table 8 shows the distribution of payments to offfarm landlords 10 see crs report rs21779 grains cotton oilseeds and peanuts payments under the 2002 farm bill for more information on perperson payment limits related to commodity support programs 11 to be eligible for commodity payments person must be actively engaged in farming this can be achieved by providing significant contribution of capital land or equipment as well as significant contribution of personal labor or active personal management to the operation few people qualify for commodity payments who are not operators or landlords crs20 figure 6 average number of landlords per farm receiving subsidies in 2002 landlords per farm 0412 1322 2341 source based on data from usda 2002 census of agriculture and environmental working group farm subsidy database the national average number of landlords nonoperator recipients per farm that received subsidies in 2002 was
