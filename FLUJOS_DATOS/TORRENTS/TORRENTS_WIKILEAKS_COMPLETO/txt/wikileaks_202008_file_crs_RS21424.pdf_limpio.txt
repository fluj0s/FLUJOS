the routine maintenance exception to new source review robert meltz legislative attorney american law division summary major clean air act issue is the extent to which an existing power plant or factory may be altered wit hout effecting modification modification of an existing air pollution source is subject to the acts stringent air pollution control requirements for new sources the topic of this repor t is widely used exemption to modification allowing changes that constitute routine maintenance repair and replacement without triggering such string ent requirements the report surveys the original legal landscape surrounding this exemption in the contexts of determining applicability of new source performance standards and new source review in prevention of significant deterioration and nonattainment areas it then summarizes the many significant developments during the current bush administration both in the federal register and in th courts this report will be updated as events warrant in the three decades since its enactment the clean air act caa1 has seen many skirmishes over how its text s hould be interpreted current and major one involves the extent to which power plant or factory may alter its facilities or operations without bringing about modification of that missions source modification turns an existing emissions source into new source which has to meet more stringent air pollution control requirements in the caa than does an existing source legally speaking the issue is what changes to an existing stationary source of air pollution are significant enough to be modification so as to trigger the caas new source performance standards nspss and preconstruction new source review nsr our topic in this report however is narrowe r it is the widely used exemption to what constitutes modification for routin maintenance repair and replacement rmrr at stationary sources on the mean ing of this vague phrase turns considerable sums of money since routine

nonattainment areas the nsps program is focussed on technology requirements for new sources the nsr requirements focus on the location of the source and its potential effect on the environment of that localityexemption does not require the facility to in stall the stateofthe art often expensive pollution controls demanded by nspss and nsr this report surveys the original statutory regulatory and case law landscape on rmrr then describes more recent regulatory and judicial developments the statute nd regulations wepco in enacting the caa of 1970 congress drew sharp line between existing and new stationary sources of air pollution for many existing stationary sources congress believed retrofitting the latest airpollution control technology would not be economically or technologically feasible bu t new sources built as they are after adoption of new pollution standard could feasib ly install stateoftheart controls and given the caas goal of cleaning the air and avoiding new pollution problems it was imperative they do so so the caa of 1970 adopted different appr oaches for existing and new stationary sources for existing sources of major air pollutants but not hazardous emissions states were given wide discretion to set emission ceilings for individual sources by contrast for new sources of air pollutants that may r easonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare epa itself sets the standards the earliermentioned nspss rather than give the states discretion2 nspss are strict technologybased standards set at the emissions rate that can be achieved by use of the best adequately demonstrated technology3 the 1977 amendments went further in areas where the ai r is either cleaner than national ambient standard s require prevention of si gnificant deterioration or psd areas or dirtier than national standards nonattainment areas proposed major new sources must undergo nsr before they can be built4 both psdarea nsr and nonattainmentarea nsr are comp lex requiring among other things that the wouldbe builder obtain preconstruction permit containing emission limits based on best available control technology psd areas or lowest achievable emission rate nonattainment areas the rmrr issue arises because the caa says that not only newly constructed stationary sources but also modifications of existing sources are subject to nspss and nsr in the acts words nspss apply to any new source defined as any stationary source the construction or modification of which is commenced after the publication of regulations or if earlierhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21424crs3 5 caa 111a2 42 usc 7411a2 emphasi s added caa section 111a6 states that any stationary source that is not new source is an existing source 42 usc 7411a6 6 caa

reconstructi on is not mentioned in the caaproposed regulations prescribing nsps which will be applicable to such source5 the psd and nonattainmentarea portions of the act manda ting nsr are to similar effect nsr in such areas is triggered by proposals to build either major new sources or modifications of existing sources 6 enhancing the similarity the act says that the meaning of modification for determining applicability of nsr is the same as for applicability of nspss7 thus the pivotal issue is precisely what changes to stationary source constitute modification the caa defines m odification as any physical change in or change in the method of operation of stationary source which increases the amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or which results in the emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted8 to reiterate this definition determines both which changes in source are subject to nspss and which trigger nsr note that it does not cover just any physical change or change in the method of operation but only those that result in an increase in emissions the definition leaves many questions unanswered as it doe s not define its component phrases physical change change in the met hod of opera tion and increases the amount of any ai r pollutant the meaning of each of these phrases has been the subject of litigation given that mere modification triggers nspss and nsr it is unsurprising that an entire reconstruction of an existing facility does so as well epa defines reconstruction as replacement of components of an existing facility to such an extent that 1 the fixed capital cost of th new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct comparable entirely new facility and 2 it is technologically and economically feasible to meet the applicable nspss9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21424crs4 10 this is made explicit by 40 cfr 6015a 11 40 cfr 602 notwithstanding that the ns r sections of the act incorporate the nsps definition of modification there are differences in how epa defines the term in each context see 57 fed reg 32314 32316 july 21 1992 dis cussion of how emission increases are calculated differently for the nsps and nsr programs 12 40 cfr 6014e1 see also 40 cfr 51165a1vc1 5201d1 5224f5iiia 13 see wisconsin elec power co v reilly 893 f 2d 901 910 7th cir 1990 quoting epa memorandum 14 893 f2d 901 7th cir 1990observe that in contrast with modifications change in facility can constitute reconstruction irrespective of whether it increases emissions10 but lets return to modifications epa s definition of modification echoes the acts definition11 but also states six kinds of changes in stationary source the agency does not consider to be modifications based on its view that congress could not have intended that every change at source matter how minor would subject the source to heightened pollutioncontrol re quirements the most deba ted of these epadeveloped exceptions is for rmrr that is maintenance repair and replacement which the epa administrator determines to be routine for source category 12 until recently see below epa regulations did not further specify the kinds of activities included as rmrr rather eligibility for the rmrr exemption was through casebycase analysis weighing the nature extent purpose frequency and cost of the proposed work as well as other relevant factors to arrive at common sense determination13 this casebycase approach of epa was approved in the leading case of wisconsin electric power co v reilly wepco 14 wepco had concluded that extensive renovation of its generating units was needed and submitted proposed life extension program to the state among the renovations proposed were repair and replacement of the turbine generators boilers mechanical and elect rical auxiliaries and the common plant support facilities epa dete rmined that wepcos proposal triggered both nsps and psdarea nsr requiring permit before construction could begin relevant here epa dismi ssed wepcos argument th at the proposal was rmrr in wepco the seventh circuit ruled that us ing epas casebycase approach the agencys ruling that the proposal went bey ond rmrr was proper the extent of the work on the plant said the court was substantia l and unprecedented also the purpose of the project life extension its infrequency only once or twice in the units life and its high cost all pointed to nonroutineness recent developments in recent years the rmrr exemption has assumed center stage the curtainraising act was the filing of caa enforcement actions by the clinton administration against electric utilities across the midwest and south involving 36 power plants several ownedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21424crs5 15 67 fed reg 80186 dec 31 2002 16 67 fed reg 80290 dec 31 2002 17 336 f3d 1236 11th cir 2003 petition for cert filed feb 13 2004 031162 18 caa docket 006 sept 15 2000 19 68 fed reg 61248 oct 27 2003by tva accusing them of making plant changes that exceeded routine maintenance without installing the more stringent nsr controls following this in may 2001 president bushs national energy polic development group issued recommended national energy policy directing epa to revi ew the impact of nsr on investment in new utility and refinery generation capacity energy efficiency and environmental protection this resulted in epas june 2002 report to the president on the impact of nsr which asserted the desirability of specifying certa in categories of activities that categorically qualify as routine maintenance on december 31 2002 epa published final regulations that affect how for nsr purposes sources are to calculate emission increases resulting from change and that amend other features of its nsr rules15 more relevant here epa on the same day proposed rule purporting to clarify the rmrr exception in the manner recommended in its report by specifying activity categories that will be considered rmrr without regard to other considerations16 epa v whitman while this rmrr proposal was pending the eleventh circuit rendered its longawaited decision in epa v whitman 17 whitman arose when the epa determined that the tva violated the caa through various rehabilitation projects at its coalfired electric power pl ants that went beyond rmrr but were undertaken without permits it embodied this termination in an administr ative compliance order aco the aco was affirmed by ep as environmental appeals bo ard which also endorsed the agencys multifactor test for rmrr applied in wepco 18 the eleventh circuit however found that although the caa empowers epa to issue acos with the status of law the caa was unconstitutional to the extent that severe civil and criminal penalties can be imposed by court for noncompliance w ith such an agency order generally issued without an adjudication rather epa must prove the caa violation in district court hence the court held tva was free to violat the acos here without fear of penalty note that this decision important as it is to enforcement of the rmrr exception did not speak to the contours of the exception itself the october 2003 final rule the contours of rmrr were significantly reshaped however when epa in october 2003 finaliz ed its equipmentre placement rule proposal of the previous december19 the final rule declares set of equipment replacement activities that will be viewed as per rmrr in contrast to the old casebycase approach according to the regulatory pr eamble the new approach is intended to provide greater regulatory certainty without s acrificing the current vel of environmental protection and ddresses the criticism that the cas ebycase approach hampers activities important to assuring the safe reliable and efficient operation of existing plants the new rule represented final action on only part of the agencys december 2002 proposal for the moment epa is not taking action on the proposed annual maintenance repair and replacement allowance the allowance was an annualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21424crs6 20 031380maintenance cost allowance established fo r each facility based on an industryspecific percentage the new rule specifies that the replacement of components of process unit with identical components or their functional equivalents constitute s rmrr provided the replacement cost including related costs such as labor and equipment rentals is less than 20 of the current replacement value of the process unit of which the component is part the replacement does not change the units basic design parameters and the unit continues to meet enforceable emission limitations and any oper ational limitations that constrain emissions the agency acknowle dges that the new approach will allow replacement of components under more circum stances than the fo rmer casebycase approach the key trigger of the controvers over the new rules the former approach remains available as an alte rnative andor supplement but it is anticipated that the higher thresholds of the new per approach will make resort to the casebycase approach uncommon finally the new rule imposes recordkeeping requirements on the belief that records normally kept by business together with epas broad caa authority to inspect facilities will allow proper enforcement the new rule applies only to conduct after the rules eff ective date and thus does not constitute defense to pending caa enforcement actions based on failure to meet rmrr state of new york v envi ronmental protection agency in multiple lawsuits filed in the dc circuit fifteen states mostly in the northeast plus california illinois new mexico wisconsin and the district of columbia plus several localities and environmental groups argue that the equi pmentreplacement rmrr rule goes beyond epas authority under the caa these suits have been consolidated under the name state of new york v envi ronmental protection agency 20 on december 24 2003 the court granted petitioners motion to stay the rule pending the courts full review petitioners said the court have demonstrated the irre parable harm and likelihood of success on the merits required for the issuance of such stay because stays pending review are not often granted one may assume that this judicial statement betokens an uphill climb by epa in defending the rule with the new rule thus suspended it was to have taken effect on december 26 2003 the old casebycase approach continues to apply the court on december 24 also declined to consolidate the above actions with another group of consolidated cases that cha llenged the december 2002 final rule it did agree however to designate the same panel for the equipmentreplacement rule cases as has been assigned for the december 2002 final ru cases due to the re lated nature of the two groups of cases
