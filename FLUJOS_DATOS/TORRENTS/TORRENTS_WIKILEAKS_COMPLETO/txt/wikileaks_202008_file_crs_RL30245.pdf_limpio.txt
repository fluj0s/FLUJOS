the chainofcommand and establishes command rel ationships clarity and brevity are key characteristics as the primary emphasis in command relation s should be to keep the chain of command short and simple so it is clear who is i n charge of what3 the unified command plan is an exec utive document signed by the president the ucp is issued by the c hairman joint chiefs of staff cjcs under the authority of the president to establish the unified and specified commands as an instrument to control the armed forces of the united states the ucp is derived in large par t though not entirely from

control7 unified command has broad continuing mission charged to singl commander unified commands are compos ed of significant assigned components of two or more miliary departments they are established and designated by th president through the secretary of defense with the advice and assistance of th chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 8 combatant command is the nontransferable leg command authority established under 10 usc 164 combatant command is exercised only by commandersinchief of unified or specified combatant commands this command authority cannot b delegated it is the authority of the combatant commander to organize and employ forces assign tasks designate objectives nd direct all aspects of military operations joint training and logistics necessary to accomplish the missions assigned to th command9 geographic cincs are combatant commanders whose mission is defined by general geographic area of responsibility their organizations are referred to s geographic commands these cincs re also referred to as theater cincs regional cincs or area military commanders currently there are five geographic cincs european pacific atlantic southern and central commands functional cincs on the other hand are combatant commande rs whose mission is the worldwide performance of warfighting function their organizations ar called functional commands functional cincs are also referred to as global httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30245crs4 joint pub 02 p xv10 joint staff j5 ucp briefing slide unclassified11 ibid12cincs there are currently four functional cincs space transportation special operations and strategic commands whether geographic or functional cinc can use any one of six comman d structures subordinate unified command joint task force functional component service component single service force or specific operational force immediatel responsive to the commander the cinc has the authority to organize as needs arise and situations develop the cincs and their staffs develop joint operations plans broadly cincs deter war and prepare for war in peacetime and should war occur conduct campaigns and major operations to accomplish missions and attai n objectives10 all cincs are considered warfighting cincs importantly the ucp is t11 rigidly restrictive and may serve as basis for coordination in some instances for example the 1998 ucp includes language that allows commanders to operat wherever necessary to accomplish their missions granting them some latitude t o12 operate in another cincs aor cincs of unified commands need an appropriate span of control areas f responsibility and missions cannot be so large that they defy clear definition or reasona blysized staff yet they cannot be so small and numerous that they eithe r overlap or interfe re with each other more numerous cincs and unified commands create more staff overhead and require more resources span of control is usually thought of as limit for effecti ve control and management effective span of control implies adequate autho rity and resources and it can be applied to tasks missions or people cincs spend substantial time dealing with political and military matters hence the number of countries in an aor affect the cincs span of control th political economic ethnic religious and cultural diversity of the aor and th presence of potential conflicts impact span of control as well visually the current ucp arrangements are depicted on page 22 th geographic cincs areas of responsibility are reflected on page 23 military changes to the ucp the defense department periodically changes the ucp for several reasons the changes reflect shifting priorities and new political realities emerging threats r declining dangers and fewer enemies call for ch anged ucp dod seeks efficiencies to eliminate and reduce outdated tasks the jcs and js change the ucp to eithe r create or eliminate redundancies in capabilities depending on the circumstances

problems to an unnecessary degree while too many cincs diffus command complicate command arrangements and relationships and dispers resources among competing priorities more recently the military especially the cjcs has been using the ucp as tool to further jointmindedness the ucp is an im portant part of the roadmap to get to joint vision 2010 the joint vision the military has of itself13 the

congress has prohibited certain actions from being included in the ucp fo r example the army and navy chiefs lobbied hard against the establishment of unified transportation command this put these two

restriction on establishment of unified transportatio n command second it called for the cjcs to review the missions responsibilities and force structure and geographic boundaries of each combatant command not less than every two years and to recommend necessary changes through the secretary f defense to the president the act also repealed prohibition on altering th command structure for

suggestions were tailored to improve joint operations not just finetuning th boundaries32 the commission suggested the ucp should reflect regional focus and ne w missions emphasized in the national

the aors of the geographic cincs should be adjusted to eliminate seams that may impede joint operatio ns between military theaters of operation and better align cin c responsibilities with regional strategies and strategic interests33 also with regard to the ucp the commission reaffirmed that the cincs ar responsible for fighting americas wars and employing military forces in pursuit of national security objectives the commission held that the cincs need mor influence over priorities and processes to acquire capabilities to perform missions but dont need detracting responsibilities34 the

recognized or likely strategic interest to the united states the size of each aor should accommodate the cincs representationa l obligations and other responsibilities seams between cincs aors should be reviewed to ensure that they do not split areas of strategic interest or exacerbate existing political economic religious or cultural differences sufficient land area sea area and airspace should be included in each aor for the cinc to carry out assigned missions and if necessary wage an effectiv unified military campaign against any plausible adversary the distinction between geograph ic and functional cincs should be preserved ie functional cincs should not have aors the responsibilities assigned to the functional cincs should be reviewe d periodically for overlap and consolidated where practical furtherm ore the commission evaluated opportunities for consolidating unified commands but found potentially high costs in expanding span of control and onl marginal cost sav ings the commission found that the demands of global leadership actually increased the demands on military leaders according to the commission the growing number of challenges may actually argue for increasing rather tha n decreasing the number of unified commands and cincs assigning them smalle r aors or alternatively creating more subunified commands37 the commission acknowledged the problem of having
