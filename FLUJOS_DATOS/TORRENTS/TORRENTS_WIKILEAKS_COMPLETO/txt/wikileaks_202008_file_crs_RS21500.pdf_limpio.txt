background the endangered species act esa1was enacted to conserve listed species to bring them to the point where the do not need the special protections of the act2 and to protect the ecosystems of which dwindling species are part3dwindling species often reflect endangered resources or ecosystems recent situations4in which there have been economic and social disruptions as result of listings under the have resulted in renewed focus on th protective posture of the act5and on the use of science under it all agree that decisions should be bas ed on sound science6but that phrase can mean different things to different people and accusations of junk science have been vigorously exchangedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21500crs2 7the word solely was deliberately added in the 1982 amendments to the pl 97304 96 stat 1411 to clarify that the determination f endangered or threatened status was intended to be biological decision made without referenc to economic or other nonbiological factors hrept 97567 at 1920 1982 discussed why listin g was to be solely scientific decision and also interpreted commercial data as referring to trade data and not as inferring that economic factors were to be considered hrept 97835 at 19 1982 confirms that it was the intent of both chambers that economic factors not play role in the designation and listing of species for protection 8see fish and wildlife service handbook at 16 nd hr conf rep 96697 at 12 1979 which stated that the best information available language was intended to allow the fws to issue biological opinions even when inadequate in formation was available rather than being forced to issue negative opinions thereby unduly impeding proposed actions an agency has the duty to show its actions will not jeopardize species and continuing obligation to make reasonable effort to develop additional information and to give the benefit of the doubt to the species 959 fed reg 34271 july 1 1994 105 usc 7062a 11motor vehicle manufacturers association v s tate farm mutual automobile insurance co continuedthe requires that decisions to list sp ecies be made solely on the basis of the best scientific and co mmercial data available there i s elaboration on the meaning of this phrase in the law itself or in agency regulations but the legislative history indicates that science alone is to be the basis for listing decisions although other factors may be considered in postlisting decisions and actions7science plays an important role in the designation of critical habitat in the consultation process in the development of habitat conservation plans and inciden tal take permits that allow lis ted species to be killed under certain conditions and in the velopment of recovery plans however given that the act addresses species that almost by definition are likely to be rare there may be insufficient informa tion on many species facing extinction or insufficient personnel or funds available t conduct necessary studies what should be done in such instances the act does not expre ssly address this question but considering the strongly protective purpose of the ac t to save and recover species with the wording of best data available arguably the act intends that all dwindling species should be given the benefit of the doubt and margin of safety provided this is the position taken in the conference report and agency documents8the fish and wildlife service fws and noaa fisheries have d eveloped joint policies on information standards use of expert opinions and peer review9 judicial review in general judicial review can help ensure that an agencys use of scientific data and the decisions base d on it are sound under the administrative procedure act court may set aside an agencys decision if it is arbitrary capricious an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law10normally an agency rule would be arbitrary and capricious if the gency has relied on factors

particular expertise14these standards may require that regulation under the be r ationally related to the problems causing the decline of species especially when other interests are adversely affected judicial review of the use of science courts that have considered the best data available language ve held that it does not requi re and hence court lacks the authority to order an agency to conduct studies to obtain missing data15however an agency cannot ignore available biological information16especially if the ignored information is the most current17or is scientifically superior to that which the decision maker relied on nor can an agency treat one species differently from the way other similarlysituated species are treated18the agency may not postpone listing dwindling species until it is on the brink of extinction in r eliance on possible but uncertain future actions of an agency19a court also has said that the best scientific and commercial data available is not standard of absolute certainty and is fact that reflects congress intent that the fws take conservation measures before species is conclusively headed for extinction20if the fws does not base its listings on speculation or surmise or disregard superior data the fact that the s tudies it does rely on are imperfect does not undermine those author ities as the best scientific data available the service must utilize the best scientific data available not the best scientific data possible 21 on the other hand an agencys response must be appropriate to the problem one case struck down regulations that totally banned duck hunting in an area in order to protect one species of duck22another case stated that low numbers of particular species alone do not necessarily warrant listing the reasons for the low

another court stated that the bar the fws m ust clear in terms of evidence is very low but it must at least clear it and in the context of issuance of incidental take permits under 10 of the act this means the agency must demonstrate that species is or could be in an area before regulating it and must establish the causal connection between the land use being regulated and harm to the species in question mere speculation as to the potential for harm is not sufficient24 courts have held that the agencies basically must rely on existing regulatory mechanisms in making listing determinations and not on future or uncertain actions to justify decision not to list species25inoregon natural resources council v daley ornc 26the court found that nmfs rule determining the oregon coast salmon ecologically significant unit esu not to be threatened was arbitrary and capricious in that nmfs had relied on improper factors in reaching its decision and acted contrary to the administrative record nmfs had relied in part on state plan to improve conditions for the salmon that was voluntary and was to occur in the future27resulting in decision that flew in the face of the agencys scientific evaluations in the record see also federation of fly fishers v daley28which agreed with the onrc case regarding relying on voluntary and future actions in the face of scientific studies indicating listing was needed but see also defenders of wildlife v babbitt 29which did allow reliance in part on cooperative conservation efforts in case w here the state plan was not the sole basis for the agencys decision federal district court held in march 2002 that the economic analysis supporting designation of critical habitat was insufficiently specific30the court found that looking only at the economic impacts that designation of critical habitat caused that were in excess of those attributable to listing species was illegal the problem the court saw with the agency approach is that the economic costs of listing that should be considered when designating critical habitat wind up being left out of consideration entirely but see an earlier decision also in the district court for the district of columbia trinity countyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21500crs5 31on this subject see 7 endangered species wetlands report may 2002 p1 32002799 ckk ddc 2002 33pacific coast federation of

river flows suit has also been filed to challenge the record of decision setting trinity river flows the trinity flows into the klamath but much of its water is diverted and sent to californias central valley some reports state that many of the fish that died in the klamath river in late mmer 2002 were attempting to return to the trinity in 1992 congress ordered studies of tr inity fisheries and then secretary babbitt decided in 2000 to send more water down the tr inity to scour the river and make the river more habitable for salmon which would have res ulted in less water for the central valley and westlands water district fws study f ound that higher releases from trinity dam would cool the trinity river and counteract the warm klamath downstream making the water safer for salmon

the relevant regulations reasonable nd prudent measure could only require minor changes the court also set aside nmfs rpm asserting that essentially what nmfs did was require that the preferred alternative be implemented to minimize the effects of implementing the preferred alternative35the court also faulted interiors choice of flow levels because they were based on analy sis that failed to consider nonflow measures or secondary statutory objectives grounds on which the court also faulted the eis that accompanied the decision the court however did note that the secretarys decision was not arbitrary or capricious merely because the science on which it rested was not certain as long as the decision was based on the best available scientific data however inexact the court also noted the congressional directi ons to restore the trinity and to meet federal obligations to the tribes who d intervened as defendants therefore the court directed interior to expedite preparation of suppl
