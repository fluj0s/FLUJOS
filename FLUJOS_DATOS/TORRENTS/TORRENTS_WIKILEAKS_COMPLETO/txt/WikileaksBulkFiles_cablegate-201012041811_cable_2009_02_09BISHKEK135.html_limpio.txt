0012 of 002 classified by ambassador tatiana c gfoeller reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary during meeting with the ambassador february 13 chinese ambassador zhang yannian ridiculed the idea but did not deny categorically that china would provide kyrgyzstan 3 billion financial package in return for closing manas air base zhang said kyrgyzstan was in russias sphere of influence and china had only commercial interests here he also complained bitterly about chinese guantanamo detainees being shipped to germany instead of china zhang was very interested in whether the us would negotiate to keep manas and he advised just giving the kyrgyz 150 million year for the base this is all about money he said end summary losing the ability to speak russian 2 c ambassador met february 13 with chinese ambassador to kyrgyzstan zhang yannian after opening pleasantries the ambassador mentioned that kyrgyz officials had told her that china had offered 3 billion financial package to close manas air base and asked for the ambassadors reaction to such an allegation visibly flustered zhang temporarily lost the ability to speak russian and began spluttering in chinese to the silent aide diligently taking notes right behind him once he had recovered the power of russian speech he inveighed against such calumny claiming that such an idea was impossible china was staunch opponent of terrorism and chinas attitude toward kyrgyzstans decision to close manas was one of respect and understanding 3 c composing himself zhang inquired if maybe the kyrgyz had meant the trade turnover between the two countries which he claimed was about 3 billion year when disabused of that notion zhang went on at length to explain that china could not afford 3 billion loan and aid package it would take 3 from every chinese person to pay for it if our people found out thered be revolution he said we have 200 million people unemployed because of the downturn in exports he said and millions of disabled and others who need help from the government slap in the face 4 c when the ambassador asked whether he would categorically deny what the kyrgyz officials had told her about deal with china zhang snapped that releasing 17 from guantanamo is an unfriendly act toward us he then went on at length about what slap in the face it was to china that the uighur detainees were not going to be returned to their homeland but instead shipped to germany where reportedly they had already been granted refugee status while not stating titfortat reaction on manas he did imply that the guantanamo situation had made china look for ways to hit back at the us when the ambassador inquired if maybe the chinese were favorably disposed toward closing manas because of their sco membership zhang acknowledged that the sco had pronounced for closing manas but claimed that that was years ago and nothing has happened since he denied that the sco was pressuring the kyrgyz to close manas russia gift from god for the kyrgyz 5 c the ambassador then asked what zhang thought about the 2 billion plus russian deal with kyrgyzstan after some hemming and hawing zhang said it was probably true that bishkek 00000135 0022 of 002 the russian assistance was tied to closing manas asked if he had any concerns about the kyrgyz republic falling ever deeper into the russian sphere of influence and whether china had any interest in countering this he answered that kyrgyzstan was already in that sphere and china had interest in balancing that influence kyrgyzstan is russias neighbor he intoned somewhat expansively since kyrgyzstan does not share border with the russian federation though it does share border with china and when the kyrgyz ask about this i always tell them that neighbor is gift from god as for chinas interests in the kyrgyz republic he stated flatly we have only commercial interests here we want to increase investment and trade we have interest in politics he claimed that some kyrgyz had argued for china to open base in kyrgyzstan to counterbalance russian and american influence in the country but china has interest in base we want military or political advantage therefore we wouldnt pay 3 billion for manas he argued personal advice pay them 150 million 6 c zhang asked the ambassador whether the us would negotiate to keep the base open the ambassador answered that the us side was evaluating its options zhang then offered his personal advice this is all about money he said he understood from the kyrgyz that they needed 150 million the ambassador explained that the us does provide 150 million in assistance to kyrgyzstan each year including numerous assistance programs zhang suggested that the us should scrap its assistance programs just give them 150 million in cash per year and you will have the base forever very uncharacteristically the silent young aide then jumped in or maybe you should give them 5 billion and buy both us and the russians out the aide then withered under the ambassadors horrified stare 7 c commenting on the recent diplomatic corps lunch ref b zhang noted that russian ambassador vlasov had been in an expansive mood and dominated portions of the meeting i think thats when he found out that theyd reached deal with bakiyev to close the base he opined zhang who is doyen of the diplomatic corps said he would be leaving bishkek soon but did not yet know his next assignment in our service he said we dont know our postings until the last minute comment 8 c zhang was clearly flustered when confronted with the claims of kyrgyz officials that they were negotiating financial deal with china in return for closing the base while he ridiculed the notion of such deal he did not deny it outright perhaps because of his being discomposed he returned several times to the topic of possible revolution in china if the economic picture does not improve and work is not found for the millions of unemployed there in our experience talk of revolution at home is taboo for chinese diplomats while candid at times the meeting ended on very cordial note gfoeller
