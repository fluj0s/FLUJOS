6211c27 shspec218 routine 212 part 1 poor r212 the first and fundamental error of r212 showed up lrh made mistake by giving some leeway on list one dont add motivatorish items to the list the list must contain only nouns verbs adjectives or adverbs when lrh expanded list one it escaped his notice that lot of practice with 3gaxx would invite lot of things to be entered onto the list by the pc even though r212 says that it is not the pcs list so list one issue two must contain only scientology nouns r212 is to put the case in condition so that it can progress towards clearing as well as being in itself clearing process what we are fighting in clearing today is slow progress with r321 you will sooner or later get the item that is holding up the case see p 332 above but with r212 you will get it sooner you are looking for the items that pin the pc to present time you want to eradicate the items that have been keyed in by present time which now hold the pc in ptp in r212 you dont just oppose any item that once rockslammed you always start from scratch matter what has been done previously you take list one even if it was done before start with the first list find what rockslams oppose it etc the main discovery is that any time you get whisper on list you can represent it and get rock slam on it the rationale of r212 is that as long as the gpm is keyed in in pt the pc is left with full ptp and will show case gain you dont have to find his goal to set him straight this is all based on the observation made in 1949 that what needs to be run to resolve the case always has little tag sticking out like taximeter flag there are lots of these little tags sticking out but most come out easily and can be thrown away however every once in awhile you get one that is tied to something it was also known that case gain wont occur over ptp the gpm would be the biggest ptp person could have the only way you get rid of it is to identify it very thoroughly in its various parts this is what the tag gets stuck in if part of the gpm is in pt walking around and the other part is buried in the bank the pc will go around feeling that it is the visible part that is keeping him from getting clear he never looks to see what is opposing it and that item will remain so undisclosed that the person could go all the way to clear and still have it he might by fluke key out the rest of the gpm and still have that buried part of the gpm pair this gives you bypassed item par excellence the probability that he would go clear under these circumstances is very miniscule to be sure it takes awhile to build up rock slam it is not from pt directly that the pc gets the rock slam it is from confusing pt with some opposition mass in the bank the pc hasnt even seen the terminal in the bank that faces the opposition mass he has made mistake he has mistaken something in the environment for an opposition mass in the bank and he cant see his terminal in the bank he thinks he is opposed to something in pt when it is just an oppterm that he has confused it with he is in this oppterm but he never puts it on the list so it never blows and he doesnt opposition it you will get recurring item as the pc lists it recurs because something is missing namely the other half of the package the half that he is being person doesnt look at things that he is stuck in that is how the bank accumulates the person is too close to it to look at it the recurring item lacking an oppterm to balance it creates ptp in itself with this condition the pc will make little or case gain if the pc werent pinned to pt he would still have this trouble it is part of every case to some degree let us define rockslammer as anyone who slams in pt on any item that is part of the gpm at first neither we nor he can determine which item he is slamming on one fine day you make list on something and it doesnt immediately go out on tiger drilling the tiger drill is what saves our bacon it tells us whether the worm is still in the ground in r212 you pick up the trace list it out and get slamming item if the item was accurately assessed and if it doesnt go out with the tiger drill then it must be stuck in the gpm therefore you can represent it and you will get slam so one fine day he accidentally puts an item on his present time environment list now he is longer able to not confront it when you oppose it he now doesnt feel bad about it you have discharged the mass here is another place where r212 differs from 3gaxx r212 deals with the tags the locks to pt and blows them on r212 the items blow up and go pffft on 3gaxx items stay in there in concrete and brass because you are diving into the bank to find the fundamental goal you are reaching for deeper items 3gaxx delivers goals but not pt when you have an item that is in pt you will get more fireworks the amount of case gain that you will get from r212 is sometimes fantastic all the pcs lifelong worry has evaporated watch out for doing misassessment on list 1a and getting deeper than you intended this is not likely to happen on list one where he doesnt make the list if the question was in pt what have you been upset about and he gives you something like dragons or spaceships just pretend to write it down dont put it on the list you will get terminal and an oppterm from such an item but they wont do the pc much good in pt you could use them to get goals but that doesnt get rid of ptps you could get big read on an item like this bigger than you would normally get on list one or list 1a if you take up dragons you are not handling any pt restimulation you will be led astray if you dont keep in mind that r212 is an effort to locate one of the gpm items as it seems to be in pt to the pc and find its oppterm and if you succeed youve taken away the ptp the ptp is below the pcs recognition of what it is that he is worried about which is why you wouldnt get the ptp by running ptps there is heavy charge on this anything with rock slam has heavy standoffishness connected with it rock slam item is like guy at night shining flashlight in your eyes you cant see who it is and you dont want to look at it but you have to the pc cant look at rock slam item and he cant look away from it unless you get it out of pt he doesnt have enough attention units to look at the bank if he can be sufficiently aware of the piece of the gpm that is in pt to be nervous about it he can cognite on it other things equally part of gpms are so buried that he cant even slam on them they are too tough for him they wont read or be real to him until later when the case is unburdened more person whos getting off motivators is being an oppterm to himself hes out of valence hes not even in his own terminal line he will therefore turn on sensation all over the place the terminal is always at cause if you try to list something causative for the oppterm eg who or what would the oppterm oppose or who or what would the oppterm do something to instead of ho or what would oppose the oppterm you will get total stuck needle misemotion etc this is the wrong way to phenomenon if you get rid of problem on which the pc has great reality the pc will have tremendous resurgence when you do skilled r212 that is the result that you will get even though the pc doesnt even know that he has the problem in order to handle the problems in his environment he must not have problem on scientology the session is closer to the pc than the rest of his environment therefore in doing r212 you take his scientology problems away before you take the other environment problems away get them out of the way and watch the pcs relief if you arent seeing it you are doing something wrong
