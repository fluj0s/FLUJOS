state 122247 classified by charge d affaires richard m eason for reasons 14 b and d 1 cnf summary the ambassador discussed the conference of parties cop conference in copenhagen and afghanistan with eu council permanent president herman van rompuy over coffee december 23 after delivering the congratulatory letter reftel from president obama van rompuy called the copenhagen conference disaster in which europe was excluded and mistreated he predicted mexico cop 16 would be disaster as well and added that multilateral conferences would not resolve the climate problem he proposed coming to an agreement between the eu and the united states during the possible upcoming us eu summit in madrid and then approaching china to achieve workable solution on afghanistan van rompuy opined that one in europe believed in afghanistan anymore he said europe was going along in deference to the united states there must be results in 2010 or afghanistan is over for europe end summary coffee with eu president van rompuy 2 u as instructed reftel i delivered the letter of congratulations from president obama to new eu council permanent president herman van rompuy on december 23 the meeting was arranged by his new chief of staff frans van daele i did not mean to engage in any substantive discussions nor enter into domain better left to ambassador kennard however both van daele and van rompuy are friends of mine and they invited to have some coffee for about an hour given the holiday period the eu building was virtually empty and both men seemed to have time to spare we first discussed many social pleasantries moving to new office space the holidays and family copenhagen was disaster for europe 3 cnf van rompuy raised the recent cop 15 conference in copenhagen calling it an incredible disaster he was not angry in the sense that he never seems angry but he was as animated and as frustrated as i have seen him he thought that europe had been totally excluded and was mistreated he thought the only saving grace was that he was not there van rompuy said had i been there my presidency would have been over before it began he said he was criticized for not being present in copenhagen and added that he did not need to be there because he does not start in his new position until january 1 he thought it was wise decision not to attend the conference despite the pressure 4 cnf i responded by saying that i had idea what actually happened since i was not there but offered that from the reports i was seeing it looked more like chaotic meeting had occurred rather than any decision to exclude europe but van rompuy did not give that explanation much credence responding they could certainly have called europe and told us to come 5 cnf van rompuy did seem to ascribe some blame to europe he said one knows who to call merkel barroso who knows who he said he planned to take control of getting europe on the same page he mentioned that he had scheduled an informal eu meeting in february to discuss the economy but he was now going to use the meeting to discuss copenhagen in addition to the economy he intends to get the eu lined up us and eu need to talk climate at madrid 6 cnf van rompuy said he has given up on mexico city with van daele calling the planned cop 16 meeting to be held there november to december 2010 nightmare on elm street 2 and stating who wants to see that horror movie again van rompuy said multilateral meetings will not work he indicated that europe first had to get on the same page then europe had to meet with the us and finally they i think he meant europe and the us had to meet as well with china rather than waiting for failure at mexico city he intends to address copenhagen issues with the united states at madrid he envisioned engaging china thereafter in his mind talks with the us would have to focus on madrid and brussels 00000004 002 of 002 not mexico city afghanistan 7 cnf we talked briefly about my having opened the residence to the press to watch president obamas afghanistan speech live at 200 am belgian time on december 1 that led van rompuy briefly to address afghanistan he said it was the last chance europe is doing it and will go along out of deference to the united states but not out of deference to afghanistan one believes in afghanistan any more but we will give it 2010 to see results if it doesnt work that will be it because it is the last chance and if belgian gets killed it would be over for belgium right then 8 u we parted with holiday wishes and talked about seeing an anderlecht football soccer game soon i told him i was leaving him in the good hands of us ambassador to the eu bill kennard but would continue to see him socially 9 cnf comment van rompuys chief of staff frans van daele is belgiums premier diplomat he is former ambassador to the united states permanent representative to nato to the eu and most recently chief of staff to outgoing belgian foreign minister and now prime minister yves leterme much of what van rompuy said might be attributed to the proamerican van daele who could have recommended that this appointment be used to deliver the messages on copenhagen and afghanistan end comment eason
