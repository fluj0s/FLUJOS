shsbc300 ren 329 28 aug 63 the tone arm and the service facsimile the tone arm and the service facsimile lecture given on 28 august 1963 based on the clearsound version only how are you doing today audience good good well this is the what of the what audience 28th august ah august the 28th 195 audience ad 13 ad 13 thank you thank you the day the white house was burned all right well today we have some good news we have some good news technically to do you the most good this is all actually scientology two but the understanding of it im afraid lies in scientology four now let give you the first startling statement just startling statement if you cannot make keyedout clear with prepcheck in twentyfive hours or less of processing then the pc is operating on service facsimile startling statement isnt it its elementary its elementary prepcheck fits in with your itsa line in very hand and glove proposition and of course these are the hottest itsas there are is on your eighteenbutton prepcheck list those are hot itsas and you give somebody an eighteenbutton prepcheck and that tone arm doesnt go through the complete rehabilitation cycle uhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuh we assume that you the auditor have not parked it with clumsy auditing we assume that we assume you havent let an uncontrolled itsa line wander down through the bank and restimulate everything on the early track see because you put in an itsa line that is untimed and uncontrolled and you sooner or later are going to be in trouble itsa lines have to be timed in other words your questions on itsa always require time limitation factor or youre going to get somebody in trouble in this lifetime since you have been in scientology in birmingham in college you get the idea that sort of thing your pc wanders around all over the place and wanders into bunch of things that you didnt want him in and youve got restimulation factor to deal with now which you didnt intend to have so an uncontrolled itsa line now that youve had lot of fun letting an itsa line wander all over the place ill give you the trouble with an itsa line and the trouble with an itsa line is that an uncontrolled itsa line will get the pc in more trouble than youve been in for long time with pc why because the pcs attention is permitted to wander and tick and clip things which heretofore were inert they then restimulate and the charge comes up and blows his head off and then because you arent running systematic whole track things like r3r and r3n you of course keep clipping gpms and that sort of thing and restimulating them and clip another gpm and restimulate that and clip another and then half dozen engrams then few entrapments and few crashes and few betrayals and let him touch two or three overts too by this time you have tone arm action why the case is overcharged thats an uncontrolled itsa line well go into that more fully later not necessarily in this lecture i just give you that as word of warning you can let pcs itsa line wander all you please as long as it is wandering exactly where you want it to go ill give you an idea sometimes the pc will overanswer the question you say review i was going to put this in new model session and then didnt do so because youll have too much trouble with it you would have had review the last session all right the pc says soandso and soandso and soandso if the auditor right isnt right up there on the edge of his auditing chair ready to cut that line the moment the pc exceeds that question see the pc doesnt review the last session but starts to run the incidents or new incidents contacted in the last session doesnt just review it but gives you brandnew stuff out of the last session which wasnt there in other words exceeds the answer to it and you all of sudden have yourself some trouble well whats this trouble the trouble is that your pc on an uncontrolled itsa line has gone and plunged off and started restimulating material that he shouldnt have been in and now youre going to have trouble in this session you already predetermined by letting the itsa line be uncontrolled what youre now going to run in this session so therefore you cant ever carry out an auditing program itd be perfectly all right to do that as long as he just reviewed the last session that was all what did we do in the last session we did soandso and soandso and soandso and etc and i had cognition of soandso and soandso and soandso and you say all right thank you good all right good thank you thank you very much all right your pc your pc if the auditor is unadroit psychic and so forth is going to feel his communication line has been cut but let assure you its far far better for that pc to feel his communication line has been cut than wind up eighttrillionseight ago in the middle of gpm which you had business running because now your pcs really going to arc break in addition to that why youve got more charge restimulated than youre about to handle do you understand you got to control the itsa line the best way to control it is with time span you can do time spans in several ways i wrote that up recently i dont know whether it was published or not theres time is always part of it theres time by subject you see saint hill see thats time period although youve merely said subject and so forth but theyre all time periods all right so itsa line is always controlled by time period you go in put in r1c on pc without specifying the time of your question and without carefully limiting the pcs wandering and youre going to have an overcharged pc an overrestimulated pc every time got it there is direction of attention necessary where the auditor comes in now that youve had some experience letting pc wander all over the place and so forth maybe youve learned how to listen now learn how to control that line very difficult problem how to control the itsa line without cutting the communication of the pc that my dears is your problem still getting in trouble ive got business telling you how to do it now whats good news here whats good news here thats not necessarily germane to the situation is that pc answering prepcheck buttons is of course giving you straight direct itsas these are the key itsas of the case so as he gives you prepcheck answers within time period and i dont care how you limit this time period itd probably have to be half this lifetime youd have to clean up something on the order of about half of this lifetime or maybe bit more in order to make keyedout clear with ease clear lets drop it back in definition to the dianetic definition which never considered anything more than this lifetime and lets handle what we set out to handle in the first place we made lot of keyedout clears lets not defame this particular situation because it is very valuable its valuable state of case and its state of case which you yourself ought to be able to create now with the technology we have with the slightest without the slightest qualms how well just put in an eighteenbutton prepcheck well do you require an assessment well that would be nice thats about how valuable the assessment is itd be nice gives the pc something to ask answer about the assessment does but that assessment and your prepchecks are headed at only one thing theyre headed at restimulation what youre trying to do is key out restimulation and thats the only thing youre interested in is just keyingout restimulation therefore clearing is destimulation way to clear somebody is destimulate him well how do you destimulate him well you knock off the points of clearing where the restimulation took place this has nothing to do with getting out the original incident incidents then categorize into an inert incident unrestimulated an inert incident nobodys worried about it its buried down there in the center of the earth nobodys kicked it tripped it touched it has nothing to do with it dont you see its inert its got charge in it potential charge man you tread on its tail and it goes bzzzzzzzz now you have restimulated it all you have to do is flick the pcs attention on it and you have restimulated it theres of course the degree that you can restimulate it but we are not worried about the degree that we restimulate it this could be large catalog like kraepelins chart of insanity see the degree of restimulation and if you work over an incident and chew on it and chew on it and chew on it and restimulate it of course you restimulate it more and then theres not letting it discharge while it is being restimulated and there are all kinds of conditions to the degree that an inert incident can be restimulated see restimulated greatly or slightly or just kicked in or something well we dont care about all of that thats getting far far too nice thats like fellow being good mannered and being an expert on emily post i dont think they have anything to do with each other particularly its just being too much its what kind of fingernail polish do you wear on your little finger that you hold aloft from the tea cup you see what is the proper color of the fingernail polish what is the proper color of it that of course is pooh who cares an incident is restimulated or its not restimulated and that will do us you will find yourself saying good and proper restimulated you see and theres also unknowing restimulation it got restimulated and nobody knew what was restimulated including the pc and that is the subject of your arc break there are different conditions of restimulation but in final analysis it doesnt matter what the condition is the fact remains that it is restimulated so there is simply this matter of it being restimulated and then there is state of case case is restimulated all cases are restimulated to some degree of one kind or another all cases are but case can be overrestimulated and that is condition of restimulation the conditions of restimulation are extremely varied as i have just said but there is condition of overrestimulation and that condition of overrestimulation is that it will its definition is it will not discharge by ordinary means now the situation that we have to deal with in all of these regards is whether or not something can be discharged and something that is overrestimulated is not easily discharged because in some fashion or another the discharge has been prevented thats prevented discharge overrestimulation so it comes from getting ahold of too much and not discharging it and that is what is an overrestimulation and then theres the condition of destimulation which simply knocks out the restimulation it doesnt knock out the incident and then theres the condition of discharge discharge is entirely and completely wrapped up with what is being discharged it is simply the flowoff now an incident which is discharged is discharged it is longer capable of restimulation it is not now an inert incident it is gone incident the batteries in it have been shortcircuited thats the end of it it is longer capable of producing restimulation discharged now where you get condition of restimulation which is then let off that is not discharged now were introducing special definition and meaning here that is not discharged it is destimulated got the idea thats not discharged discharged means that the incident just is now incapable of being restimulated you have just up and hit it in the head with an ax and its gone see but if this incident is going to be put back in an inert state then you destimulate so theres two things which you can do to bank one is destimulate it which is simply knock out the keyins of the original charge you didnt knock out the original incident you just knocked out the moments when the original incident was keyed in ill give you an idea youre coffee shopping with somebody and you sayyou say you realize you realize that theres gpm there is gpm devoted to homosexuality in the betweenlives implants there is one and he says oh i dont really think so he says well get the get the get the idea nowjust get the idea of to be homosexual just get that idea for moment and youll see that of course throws that gpm alive see it actually just discussing it isnt going to do very much about it see hes got to you got to concentrate somebodys got to concentrate his attention on it him or somebody else you know has got to look right at it you know straight at it and bang that gpm which up to this moment has been inert now becomes restimulated and is now in restimulated state now there are two things which can be done with it one is discharge it which is run it get its items out of it and take it off its something like taking the battery out of car discharge it in other words theres battery left in it it cant charge up now thats it its had it you see and the other thing you can do is say now recall the time that you were talking to joethere in the coffee shop and he said to remember that gpm yeah thats right well what was happening in the coffee shop see theres your time factor see oh there was lot of clicks and clacks of cups and saucers and joe was arguing with and so forth and actually i had withhold from him at the time been out with his girl last night and so forth and clickclock thats the end of that gpm restimulation see get the idea that is now destimulated now at any given moment somebody can come along and say well there is gpm in the betweenlives area to be homosexual i dont believe it he says you say all right well just take look at it bang you see there it is somebodys turned on the ignition switch so an incident an incident which is an inert incident is not having any effect on the pc its not part of his aberrative picture you see but might very well by various chains and channels have influence upon him dont you see in various ways but it itself as an incident is not restimulated were not interested here in behavior what does this inert incident do to influence behavior the degree that it is inert were not interested in that were just interested in whether or not charge is coming off of this thing or charge is blocked up and almost off of this thing and were interested in that kind of proposition so theres two things you can do to an incident you can destimulate it which is knock out the times its been keyed in or you can discharge it which is to just to knock it out and shoot it down in flames forever see theres the two things you can do now let us consider let us consider that the reactive bank is basically concerned with and contains inert incidents let us just assume that its inert incidents after all theres fantastic amount of time track and the individual has not been out on this time track to amount to anything and there it is all stacked in one way or the other and theres probably thousands hundreds of thousands of incidents make some auditors just weary to think of how many incidents there are in the reactive mind theyd just throw their hands up in horror and all of those things are little potential batteries they can furnish charge they can furnish charge like mad see but nobodys been walking around on top of them theyre just lying there theyre not doing anything see not hardly anything at all theyre not doing anything well if theyd just stay quiet youd never have to clear anybody but the pcs attention directed by life or some artificial means such as auditing can be made to connect with or by his own means can be made to connect with one of these incidents that has never before been alive and at that moment its batteries go bzzzzzzzz and start generating juice now whats remarkable is its actually the pcs attention which generates the juice so the incident is merely manif trick put together by which the pcs attention can be converted to restimulation over which he has power its out of his control if you want to go into the real mechanics of the situation in other words heres this dead fish lying there had life in it pcs attention is placed on the dead fish and the fish begins to wiggle worse than that he begins to fan his tail and the ripples come up from that we will call charge thats charge all right now actually as long as his attention is flicked back and forth across this inert incident charge is generated and if this attention is fully enough directed to it and if the channel of the pcs attention is clear enough so as to permit understanding and confront in other words permit his arc to flow you will see motion on the tone arm of your meter and very soon fish wiggle very soon after that fish not there now actually you can put the pcs attention on this he can put his own attention on that zone or area of the time track as many times as he please and he will never get any charge from it thats discharging an incident thats erasing one you have various terms for it already lets look at this other action lets look at this restimulation from another point of view pcs attention flicks onto it either from an uncontrolled itsa line or something happens in life somebody comes charging up to him and holds dead fish in his face something like this and it reminds him of this other thing and his attention wittingly or unwittingly flicks over this particular section of the bank which has been lying quiescent and the moment when his attention flicked on it is the moment of restimulation we call that keyin his attention hits it so you got moment of restimulation now oddly enough it is only necessary to destimulate that incident to have it go back into dead fish state you only need to hit this moment of restimulation knock out any abberative factor in the moment of restimulation and the incident will destimulate and the individuals attention is longer fixed or fixated on this particular incident and the incident goes quiet again keying out is the term we normally assign to that action so theoretically you can take hold of the pc and take anything as powerful as the eighteen buttons of the prepcheck and with any time of kind of time span or subject direction here that nevertheless gets it all in let him wander up and down this thing putting in the buttons of the prepcheck and you should key out the bulk of anything that has been keyed in in this lifetime then you would return to state of free needle you have in effect clear youve destimulated somebody to state of clear thats clear you see it isnt necessary then to make clear in order to make an ot but you should know how to do it because youre going to have to do it in part lot of the time very fascinating that all of this ties together so neatly because its directly represented and analyzed by the tone arm directly and immediately and in the higher state of free needle of course requires the needle in addition to the tone arm there are eight states of needle youll have bulletin on it theres reason to go into them now and call them off number by number they begin with free needle they begin with tightening needle and moving tone arm they go up to through this to high tone arm they go through high tone arm to low tone arm they go from low tone arm to tone arm at clear read dead thetan see clear read tight tone arm tight needle motion at clear read for the pc thats dead thetan that youve got in your emeter essentials and so forth its next stage now lets you got that thats cycle of tone arm conditions there are few more of them intermediate stages but youll have list of those as i said now lets take look at this they also compare to your eight levels of case theyre straight across you can analyze the level of case by the level of behavior and action of the tone arm now that makes id been trying to solve this for you for long time of how the devil did you make diagnosis of the case and finally worked out how you could do it with the way person appears on meter so thats very direct how does he behave in the first few minutes of processing on the meter and that gives you the level of case bang im not making lecture now on the diagnosis so you can have your levels of case and your tone arm conditions and so forth some other time or in the bulletin which im doing on it if i ever finish it i seem to keep hacking away at this bulletin its now getting about foot thick full of papers and now the conditions which you must pay attention to are these dead thetan clear read without tone arm motion and tight needle thats your lowest case range save one there is one below that but that one below it is not tone arm manifestation so it is not included but i just throw it in gratuitously the needle is inversely reading its inversely tight so its frantic youll see for the first time constantly rock slamming needle with the tone arm sitting at dead thetan its just constant charge that is reading its like reading switchboard of power plant its just yaawlyaaaa everything moving except the tone arm but we just include that in the unaware case since its needle manifestation we dont need it your next movement up from dead thetan is low tone arm case the low tone arm case that case sits constantly and continually around 10 or 05 or something like that you just cant get any motion out of it and the next case that is important to you is the high tone arm case and the next case is one moving in the high range and then there is the case which has got what you would call good tone arm motion which is going past and through clear read and then this goes right on down to free needle with tone arm at clear read in other words it turns whole cycle so you have to be able to recognize the difference between dead thetan and clear its fairly easy to do ones alive and ones dead i mean but youd be surprised how often this ones been missed ive seen it missed guy sitting there hes pale gray you know never has anything to say the needle is totally stuck you ask him anything try to do sec check or something on him total stuck needle reaction from anything of the sort somebody comes around and said well the guys clear ive had it happen i havent believed it but its happened then ive seen arguments with clears arguments with clear reads now you can see that if the state of clear and this is something thats needed classification and clarification for long time were working actually now at the level of scientology three when were actually working with clears this has needed clarification for long time the second i tried to push clear through from anything but destimulated clear to discharged clear i found out you had to go all the way to ot there wasnt any way stop even though the person would exteriorize and theyd be theta clear and theyd be this and theyd be that and so forth none of these none of these furnished sufficient way stop short of ot so its just long pull the odd part of it is that at any time on that route you could make clear at any moment on that route you could make clear well all you have to do is prepcheck them this lifetime to free needle and you got clear that destimulates whatever youre running see you just drop all the restimulation off the case and there it is youll have free needle now its interesting that this is very easy one to produce its been produced by nineyearold boy on staff member in new york thats right he just got in the prepcheck buttons on his pc and didnt nag the pc and clean cleans or cut lines probably didnt even read the meter to that degree the pc finally said that that was all the suppress well that was fine that was all the suppress i dont know that the session went that way he might have been hell on wheels getting that needle clean too but obviously he couldnt have cut the line very hard or he wouldnt have gotten the result he got which of course was free needle needle sloppy and flop and drifting across and falling on its own pins and you cant get it to read on anything you see elementary now the condition youve got to have in order to take anybody to ot is that nextdoor neighbor to free needle moving tone arm which is moving through the clear read with good motion now if you dont achieve that before you start trying to strike for ot youre not going to make it well why the case is overrestimulated there are too many incidents kicked in and you in trying to take the case its elementary it has nothing to do with the state of case oddly enough i mean it doesnt matter whether the guy is loopy balmy or it has nothing to do with it you see what he can or cannot do its just the state of this meter and you try to take this character on to the backtrack and of course you restimulate something new and you add it to the overrestimulated case which adds up to frozen tone arm so you actually have put his case state down one click see from wherever he is now if you continued to do this he would theoretically theoretically go from fairly loose tone arm well that is to say it moved little bit once in while hed go to high tone arm and if you continued to overrestimulate the case and run the case without tone arm action the case would then become low tone arm case and if you continue to run the case without tone arm action you would have that needle stuck at the clear read just as elementary as this you see then by doing prepcheck now its now more difficult to do the prepcheck dont you see because hes sort of disassociating and hes overcharged and blown toward pt and he can just get yesterday and so forth youve overcharged the case now with prepcheck however you start cleaning up all this stuff you back the thing down from clear read stuck that goes right straight on through to low tone arm case stuck and that frees up bit and goes to high tone arm case stuck and then with more prepchecking and actions in this direction destimulating the case all the way the case then turns to fairly free needle toward the free needle state dont you see well you dont have to get to free needle in order to now run the case on the backtrack its cinch if this guy is carrying around this much toxemia in the way of an inert bank that any time anybody sneezes in his direction inadvertently puts his attention on the time he was crucified he then he goes from free needle to this you see its cinch hes got to have those incidents discharged sooner or later now the subject here is not how you discharge the incident its when you discharge the incidents see that gives you all now you really know all when you start to look that over well you put the case in state where incidents can be discharged and if the case is getting good tone arm action and what do i mean by good tone arm action theres bulletin on it but youve got youve got to have fair sweep of that tone arm its got to be moving around man and it should preferably be moving through 30 preferably moving through 30 higher range motion from 30 to 50 is critical and the second you go backtrack by actual experience on case that is moving well not 30 to 50 but case that is moving from 3 lets take an actual lets take in some actual figures here case moving from 40 to 525 with good tone arm action when taken on the backtrack to restimulate new incident or gpm promptly flies up to 575 and sticks see the case would run on this lifetime with tone arm action between 40 and 50 or something like this or 40 and 525 and get good tone arm action and the second you go backtrack and grab handful of inert incident and restimulate it why clank she goes clang right there stuck 55 stuck 575 something like this dont you see stuck thung there it is see got the idea so that case isnt high enough case level to run backtrack on how do you diagnose this tone arm motion is moving in that sphere or zone now lets take much more critical case lets take case that is moving down here from 225 to 05 and lets achieve that as the cases tone arm motion 225 to 05 is the extreme range and we take that case backtrack well youre probably not going to make high needle youre probably going to stabilize this case toward clear read with less tone arm action ah you moved it from low tone arm case to dead thetan case that is long way from enough tone arm action or proper tone arm response to run backtrack see thats long way from it that case actually under prepcheck will become high tone arm case in theory and move around to the high range before it moves down to proper tone arm action do you see the progress of case then as represented by the tone arm stuck tone arm at clear read low tone arm high tone arm tone arm in range tone arm settling back to clear read but loose and the needle free see it goes that cycle thats the way that tone arm behaves in the presence of cases to get clear absolute text book look at this is rather difficult because sometimes when you start prepchecking the case transfers rather rapidly from one kind of case to another case rather speedily goes through one of these stages without your seeing it go through the stage see because you werent purposely going to stick the case high up so therefore it doesnt stick way up and then doesnt stick lower and so forth actually does spin and goes through 70 and youll see such cases low tone arm case go through 7o bzzzzzzz and you wonder where the needles gone where its gone wheres it gone sit there the meters gone out of action obviously because the tone arm cant be centered on anything gone you know when that happens to you and you wonder what has happened by the way there is something on here you probably had never paid much attention to theres the trim knob and you just take that trim knob between your thumb and forefinger and give it violent switch and you just twist that trim knob all the way over and your needle will come back on when she goes through 70 and wont register why your trim knob will put the needle back on the dial for you if you get stuck at 70 handy thing to know but i myself it happens so frequen infrequently that somebody goes through 70 that i myself get caught on this i got caught on this the other night i was trying to catch the thingand then finally flip and i had it thought the meter goes out its almost impossible its such startlement to keep from directing the pcs attention to something weird going on here could happen very rare its very rare that your thing goes through 70 now it can go through 70 wrong way to it can go through 70 from high tone arm high stuck tone arm to low stuck tone arm thats undesirable it can also go through 70 and come back off 70 again by going through high tone arm through to low tone arm you rescue the pc by doing r2h or something like this youre doing r2h or something which rescues the pc rather easily and relieves charge rather easily and keys out nicely and it only stays in low tone arm state for split second and then slipslipbingbang goes back through 70 again and comes up on the other side but this time maybe bit higher in other words you were carrying the case downhill and you went through 70 going through 70 doesnt always mean that the case is improving the case can also deteriorate now this puts under your control this puts under your control the very interesting fact that you can make clear at any given moment you can make clear anytime you can just sit down and make clear nothing much to it you got the weapons its very easy just dont clean cleans on the prepcheck line or something like that and be rather permissive in running some kind of prepcheck on some kind of an assessed subject and maybe another prepcheck on another assessed subject and maybe even third one on another assessed subject and all of sudden youll be sitting there looking at free needle pc will feel wonderful its fine and oddly enough you have done enough such is the power of auditing to keep him going for years in most cases theyll start worrying about it however theyll start chewing at things which they remembered they used to chew at and theyll wonder how those are now and there goes their attention onto an incident youd made nicely inert and they kick that one in so when they get up in the morning they put themselves on the emeter to find out if theyre still clear this morning and theyre not theyre at 325 and thats not so good and they worry about that dont you see and wonder what incident kicked in put in their own itsa line flick down hit some other and the next thing you know youve merely got somebody with an active tone arm now you see whats happening here in other words you carefully destimulate somebody and they or life restimulates the thing back out of existence again well thats about all there is to clearing clearing then you would look at it as relatively unstable state and so it is but it is more stable than anything thats ever existed in the whole field of mental healing psychetherapy or anything else so why not accept it as state now you could the next step up by which you achieve this and by which you achieve this totally stable with complete stability is theres nothing left in the bank except things that dont have batteries in them see the incidents left whether theyre inert or otherwise arent going to do anybody any harm you get case level 2 you see as far as the bank is concerned because you discharged everything else youre going to start seeing free needles occasionally and when you just delete all of those too or delete why he is mocking up bank all of sudden the whole meter goes blank then the pc has to worry about how does he estimate the amount of beam to put on an emeter electrode in order for you to get any connection between the two cans and one way of doing that is just hook permanent beam between the two cans and the meter continues to read very nicely that hasnt anything to do with the individual in other words you havent got anything to measure and that of course you reached up to state of ot so state of totally discharged bank is ot and state of see ot and clear are the same breed of cat except they go out on two different sides of the house see you pull the guy out of the bank and hes not in the bank and he will behave very nicely and can probably do lot of interesting things but if he does them hes going to kick in charge occasionally and this is going to worry him and he doesnt really dare turn on any power or juice because if he turns on any power or juice he runs into inert incidents and they activate and this throws him down scale again so he feels tippy he feels he feels somewhat unstable the second he starts keying back in again its loss of hope he gets lose that is he considered himself in such wonderful shape and suddenly he isnt in such good shape because actually that fellow still has in his bank enough incidents he has them all you see that if you threw those incidents alive one after the other systematically preventing their discharge you could run this case just bangbangbang by the amount of charge that was restimulated you could just run the case down to actionaction and then highest tone arm and then low tone arm and then dead thetan you could so overcharge him he couldnt remember his name rank serial number or anything because hes still got bank overrestimulation is the cause of amnesia all you have to do is overrestimulate somebody you get amnesia its the cause of weird behavior its the cause of lot of things its the cause of making you feel like your skulls coming off its the cause of making your body feel bad it doesnt matter much what part of the body feels bad or whats the significance of feel bad is its the overcharge that makes one feel bad one feels nervy edgy that sort of thing now if you were to give pc three sessions in row without achieving any tone arm action on the case the case starts to feel pretty wild because just the fact of auditing is going to restimulate in other words hes going to wander around now the more overcharged the more restimulated case is the more overrestimulated to use the proper term case is the more it greases around on the track the more it dissociates the harder it is for it to hold position on the track the harder for it is to sit in an engram the harder to stay on the backtrack the more easily the case is swept up toward present time its all grease see and its all uncomfortable memory is bad recognition is bad the facsimiles look bad of course youre walking up to something thats charged like got ten thousand volts on the confounded thing you know and you expect him to get near this facsimile see because hes got so much charge residually the charge is starting to match up with charge incidents start to jam together and that is all assisted by wrong dates and wrong durations and the bank starts to look like its been in wine press or something like that its kind of mess and that is always due to overrestimulation now as you move overrestimulation off the case why the case goes back into happy state of time track in place everythings in place everythings fine you dont even have to head for the exact moments of restimulation just prepcheck buttons are good enough case all gets patted back together again time track will be back there unwalked on but in beautifui condition the pc will be able to get near incidents hold himself on the time track everythings going along fine visio is up and perception up when he does hit an incident now in condition like that an auditor carefully without keeping the itsa line in with control an auditor carefully regulating the pcs attention goes backtrack grabs up handful of gpm that he knows about and runs it with an accurate line plot and discharges the thing and so forth and hes still getting tone arm action now the tone arm action of the pc potentially will increase and you get better tone arm action because hes one less gpm dont you see that is even if you do put his attention on the backtrack it isnt so likely to freeze providing you dont take eight gpms you see restimulate all those and then go off to find some bettertasting clover and then because that didnt taste very well go off someplace to find some more and then find the exact combination of how come he got gpms well lets get basic on the whole line of gpms and lets get the first gpm out lets do this lets do that and lets not run anything and the next thing you know why your case is high stuck tone arm case and youre getting tone arm motion you cant get anything on the backtrack he has perceptions his memorys bad somebody drops pin block away and he jumps foot hes all nerved up what is happening to him in auditing auditing is doing him in all of this all of this all of this you see and he gets all of those things as net result of overrestimulation now you can turn right around prepcheck the case with appropriate terms and so forth you can prepcheck the case back to good tone arm action take him on the backtrack to stuff you already know is there take the stuff up selectively one after the other discharge it properly and the case is on the road again but the wrong thing to do is to not pay any attention to the condition of the tone arm and hope that you can go backtrack and pick up the incident which is responsible for this restimulation pahhahahaha because you always restimulate at any given instant more than you are discharging so case has to have some latitude for restimulation youre going to do youre going to take one bear gpm series one bear series well i defy you to run one bear series without ticking the adjacent pair pardon one goal out of the bear series without ticking the adjacent pair in the series the one above it and the one below it just in the process of finding the top oppterm why the pc is around that isnt so much finding the items thats fairly easy but getting down to the bottom you have to have the next gpm in the series to get the bottom oppterm so youve now thrown that one alive havent you and now how about listing for the next one well thats liable to throw that one and two or three other series alive see what is the next gpm well you have to list for it which of course throws more retimulation onto the case theres got to be some tolerance for an additional restimulation without killing the tone arm action in other words the case has to be in pretty good shape to have this kind of thing happening to it its got to have width of tolerance in other words you started out with margine of tone arm action now if you started out to do this action with margin of tone arm action tone arm action to spare at all this case is running between 40 and 50 getting good ta action between 40 and 50 and now were going to go back and were going to take series of the bear goals one right after the other and were going to run those gpms out that case is going to stick at 525 or thereabouts and is not going to budge because its overrestimulated see its overrestimulated to begin with didnt have enough margin to run on now sometimes you win on this so you discard it sometimes you just play it lucky you knew there was gpm back there you went back there you ran out that gpm and it restored little more tone arm action and so you ran the next gpm to it and theres little more tone arm action you thought that was fine and once in blue moon you will actually restore the cases tone arm motion from the backtrack cut your throat because thats the type of win which leads you into because the other nine times out of the ten that you do that the reverse happens you go back you knew where the gpm was youre going to run this gpm you got the plot everything of the sort you start buuhuhtuttutbobo bapong and were presented with something which is running at 55 one session at 55 pc survives it two sessions at 55 hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm well if we just get the rest of this gpm out ahhhahhh if we can just get the items and we have arc breaks or flubs or anything like that and the pc stays happy through the whole thing and we get enough charge off the case because the gpms are actually what cause that tone arm to stick we know that so so huh this we get the th thand so on you you say you have an arc break well lets see do we do an assessment uh well maybe we can just clear it up what did i cut your comm or something oh ohhhh next give the next item the next item the next item yeah give give the next pair give the next four lets just get anything off of it we can down to the end see 575 stuck we did get blowdown of 02 and we try to run something else and theres that tone arm up and youre not going place man and you cant get on the backtrack without sticking it harder why the case is already overrestimulated youve got to take long breath and run something on this case to destimulate it and return the tone arm action so its going pleasantly back and forth across 30 and is running in to good condition and good tone arm action before you dare do anything else on the backtrack now you go on the backtrack and get some of the charge off and the case runs like startled gazelle and everything is fine in other words you damn near got to make clear before you can ot somebody i considerthat very interesting set of data and thats why i say were lucky because that tone arm behavior compares exactly to case levels and case level is just overrestimulation not bank you consider that case has bank reactive mind the content of which is inert but if he gets walking around in there in his muddy feet it soo going to soon cease to be inert but there it sits nice big inert mass ofjunk unrestimulated big its sizable its formidable but it is inert and therefore is not bothering anybody and then we have subsidiary if we want graphic graph this so it looks like something draw great big circle for your inert bank and then draw little tube off the big circle and draw another little circle and you call that the restimulation the amount of restimulation and the amount of restimulation is always the auditing target now that amount can be great or small and as it becomes great you get the lower case type and as it becomes small you get the higher case type as far as your representation is concerned in other words youre working on two bins here theres one great big one that has inert and then theres what has been restimulated off of that and that lies in another cubicle and the auditing is always done against the cubicle of restimulation and when that cubicle is emptied the auditor can reach into the big bank expertly grab by its tail one gpm haul it over into the little restimulation cubicle audit the hell out of it and empty the restimulation cubicle of that and then reach over into the big bank and haul another great big whopping series of stuff out of it and put it into state of restimulation and just graphically represented its now in the restimulation chamber and now he empties the restimulation chamber and so he brings about an ot now when he puts his great big hands into the inert bank and hauls out fifteen dozen fish all in full restimulation he finds hes got more fish than hes got bank he feels now that hes auditing the whole reactive mind simultaneously and thats the way it looks because hes restimulated too much so having if hes done that error the thing to do or if life has done that to the pc the thing to do is just throw the fish back into the main chamber inert and just empty this cubicle now if we get this graphically pictured we get something that looks something like this which ive just described to you we have your big bank and that is your reactive mind and then we have the restimulation chamber you understand and your restimulation chamber has some kind of vent on it which is discharge now you can discharge this and always some of this discharges regardless if youre destimulating or you can put it back to sleep which is destimulate see so theres youre auditing the restimulation chamber always youre always auditing the restimulation chamber and you have another action which really isnt auditing its restimulation you do it with an emeter and so forth and you select something out of the reactive mind and it goes live and it looks like it hasnt moved or anything and it really hasnt but pretend that youve hauled that through into the restimulation chamber and youve got now charge and you audit that charge off and you discharge that and when youve got this thing nicely empty only then do you reach back into the reactive mind and haul something new out into the restimulation chamber and discharge that at any time if this condition seems to exist whereby your restimulation chamber seems to be that size you open up this line of course inevitably you get little discharge here but you open up that line and just empty it back into the reactive mind got the notion that were involved with here its just the idea is the auditor can at will put into restimulation or into this restimulation chamber at will he can put anything and everything he wants from the reactive mind well you got line plots you got pictures of the track you got various things like this put an itsa line in uh get time factor on your early track thats nice time factor on your early track what do you suppose you must have run into that convinced you you should have aberrations or pictures or something like that and then just sit there for while see and let the pc talk in fact sit there for several sessions if you really want to make good test of it because youre going to get tone arm action first thats whats going to fool you and youll see the tone arm go on up and stick and then youll see the tone arm go through 70 and go low and then youll see the tone arm go to dead thetan because youre just asking this guy to restimulate the whole backtrack see uncontrolled action so you brought this restimulation chamber not just full but bursting if youre not undertaking an auditing action to empty it such as to run the line plot and shape it all up and groove it all down and that sort of thing horrible this case pin drops quarter of mile away goes through top of skull nervous body things happening all kinds of wild things are occurring on this case you say go to ten years ago tracks greasy see so he goes to ten million five million six million tomorrow yesterday out of session zzzz looks like bear on skates hes just going all over the doggone place see and you say get an incident when you were in baby carriage flickflickflickflickflickflickflickflick hes gotten fifteen incidents of being in baby carriages in the last fifteen lives why well actually the thetan just gets backed up here in the corner subjected to enormous pressure hes just overwhelmed hes just drowned he cant cope with it he cant he isnt hasnt been permitted to understand or confront the things which have been restimulated so they havent discharged and he doesnt know what to look at and you get high tone arm case the main thing wrong with them is they dont know what to look at and you ask them to do anything and they do something else and they dont quite know where or how to go about this and it takes very precise action on your part so it takes something like prepcheck you get to put in time limit one that is real to the person and the next thing you know with one single exception which i will come to in moment and give you much greater lecture about why the case peels right on down into destimulation and you get the case back from this state to this state and then you actually get the case into state of nothing thats clear nothing in the restimulation chamber thats all clear is loose charge kicking around but some case that is having trouble some case thats having lot of trouble all you have to do is make motion you know youve got more charge kicked up in this restimulation chamber its practically bursting you see and you just raise your hand in session and bank caves in on him see in other words the charge the overrestimulation the amount of charge present is so great charge isnt overrestimulation but the word overcharge is not proper people get to thinking about fees or something and this degree of restimulation is so great that anything in the environment kicks some part of the restimulation into action so hes just totally reactive everything is already fixed up so it can react its already reacting so everything reacts you run any pc three sessions with stuck tone arm i dont care where the tone arm is stuck case is going to worsen uuhhh then they come to the fourth session hoooo theyve already been coming in feeling grim and that fourth session hmmmm man they feel bad and theyre griefy they dont want to go on they dont want to have anything to do with anything just overrestimulation because its not possible to audit somebody without doing one of three things one of three its impossible to audit somebody without doing one of three which is restimulate destimulate or discharge you got to do one or another of these actions now when case is already in confusion and is not understanding or confronting well naturally the amount of destimulation and discharge is going to be minimal so the restimulation is what takes over and you just start auditing the case and just auditing restimulates the case nothing is being discharged because theres motion on the tone arm theres destimulation taking place and theres discharge taking place so obviously theres only one thing left to happen and thats restimulation so just the fact of auditing somebody is going to do one of three things and when you dont destimulate anything and you dont discharge anything you certainly are going to restimulate something more so an auditors danger signal is tone arm action and thats danger signal and you should go at once into finding out why there is tone arm action and theres several reasons why theres tone arm action but first and foremost amongst these things i say several there are two two reasons why theres tone arm action of course we understand already that the tone arm action as case level has deteriorated because of restimulation to that case level which doesnt achieve tone arm action that goes without saying we say theres tone arm action obviously the case level has deteriorated now these two things here are present in your actions the auditor either does something that can discharge the existing restimulation or looks for what reason it has not to discharge in other words he really undertakes those two actions he either discharges it right now which hed better do and if he cant do that right now then he had better look to find out why it isnt happening right now the case isnt running something that will discharge in other words the case is overrestimulated the stuck tone arm its already overrestimulated so you better jolly well not restimulate anything else youd better take an action under that heading which will discharge something that has already been restimulated but mildly and up toward pt ordinarily not necessarily tone arm action just stopped you just got through abandoning twelve gpms one right after the other and tone arm action is now stopped well the way obviously to start that tone arm action go back and flatten those twelve gpms one right after the other and the tone arm action restores maybe you see you might have accidentally restimulated more by doing this you see than would ordinarily discharge and youre now the case is over its head your best action is prepcheck type action or r2h or some such action as that routine 2 process which is aimed toward making people healthy and well and clearing them and so forth or routine 3 actions routine 3 actions which tear into the backtrack are definitely out and if the condition doesnt instantly and immediately remedy itself and tone arm action restores by reason of your prepcheck or your r2h or something like that and if you dont get immediate restoration of that and you cant bring that about at once then theres only one other thing that is wrong with this case this case is sitting on service fac service facsimile therefore we can say that any case any case that cannot be restored or put in the situation of clear in relatively small amount of auditing certainly less than twentyfive hours is sitting in service facsimile and their case will not do anything but worsen until that service facsimile is located and cleared this also gives you the hidden standard this gives you lot of other things and just so youll have record of it right now rather than im going to give you another lecture about service facsimiles and that sort of thing the service facsimile is viewable because when you prepcheck them on some subjects mass turns on in the pc the prepcheck turns on mass oh who ever heard of such thing prepcheck couldnt turn on mass oh yes it will on service facsimile because the pc doesnt intend to get rid of this the pc has of course rightnesswrongness equation of something in life and this rightnesswrongness thing is what doesnt surrender then to normal auditing because it is service facsimile and you now have rightness and wrongness and you have domination and you have survival that you can directly address the service facsimile and discharge it and the case will then go back to battery and go to clear read but if anybody has been audited over long period of time on prepchecks on in scientology yapyapyap on this on that and so forth and they have not reverted to clear read there is only one thing that stands in their road and that is service facsimile and the service facsimile has got to be gotten out of the road with picks shovels sledgehammers or any other type of action and as soon as its out of the road then the case will pick up and fly and will go to clear read theres rightnesswrongness computation the reason we never handled service facsimile before the reason we never handled service facsimiles before is actually we didnt have any way to handle it because we didnt know their total anatomy we knew of their existence as youll find in advanced procedures and axioms but the service facsimile is rightnesswrongness computation any case that isnt improving at once instantly alertly right on the way tone arm action improving needle action improving on such thing as prepcheck on such thing as their auditing on such thing as recent times on such thing as this lifetime anything in this lifetime case isnt snapping back to battery the case still having recurrent present time problems case is still worried about something of the sort yipyap yipyap yipyap always trouble with this case this case isnt so on tone arm action is very hard to restore on this case prepchecks dont seem to do anything to this case oh my god isnt life awful that case is sitting on service facsimile and the thing to do is to isolate the service facsimile and we havent got that all tied up how do you isolate the service facsimile but i will tell you the service facsimile if present will turn on mass when prepchecked wont surrender to prepcheck hahahahaha what do you know and that was the big discovery on the thing how could anything not surrender to prepcheck see well all prepcheck is is the series and types of decisions which thetan makes about things if prepcheck is going to turn on mass whats kicking here whats happening well it must be that the prepcheck is in conflict with the rightness and wrongness and the auditor must be sitting someplace with the prepcheck trying to make the pc in the pcs imagination wrong so the pc reinforces the facsimile and moves it forward in defense reactively you got rightnesswrongness computation represented by the existence and increase of mass well that takes care of about threequarters of the hgc pcs doesnt it well i think its quite interesting ive often noticed that an hgc got along all right when it didnt get any case results but thats quite interesting an awful condemnation but the truth of the matter is that it often ive noticed this that quite while itll get along all right without getting any case results and we can finally put that down to that it makes people so right not to have any case improvement lack of results in their immediate neighborhood however over period of six or eight months eventually will catch up with them and the whole roof caves in but they can go along so long without case results that one almost wonders if people dont come there to be made right about what theyre doing so there is your proposition theres your proposition with regard to why charge cant be discharged and the only thing which prevents charge from being discharged is theres too much overrestimulation the overrestimulation is so great the pc can confront nothing so you get tone arm action as long as you address unspecific backtrack things you get tone arm action you got to have something the pc finds very easy to understand very easy to confront in other words his arc has got to be raisable on it before itll discharge or if this isnt happening matter what you do then it must follow that the pc is operating on service facsimile and then your two reasons for high tone arm action actually the one reason for high tone arm action is overrestimulation see thats the one reason for high tone arm action but the two things which prevent discharge are the overrestimulated condition or the fact youre auditing service facsimile and the guy isnt just about to give that up my god what would happen what would happen what would happen if you cant chew tobacco if you cant chew tobacco how can you get even with the army you know horrible horrible situation here all kinds of additives get added on this situation well naturally ive got to have ive got to have ive got to have the situation has got to be terrible because if it werent terrible why it would be terrible see logical youve got case where little kid if he wasnt on crutches why hed be wrong and you try to take him off crutches and hes mass turns on how fascinating so you must be then by resolving his crutches you must be in some way be making him wrong so hes defending his right to be right this is perfectly understandable and thats the anatomy of service facsimile now to some degree very few cases fail to fall into this category there are very few cases that but most cases the bulk of cases are slowly resolvable and so you settle for the slow resolution and actually the service facs that the case has arent directly across the auditing channel so then we assume that only those service facsimiles that lie directly across auditing actually prevent discharge or destimulation of the bank so theyre the only ones that really stop clearing from occurring guy can have lot of service facsimiles if they dont operate directly and immediately in the road of auditing see if the service facsimile however has to do with the condition of his spirit or the service facsimile has to do with the fact that if he got better something or other if it has to do with his case if it has to do with well lets take state of insanity supposing he was being right with the state of insanity youre going to audit him huh youre going to audit him on any other button but this are you im afraid not see because theres vested interest in insanity whats the vested interest well obviously its vested interest thats all service facsimile thats all youve got situation going here whereby the person can only be right by being insane i know that sounds insane but all service facsimiles are insane just that way so theres your whole situation laid out in panorama the closer service facsimile moves in toward being right by having wrong case then the less progress the auditor is going to make on this pc so the pcs whose hills are very hard to climb have service facs which lie directly across the road of auditing for instance i asked myself this is so true i asked myself this is so true then if i have bank at all then i must be having bank in order to be right see in some way i must be having bank in order to be right and i almost got my head knocked off i ask myself silly questions like that once in while help you out see and i got the answer was sitting right there man if i didnt have bank theyd give one see so therefore the only way you can survive would be to have bank and then theyd leave you alone well thats the type thats the type of logic you see by which by which that whole computation occurs there are also interesting computations if you cant go anywhere on right and wrong you also can go someplace on dominate or survive the survival value of but right and wrong is your best your best bet and its always how would it make you right and how would it make others wrong woven around in some way so you get rightwrong balance in asking the question now theres your service facsimile lying across and you actually have only these two factors involved in the state of case as far as from an auditing viewpoint you only have this theyre the only factors involved in case state one two three the case factors are the state of overrestimulation and the possible presence of service facsimile and if your overrestimulation cannot be immediately and directly cured and you cannot make the case promptly and immediately clear so you can get on with auditing them to ot in other words you cant get the tone arm moving well so he can go up to ot then you know at once that youre dealing with service facsimile and that youll have to handle that service facsimile with prepcheck or an itsa line or something of this sort and your case will still get on the road and i think weve just whipped the biggest single barriers of auditing one an understanding of what is charge and what is restimulation and what are we auditing in the first place and the other one is if you cant do this what other factor is involved and weve had that for years but we now have process that handles it and i hope you find it very successful thank you end of tape
