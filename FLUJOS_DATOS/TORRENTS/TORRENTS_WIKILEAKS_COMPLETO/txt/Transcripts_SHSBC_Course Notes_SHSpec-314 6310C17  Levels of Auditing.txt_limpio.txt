6310c17 shspec314 levels of auditing getting ta motion is common denominator of all scientology activities the state of case of the pc has practically nothing to do with your ability to get ta motion on him some day you will cognite that if you dont yank the pcs attention off of his case and if you give him something to itsa and if you dont stop him he will get ta motion you can reduce ta motion by being unpredictable as an auditor eg by varying the form of model session keep the session drill constant and predictable from session to session or the pc will start running whatsit on the auditor then the auditor runs itsa on the pc and you get ta the auditor not the pc is in complete control of the bank the bank always does what you tell it to do the pc sometimes does and usually tries to when new style of auditing is released like listen style auditors at first go to pieces they will start introducing some listenstyle into formal auditing you should let the pc itsa the item or goal but thats all if you let the pc itsa the bank you will have sick pc on your hands the ta might move for awhile but the overrestimulation that the pc could get into will lock up the ta pretty soon the things that you are handling in the bank are the things that prevent itsa so letting the pc itsa around in the bank isnt effective the pc will restimulate that which prevents him from itsaing so he wont be able to itsa level iv is all subitsa but when you give the pc an item do let him cognite and itsa on it or you will stack up missed withholds bpc and high and stuck ta this presents bit of problem since eg when the auditor stops the pc from wandering into the wrong gpm there is bpc which can produce fierce arc break what you have to do is to audit fast enough and positively enough so that the pc never gets chance to wander the two great dangers in level iv auditing are 1 the tendency for goals list to be underlisted 2 the tendency for an item list to be overlisted when you fumble command you are not in control of the pcs itsaing of his bank but you are in absolute control of the bank so if you fumble list the bank will fumble so the bank fumbles unseen to you the pcs attention line is on the point where you fumbled therefore the bank has shifted under that scanner and the pcs attention goes off onto other things because you have shifted other things into his view with your fumbling soon after such fumble the pc will add something to the session some kind of yipyap not necessarily critical you did something that showed that you did not have control of the pcs bank you distracted the pcs itsamaker line and shifted the bank underneath it with this goof so you are going to get some other stuff it isnt neat and clean the pcs attention will now be somewhere you dont want it if there is any bpc lying around the goof or cutting the itsa line will key it in and you will get an arc break you will get dispersal of attention the itsa goes all over the time track there is always bpc in session you cant avoid it the bpc is either from past auditing or from this session the keyin of bpc is always some communication failure eg cut comm or refuted itsa on the part of the auditor you could even get wrong goal and if you audited very smoothly you could audit without giving the pc single arc break because it takes cut comm line to restimulate any bpc even when it is there the fact that there is bpc does not mean that there has to be an arc break but the fact that there is an arc break does mean that there was some bpc bpc via rough spot in auditing via session keyin cut comm etc gives rise to an arc break wrong goal may cause very uncomfortable pc but need not cause an arc break whether there is an arc break from bpc is entirely dependent on the auditor of course the more bpc there is in the session the tinier the mistake could be that could key it in the cycle of any arc break is 1 bypassed charge 2 rough spot that gives the pc little dispersion 3 cut line on the rough spot 4 the arc break dead on the arc break you will find little misdemeanor but ten minutes to 1 12 hours earlier you will find nice nasty misdemeanor for instance you might find that some sort of forcingness was going on guide the pcs attention dont force it the bank does move to whatever the auditor says running an engram is like developing picture just have the pc look at it you can move his attention over it repetitively this procedure will develop his picture of whatever was there lrh did this with pc who was dead in his head lrh moved the pc to nonsignificant date and moved him through the next half hour over and over the pc got to where he was reading the mail that he had read at the time that lrh moved him to word for word if you get the date and duration of any picture on the back track the picture will turn on the only thing that fouls this up is 1 the comm line is too lousy for the pc to report that he has done it there are several ways to prevent pc from reporting what he sees you can also foul up the comm line by refusing to take the pcs data you could fail to believe that you were moving the date under the pcs attention 2 the track is stuck in something you can demonstrate the above phenomenon by taking some nonsignificant date and getting the pc to pick up everything in it by moving him through it enough this is even easier than getting aberrated incidents since there is charge debarring it running chargeless incident is test of an auditors tech because there is nothing there but the auditing if you dont go goofy and demand more than the pc has you can get the picture you may not get the pcs state of consciousness in the incident unless you spend long time on it it would be good test of auditing there is upset present except what the auditor introduces if your auditing is rough you will find that when you are trying to get the pcs attention on the rough stuff of level iv his confront will be lowered his confidence will suffer and his ability to itsa will be lessened the pc will only have difficulty on what he can confront and do if you make difficulty for the pc additions to the comm cycle do make trouble for the pc so keep itsa where it belongs when youve got nice long item list 20 items long give the pc his item let him look at it and cognite when he has done so you can show him the list and ask him how the other items relate now you will get more ta and more confusion blowing off once you have learned how to audit level iv it will seem easy the fast way to arrive at that point is to do it
