disagree and some agree but with exceptions query has an attorney engaged in unprofessional conduct when he or she secretly records conversation the practice is unquestiona bly unethical when it is done illegally its status is more uncertain when it is done legally both the code of professi onal responsibility dr 1102 a3 and the model rules of professional conduct rule 84b models for the standards binding on members of the bar in most jurisdictions broadl condemn illegal c onduct as unethical1 i n the absence of an applicable exception secretly recording either telephone or face to face conversation is violation of the electronic communications privacy act provisions thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98251crs2 2 some of these jurisdictions permit intercepti on with one party consent for either telephone or oral communications but not both some permit in terception in criminal cases with one party consent but require the consent of all parties fo r interception by the general public or if the interception is unrelated to any of list of statutory designated offenses 3 the conduct proscribed in dr 1102a4 ie conduct which involves dishonesty fraud deceit or misrepresentation clearly encompa sses the making of making of recordings without the consent of all parties lawyer s hould record any conversation whether by tapes or other electronic device without the consent or knowledge of all parties to the conversation aba formal op 337 at 3 1974 4 there may be extraordinary circumstances in which the attorney general of the united states or the principal prosecuting attorney of state or local government or law enforcement attorneys or officers acting under the direction of the ttorney general or such principal prosecuting attorneys might ethically make and use secret recordings if acting within strict statutory limitations conforming to constitutional require ments this opinion does not address such exceptions which would necessarily require examination on case by case basis id note that under federal law in effect at the time an application for judicially supervised wiretapping for law enforcement purposes required the approval of the attorney general or principal prosecuting attorney of state or politic subdivision of state but law enforcement wiretapping with one party consent require d such approval 18 usc2516 2511 1972 edproscribe the use of an electronic or mechanical device to intercept wire oral or electronic communications 18 usc 2510 2511 exceptions are available for judicially supervised law enforcement interceptions under procedures dictated by the act 18 u sc 25111 it is likewise not unlawful under the federal act to record conversation as long as one of the parties to the conversation consents regard less of whether the recording is accomplished by someone acting under color of law the police or someone not acting under color of law everyone else 18 usc 25112c d state law frequently follows similar pattern recording is outlawed subject to one party consent exception for either the poli ce or both the police and everyone else yet several states make unlawful wh at is not unlawful under fede ral law they ban recording but are less forgiving of consent interceptions in california delaware florida illinois kansas maryland massachusetts michiga n montana new hampshire oregon pennsylvania and washington so types of recording that are lawful as matter of federal law are illegal as matter of state law and consequently are unethical2 in the remaining jurisdictions recording that is lawful may nevertheless be unethical its status turns upon construction of the co mmand that attorneys avoid conduct involving dishonesty fraud deceit or misrepresentati on dr 1102a4 rule 84c almost quarter of century ago the aba declared that the phrase dishonesty fraud deceit or misrepresentation includes recording convers ation without the consent of all of the parties to conversation even if the conduct is lawful aba formal op 337 19743 the opinion conceded an exception for courtordered interceptions4 most jurisdictions to consider the question have concurred in doing so some recognize an expanded class of exceptions and some disagree the convictions expressed by the texa s professional ethics committee are typical of the states that follow the aba approachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98251crs3 5 ala opinion

1986in february 1978 this committee addressed the issue of whether an attorney in the course of his or her pr actice of law could electronically record telephone conversation wit hout first informing all of the parties involved the committee concluded that although the recording of telephone conversation by party thereto did not per violate the law attorneys were held to higher standard the committee reasoned that the secret recording of conversations offended most persons concept of honor and fair play therefore attorneys should not electr onically record conversation without first informing that party that th conversation was being recorded the only exceptions considered at that time were extraordinary circumstances with which the state attorney general or local government or law enforcement attorneys or officers acting under the direction of state attorney general or such principal prosecuting ttorneys might ethically make and use secret recordings if acting within strict statutory limitations conforming to constitutional requirements which exceptions were to be considered on case by case basis this committee sees reason to change its former opinion pursuant to rule 804a3 attorn eys may not electronically record conversation with another party without first informing that party that the conversation is being recorded x prof eth comm opinion 514 1996 the states

aba unethical per approach in one form or another the di strict of columbia mississippi new mexico north carolina oklahoma oregon utah and wi sconsin suggest that the position that the propriety of an attorney surreptitiously r ecording his or her c onversations where it is lawful to do so depends upon the other circ umstances involved in particular case14 in new york the question of whether an attorneys surreptitiously recording conversations is ethically susp ect is determined by locality15 there is general agreement that attorney may advise hi s or her clients of the circ umstances under which surreptitious recording is lawful but that an attorney ma not use client agent or any other individual to evade any ethical limitation to which the attorney is subject in several jurisdictions the question of whether lawful r ecording is per unethical has yet to arise elsewhere the hold of pr ecedent of either persuasion may prove unsure for simple reason there is rational c onsistency between the per rule and its exceptions between the reason why one party consent should be lawful and why it should be unethical they represent two irreconc ilable schools of thought with the outcome of any given case determined by the predilection of the tribunal the prudent lawyer avoids surreptitious recording aware that in similar circumstances others may be allowed
