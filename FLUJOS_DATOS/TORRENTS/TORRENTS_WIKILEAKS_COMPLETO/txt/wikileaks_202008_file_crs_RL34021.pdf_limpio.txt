underdeveloped regions over the years they have held protests demanding greater rights even though the constitution guarantees the righ ts of ethnic and religious minorities in reality the central government emphasizes the persian and shiite nature of the state analysts argue that globalization larg number of organized ethnic groups and political activists in europe and north america and modern communications systems are making significant changes to the internal dynamics of the country5 international media and human rights agen cies and associated organizations outside iran are also helping these issu become known internationally persian dominance persians who constitute 51 of ir ans population dominate the central government of iran persians are from the indoeuropean tribes who settled the iranian plateau and established the anci ent persian empire around 1000 bc experts argue that persians with only slim majority possess distinct sense of superiority over other iranians and regard themselves as true heirs of irans history and tradition and the guardians and perpetrators of its legacies6 under both the monarchy and the islamic republic persians were and remain the bene ficiaries of government economic and social policies geographically the provinces principally settled by persians continue to be the most developed provinces in the country in spite of the affirmative policies adopted in favor of other regions of the country furthermore the state run radio and television broadcas ts are predominantly in persian and only limited amount of programs ar run in minority

not without precedent9 kurds azeris turkmens and baluchis as well as the arabs continue to occasionally demonstrate over perceived injustices with incidents of ethnic unrest their complaints cover economic issu such as insufficient jobs and underdevelopment that led to migration to urban centers and discr imination in getting government jobs these minorities also note inadequate educational facilities for young pe ople few publications in their languages and lack of culturally and linguistically inclusive local programming by state radio and television they refer to poor governmental repres entation and allude to lack of reconciliation over historical grievances the st ate response to these incident s varies depending on their scale sometimes it resorts to means of repression such as arrest but occasionally the central government will dispatch offici als to the region to show interest and attempt to mollify the locals ethnic unrest although ethnic rioting in iran has not been uncommon in the past generally incidents of ethnic unrest seem to have risen steadily since president mahmoud ahmedinejad took office in 2005 analysts ar gue that occasionally individuals and groups have briefly taken up arms only to calm down again for years or decades10 but rarely have so many sn apped back at the government so furiously over so short time for example in the past two years turks have rioted in the northwest baluchis have kidnaped and be headed some government fficials arabs have blown up oil pipelines in the southwest and kurdish guerillas have sniped continually at iranian soldiers in the mountains bordering iraq and turkey for these rash and abrupt outbursts minority groups blame ah medinejads shia pe rsian chauvinism as primary provocation along with the

in response to turkeys february 1999 arrest of abdullah ocalan thenleader of the ku rdistan workers party the governments of turkey and iran fear that the creati on of semiautonomous state in northern

approach the level of turkey still there have been repeated clashes between kurds and ir anian security forces the most recent of which was sparked by the july 2005 shootin g of young kurd some
