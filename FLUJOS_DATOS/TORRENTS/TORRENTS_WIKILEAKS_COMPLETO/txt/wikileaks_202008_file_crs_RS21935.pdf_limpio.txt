domestically and sold by the producer the blet was enacted as part of the black lung benef its revenue act of 1977 pl 95227 but the effective date of the tax april 1 1978 was contingent upon enactment of the trust fund which was enacted under the black lung be nefits reform act pl 95239 on march 1 1978 the black lung disability trust fund was enacted by congress to compensate miners afflicted with pneumoconiosis or black lung di sease this disease is caused by inhaling coal dust for prolonged periods of time usually at least 10 years eventually the disease causes respiratory impairment d eath usually follows within few years thereafter the original blet rates were 50t on for underground mines and 25ton for surface mines each not to exceed 2 of pri ce these rates were temporarily doubled under the black lung benefits revenue ac t of 1981 pl 97119 effective on january 1 1982 the tax rates were schedul ed to revert to their orig inal levels but were insteadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21935crs2 1 26 cfr 4841211extended at higher rates as part of the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 pl 99272 that law raised the blet rates by 10 to 110ton for underground mines and 055ton for surface min subject to 44 of price ceiling these increases becam effective from april 1 1986 and were to last until december 31 1995 the revenue act of 1987 pl 100203 ex tended the termina tion date of the excise taxes to the earlier of january 1 2014 or the first january 1 when the trust fund achieves solvency due to high and rising medi cal costs the trust fund has been in deficit every year since its inception in 1978 in or der to maintain revenues for the black lung disability trust fund the presidents fy2005 budget proposes to repeal the scheduled reduction in tax rates for co sales after december 31 2014 structure of the tax the blet is imposed on the producer and the taxable event is the sale of the coal the statute does not define th producer but irs regulations treat the producer as the person who has the vested ownership interest in the coal immediately after the coal is severed from the ground1 typically the coal producer is the mining company that extracts the coal from the mine but it could also be landowner who contracts the actual mining to an independent contractor or lessee operator who leases the land from landowner from which the coal is mined esse ntially this means that the owner of the coal is liable for the tax rather than the contract miner that is hired to physically extract the coal the producer is liable for the blet immediately after the coal is severed from the ground and sold the taxable event under the ta x law is the sale of the coal by the producer to the first purchaser which occurs when the ownership of the coal passes or transfers from the producer to the buyer legally sale is the transfer of the title to or the substantial incidence of ownership of the coal for consideration of money or moneys worth services or other goods the blet is collected by the producer who must register with the irs file the required tax return form 720 to report th collections and remit the funds to the treasury returns are genera lly filed quarterly but more frequent filing may be required if the producer fails to make the required deposits on timely basis deposits are generally made twice month nd reported by the producer using federal tax deposit form form 8109 unless deposits are made electronically the blet statute is subsumed in chapte r 32 of the tax code along with other manufacturer excise taxes such as the ga sguzzler tax the ta xes on petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel fuel and the exci tax on vaccines as such the statutes and rules that apply to other manufacturers excise taxes for example regarding the procedures for refunds and credits of tax overpayments which w ill be discussed below also generally apply to the blet for pur poses of these taxes the manufacturer and producer are one and the samehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21935crs3 2 the free on board fob price of coal is the price of coal at the mine excluding transportation or shipping and insurance cost s the fob price could include the cost of cleaning the coal removing noncombustible material s such as rock ash and other refuse if the cleaning occurs before the first sale ie if the first purchaser is buying clean coal 3 spot coal prices recently approached 60ton s ee steven d jones coal is red hot but for how long wall street journal july 20 2004 4 louisiana and montana also produce small quantities of lignite see crs report rl31819 us coal primer on the major issues coordinated by marc humphriesrates of tax the blet rate is 110 per ton of coal produced from underground mines and 055 per ton of coal produced from surface mines subject to maximum tax rate of 44 of the coals sales price free on board 2 therefore coal will be taxed at the 44 rate if the selling price is less than 25ton for underground mines and 1250ton for surface mines for example when average selling pri ces were 17ton for deep coal the tax was 0748 ton rather than 110 with current co prices well above 25ton the blet rate on deep coal is limited to 110ton3 tax deductibility the blet is cost of doing business for th coal producers and as such is deductible against the income tax tax deductibility reduces the income tax otherwise payable which reduces the net cost of the excise tax to the producer as follows if t is the blet rate and ty is the marginal corporate income tax rate then the aftertax cost to the coal producer would be t 1 ty to illustrate for underground mines the gross blet is 110ton but for corporate coal producer taxed at the 35 cor porate tax rate the aftertax cost is 072ton 65 of 110 for surface mine the comparab aftertax cost is 65 of 055ton or 036ton the three exemptions the blet is imposed on the sale of all domestic coal with three exceptions lignite lignite is statutorily exempt under subs ection c of irc 4121 lignite also known as brown coal is lowgrade coal of va riety intermediate between peat and bituminous coal it has high moisture and volatile matter content and high ash content it is low btu coal and is used almost exclusively by the electric utility industry it is produced primarily in two states texas 65 of production and north dakota 35 of production4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21935crs4 5 irs notice 200028 20001 cb 1116 6 ranger fuel 33 f supp 2d at 468 7 many of the exemptions that apply to other ma nufacturers taxes such as sales to state and local government or nonprofit educational institu tions or on sales of the product used as feedstock also do not apply to coalimported coal the blet is also not imposed on coal im ports this exemption is implied by irc 4121 subsection a1 which states that the tax is imposed on coal mined in the united states coal imports which are negligible fraction of domestic production 2 come mostly from colombia and venezuela exported coal finally on may 20 2000 the irs officially stopped collecting the blet on exported coal ie domestically produced coal sold and destined for export5 irs treats coal as being destined for export if it is in the stream of export when it is sold by the producer and the coal is actually exported coal is defined as being in the stream of export if the sale is but one of the steps i nvolved in the exportation process to its ultimate destination to foreign purchaser the exemption for exported coal is not statutory exemption it was established in 1998 federal district court ruling ranger fuel that found the tax on exports to be unconstitutional6 unlike most manufacturer excise taxes which explicitly exempt export sales from federal ta xation the blet statute ie irc 4121 has never specifically exempted exported coal from tax further other sections of the tax code concerning manufacturers excise taxes in chapter 32 whic h apply equally to the coal tax authorized at least before the tax was ruled uncons titutional in 1998 the imposition of the tax on coal exports according to irc 4221 tax shall be imposed under this chapter other than 4121 on the sale of an article for export or for resale by the purchaser to second purchaser for export thus this provision does not apply to the blet 4121 which is part of chapter 32 of the tax code7 the export clause of the us constitution rticle i 9 clause 5 states however that tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state in 1998 group of coal producers cum exporters successfully argued that the blet imposed on exported coal violated the export clause in that case ranger fuel us district court agreed that the excise tax on exported coal was unconstitutional the irs acquiesced to the ranger fuel decision in notice 200028 which was issued on may 20 2000httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21935crs5 8 presumably coal not originally destined for export but eventually exported would be taxed up front and taxpayers would not be able to claim refund or tax credit since the coal was not destined for export 9 the plaintiffs for ranger filed their case in 1998 but it was not officially known whether the irs would appeal the decision to the suprem court until the irs promulgated notice 200028 on may 20 2000 thus in the intervening time it is possible that some coal companies continued to collect the blet and remit the monies to the treasury 10 in reality the estimate could be somewhat higher if producers paid taxes during 1999 and 2000 which the aggregate receipts data in table 1 show this is possible because producers were unsure whether the irs would appeal the ranger decision to the supreme court as noted it was not until irs decision 200028 on may 28 2000 that the irs made it official that it would not appeal the decision although there is inform ation that it stopped collecting the tax sometime after 1998 but before the 200028 decision credits and refunds the ranger fuel decision established that 1 afte r 1998 all coal sales destined for export would be tax exempt up front and 2 all blet imposed on exports which were inappropriately or unconstitutionally collected constituted overpayments and would have to be refunded by the irs if valid and timely claim was made8 the unconstitutionally collected excise ta xes covered all those amounts collected from the inception of the blet and up to the 1998 ruling but also included any taxes collected up to the time the irs issued notice 200028 which was may 20 20009 however under the general excise tax statutes refund claim is timely if made within three years from the time the tax return repor ting the liability form 720 is filed or two years from the time the tax monies are actually paid whichever is later assuming coal producers stopped paying the blet in 1998 and with the threeyear statute of limitations on coal producers could claim refund of taxes paid from 1995 to 1998 producers making claim in 1998 could reach back to taxes pa id in 1995 similarly producers that paid taxes in 1999 would have had until 2002 to file claim for refund table 1 shows the estimated amount of blet collected on coal exports from the taxs inception to its being ruled unconstitu tional in december 1998 column 5 column 2 shows annual total blet re venues collected columns 3 and 4 show the total amount of coal exports and the estimated average effective tax rates average effective tax rates are calculated by dividing to tal revenues by tota l taxable production the product of the estimated average effective tax rate column 4 and the magnitude of coal exports from 1978 to 1998 column 3 yields the estimated co export tax revenues in column 5 note that the estimated total tax burden on coal exports through 1999 what the irs collected is 130522 million but owing to the time limitations on the cla iming of tax refunds or credits the maximum amount of the poten tial refunds is estima ted at approximately 270 million assuming the irs stopped collecting the tax in 199810 the 970 million in taxes collected prior to 1995 which cannot be refunded because of the threeyear statute of limitations represents the amount of inappropriately or unconstitutionally collected blet httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21935crs6 table 1 estimated potential refund claims
