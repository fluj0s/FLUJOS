administrative action and congressional legislation on section 301 section 301 its operation section 301 is one of the principal means by which the united states attempts to combat unfair trading practices and enforce us rights under trade agreements1 congress created this provision in part to give the president authority to respond to restrictive foreign trade barriers in the hope that the removal of such barriers would boost us exports the section 301 provisions cover wide variety of practices and set procedures and timetables based on the type of trade barriers addressed broadly speaking section 301 divides such practices into two major categories 1 violations of us rights under trade agreement2 and 2 unreasonable or discriminatory practices that burden or restrict us commercehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98454crs2 3 special 301 was added by section 1303 of the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 pl 100418 ipr provisions such as patents copyrights and trademarks give legal protection to various intangible assets resulting from research innovation creativity and commercial reputation such assets cannot be copied used changed or sold without the authorization of its owner 4 the uruguay round agreements established new guidelines for the protec tion of ipr as result the special 301 statute was amended in the uruguay round implementing legislation pl 103465 to exempt ipr issue s covered under the wto from the timetables under special 301 to allow the ustr to proceed under the wto dispute resolution process and timetablessection 301 cases can be initiated as result of petition filed by an interested party such as us firm or industry group with the united states trade representative ustr or can be selfinitiated by the ustr if the ustr decides to start section 301 investigation it must seek to negotiate settlement with the foreign country concerned either in the form of compensation or an elimination of that barrier or practice for cases involving an area covered under trade agreement such as the wto trade agreements the ustr is required to use the formal dispute proceedings provided by that agreement if settlement cannot be reached within specified period 12 to 18 months for most cases except for intellectual property rights see below the ustr is required to determine whether or not to retaliate such retaliation usually takes the form of 100 tariffs on selected imported products from the offending country the level of which is generally intended to equal us trade losses resulting from the trade barrier there have been 119 cases initiated under section 301 since its enactment in 1974 most cases have been resolved through trade agreements 15 cases have resulted in trade sanctions special 301 section 182 of the 1974 trade act as amended commonly referred to as special 301 is the primary us trade law used to protect us intellectual property rights ipr in foreign markets3 it directs the ustr to identify countries that deny adequate protection of ipr or restrict iprrelated products and to initiate section 301 procedures against countries whose practices are considered to be the most serious or harmful priority foreign countries if an agreement is not reached between six months and nine months the ustr must determine if trade sanctions should be imposed4 since the start of the special 301 provision in 1989 the ustr has annually issued threetier list of countries which are judged to have inadequate regimes for ipr protection or to deny market access 1 priority foreign countries which are considered to be the worst violators of us ipr and are subject to section 301 investigations and possible us trade sanctions 2 priority watch list countries which are considered to have serious deficiencies in their ipr regime but do not currently warrant section 301 investigation and 3 watch list countries which have been identified because they maintain ipr practices or market barriers that are of particular concern but do not yet warrant higher level designations in addition the ustr has made outofcycle decisions throughout the year concerning the ipr regimes ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98454crs3 5 china in particular has been the subject of several special 301 actions in recent years it was designated as special 301 priority foreign country in 1991 1994 and 1996 under the threat of us sanctions china agreed to improve its ipr laws and enforcement efforts 6 in june 2000 the ustr stated that ukraine had made progress in improving its ipr regime and indicated that decision on ukraines status under special 301 would be put off until november 7 originally enacted under section 1302 of the 1988 trade act pl 100418 8 congress added the super 301 provision mainly becaus many members felt that the regular section 301 mechanism was sparingly used by the executive branch and generally constituted piecemeal approach to addressing foreig n trade barriers congress wanted the president to take action against countries that mainta ined the most pervasive and restrictive trade barriers and to address all at once wide array of trade barriers that impeded certain us exports 9 brazil was cited for quantitative import restrictions it subsequently lowered certain import license barriers resolving the case india was cited in 1989 and 1990 for restrictions on insurance and investment it refused to lower its barriers but the ustr chose not to retaliate 10 super 301 designations were to be made six months by september 30 after the ustr issued continuedparticular countries including the designation of countries as priority foreign countries and the imposition of trade sanctions for ipr violations5 in its latest special 301 annual review issued on may 1 2000 the ustr identified 59 trading partners whose ipr protecti on practices raised us concern countries were designated as priority foreign country but the ustr warned that the ukraine risked such designation by august 20006 additionally the ustr announced it would initiate iprrelated wto dispute resolution consultations with argentina and brazil and warned it would proceed to wto dispute resolution case against denmark super 301 section 310 of the 1974 trade act as amended is commonly referred to as super 3017 as enacted super 301 required the ustr for 1989 and 1990 to issue report on its trade priorities and to identify priority foreign countries that practiced unfair trade and priority practices that had the greatest effect on restricting us exports the ustr would then initiate section 301 investigation against the priority countries to obtain elimination of the practices which impeded us exports in the expectation that doing so would substantially expand us exports8 japan was the main target of super 301 during its initial twoyear operation although brazil and india were designated as super 301 priority countries in 1989 and india again in 19909 the united states reached separate trade agreements with japan in 1990 on trade barriers to satellites supercomputers and wood products the original super 301 provision expired in 1990 however following breakdown in talks between the united states and japan in february 1994 over new framework for addressing japanese trade barriers president clinton issued an executive order eo 12901 reactivating the super 301 mechanism the eo reinstated the super 301 process for two years 1994 and 1995 but made certain changes10 the super 301 process washttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98454crs4 10 continued its report on foreign trade barriers usually by march 30 rather than after 30 days following the issuance of the report as under the previous law the eo also directed the ustr to identify priority foreign country practices under super 301 as opposed to priority practices in priority foreign countries under prior law this was done to avoid labeling count ries as unfair traders 11 in october 1998 the united states and south korea reached an agreement on autos 12 under the wtos predecessor the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt dispute settlement panels and reports could be delayed or blocked by any one country and the gatt had authority to enforce its decisions the united states often claimed that it had to rely on section 301 until the gatt developed more effective trade dispute mechanismextended again through 1997 by eo 12973 issued in september 1995 but was not in operation during 1998 from 19941997 the ustr throu gh its annual trade expansion priorities or super 301 reports took the following actions in both 1994 and 1995 priority foreign country practices were identified in 1996 priority foreign country practices were identified however four new section 301 cases were initiated against indonesias national auto policy brazils auto program australias leather export subsidies and argentinas import duties on textiles and apparel all four cases were brought to the wto for dispute settlement in 1997 the ustr designated south koreas barriers to auto imports as priority foreign country practice under super 30111 in addition the ustr announced that it would pursue wto dispute settlement procedures in the context of section 301 investigations against japanese trade barriers to fruit canadian export subsidies and import quotas on dairy products and the eus circumvention of export subsidy commitments on dairy products the ustr also said it would invoke wto dispute settlement procedures against australias export subsidies on automotive leather on march 31 1999 super 301 was reinstated and revised by eo 13116 it requires the ustr by april 30 to issue its super 301 report on priority foreign trade practices and to initiate section 301 case against such practices if an agreement is not reached after 90 days the ustrs april 1999 super 301 report did not identify any trade practices under super 301 however the ustr announced it would initiate wto dispute resolution proceedings against the eu aviation equipment subsidies indias auto policy and south korea import barriers on beef in addition the ustr announced that it would initiate section 301 case against canadas restrictions on tourism the ustrs may 2000 super 301 report again did not make any designations under super 301 however the ustr announced that it would pursue wto dispute settlement cases against india the philippines brazil and romania section 301 and wto trade dispute resolution central goal of us officials during the uruguay round ur negotiations 19861994 was to strengthen multilateral trade dispute mechanisms12 the ur agreements included several provisions to strengthen dispute resolution procedures by providing stricter timetables for trade dispute panel decisions establishing mechanisms to prevent blocking of panel decisions by affected countries and broadening the ability of nations to retaliate against countries that fail to abide by wto dispute settlement decisions httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98454crs5 13 gao world trade organization issues in dispute settlement august 2000the ur agreements expanded the level and types of trade in goods and services which are now covered under multilateral rules and included new rules for traderelated investment and intellectual property rights us trade law requires that section 301 investigations involving trade agreements be brought to formal dispute proceedings provided for by the trade agreements thus many cases initiated under section 301 have been brought before the wto for dispute resolution if initial consultations failed to resolve the issue in some cases the ustr has brought disputes directly to the wto without initiating formal section 301 case the united states has been one of the heaviest users of the wto dispute resolution process established in january 1995 which it has used to successfully resolve several trade disputes an august 2000 general accounting office gao report stated overall the results of the wtos dispute settlement process have been positive for the united states13 on the other hand the united states has been one of the largest targets of wto dispute resolution cases brought by other wto members some us policymakers have expressed concern that the wto diminishes the ability of the united states to utilize section 301 to eliminate trade barriers and hence undermines us sovereignty several points regarding the use of section 301 and the wto are worth examining section 301 provisions require the united states to bring section 301 cases involving trade agreements to the dispute settlement procedures established under those agreements thus us membership in the wto does not diminish or restrict the ability of the united states to initiate section 301 cases but technically requires it to submit cases involvin g wto trade agreements to the wto for dispute settlement if wto dispute resolution panel rules in favor of the united states the offending country could be directed to remove the trade barrier in question or provide compensation to the united states if that country refuses to abide by the wto ruling the united states could seek to obtain authorization from the wto to impose sanctions under section 301 cases initiated under section 301 are brought to the wto for dispute resolution if the country in question is member of the wto and if the trade practice is covered under multilateral rules or the practice nullifies or impairs benefit accruing under wto agreement section 301 sanctions can be applied to nonwto members without having to go through wto dispute resolution proceedings technic ally the united states could impose trade sanctions under section 301 even if it lost case brought before the wto dispute resolution process however if the united states imposed such sanctions against wto member that country could bring complaint before the wto which might rule against the united states and authorize that country to impose sanctions against the united states the wto has real authority to force any nation including the united states to abide by wto dispute resolution rulings andor to change its lawshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98454crs6 14 some analysts argue that if wto members fail to abide by wto dispute panel decisions or begin to take unauthorized action to resolve trade disputes the ability of the wto to resolve trade disputes could be diminished which could lead to greater conflict among wto members over trade and undermine international support for multilateral trade rules 15 see international trade reporter november 4 1998 p 1840 16 similar case arose in 1998 when the canadian government proposed to pass new law restricting the sale of advertising in canada by foreign magazine publishers provision the united states argued violated two previous wto dispute rulings on similar restrictions which had found such policies violated wto trade rules subsequently canada and the united states reached an agreement on the issue in may 1999 17 on april 6 1999 the wto authorized the united states to impose 191million in trade sanctions 100 ad valorem duties on eu products due to its restrictive banana import regime on april 91999 the ustr issued list of products that would be subject to us sanctions on july 12 1999 the wto determined that eus beef hormone restrictions cost us exporters 117 million annually and authorized the united states to impose trade sanctions as result the ustr issued list of eu products subject to beginning on july 29 1999 for further information on these disputes see crs reports rs20130 bananas and rs20142 meat hormones both by charles hanrahan 18 previously the eu the challenged the us use of section 301 procedures as being inconsistent with wto rules however wto dispute resolution panel ruled in favor of the united stateshowever in joining the wto the united states like other wto members has agreed to abide by the obligations in the various trade agreements and follow the wto dispute resolution procedures if the united states chooses to ignore rulings under the wto it could run the risk that other countries would refuse to abide by wto rulings that are favorable to us trade interests14 while many us policymakers have praised the overall operations of the wtos dispute settlement mechanism arguing that it has been effective in resolving several trade disputes with us trading partners some have criticized certain aspects of the process for example one analyst estimates that wto dispute resolution cases on average take nearly 3 years to complete and that over half of all cases filed since 1995 are still pending15 in addition us officials have expressed concern over the implementation of wto dispute settlement rulings on two cases brought by the united states against the eu concerning its banana import regime and ban on hormonetreated meat imports in both instances wto dispute panel ruled in favor of the united states and those decisions were basically affirmed by the wto appellate body16 however the united states has charged that the eu has failed to fully abide by the wto dispute panel rulings on meat hormones and bananas17 congressional concern over the eus noncompliance with wto dispute resolution rulings led it to add provision sec 407 to the trade and development act of 2000 pl 106200 authorizi ng the ustr to periodically revise the list of products subject to retaliation in cases where the united states has won trade dispute case in the wto and has been authorized to impose sanctions against another wto member that refuses to remove the barrier the eu has threatened to pursue wto dispute resolution case against the united states if it employs this provision18 it is likely that us trade officials will press for reform s in the wto that quicken the dispute resolu tion process and ensure prompt and effective compliance with wto dispute settlement rulings
