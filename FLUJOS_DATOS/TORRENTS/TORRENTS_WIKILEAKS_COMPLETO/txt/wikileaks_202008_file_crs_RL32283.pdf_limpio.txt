card programprogram design covered discount card drugs covered discount card drugs are defined as virtually all recognized prescription dr ugs however an individual plan does not have to include all drugs on its formular see below and not all formulary drugs have to be discounted individuals will select card program based on which program will offer the discounted drugs they expect to use specifically covered discount card drugs are defined in the law as prescription drugs and biologicals covered under medicaid vaccines licensed under section 351 of the public health service act and insulin necessary supplies associated with the injection of insulin are also included syringes needles alc ohol swabs and gauze meet the definition while test strips or lancets do not the definition of covered di scount drugs includes drugs when they are used for medically accepted indication in general this means the use is approved under the federal food drug and cosmetic act or the use of which is supported by one or more recognized compendia specifically excluded from the definiti on of covered discount card drugs are drugs excluded under medicaid except for smoking cessation thus the following categories are specifically excluded 1 agents when used for anorexia weight loss or weight gain 2 agents when used to promote fertility 3 agents when used for cosmetic purposes or hair growth 4 agents when used for the symptomatic relief of coughs and colds 5 prescription v itamins and mineral products except prenatal vitamins and fluoride prepara tions 6 nonprescription drugs5 7 outpatient prescription drugs for which the manufacturer seeks to require associated tests or monitoring services be purchased exclusively from the manufacturer or its designee as condition of sale 8 barbiturates and 9 benzodiazepines central nervous system depressants additionally drugs which would otherw ise be covered under the card program are not covered if they can be covere d under medicare part in connection with covered inpatient services or under part b which provides coverage for limited categories of outpatient pres cription drugs including drugs which cannot be self administered immunosuppressi ve drugs under certain circumstances and some oncology drugs formularies endorsed card programs may us formularies for purposes of the card program formulary is defined as the list of specific drugs from among covered discount card drugs for which an endorsed sponsor offe rs negotiated prices to medicare beneficiaries enrolled in its card program cms expects that allowing sponsor s to use formularies will result in deeper discounts for card enrollees and enhanced use of generic drugs in the interim final regulation cms stated that it wanted sponsors when constructing their fo rmularies to include at minimum the types of drugs commonly needed by benefi ciaries both aged and disabled it developed list of therapeutic classes nd subclasses for medica tions frequently usedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32283crs7 by medicare beneficiaries at minimum card programs will be required to offer negotiated price for at least one drug in each of the 209 categories identified in the list drug can be used only once to sa tisfy this requirement further sponsors must provide at least one generic drug for negotiated price in at least 55 of the required categories cms indicated that there are several ke issues applicants should consider in developing their formularies these are 1 evaluation of whether some drugs not widely recommended for use in the elderly but appropriate in i ndividual cases should be included in the formulary 2 importa nce of assuring discounted prices are available to special populations for the sp ecific medication combinations they require for example for those persons who are hiv positive or those with mental illness and 3 ensuring that there are appropriate selections and dosage forms within each class or subclass for example l ongacting versus short acting pricing negotiated prices price concessions card sponsors are required to provide benefi ciaries access to negotiated prices as condition of endorsement sponsors must obt ain discounts rebates s ubsidies or other price concessions on at least some covered discount card drugs any such price concessions obtained by endorsed spons ors are to be taken into account in determining negotiated prices the interim final regulation requires that share of such price concessions should be passed along in the form of wer prices it does not specify what should constitute share the preamble to the regulation states that cms would not set minimum quantitative requirement either for the level of price concessions endorsed sponsors must obtain or the share of such concessions that must be passed along to card enrollees rather cms states that it will allow endorsed s ponsors to determine this in light of their understanding of consumer preferences and the impact of market forces on their business model cms further notes that pbms frequently obtain and pass through substantial re bates for their commercial populations cms states that establishing minimum level for price concessions could potentially undercut market competition b ecause manufacturers might tend to set their prices around the minimum level it states that the cms price comparison website will enable beneficiaries to compare maximum negotiated prices for drugs under different endorsed progra ms see discussion below price variation it is expected that the level of discounts offered to card enrollees will vary across the spectrum of drugs offered cms is also allowing sponsors to vary prices and formularies by enrollee characteris tics for example lower prices could be offered to transitional eligible enrollees or enrollees with particular disease updates cms will allow pricing changes to be made its fact sheet on the program states that changes can be made on weekly basis

already have access to drug discounts either through their health insurance or through an existing card program further transitional assistance is not available for persons who have othe r drug coverage in december 2003 cms estimated that 154 llion beneficiaries slightly over one third of the total would be both eligible for and could benefit from the discount card program it estimate d that 73 million persons would enroll in an ndorsed card program in 2004 and 74 million would enroll in 2005 of these it estimated that 47 million persons each year will be elig ible for transitional assistance beneficiary savings attributable to lower negotiated prices were estimated to range from 14 to 18 billion in 2004 and 20 to 27 billion in 200511 this estimate was based on two main assumptions first the program would result in average drug savings of 1015 over cost s that would be incurred in the absence of the card program12 second the effects of benefici ary education would lead to greater use of generic drugs and more effective management of expenses estimated beneficiary savings attributable to tr ansitional assistance were 24 billion in 2004 and 26 billion in 2005 the savings estimates did not reflect the annual enrollment fees which can range up to 30 per year factoring in the enrollment fees could reduce estimated beneficiary savings by up to 80 million each year medicare program costs for persons eligible for transitional assistance are funded through general revenues which are cred ited to separate account in the medicare part b trust fund payments are made from this account cms estimated that medicare program spending would increase by 25 billion in cy2004 27 billion in cy2005 and 01 billion in cy2006 for those costs incurred during an individuals transition period the vast majority of these costs we re associated with transitional assistancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32283crs13 24 billion in 2004 26 billion in cy2005 and 01 b illion in 2006 with the remaining costs attributable to payment of enrollment fees for this population group in addition cms administrative expens would total an estimated 134 million costs for sponsors card sponsors incur number of costs in setting up their programs these include activities related to program implementation information and outreach eligibility determination and enrollment processing customer service operations claims processing and claims adjudicati on account maintenance and logging and responding to grievances costs vary by sponsor though all must have had experience in running large programs cm s estimated that sponsors with low costs would be able to recover their costs through enrollment fees in both 2004 and 2005 and would have sufficient revenue stream to carry them through the transition period for those with the highest costs enrollment revenues would not exceed such costs until 2005 though they might be ab to cover any sses through rebate revenues they would however have re venues greater than costs over the entire period current status approved card sponsors were able to be gin enrolling beneficiaries in may 2004 they could begin offering enrollees acce ss to

plans this means that as of june 2004 34 national plans were available further it noted that the num ber of options was actually fewer than 34 when looked at in terms of actual variations in programs drug prices enrollment fees and pharmacy access this was attributed to the fact that many card programs are either offered by the same sponsor or work through the same pbm or tpa however the fact that

card raises number of issues some are unique to the card program itself while others have implications for the medicare drug benefit which will be put in place in 2006 beneficiary enrollment and selection of plan in general as noted beneficiaries are expected to make selection from endorsed drug card programs available in their area an exception applies for ma plan enrollees who will get their card through the ma plan if the plan offers an exclusive card program many persons have suggested that the enrollment figures are less than anticipated while others c ontend that the numbers are

benefit that will be implemented in 2006program under the card program benefici aries are not penalized if they delay enrollment however there is concern th at many lowincome persons who should be taking advantage of the 600 subsidy ve failed to sign up as noted above special effort is currently being made to contact and enroll this population group beneficiaries not enrolled with ma or ganizations can choose between large number of card programs information on thes programs is available on the internet some people have suggested that beneficiar ies have in fact had too many choices many particularly older nd frailer beneficiaries are not comfortable using the internet reportedly both be neficiaries and persons assi sting them have had trouble navigating the website and are confused by the large number of choices available to them cms has responded by making impr ovements to the website including the listing of the best five for an individua l in an area however some observers continue to suggest that the site is not user friendly autoenrollment lowincome populations are ty pically hard to reach for example enrollment in medicare savings programs ie qmb slimb and qi1 has traditionally been below desired levels some persons suggest that enrollment figures for the 600 subsidy could be increas ed through autoenrollment of selected populations while auto enrollment of these groups could potentially increase enrollment in the transitional assistance program it would still fail to identify persons who have not established their potential eligibility through another program medicare savings programs lowincome persons enrolled in medicare savings programs are potentially eligible for transitional assistance since by definition they meet the income criteria number of persons have stated that cms should automatically enroll them in the card program cms has been reluctant to do this for several reasons it notes that some persons enrolled in medicare savings programs may in fact have health insu rance for drugs which would make them ineligible for transitional assistance there are also questions about how beneficiaries could exercise choice among the card programs however the biggest concern is that the law requires beneficiaries to submit an enrollment form certifying they do not have other drug coverage many states do not have representative authority to make the certification on behalf of medicare savings programs enrollees the access to benefits coalition recently commissioned legal analysis on the autoenrollment issue by hogan and hartson16 the analysis concluded that the law gives the secretary authority to use alternatives to the standard enrollment form to enroll and certify persons for the 600 subsidy this issue is expected to be of continuing interest as persons look for dditional ways to increase the enrollment of lowincome persons17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32283crs17 18 kimberly fox testimony for public hearing of th state pharmaceutical assistance transition commission and supplemental tables rutgers center for state health policy july 7 2004state pharmacy assistance programs spaps number of states operate statefunded pharmacy assistance programs for lowincome individuals each state establishes its own eligibility criteria it is estimated that approximately half of the enrollees would meet the elig ibility cr iteria for transitional assistance the remaining enrollees generally have incomes above 135 of poverty which is the cutoff for transitional assistance as of june 2004 seven states provided for automatic enrollment for their spap enrollees who meet the eligibility criteria for transitional assistance these states use authorized representative authority to auto enroll six of the states massachusetts maine minnesota new jersey new york and pennsylvania automatically enrolled persons with preferred card sponsor conn ecticut chose to imp lement the program with several cards review of auto enrollment found that it proved to be an effective strategy18 formularies key factor influencing beneficiarys choice of card is presumably the drugs that are available on the plans formulary as noted each plan is required to offer discount on at least one drug in each of 209 identified therapeutic categories single drug can not be used to satisfy the requi rement for more than one category cms established these groupings in order to promote timely implementation of the temporary program and to provide access to discounts on drugs used most often by beneficiaries at this point it is difficult to assess the degree of variation in formularies that are offered by different programs benefi ciaries using the website can tell which card programs in their area cover the drugs they use on regular basis however available data and marketing materials do not provide useful mechanism for extensive comparisons beneficiaries who need costly drugs need to review available offerings carefully since not all plans may cover ll of their drugs some obser vers have noted that plans are permitted to change formularies throug hout the year even though beneficiaries are locked into their choice for the remainder of the calendar year however other observers have suggested that most plans are unlikely to make significant changes in part because they do not wish to antagonize their enrollees beneficiaries can elect to use drug off the formulary but they will not be able to take advantage of any negotiated price fo r the drug however if beneficiary is entitled to transitional assistance payment may be made for drug even if it is off the formularyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32283crs18 19 for example an analysis prepared by the minority staff of the house committee on government relations in apr 2004 prior to the implementation of the program found that prices expected to be available under the card program were higher than those that could be obtained in canada or through the veterans administration and were lower than prices that could be obtained without the card similarly consumers reports item in its aug 2004 issue stated that its review of posted prices for five drugs in five cities in midmay 2004 found that the prices under the card progra ms were higher than those available from drugstorecom and costcocom it should be noted that some early pricing information on the website was inaccurate additionally some plans lowered their initial price levelsprice negotiation related issue is the price that is negotiated for the drugs some observers are concerned that while card sponsors can change both formularies and negotiated prices after beneficiary rolls in sponsors program beneficiaries are essentially locked into their choice for the remainder of the calendar year some have suggested that plans will raise their prices however preliminary review of selected drugs and selected card programs showed that ove rall prices remained relatively stable over the initial weeks of the program another concern is the price informatio n that is published when cms first posted price information on the website there were reportedly number of inaccuracies this was attributed to the short turn around time to post the information and the submission of incomp lete andor incorrect information by sponsors many of the early problems have been corrected measuring negotiated discounts virtually all observers agree that the 600 subsidy provides meaningful benefit to enrollees with incomes under 135 of poverty there has been less of consensus with regard to the value of card for other enrollees several observers have suggested that beneficiaries can obtain similar savings through other card programs19 comparative analysis is made difficult by the fact that pdap price information is only accessible by plan and zip code in the early weeks of the program cms was estimating savings in the range of 1015 more recently two studies have attempted to further quantify the savings health policy alternatives hpa analysis the hpa analysis cited above was issued july 2004 the study fo cused on prices available to persons not eligible for the subsidy it tracked drug prices for threeday supply for set of 10 drugs commonly prescribed for medicare beneficiaries and seven discount card programs the programs picked were ones that offered discounts on all selected drugs at pharmacies in an urban and rura l location in maryland the prices were compared to those reported by the maryland attorney generals ags office which tracks retail prices paid by cash customers for selected drugshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32283crs19 20 they do not however factor in the saving s attributable to manufacturer assistance programs offered to lowincome beneficiaries who have exhausted their 600 subsidy during the yearthe hpa analysis showed that all seve n card programs had prices that were significantly less than those reported by the maryland attorney general for the basket of 10 drugs it found that urban pr ices were 19 to 24 lower than the aggregate of the median ag reported prices rural prices were 1722 lower than the ag prices and mail order prices were 2732 lower than the ag prices for urban areas all six of the seven card programs offe ring mail order had prices for 90day supply for the basket of 10 drugs lower than costcocom drugstorecom was competitive with the card mail order programs the aggregate price on drugstorecom for the 10 drugs was 5 higher than the lowest priced card but 2 less than the highest priced card the hpa analysis also concluded that choice of card mattered with considerable differences recorded betw een savings achieved from cards with the lowest and highest retail prices even gr eater differences were recorded when mail order prices were compared lewin group analysis on august 13 2004 the lewin group issued its analysis of potential drug card savings its study commissioned by the healthcare leadership council used three different approaches to measure savings available during june and july 2004 the first appr oach compared discount card prices to average retail prices in each state for the 150 most commonly prescribed drugs this comparison would be most useful for pers ons using small number of drugs the second approach compared prices on cardby card basis for market basket of the 25 drugs prescribed most frequently for benefi ciaries this analysis would be useful for persons taking number of drugs the third approach looked at typical drug regimens used to treat selected chronic conditions in all cases comparisons were based on 30day supply of the most common form and strength of each drug only discounts available at retail pharmacies were used they were compared to retail prices which would be paid by persons without other access to discounted prices savings would be less for persons with access to other discount cards or enrolled in state pharmaceutical assistance program it should be noted that the savings estimates factor in the value of the 600 subsidy20 the following are some of the key findings form the survey when looking at the top 150 drugs the best available prices for brand name drugs represented av erage savings per prescription of 1268 186 the best available prices for generic drugs represented average savings per prescription of 468 675 available discounts vary by sponsor therefore the card beneficiary picks has significant effect on overall savings all of the cards in the top quartile provide d savings of at least 199 on the 25 drugs included in the market ba sket median card savings were 172 or 848 per prescriptionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32283crs20 21 these estimates assume beneficiaries with higher drug costs are more likely to enroll as are those eligible for the creditsavings for beneficiaries using typical drug regimen for diabetes ranged from 13 to 26 while those for typical hypertension regimen average 28 the best available price offered for single drug under the card program seldom varied across mark ets thus while card sponsors offer uniform pricing nationwide the savings from the cards vary geographically and by pharmacy due to variations in retail prices the best available prices can generally be obtained at multiple pharmacies in an area the report also estimated national savings based on these findings the savings estimates are based on several assumptions first it assumes that enrollment will reach the cms estimate by january 1 2005 namely that 73 million will enroll and 61 of enrollees 45 million will be elig ible for the subsidy second the report assumes that beneficiarie s will choose discount card averaging savings of 199 the 75th percentile of the market basket test the savings for all beneficiaries over 18 months would average 1247 355 of dian retail spending of 3514 this estimate includes the 600 subsidy value sa vings for beneficiaries eligible for the subsidy would average 1548 473 of dian retail spending of 3270 for this group while those for persons above 135 of poverty would average 775 199 of median retail spending for this group of 389521 overall the report estimate d that savings would total 77 billion if enrollment reaches 73 million by january 1 2005 and be neficiaries select cards in the 75th percentile with average sa vings of 199 of the 77 billion total savings 43 billion 56 is attributable to discount ed prices and 34 billion to the subsidy 44 taking into account both discount ed prices and the subsidy 59 billion of the total 77 billion are estimated to accr ue to lowincome beneficiaries price changes over time both the hpa and lewin analyses compared drug prices available through the cards with retail prices available on the same date to persons not covered under an endorsed discount card or elig ible for discounts through another source such as privat insurance or none ndorsed disc ount card program one question that has not been answered by the recent analyses is to what extent prices were raised prior to the start of the card program if there were sharp increase in prices prior to the progra ms introduction the value of the discounts would be somewhat undercut pricing information in eff ect prior to implementation of the card program is proprietary so precise comparisons are not available however some reviews suggest that recent increases may be considerable an aarp report on the first quarter of 2004 s howed that manufacturers increases to wholesalers for widely used brand name drugs rose faster

increase of 43 times the ra of inflation between january 2003 and january 2004 in the threeyear period from january 2001january 2004 the average increase was 36 times the rate of inflation 23 pharmacy access as noted earlier card sponsors are require d to contract with sufficient number of pharmacies other than mail order to ensure that beneficiaries have sufficient access to retail pharmacies number of card sponsors have made network pharmacy information available to potential enrollees through the pdap website other sponsors will make pharmacy information available on request questions have been raised regarding the accuracy of network pharmacy information one review found that so card sponsors were using passive acceptance agreements to identify participating pharmacies unless pharmacy specifically told s ponsor it w ould not be participating the sponsor listed it as participant in certain cases pharmacies that had intention of participating or in certain cases were longer in business at the stated address were listed as participants on the pdap24 it is not clear how widespread this problem may be transition to permanent drug benefit as noted the medicare endorsed drug card program is temporary and will be replaced by permanent drug be nefit under medicare part d in 200625 eligibility there are several differences between the eligibility requirements and determination procedures applicable for transitional assistance under the drug card program and the require ments and procedures applicable for lowincome subsides under the new medicare drug benefit this could lead to potential confusion for beneficiaries cms adopted streamlined procedures fo r the card program both because of the short lead time for the program and the fact that it is temporary for the drug card individuals attest that their income falls below the threshold and cms verifies the eligibility under the permanent program states will make eligibility determinations using procedures currently in place for medicaidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32283crs22 another difference involves ssets tests there are assets tests for the 600 subsidy under the drug card while there are assets tests for lowincome subsidies under the medicare drug benefit it is therefore possible that some persons will qualify for lowincome assistance unde r the card program but not under the permanent drug benefit plan choices under the part d benefit each medicare beneficiary will be entitled to obtain qualified prescription drug coverage through enrollment in prescription drug plan pdp or in the case of ma enrollee through enrollment in mapdp plan cms received large number of appli cations from entities wishing to become drug card sponsors it unclear how ma ny of these entities will actually submit applications to become pdp plans many may view participati on in the card program as an opportunity to position themselves in the market and make themselves known to beneficiaries prior to the roll out of the new benefit in 2006 presumably the experience entities gain in administering the drug card including dealing with the medicare population will prove useful when they take on the responsibilities for the new benefit at the same time cms expects that information provided through the card program will assist it in further understanding the pharmaceutical industry however some observers have suggested that many of the card programs may not apply to become pdp plans under the 2006 benefit pdp plans are to provide drugonly benefit and unlike disc ount card program assume portion of the financial risk of coverage drugonly product is largel untested therefore some entities may be reluctant to assume the unknown financial risk of the new benefit this is less of an issue for mapdp plans since most of these entities have experience offering drug benefits and the drug benefit is offered as part of the overall benefits package beneficiary choices it may be difficult for some seniors to adjust to the changes between the card program and the ne w permanent benefit as noted there are differences between the two programs with respect to eligibility requirements and the process for determining eligibility there are also likely to be differences between the formularies and negotiated prices established under the endorsed card program and thos made available by pdp plans even if offered by the same entity the consequences of individual choices between plans will become more important in 2006 as is the case with the drug card negotiated prices will only be available for drugs on the plans formulary in addition beginning in 2006 beneficiaries wi ll receive federal subsidies for costs incurred with respect to drugs on plan s formulary but will not receive such subsidies except in the case of successful appeals for drugs not on plans formulary further since beneficiaries will be paying premiums estimated at 35 month rather than maximum of 30 year for the card they will want to select program that best meets their needs these concerns highlight the necessity for beneficiary education on both the card program and the permanent drug bene fit as well as the differences between them cms has begun this process
