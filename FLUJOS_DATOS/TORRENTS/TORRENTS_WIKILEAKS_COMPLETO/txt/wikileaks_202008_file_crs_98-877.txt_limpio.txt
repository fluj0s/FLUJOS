tanzania rwanda zairedemocratic republic of congo kenya uganda ethiopia zambia and zimbabwe imposed sanctions on the crisisprone central african nation1 the countries outlined several conditions for the lifting of the sanctions the restoration of the dissolved national assembly the reinstatement of political parties banned immediately after the coup democratic reforms the creation of national unity government or similar powersharing framework unconditional internal peace negotiations with hutu rebel and opposition groups and participation in external peace talks the organization of african unity the united nations the united states and the european union all initially backed the sanctions the united states condemned the military takeover but aside from public support for the regional embargo refrained from taking additional measures to punish the military junta officials had stated earlier that the united states would not recognize 1 dellios hugh burundis neighbors vow to bring new military regime to its knees economic embargo has early impact chicago tribune 8896 crs3 government which assumed power through military coup and would in fact work to isolate such government but the takeover by buyoya considered to be moderate constituted major stumbling block some viewed buyoya as the only leader capable of bringing stability to burundi while others feared embracing buyoya could send the wrong message elsewhere in africa three months after taking power buyoya reopened the national assembly and lifted the ban on political parties initially he indicated that he would negotiate with the rebels only if they first laid down their arms but in early october 1996 in letter to regional heads of state he demonstrated willingness to participate in unconditional talks these steps and responsive us pressure to ease the sanctions notwithstanding the african nations continued the embargo the regional measures have had serious impact on the burundian economy and have also increased domestic pressure on buyoya as extremists in both parties use the hardship to undermine his political power in an apparent effort to counter opposition attacks buyoya arrested his most vocal critic former president jeanbaptiste bagaza on charges that he had plotted an assassination attempt on buyoya he has also made year of military service mandatory for all universityage students political reforms in the midst of conflict buyoyas government has actively sought the lifting of all sanctions against burundi and has fulfilled to some extent all of the conditions for their removal the national assembly and political parties were both reinstated soon after the coup internal peace negotiations began in fall 1997 leading to the internal partnership for peace and new transitional constitution buyoya was sworn in as transitional president in june 1998 two days after signing into law the new transitional constitution designed to pave the way for powersharing government in the transitional constitution the position of prime minister was split into two vice presidential positions one of whom will be responsible for the political and administrative domains the other to supervise the economic and social domains and to be filled by one tutsi and one hutu the national assembly was expanded from 80 to 121 members in order to accommodate opposition parties and regional interests and the constitutional court will be reinstated in order to judge the constitutionality of laws and interpret the transitional constitution the government also designated conciliation body in case of disputes arising from the implementation of the transitional platform external peace negotiations between the government and rebel groups represent the only remaining original condition for the lifting of sanctions initially addressed by the government of burundi when the major rebel group and the government met in late 1996 allinclusive external talks did not begin in earnest until earlier this year hutu rebels continued their attacks in the countryside in early 1998 and gained ground in their push toward the capital2 the army also staged several attacks against rebel positions most recently in late june burundian authorities have accused both the democratic republic of congo and tanzania of harboring and supporting hutu militias in refugee camps along their shared borders as well as permitting hate radio to broadcast from their territories hutu members of the former rwandan armed forces and the 2 upsurge of violence in burundi panafrican news agency 82598 crs4 interahamwe militias have also aided the burundian hutu rebels3 late last year burundian and tanzanian forces scuffled in several incidents on their border and the burundian diplomat to tanzania was expelled there have also been reports that the tanzanian authorities in dar salaam handed over the burundian embassy and its accounts to the national council for the defense of democracy cndd the peace process after agreeing on an agenda earlier this year peace talks were supposed to resume in midjune 1998 in arusha tanzania led by mediator and former tanzanian president julius nyerere but were postponed until july 20 instead nyerere held private consultations with the delegations in order to establish the rules and agenda for the july talks seventeen factions including the government frodebu uprona and hutu rebel groups cndd palipehutu and frolina all signed ceasefire agreement to begin july 20 1998 the agreement also fixed the length of negotiations at three months and foresaw the creation of commissions responsible for negotiating issues related to the establishment of democratic powersharing government talks began on july 21 1998 in arusha and lasted for ten days focusing predominantly on the rules of procedure and debate on the root cause of the problem in burundi discussions resumed behind closed doors in arusha in midoctober and delegates are expected to select the leaders of the proposed subcommittees during talks expected to last two to three weeks some analysts point out that the progress of the fighting in the drc could impact the peace process in burundi since the burundian rebels would have strengthened position if the drc government regains control of the eastern kivu provinces4 some rebel groups including the armed wing of the main hutu rebel group cndd refuse to honor the ceasefire and the army maintains that it does not apply to government forces which it argues need to protect citizens from rebel attacks the cndd recently split suspending its leader leonard nyangoma and appointing the head of its armed wing colonel john bosco ndayikengurukiye in his place in may however nyangoma insists he remains in charge5 this division has led to confusion as to the identity of the cndd representative accepted by both the rebels and the other parties to the peace talks in june the cndd rejected the political changes in burundi as unconstitutional and vowed to continue its campaign for democracy the hardline tutsi wing of uprona buyoyas own party ousted its leader charles mukasi on october 5 replacing him with information minister luc rukingama mukasi is considered an extremist opposed to the ceasefire agreement and external talks in general and has accused buyoya of complicity with those who teach genocide and ethnic racismlike frodebu6 rukingama buyoya supporter is considered moderate mukasis ouster was likely intended to strengthen the legitimacy of the peace process by ensuring upronas continued participation since mukasi had pledged to boycott the negotiations the move suggests increased efforts to minimize the role of extremists in determining the political future of burundi 3 buckley stephen 3 countries

tanzanian capital dar salaam to discuss the embargo on burundi despite calls by some to lift the sanctions the leaders voted to keep them in place ethiopia zambia and kenya supported the lifting of the sanctions while tanzania uganda and rwanda argued to keep the sanctions until the government made additional reforms in april 1997 the east and central african leaders partially lifted sanctions for basic goods such as food medical and educational supplies and fuel the nations also imposed several new conditions to have the embargo fully removed the release of former president jeanbaptiste bagaza from house arrest the closure of the forced hutu regroupment camps the suspension of all ethnic crimes trials until an impartial judicial system is established and permission for all burundian political figures to travel abroad for participation in the peace process buyoya and his government have sought to fulfill these latest conditions as well in june 1997 former president ntibantunganya left the us ambassadors residence after almost year in hiding and has been an active participant in the peace process former president bagaza was released from house arrest in late february 1998 and has also been involved in the negotiations although many observers feel his influence decreased significantly while he was in detention presidential special envoy howard wolpe reported in march that the burundian government had closed the vast majority of the hutu regroupment camps which had contained 10 of the population the new constitution calls for the beginning of the reconstruction of the burundian judicial system process that will likely be helped by the new 30 million us great lakes justice initiative7 there are adversary views over the sanctions in speech to the united nations general assembly buyoya stated that the sanctions had destroyed the economic and social fabric of burundi jeopardized its stability and eroded the trust between the mediating parties and the parties to the conflict he added that the security situation in burundi is worse than that in any other country in the great lakes region and thus should be treated in the same manner8 buyoya has also accused the tanzanian government of being biased in favor of hutu rebels and therefore opposed to lifting the sanctions some western officials have agreed one called the embargo red herring adding that its serving purpose apart from making bunch of tanzanians rich its certainly not working9 however others blame buyoya for economic hardship pointing out his investments in the military rather than the economy on the international level some governments and organizations have been encouraging the lifting of sanctions for quite some time in december 1997 the human rights rapporteur for burundi paulo sergio pinheiro urged the african nations to review the embargo against burundi in january 1998 the oau mission leader to burundi called for an end to the sanctions however during the oau meeting in may despite reports that most members favored lifting the sanctions the embargo was upheld 7 office of the press secretary the white house fact sheet countering genocide and promoting human rights

that the sanctions should be lifted three members of congress recently sent letter to the clinton administration stating that removal of sanctions is warranted at this time and requesting the united
