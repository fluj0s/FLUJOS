economics government and finance summary covered bonds are relatively common met hod of funding mortgages in europe but uncommon in the united states cove red bond is recourse debt obligation that is secured by pool of assets in this case mortgages the holders of the bond are given additional protection in the event of the bankr uptcy or insolvency of the issuing lender they have some features such as pooled mort gages that resemble securitization but the original lenders maintain continuing interest in the performance of the loans because some believe that the subprime mortgage turmoil may have been influenced by poor incentives for lenders using the securitization process some policymakers have recommended covered bonds as an alternative for us mortgage markets treasury secretary

in europe especia lly the german pfandbrief market also pool mortgages but the issuing banks continue to stand behind the performance of the loan pool on march 13 2008 treasury secretary paul suggested the increased use of covered bonds as one option to restore confidence in mortgage finance covered bonds which allow banks to retain originated mortgage loans while accessing financial market funding are another alternative worth considering covered bonds may address the current lack of liquidity in and bring more competition to mortgage secur itization rulemaking not legislation is needed to facilitate the issuance of covered bonds through clarification of covered bonds status in the event of bankissuers inso lvency the fdic can reduce uncertainty and consider appropriate measures that will protect the deposit insurance fund these steps would encourage covered bond market in the us similar changes in europe have resulted in more covered bond activity3 financial

payment freezes by edward vincent murphy 5 covered bond statement fdic july 15 2008 available at h ttp wwwfdicgovnews newspress2008pr08060ahtmlcompared to securitization the stru cture of covered bond simplifies the relationship between mortgage pools and mort gage servicers for covered bond the issuing bank continues to service the pooled ans or contract out servicing in the same manner as it would for loans that it has not i ssued as covered bonds this preserves the issuing banks discretion to modify loans in times of distress in securitization however the discretion of servicers to modify loans can be limited by loan servicing contracts that can be difficult to adjust in changing circumstances4 fdic rulemaking affecting covered bonds although the covered bond market has long tradition in europe the united states has much less experience in june 2007 bank of america became the first us depository institution to issue domestic c overed bond with 2 billion offering since then industry specialists and policymaker s have been evaluating american banking regulation to see what kinds of modifications might be required to adapt this european debt instrument to us financial markets in the united states financial problems of banks with insured deposits are often resolved through actions of the fdic in or der to adapt covered bonds to the us system therefore fdic rules for resolving claims against insolvent banks that have outstanding covered bonds might have to be modified the fdic issued financial institution letter fil 342008 fdic policy statement on covered bonds on april 30 2008 fil 34 provides more regulatory clarity by giv ing expedited access to covered bond collateral if the issuing institution fails or is placed in conservatorship and m eets certain criteria its expressed intent is to reduce market uncertainty and allow for evaluation of the benefits and questions about covered bonds as the market develops in the united states the fdic issued its policy statement for covered bonds on july 15 2008 the policy statement defines covered bond as nondeposit recourse debt obligation of an idi insured depository institution with term greater than one year and more than thirty years that is secured directly or indirectly by perfected security interests under applicable state and federal law on assets held and owned by the idi consisting of eligible mortgages or aaarated mortgagebacked securities secured by eligib mortgages if for more than ten percent of the collateral for any covered bond issuance or series5 the fdic limited the covered bond policy statemen t only to those circumstances in which the covered bonds would comprise more than 4 of the issuers total liabilities the fdic statement did not require that issuers of covered bonds use special purpose vehicle spv which was common financial device used in securitizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22925crs5 equal treatment for covered bonds act of 2008 hr 6659 hr 6659 the equal treatment for cove red bonds act of 2008 was introduced by congressman garrett on july 30 2008 the defi nition of covered bond is similar to the definition used in the fdic rulemaking the bill defines cove red bond as nondeposit recourse debt obligation of an insured depository institution with term to maturity of at least 1 year which is secured by specifically identified assets which are performing in accordance with the terms of the contracts which created the assets section 2b although similar to the fdic definition hr 6659 does not require that covered bond be used for mortgages or for aaarated securities also the bill does not limit the term to maturity of the assets to 30 years which would allow cove red bonds to fund 40year mortgages the bill also specifies the regulatory aut hority of federal financial regulators for covered bonds section 2d in order to be applicable to covered bonds federal banking regulations must be jointly prescribed by the secretary of the treasury the board of governors of the federal rese rve system the comptroller of the currency the director of the office of thrift supervision and th board of directors of the fdic of the members of the
